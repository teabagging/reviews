But the stupid premise of the story and the relentless description of disgusting deaths, told in the style of pre-teens trying to out-gross each other at horror stories around a camp fire really pushed this book into the trash heap. It was dumb and pointless. Find something else better with which to waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book seriously pissed me the hell off. I loved A Simple Plan and I love Stephen King too, so having seen his review I was looking forward to the book even more. Too bad it turned out to be crap. The way it ends basically means that the story has no redemptive value whatsoever. It's a geek show. I love horror but this was just too much for me. If Scott Smith actually gets off his butt and writes another novel sometime in the next decade, I'll still try it out, but I'll be reading the reviews very very carefully before I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Rooted For The Killer Vines!","review":"I gave this book a single star only because there is no zero. Six people find themselves trapped in the jungle by intelligent killer vines and armed Mayan villagers. I kept slogging along hoping that there would be more to this story, no such luck. Vapid characters, most of whom seem so shallow that I couldn't even muster sympathy for their plight. Tedious, predictable and way too long. After the first 100 pages I started rooting, no pun intended, for killer vines to save me from the other 200+ pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel betrayed...","review":"by Mr. King. What a stupid, horrible piece of fiction. I am two thirds through and have no desire to finish. This, after having spent the better part of the last 75 pages just skimming paragraphs. Killer vines imitating chirping cells phones with characters dumb enough to take the bait? Characters stupid enough to get drunk on tequila when they are without water or food in a hot climate? With the sun relentlessly beating down on them? And the constant sweating? Jeez, I kind of wished the characters just died from dehydration. Actually, it would probably have made for a better storyline.Ugh, please take my advice and do not get duped by King's review. Do not spend your hard-earned money on this paper waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Geraniums Attack...","review":"This is not the worst book I have ever read but it's right toward the top of the list: slow-moving, predictable, full of unappealing characters with muddy motivations and ho-hum suspense - it's a terrific relief when the flora eats the fauna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Don't let the premise fool you. I thought this sounded like an awesome story - people getting lost in the jungle, trying to survive off the land. First off, I am okay with the \\"supernatural,\\" but this is simply absurd. This is 15+ hours listening to (or reading) a story about people who have no chance. As bored as I was, I couldn't help but anxiously anticipate finding out how the story would end. I was disappointed.Let me put it to you this way. The story got dumber dumber as it went on. Just when I thought I had heard the stupidest thing, the author thought of something else to trump it. Really, this is really that bad. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because nothing is as bad as a John Saul novel (see my other reviews). This story is very farfetched, dragged out, not far from boring and more than anything, very, very depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"i felt completely empty at the end","review":"i didn't want to read the reviews prior to reading this book. i felt that stephen king's review was evidence enough to check it out. i felt that the premise of the story had great potential but i felt that scott smith left you feeling flat and empty, as if nothing had been accomplished. i was intrigued by the possibility that i was going to led into a mayan ruin with a deep and horrific past. all i got was a bunch of blood thirsty vines. and WAY too much delving into the meandering minds of the main characters! i kept turning the page expecting something suspenseful to happen and i never got it. i still plan on reading a simple plan because it seems to be a much better example of scott smith's handy work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen, What Were You Thinking?","review":"Setting aside Stephen King's head-scratcher of an endorsement, this isn't much more than an overextended survivalist story with an unimpressive monster thrown in for good measure. Take away the monster, substitute a desert island for the ruins, and the only thing that would change about the book would be its length. (If you've read it, you'll understand.) It kept me reading through the end, which is something; but it ultimately feels like a cheap knock-off of Dean Koontz's \\"Phantoms.\\" It wasn't worth the five or so hours I invested in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy leaves and vines and sap, Oh My","review":"Ranks right down there with the worst ever. If it receives a good review from Steven, Turn 'Em Out By The Dozen, King it's GOTTA be bad. And to think they chop trees down to make the paper on which this tripe is written. Disgraceful !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it.","review":"This book had a decent beginning but once they got to the 'ruins' it was no longer worth reading. I tried to keep plodding along but eventually I just skipped ahead to find out if anything changed in the plot. When I found out the answer to that question, I removed my bookmark and put it on a pile of stuff to donate to charity. The charitable thing might just be to recycle the paper and save some poor fool from wasting time that could have been spent reading a better book. If this book were a piece of music, it would be the same low note played over and over again for 10 hours. Monotonous and dreary."},{"rating":"1","title":"no bueno.","review":"a good way to describe this book: if a movie was made into a book, this is how it would go. especiialy the ending. oh god the ending.too simple, too predictable, too long?i feel like this book could have been cut in half, easily.dont read this book. or see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruins","review":"Basic premise of book is a bit unbelievable, just shy of ridiculous. Character development was good and it was a page turner; however, had the evil element of the book been something believable, such as a government agency conducting testing with dangerous chemicals, it would have been a much, much better read. Scott Smith's previous book, A Simple Plan, was terrific, as I could envision myself acting as any one of the main characters acted. In The Ruins, however, Scott Smith asks us to believe in the unbelievable. Perhaps Sci-Fi readers would enjoy The Ruins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page Turner? And how!","review":"I read the first 25 or so pages and then scimmed the rest. Pages turned like mad! You know these young people are doomed from almost the beginning of this book- stolen hat and sunglasses in blistering heat of tropical jungle country, lost insect repellent, paths leading nowhere with people they don't know who speak languages they don't have a clue about. Just a question of time until they are all dead. For supposedly smart people they are so very dumb. And we're not much interested in just how they blunder into the increasingly pointless horror after a short time. A murderous vine?! This book is a bent way of heaping horror on horror to more than 50 ways to kill your lover bit by bloody bit. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art for sadists","review":"Not an actual story, more the slow description of people dying in improbable circumstances. Other reviewers have pointed out the logical flaws and plot holes, but there's also the author's bumbling prose and the lack of explanation: what are these vines? Why do the natives trap people there when it'd be so much easier just to kill the prisoners and feed them to the vine?Interesting that Stephen King calls it the \\"best suspense novel since Silence of the Lambs\\". About as suspensful as a butcher's shop or watching surgery, pure slasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done Much Better Before","review":"If you're looking for an exciting romp through some Central American ruins, don't buy this book. There aren't any ruins. Anywhere. In fact, this whole book is basically a ripoff of Clark Ashton Smith's \\"The Seed From the Sepulcher\\", published in Weird Tales in October 1933. He told the same story in one tenth the number of pages and did it better. I first discovered that story in 1960, and I still get chills when I read it, 45 years later. I'm just really glad I bought \\"The Ruins\\" at Costco instead of paying full street value for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully Entertaining? NO. Just Awful.","review":"I was very excited about this book, being a fan of his earlier book. I must say though, I was more than a little disappointed. The book just doesn't do what it could have. I guess my biggest complaints are that most of the characters are just too annoying to want to spend any time with. That, and the suspense seems disjointed and improperly set up, only to lead nowhere. But the biggest problem of all is that the plot is simply way too ridiculous to even attempt to buy into. After finishing this book, I was just happy to be done with it. This book does not deserve a movie, or the attention being paid to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"...\\"can you hear me now?!?...\\"","review":"okay, i really liked the book 'a simple plan' and yes, was excited and alerted by stevie's rave review of 'the ruins'.butt!!!...i'm not a cell phone person...never had one, probably never will...however, i'm literally and loudly surrounded by them, annoyingly so...so, please sir scott, there's NO WAY IN MAYAN RUIN HELL that NOBODY!!!, not just the six kids most recently trapped there (somewhat explained away feebly) but most certainly SOMEONE in the archaeological crew would have had at least \\"juan\\"......that's not even mentioning the fact that most phones now have picture-taking capabilities...wouldn't ANYONE, esp. the kids, make sure they're getting a photo-op outta most situations?!?...the scientists?!?...hmmm...lap-top computers, anyone...!?!big holes in the plausibility of this plot point sink it simply, plainly..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time...","review":"I give this book one star because in the 123 pages I've read so far I haven't found any typos. I rushed to get this book because it came highly recommended by my favorite author (you know who you are). I very rarely put a book down unfinished but I have wasted too much time already. Zero character development, snail paced story telling. I've gotten almost to the halfway point and still nothing exciting or \\"horrific\\" has happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruins","review":"I Stopped reading it on page 31. I gave it to my sister to read, she finished it and said I had to read it. She said the book was very different. She would not recommend it. We both liked his previous book \\"A Simple Plan\\". This book was way far out. Will try it again. I Think??????"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"If you are a fan of ABC's LOST, you will love this book. Similar mysteries, freaks of nature, horror, and excitement await you. Six friends on vacation in Mexico decide to embark into The Ruins to find one of the friend's brother. Once there, they find they shouldn't have come at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetically Bad, But Who Cares?","review":"I would have given it NO stars if I could have.I liked his first, A Simple Plan. This one is simply appalling. A vine that eats people. What a great idea! Obviously he was writing it with the idea it would be a movie.Ridiculous, unbelieveable plotline, cardboard characters, with the writing really nothing more than boring, unimaginative and predictable exposition, yet, still, over 1000 people have reviewed this horrible book on Amazon alone.It goes to show you that you can write trash, and still sell tons of books, making tons of dough.Scott, you should be ashamed of yourself.I listened to the audio of this, while I was doing other things....I'd never have wasted my time sitting down and reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindnumbingly Boring!","review":"I too picked up this book partially because of the King quote and what sounded like an interesting plot. Boy, was I dissapointed. 4 vacationing Americans make friends with a group of foreigners and on a whim decide to help find one of the group's missing brother who left on a supposed dig on \\"ruins\\" in the middle of the jungle, but has yet to return. What follows is page after page of whining and stupidity. I actually hated all the American characters, who barely have enough brain power between them all to walk up-right. The Greeks they meet are actually creepy. The only person I liked was Mathias. Midway through the book I was praying for someone/something to just kill them all already so I didn't have to hear any more complaining or stupid ideas. Horrible plot, way too slow, characters no one should like and the most intense part for me was trying to finish the book so I could move on to something worth my time and the paper it's printed on. SKIP IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so creepy creepers","review":"Let me start off by saying that I wanted to like this book. I love horror, and I had high hopes for this one reading the author's other novel, A Simple Plan. But I was disappointed. It just never took off for me, and even by the end of it, I could have cared less about the characters. Ultimately, this probably would have made a decent short story, but as a novel, this is one to miss. One of the book's few redeeming qualities is that it was slightly better than the movie based on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror for it's own sake...","review":"THE RUINS is a rather disappointing example of a horror novel that limits itself to just the horror, leaving little room for anything else, Poorly sketched characters head gradually toward their doom; not one individual is described enough detail to develop any compassion toward his or her plight so the reader remain emotionally distant. When left with a lack of any compassion for the characters, the book is dependent on atmosphere and the novelty of the setting to carry it and it turns out that this isn't enough. What you're left with is a good writer trying to make something compelling out of very little. There are some truly grotesque and horrifying set pieces that will provide fleeting thrills, but the lack of interest for the characters makes this nothing more intriguing than any run of the mill entry in the genre and from the author ofA Simple Planit's fair to expect quite a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad","review":"This book is just bad. I believe I know why Stephen King enjoyed it so much -- it's like Cujo with plants instead of a dog. So, this has been done before, just much better. The title is misleading -- there are no \\"ruins\\". It should have been called \\"The Vines\\" or something like that. It definately reads like an inane movie script and the movie is going to be bad too. Save your money and your time. Obviously someone has paid for it to be on the best seller list."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I left it on the airplane. I never leave books behind.","review":"I picked up this book at the airport because of the great quote by Stephen King. I was a bit worried to discover that Scott Smith also wrote \\"A Simple Plan,\\" a book that I would call \\"dreary and depressing\\" except that doesn't quite cover how grim it really was.Well, guess what. \\"The Ruins\\" is another trip to the unmagical land of drear and depression. I don't want to give any spoilers, but it is very similar to the current rage of \\"horror porn\\" movies where young and gorgeous men and women fall into a bad situation and are tortured to death.There is no redemption here, no light, no sense of wonder. There is nothing but death.My travelling companions secretly purchased another copy of \\"The Ruins\\" after hearing me complain about how bad it was and how I'd left it on the plane. They slipped ahead of me on the return flight and put it in the pocket of my seat. When I sat down, there was \\"The Ruins.\\"Now that's a good joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feed Me, Seymour!","review":"It's been 13 years between his first, great book (\\"A Simple Plan\\") and this, his second, and all Scott Smith could come up with is a retread of the musical \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" minus the songs and jokes. The laughs in this book are, I'm certain, completely unintentional. Are we seriously supposed to get the chills over the threat of a killer weed? I'm not sure what grand theme Mr. Smith is attempting to illuminate here. Can it be that the vine is a metaphor for his many fans who, no doubt, will feel utterly disappointed about Mr. Smith's pointless, nihilistic story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"The author has enough skill to draw you in, but it is a bait and switch. This book gets rapidly worse as you go along, and when I realized (SPOILER) that the vine was actually indeed the bad guy, and that it imitated cell phones, talked and had super powers...I found it very difficult to continue. The ending? Completely and totally unsatisfying. My hands feel dirtier somehow for having touched this book, my eyes injured...my brain somehow dumber...this might be the worst book I have read. Not only do I not recommend it, I recommend you run from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruins - a Long ways to go for a somewhat empty read.","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much from Scott Smith's The Ruins. I loved his previous novel A Simple Plan and was excited to delve into what critics were calling \\"the best horror novel of the new century.\\"And yet...I just didn't get it.At 509 pages The Ruins feels like it could have been told easily in under 200 pages. Not much truly happens. The story has 6 characters essentially trapped in a confined area of the jungle and yet it took far too long for 4 of these characters to even be partially fleshed out. The 5th and 6th characters never get the chance to become anything more than background.Still with each turn of the page I kept hoping for something more and was always met with disappointment. I hear the movie is worse than the book so that makes the decision to skip it easier.If you're a fan of tight-paced horror stories, you probably want to look some place else. The Ruins just misses on every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most depressing book I've ever read","review":"It's not that I don't like horror novels, King is one of my favorite authors, it's just that this book, simply put, is a MAJOR bummer novel. From beginning to end, one bad thing after another, one sick thing that just gets sicker, gross, depressing, not even a sliver of an ending that is begrudginly satisfying. A \\"novel\\" that runs on and on with without even a chapter break. Ugh, not going to invest a dime in this author again.I'd give it a zero if there were an option here ......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! What a Disappointment","review":"If you are looking for more of the same out of Smith because you enjoyed \\"A Simple Plan\\", please don't make the same mistake I did and waste any of the precious hours of your life reading this argument for succumbing to writer's block.

It started out well, but fizzled towards the end. The characters have their distinct personalities, but don't expect any character development. The ethnic stereotypes are tiresome (the Maya, the Greeks, the Germans). A bit like Halloween or Friday the 13th, only with a plant as the slasher--you know each is going to get it, you're just not sure exactly how. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined trees","review":"Don't waste your time or money. The characters have no depth. The story is over the top with no begining or end.

Huge disappontment.It starts slow and goes nowhere fast. It drags and due to the nature of WHAT is in the ruins, is repetitive to the point of irritation. There is not much character development though there are only 6 main ones we must contend with (+ what they find) throughout the book. One never finds out the WHY or the HOW; one must just accept everything that occurs. If, however, you are into descriptive passages of gore, you might like this book.I did finish the book; that's all I wanted to do was get through it. No surprise ending either. In a couple of words, a bust! Don't waste your time OR money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The first half was good, but the second half was awful, it made me wish I hadn't bothered to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, boring, ridiculous...you get the picture.","review":"I opened this book with high hopes and an open mind. I was ready to be terrified. Unfortunately, The Ruins never failed to disappoint me from start to finish. I won't go into details in case someone still wants to suffer through this boring book, but let me just say the heroes are significantly stupider than a flowering vine. Please, don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and Totally Implausible","review":"While the book was compelling, it was also very silly (i.e. contrived and unbelievable). Then there's the gratuitous violence and sensationalism, and you end up with a potboiler. It's fun, but it's totally ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Is Misleading","review":"I found the book equivalent to a script for a bad B movie. The title has nothing remotely to do with the premise of the novel. It is a cross between Little Shop of Horrors and a bad teen slasher flick. If I were in this book, I would have killed myself because of the bad writing before the plants could feast on me. There was no real character development, just a group hurling insults at each other and boring flashbacks, while they waited for their numbers to be called as plant food.

Alas, what a colossal disappointment tortures us in his second ridiculously tedious effort, The Ruins.Touted as highly intelligent (after all, they are post-grad students), not one idiotic character in this wildly absurd contrivance deserves mention. It vaguely occurred to me that the architects of another equally banal production presented through a divergent distinct medium which attracted a vast weekly audience may owe Scott Smith a smidgen of legitimate credit for their innovative or serendipitous ingenuity in the creation of the series, \\"Lost.\\"Revised: 10/02/2010"},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"I would rather die a thousand painful deaths than suffer through this ridiculous book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Scott Smith sure has a way with titles. \\"A Simple Plan\\" was simply brilliant. \\"The Ruins\\" ruined my day.The problem is not the lack of originality; a novel needn't be original to be good. The difficulty lies in the characterizations. There are three types of characters in fiction: characters who are too smart all of the time (sometimes you can say this about Lee Child's Jack Reacher), characters who are too dumb all of the time, and characters with a more varied, more human intelligence. Every character in \\"The Ruins\\" is too dumb all of the time, even the stereotypical smart guy. They are so dumb, they deserve to die!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing short of awful","review":"Sorry, Mr. Smith, but I have to be honest. I thought A Simple Plan was a great fun read, so I picked up The Ruins to read over the Labor Day holiday. What a disappointment.

If there is another book on your bedside table waiting to be read, I would recommend that one, whatever it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"The opening chapters seemed promising. A group of young people head into the jungle for what they think will be a simple day trip to find a missing traveler. Knowing how the last \\"simple plan\\" worked out I settled in for what I thought would be a great read. The villain of the story is ridiculous. As more and more of the vine's evil capabilities are revealed the sillier they seemed to get. Since no one can communicate with the natives - including the author - the reader is never given any background of the vine, the ruins or the people. It's too bad the author felt the need to cross into the supernatural realm - it ruined a perfectly good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Out Gorefest.","review":"I was hoping for a smart thriller wrapped in the mystery of the Yucatan.

And where are \\"the ruins\\"?I kept waiting for a twist, and explaination..something..but no just one boring gross out scene after another. I love King and don't quite get why he loves this book. It could have made a great short story, where questions are often best left unanswered, but as a novel it's the same scene over and over. Evil plant kills person. BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst book I ever read, but close.","review":"I really really wanted to like this book. But the story dragged on, I felt trapped by the internal dialogue that the characters had, with little payoff in story advancement. I kept reading the book although I was bored because I wanted to find out how things turned out. Not to spoil it, but I'll never get the time I spent reading this book back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"Occasionally it's fun to read a bad book. However, when a book is this bad, it's no fun at all. This is truly one of the worst novels I've read in many, many years. Scott Smith takes an idea about carnivorous, omniscient vines growing in the Mayan jungle and tries to scare us. Instead he bores us to tears and insults our intelligence. The true horror is that this story was published in the first place. I'll gamble the farm: we'll be seeing trailers for the Hollywood adaptation within the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and lame, and totally not scary","review":"I foolishly bought this book based on Stephen King's dustjacket tout that it was the best book he'd read all year, and was sadly disappointed to learn that Mr. King apparently had yet to read any books at all this year prior to this one. While the writing is okay, the story is WAAAAAAAAAAAY too long for what it is, and frankly lame and silly. Flesh eating plants that won't let you go and make fun of you --- oooh!! ahhh! Totally stupid plot, with average or dopey characters. Why on earth nobody bothered to burn out these stupid plants with napalm before, or simply seed the entire hill and mine with salt (since apparently that stops it from growing) is an unsolved mystery in this goofey novel. At best, a book to read while stranded in the airport, then toss."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Depressing Than Scary","review":"\\"The Ruins\\" is a relentless novel; Scott Smith ratchets the tension up to 11 in the first few pages, and pretty much just keeps it there -- there's no comic relief, no hope, just a trudge to the ending.The characters are wooden; they are more collections of traits than living, interesting people. I can see that Scott Smith was more interested in group dynamics than in individual character development, but the result here is that I didn't care about anyone.Tension without drama doesn't make for a very satisfying read. Honestly, if Stephen King thinks this is the best horror novel of the new millennium (at least, that's what the quote on the cover of this edition claims), then Mr. King's taste has gone downhill."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it six stars if I could","review":"The Ruins is my personal Book of the Year so far in 2006, and I think it will probably finish the year in the same position.I'm absolutely baffled by the 1-star reviews here and can only wonder just what it is these dimbulbs *want* from a horror novel. Maybe the well-drawn characters, the expert dialogue, the finely crafted sense of impending doom, and the tight plotting threw them off ... whatever the case may be, I would suggest that all the 1-star reviewers move on to something a little less challenging for their next read.I have only one complaint: I with The Ruins had been a longer book. That's how much I enjoyed being a part of an expert craftsman's imaginary world.Ignore the nay-sayers; let them return to their Dan Brown nonsense.

I wish the plants had killed them earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"-20 stars, for the worst book that I have ever read.","review":"I can't believe that I actually finished this book. It was just totally, and utterly horrible. I hated this book, which on the cover says that Stephen King said was one of the scariest books of the decade. This book is about vines that attack people that are stranded on Mayan ruins. Stupid. Vines are not scary!!!!!!! They are stupid!!!!!I don't like telling people what to buy or what not to buy, but I'm going to have to do it here. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS HORRIBLE BOOK!!! It just isn't worth the money or the time.The reason why I gave this book one star was because they wouldn't let me go any lower, otherwise, I would've rated this book so low that it would look like M.C. Hammer's bank acount--in the negatives.Look, I'm just trying to look out for the customers and I have to say that this book was a flop and that I would to have you make the same mistake that I did by buying this book.***DON'T BUY THIS BOOK***"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ruins","review":"I bought this book after reading Steven Kings review in one of our local magazines. I just want to say I thought this book was fantastic, it is such an original idea. I loved how it was set in the mexican jungle with backpackers as the main characters. It was exciting and different. It was great from start to finish. I read it one night and have now given it to my 16yo son to read and he is really enjoying it also.Angie (Queensland, Australia)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated Short Story","review":"There's some stuff here that would make Clive Barker ill, but those scenes are few and far between. This book could easily be 150 pages shorter. I kept reading the same scene over and over, without learning anything about the characters as people, and without discovering anything new about their situation. If this book had been, say, 190 pages OR LESS, it would have been much more effective. I saw the ending coming at the half-way point, so, as I read the last page, instead of shock or fear, I simply shrugged, and cast the book aside. Save youself: don't even bother to pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This book is a real disappointment. It has absolutely nothing to do with the Mayan ruins or Mexican culture. It could have taken place on Mars. It's about a murderous, blood & vomit sucking vine that can talk. I idiotically kept reading it praying for it to get better but it never did. The anti-climactic ending only left room for a DA DA DAHHHH \\"SEQUEL\\". Hey, maybe Scott Smith can make the vine tap-dance in the next one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many good books out there ..","review":"Geez, what a waste of time this book was. Just plain awful. The whole thing can be summed up in one sentence: A group of young people find themselves kept from leaving a mound covered by a murderous plant -- and then they all die, one by one. That's pretty much it. Meanwhile, you, as the reader, have to endure page after page of description of their interaction, all of which is pretty freaking boring. I wasted a day on this one, and that's a day I won't get back. It went to paperback? And was then made into a movie? Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend this","review":"***** I've got some spoiler info in my review *****I listened to the Unabridged version on audio. Got to the chapter in which Jeff had decided to amputate Pablo's legs ... for no good reason that I could see ... and gave up.I realized that the rest of the book was probably going to be about a fairly likable group of people diddling around in the jungle and dying gruesome, meaningless, deaths,one by one. And that is exactly what the wikipedia article for this book says happens.So, goodbye and good riddance. Interesting that no one really tries to see if the plant can be defeated. And I don't see why the plant didn't kill them all the first night out.I suppose that wouldn't have given us a chance to *enjoy* all the gore.The plot is bad. But, I think the writing is very good. So, I wish the writer good luck and perhaps his next book will be a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ruins: A Little More than a Horror Novel","review":"Not only is there horror here, but character personalities in conflict, tangible images of strange places. Stephen King even gave this book high ratings. Check out my comparison of the book and the movie at [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"An ultimately disappointing 'Teenagers Get Into Trouble' story","review":"The horror cliche exists for a reason: teenagers are fairly dumb creatures. What's interesting about it is that, during the eighties, in terms of plot, this technique was relatively new. In 50s & 60s SciFi-Horror, yes, you had lustful teens getting into trouble, but they typically ended up running to the police and, of course, the adults just didn't believe them. Until, of course, the adults had to confront the enemy themselves, and then, gee golly whiz, them teens were right. This was abused with entertaining results in the 70s and 80s because creators turned the idea on its head. The kids were right, but there were no adults around to help. The result was nudity and plenty of gore. The Ruins tries to use this initial ploy to get the story going, but does nothing with it, and instead, we're left with a preposterously long tale of dumb youngins (none of whom are likable) who end up meeting their well-deserved fate.But that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"how can the vines who trap, can mimic, can think , take so long to kill each one..so boringly and annoyingly...?????????????????how could stephen king give that review???????????????/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored","review":"Page after page I hoped there would be something, anything more to this book.

The characters were unlikable and barely developed, the plot was never sufficiently explained, the horror was UTTERLY absent, there was ZERO suspense, and the killer plant was ridiculous. God, 500 pages of 'surely it must get more interesting than THIS?' There weren't even any twists or false hopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, poorly plotted, poorly executed","review":"The premise of this book sounds great - tourists off the beaten track in Mexico and \\"strange things start to happen\\" - but this book could be so much more. In fact ANYTHING more would be more than what is delivered. The only thing more shocking than this trivial bit of fluff making the \\"Best Books of the Last 25 Years List\\" is that it was made into a movie. My 20-year-old-daughter walked out of the movie out of sheer boredom. That is how I felt reading the book. I kept thinking that there had to be a twist to it, but sadly no. This book is like a short walk down a dark, weedy alley. It might look like there is the possibility of adventure and intrigue, but when you reach the end - well, there you are, at the end of a dark weedy alley with no story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books I have ever read","review":"Stephen King was an idiot to recommend this book. The plot was ludicrous, the characters were lame, the writing was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money or Time","review":"This was NOT the read of the summer, but a transparent story which I wish I had not wasted my time on. I thought I might have missed something so I passed it on to a friend who was not amused with me and was in fact angry that she too had wasted her time on this tripe. I only wish that I had waited and read the reviews before I wasted my money. Unfortunately Amazon will not let me rate this with a zero star rating as one star is too good for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it","review":"This book is well written. However, I did not like it. It is born of and dies with hopelessness. Not something I like. The characters are well formed and the plot moves along, it is a quick read. I just like upbeat endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruins","review":"This book looked interesting, especially because Stephen King has a positive quote on the cover. It was very disappointing. The entire time I was thinking, when will this be over. The worst part is that the book is suppose to be about ancient ruins...or it portrays itself as such but it is not about that at all. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruined by this","review":"Entertaining novel. Little too contrived. Definitely would not want to WATCH this in a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE/HATE all in RUINS","review":"I have a love hate relationship with this book. I hated that it became a bit predictable but love that it kept me reading and I'm still thinking about it. I was shocked that I was so easily drawn into the lives of the six tourists. Many things were left unexplained, but shouldn't a good horror novel leave you questioning? If you want to be submerged in Mayan culture this is not the book for you. However if you are bored by reality TV I suggest you give this book a little of your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all been said","review":"I won't waste anyone's time by restating what's wrong with this book, but I want to go on record as saying this is probably the biggest waste of time I have ever spent reading a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Loved his first book ( A Simple Plan). This one I honestly didn't/couldn't finish. Wayyy....tooooooo.......drawnnnn.....out. Got half way through and found myself only scanning paras and flipping pages. Don't even care if the end of this book was actually fascinating ( I have no idea), just couldn't stay with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Make a Short Story into a Novel","review":"While not poorly written, the character development is thin and irrelevant emphasizing a sense of dread at the expense of empathy. For some reason the author drives us down a single path with a predictable outcome effectively removing any sense of tension. I stayed with the story convinced that Smith would be artful enough to introduce some twist to justify the popular critical reviews. Unfortunately the story comes across with all the excitement and interest of a terminal tooth ache."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cut below previous novel","review":"I found this novel to drag along with an unbelievable premise. I would have stopped midway, (and should have), but kept hoping something good would turn the book around. It didn't. The characters were people I could have cared less about."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEW!!!","review":"There is a vast difference between a story that is scary and one of true horror. This book definitely falls into the latter category. I finished it last night and when I put it down, I let out an audible \\"F_ _ K!\\" Be prepared for the fact, that when you finish this novel, you will carry these characters and their fate around with you for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite Suspense","review":"This is certainly the most exquisitely suspenseful novel I have read this year. Despite the fantastic nature of the story, the suspense has a very real, visceral quality. There were points at which I had to physically put the book down because the feeling of claustrophobia was so intense. The brilliance of this novel is the way in which Smith details each of the characters undoing which comes from their own hubris, really, not the evil of the plant. This novel has the potential of trancending the horror genre and being a significant work of fiction in its own right. Well done and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not very good.","review":"this is just not a very good book. if you read \\"a simple plan,\\" you go into this one expecting that it may just end with everyone dying, which takes away from the suspense. i read the whole thing, because if i hadn't i wouldn't even bother rating it or writing a review. but it is not very good. i didn't care about any of the characters, there were no big surprises and very few small ones. pure junk reading for the beach, but not even good for junk. i love a lot of stephen king's books, but i disagree with his review."},{"rating":"1","title":"arezee","review":"With many books in this genre, you think you know by page 20 where it's going. But the author's just sandbagging you. You're yanked around corners, pushed into plot pits from which there seems to be no escape. By the end of the read, you wonder \\"how did we get here?\\", and your page-20 certainty seems kind of silly.Not so with this book. By page 20 you know where it's going and you're right. This is not a rollercoaster ride, it's the kiddee train at the zoo.Also, in this age of computer spellchecks and word counts, you would think a careful author might want take a few seconds to determine if any word or phrase is seriously overworked in the manuscript. For example, the phrase \\"of course.\\" See how many you can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"it gave me a headache...","review":"Honestly, I was intrigued by the premise: a group of young tourists, visiting an old archaeolgical site, end up being held hostage there by an evil plant and a tribe of Mayans...The story truly had great promise, but the author loses you at almost every 3 pages. He had a great tendency to be redundant in explaining the peril of his characters, for example:Eric: Give me the knife, give me the knife... (x999999 times)Just because the characters repeat a damn phrase over and over again, doesn't give the readers the impression that they really are in dire need of something. It just gets extremely annoying!To give the story credit, it was interesting in the first 100 or so pages, but after that, it's all downhill. The story was created wayyy too long to tell a story that really wasn't a well-developed story to begin with..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read worse, though nothing comes to mind","review":"I picked this up at the airport due, in large part, to Stephen King's glowing review. Clearly, the author must have some very compromising pictures of Mr. King.Plot holes galore, lack of character development, and total failure to execute on an intriguing idea deliver a trifecta of triteness. In the end, all the characters die. Not to worry. With characters like these you find yourself \\"rooting\\" for the plant.If there is any justice in this world, the Mayans will spring forth from Mr. Smith's imagination, encircle his home, and ensure that his future manuscripts never grace the desk of a publisher.On the bright side, the Grade B movie sure to follow could cast J.Lo and other nauseatingly self-absorbed actors as the celluloid Miracle-Gro."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruins - SPOILERS","review":"This isn't the kind of story where the characters find themselves in an impossible situation but figure out ingenious ways to escape. Once the identity and properties of the mystery killer are revealed it's fairly obvious what's going to happen, and hopelessness runs through the tale-- things are bad, then worse, then worse still-- the killer is too smart, too lethal, too powerful for the (mostly unlikeable, immature, selfish, stupid) victims to overcome. I kept waiting for the problem-solving part of the story to kick in, but Smith bombards his characters with problems that cannot be solved-- threats from which they cannot possibly protect themselves-- and the inevitable carnage ensues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissappointment","review":"I am an avid reader, especially in the summer. I had this book reserved before it was published because of the last book Smith wrote, A Simple Plan. I have probably read 4 to 6 books a week this summer and i can honestly say ..THIS WAS THE WORST ONE OF THE LOT, A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME. I started to scan the chapters after i got the basics of the story....just to see how it was going to end, then decided i really didn't CARE how it was going to end. The end is very predictable. I was amazed to read Stephen King's positive review. I would not reccommend this book to anyone, i don't know what kind of person would enjoy the disgusting, hopeless situation these characters are thrown into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of brain cells!","review":"I picked up this book because of all the glittering reviews, but what a complete disappointment. The storyline gives no answers, the characters are stupid and unlikable, and there was no \\"horror\\" to the book at all. A little bit of gory descriptions, but nothing thrilling. The author bounces back and forth between the characters repeating the same stuff over and over. One review read \\"The best American horror novel since Stephen King's The Shining\\". Are you freaking kidding me? This book wasted my brain cells, and I feel less intelligent for having been put through the \\"horror\\" of reading this rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ruins","review":"\\"The Simple Plan\\" blew me away, so I was very happy to discover another book of Scott Smith's. This one, though not as brilliant or original, for that matter, is nonetheless a very enjoyable read; I couldn't put it down. The characters, even though drawn in very general terms, are far from being cardboard. Somehow, Smith makes them all too familiar and believable. The book reminded me a lot of King's earlier story, \\"The Raft\\", as well as his novel \\"Gerald's Game\\". No wonder he loved it. Also, there is a lot of Garland's \\"The Beach\\" mixed with the \\"Open Water\\" movie. The subject of the book is a detailed account of 6 people trapped with very little water or food and facing the prospect of gruesome death. What would they make of the situation? Read the book - it's pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appropriate Airport Page Turning Fare, nothing really new...","review":"Typical of many books I've devoured while waiting for a plane, this one keeps you turning the pages to see what happens next, but there is no great connection with or feeling for the characters. This is a hamburger to Steven King's steak. While the subject matter is scary, the author lacks King's talent to really draw you in and ratchet up your nerves. Take it for what it is any you will be satisfied, but not mind blowing or surprising in any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS BOOK!","review":"I am not the type that easily/frequently predicts endings . . . but this book is transparently predictable. The 5oo pages could be covered simply enough in 100 pages. Formulaic, dull, uninspired. Like so many other recent reviewers, I ask: why is this book popular?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inept.","review":"Inept, inane, insipid and instantly forgettable. A pointless short story pointlessly fattened to novel length. Smith absolutely distrusts the intelligence of his readers, and has crafted a novel absolutely lacking in smarts. Zero character development and countless plot holes equals a terrible waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ruins","review":"If I could give minus stars for this book I would. Disappointment doesn't begin to describe how I feel about The Ruins. A Simple Plan was simply wonderful and I expected something similar from Scott Smith's latest. So much could have been done with this plot! Why couldn't he have done it? I kept waiting for something to happen rather than how the vines felt, looked sounded, from the perspective of each of the characters. Then each of then had to express how they felt about the mosquitos, then each of them had to express how they felt about the mud, the heat, the cold, the Mayans, ad nauseum. Well, how I feel is let down by this poor excuse for a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming social value","review":"This is an uninspired horror-flick wannabe - \\"Day of the Triffids\\" meets \\"The Hills Have Eyes.\\" It is depressing, gross and stupid. Reading this book may actually be harmful to the psyche. It is horrifyingly bad.The characters are all banal. The horror is gross, not scary. There is absolutely no suspense. The plot lacks intelligence or even sense. It is possibly the worst book I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain creepy","review":"My subject line not intended to be a pun. Let your imagination go into this most frightening story. No wonder Stephen King loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after A Simple Plan","review":"Ordinarily, I might give this book about 3 stars. But I probably have to downgrade this because my expectations were so high after A Simple Plan, which I adored. Perhaps that's not fair. Certainly, this book is a page-turner - I had to keep reading it and reading it until I got to the end. But, unlike A Simple Plan, this went from a potential real-life situation to surreal horror - you really have to be able to suspend disbelief. To the point that it's just not credible. To me, that marred Smith's fantastic sense of story-telling. He really is a good writer, and he certainly did well with the subject matter he'd chosen. But I just couldn't buy the premise, and that somewhat ruined it for me. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!","review":"I have three words for you folks: THIS...BOOK...SUCKS. I think Stephen King was paid off to give such a poorly written piece of garbage such a glowing review. Save yourself sometime and skip this piece of poorly written and developed trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruins","review":"When I started reading I got hooked because Scott Smith is a good writer. I thought his book A Simple Plan was just fantastic! However, The Ruins was incredibly dark, without hope, horribly gory, and I had a hard time reading it. If I hadn't spent so much money on the hardcover, I would have thrown it away. I stayed with it, too, because I continued to hope that these young kids would finally be rescued. This book is incredibly depressing. Toward the end it became obvious that no one believed in God and they were, indeed, truly alone, forever. Very, very dark and depressing. I will do my best to warn others not to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grotesque, nihilistic, claustrophobic mess","review":"Well Stephen King, who I love, seemed to like this novel. Unless you like being depressed at all of humanity and plantdom, do not read this book. If you like that sort of thing, this is just the book for you. Read on McDuff. Did I mention it was nihilistic and grotesque? This author should take 12 years between books, otherwise his readers would kill themselves if he came out every 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Over-hyped","review":"This novel was really over hyped. The writing style is dense and plodding. There is almost no dialogue, instead there is tons of descriptions - of people, of events, of what the characters think of events and other people, etc. By page 25, I think I had read less than twenty lines of dialogue, total. There is something to be said for some dialogue - it picks up the pace, and gets us more involved with and knowledgable of the characters. I admit here that I ended up skimming the book, but I still found it not very exciting, and realized that I didn't like any of the characters enough to care what happened to them. The plot did not convince me to go back to reading it continuously, and the ending was lame. Save your money - if you feel a need to try this novel out, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanic without survivors","review":"This book took me laboriously too long to read. There is nothing much to hook the reader. No plot twists to keep the suspense. No hope for the six protagonists from the beginning. Mr Smith should include more of The Mayans in the storyline rather merely use them as the perimeter guards. At least it would shed some light on the mystery of the vines. I find the writing style boring and monotonous for a suspense novel. I resort to skipping pages just to get to the predictable end. It is like reading about the Titanic without any survivors. I totally disagree with Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Boring Book I've Ever Read","review":"It took over 500 pages to write basically what should have been a short story. It didn't need chapters, because it was just nonstop rewriting of the characters actions with each other. I went through 200 pages before even coming to the horror of the plant. He should have developed the plants horror, instead of going into how the characters constantly whine about each other. Where did the thing come from, why didn't they at least try fire to burn it, and couldn't they have flung some at the natives who kept them isolated to protect themselves. I gave it one star because there was nothing lower, and am throwing out the book, instead of keeping it as a paper weight. If writing this book is his only day job, I really recommend a career change. If you have trouble sleeping, read this; because after 10 pages you won't be able to stay awake. No wonder Sams Club was selling this for $4.75; they probably got them on a close out from the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure, undiluted, unrelenting horror.","review":"This is the best pure horror book I've read in ... well, maybe ever. I am a big fan of King, Koontz, Lovecraft and others, but I'm not sure I've ever stumbled upon a book with such a pitiless and engrossing story. I finished The Ruins yesterday evening and spent the rest of my night racked with nightmares stemming from this gruesome novel.The character depictions are unrelentingly honest, and their lack of sentimenality makes the characters that much more realistic and sympathetic. And while the author doesn't spend too much time (think King or Koontz) belaboring a character's inner struggles, he does give the reader enough insight into each person to bring him to life and give meaning to his plight.If you want something that grabs you, holds you, convinces you, and tortures your mind for a long, long time, this is a perfect choice. If you want a cheerful story, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just lost hours of my life","review":"Having read A Simple Plan I thought I would give The Ruins a try. Sadly- I wish I hadn't. It's like a really bad horror movie you pick up at the store for 5$. Pretty good review by Stephen King- so it has to be decent right? No- it's not. I feel like I have wasted a few hours of my life on this book. It was so bad- yet I couldn't put it down. And, just having finished it- I am so much more dissapointed. The characters are weak, stupid and selfish. It was a battle of wits with one man holding up the other four, and as soon as he died- it was all over. Just to begin again 3 days later. And the vine- is never explained. Some sort of closure regarding the how and why the vine came to be would have been nice. Instead Mr. Smith thinks we'd enjoy it more if we only knew that it just traps 5 more people. Really, do not waste your time or money on this poorly written book. I'm already very sorry that I did (luckily though, I am only borrowing it from the library.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares?","review":"We waited 12 years (or whatever) for this? [SPOILER ALERT!] If you're thinking of reading this book, don't continue.Four kids hunting ruins in the Yucatan get trapped and eaten by a sentient vine. Smith writes well, but who cares? It was obvious that Smith's goal is a summer blockbuster film starring Julia Stiles and Natalie Portman. I suspect his goal will be achieved and, when I think about it, I guess I'd prefer to spend two hours watching Julia Stiles or Natalie Portman get eaten by a vine than spend three or four hours reading this ridiculous book. If you haven't read this book, but have read this far in this review: You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruins... ruined?","review":"After all of recent movie talk, and based on Stephen King's review of the book, I made the decision to purchase this prior to watching the movie. My honest opinion is that the book was a complete disappointment. The book really could have had a lot of potential, but possibly as a short story. The lack of description and the poor characters leave you sitting back stunned that this book could receive such high reviews, and wondering how you could get through the book to begin with.I don't foresee myself purchasing other titles from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read","review":"Wow. Ridiculous, stupid, downright asinine and, worse, horribly written. I'm angry at myself for having wasted hours of valuable reading time on this dreck, but I thought (hoped) that surely something (interesting? suprising? exciting?) would happen before the book ended. It didn't; just sort of fizzled out. I actually felt myself getting dumber while I read.Please. Save yourself the money (and time) and read something - anything - else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Novel Riding the Coattails of its predecessor","review":"Scott Smith, the writer of _A Simple Plan_, returns with his sophomore novel, _The Ruins_. Unlike his previous novel, this one is neither interesting, smart, nor inventive. I was deeply disappointed by the novel. The lengthy, reflective writing burdened the book with unneeded introspection. The agent of horror was not at all scary and rather comical at times. The promise of the novel never truly materializes. The setting had such a wonderful promise, indeed it has been covered by better authors elsewhere, yet this author chose to emphasize the individuals to such an extent, that the thrill of the novel soon dissipates. By the 150th page, I was reading only to complete the novel. This novel has gone the way of most sophomoric works"},{"rating":"1","title":"First book I've ever thrown away","review":"Poorly written, the story seems to have been created by a monkey with short term memory loss. The plot progresses slowly with insignificant points drilled into the reader's head over and over again.I picked it up in the airport and was looking forward to diving into it, mostly because of the hype on the cover. Later that day I actually threw it away in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Silly & Contrived","review":"I bought this book because it was supposed to be a great summer thriller. What I got was a silly, contrived plot of dimwitted kids and man eating flowers.

The writing is average, and the plot is only slightly better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I NOT give it a star???","review":"Totally not worth the time, I listened to the whole thing in my car, for some reason I just had to finish the 13 discs. I would not recommend this book at all to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wasted afternoon","review":"This is one of the worst books I've read in a while, and I'm shocked that Stephen King liked it. My guess is that he is applauding the complete lack of competetion in the book. Any author who, like this one, starts with a great premise and adds adequate characterization (but not to the point that I cared about any of the characters) and then completely forgets to include a plot should be spanked in public. I kept waiting for the characters to try to figure out their situation, for something to actually happen, but nothing happened at all. The author presented various clues to the situation and then just let them lie there. If this story had been told around a fire in the depths of winter in a Norse village, the storyteller would have been killed and eaten."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible!!!","review":"I have read many books in this genre and have never read one as boring and slow as this. The book never gets to the point (which is?). There is no story to the book, just rambling continuation of the same thing. Also there is hardly a climax and end to the story. If the movie is anything like this, it must be a bomb too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for betraying all of us, Stephen King","review":"King obviously \\"reviewed\\" this based on being a friend of the author. This book was much better in its original form...aka The Raft, a short story by Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Shop of Horrors Redux","review":"I had high expectations but was ultimately disappointed by this read. Truly a page turner until the inane and improbable overtake the stark and suspenseful writing. Once the conflict is established, character development halts, the plot bogs down and the scenery never changes. Most limiting is the fact that the villain is a plant -- no matter how hard Smith tries to spruce it up with preposterous properties, it remains a plant. A better format for this tome may well have been a Choose Your Own Adventure Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most unsatisfying books ever...","review":"I recently read A Simple Plan and thought it was absolutely phenomenal and for that reason, was anxiously awaiting Scott Smith's new book.While the Ruins was suspenseful and the character's dynamics were interesting, the ending was a complete let down. Smith's lack of explanation for the vines characteristics was truly annoying. I threw the book down after having read it, disgusted by the lack of plot. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ruined\\" by the ending","review":"\\"The Ruins\\" is a great ride, but the ending is so disappointing that the book was very much of a let-down. I kept waiting for the twist that would never come - even when there were only 11 pages left I kept up hope. Maybe on the second time around (e.g. the movie version) a more creative ending will be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grim and engrossing","review":"Readers will either buy the premise of \\"The Ruins\\" or find it absurd. If you're in the first camp, you're in for a long, increasingly disturbing ride. I mean that in a good way. The plot has been rehashed plenty, but to me, the most interesting part of this book is its exploration of specific personality types and how they react in intense situations. While the action is troubling enough, it's especially jarring to recognize yourself - as I did - among the characters Scott Smith assembled. \\"The Ruins,\\" much like the movie \\"Open Water,\\" forces you to think about what you would do if you were stranded with nothing but company and diminishing hope. It's not a pleasant exercise, but certainly an intriguing one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy, gruesome.... I couldn't put it down!","review":"I know from the reviews and ratings, those of us who read and enjoyed this book are in the minority, but I will eagerly speak up as someone who loved this book!The book is not broken down into chapters (which was unusual) but the action moved quickly. The characters were distinct and I found myself definitely liking and rooting for some more than others. I was so intrigued with the story that I read it in one day. A bit of \\"horror,\\" a good amount of suspense, lots of action, and a bit of mystery. This story was gruesome in places, so the squeamish should be warned.When I first picked up this book up, I thought there would be more information about the Yucatan Peninsula - culture, history, customs. There was very little of that. A bit of information about the Mayans as the tourists travel to begin the story, but otherwise the story is a good, modern horror story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good: refreshingly simple plot. The bad: unsurprising and dull.","review":"I believe that I have permanently burned myself out on horror. The Ruins came highly recommended-- author is supposed to be good, the book itself is supposed to be smart. One of the best entries in the field at the moment, supposedly.But, sad to say, I really wasn't impressed. Although there is something to be said for the kind of pleasantly retro simplicity of the plot, that's nearly the biggest praise that I can muster. In general, I found the characters irritating and the plot predictable. And while the simplicity *was* nice, it simply did not carry 509 pages. By the end, I was seriously bored.But the biggest crime? Once I understood the set up, not one single thing surprised me about the book. A death sentence, really.I would give this one a miss. Anyone got any recommendations for horror out there which I would actually like, or should I give up on the genre completely?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture Porn","review":"The plot--and the deficiencies therein--of The Ruins, by Scott Smith, have been recounted by other reviews effectively, so I'll try not to be redundant.The good--Smith is a quick read, and, for a story that doesn't move much from a single location, that's an accomplishment.What I have to add to the bad--first, a strange choice for a title. The story barely has anything to do with ruins.Second, The Ruins is bascially yet another installment with the horror genre's recent infatuation with torture porn. Don't worry, gentle reader, The Ruins is softcore when it comes down to it, but the concept is really the same: isolate some young people and make horrible things happen to them.Third, the epilogue of the book, which is supposed to leave us with a creepy feeling as we put it down is so wildly implausible it just didn't work for me.Average work, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth time/money","review":"I was way not impressed by this book. Felt like I needed to rate it appropriately. Many of the one star/two star reviewers hit on the points not great in this book. While the story line not great, I was very surprised by how NOT developed the characters were. I couldn't keep the two couples straight at all, it was as if they were all the same...If I were you, I wouldn't spend time/money on this book. Wish I had read the reviews before I read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Im Sorry I read it","review":"Im sad that I can never have back the time I wasted reading this book. This was probably the worst book I have read in several years. The characters all were unrealistic. People do not behave in such a way. I kept reading thinking that something cool would happen and everything would make sense or that the characters would smarten up and be intresting but it was all downhill after the fitst couple chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This is one of those books I wish I'd stopped reading about halfway through. It's boring. It's predictable. The four American characters are indistinguishable from each other. A half-hearted attempt is made to imply that one of the group that sets forth for the ruins might not be all that they seem, but it never goes anywhere. And the writing itself is paltry. Very little description of the world which resulted in my never crossing that boundary where you start to live out the events happening in the book. It was always just words on a page. Plants are green and red. A hat is blue. Someone has curly brown hair. It's pretty plain. But my biggest complaint is that Smith TELLS us everything. Very little is SHOWN. The end effect is like listening to a very long-winded acquaintance tell you about the bad vacation of someone they know. \\"The Ruins\\" gets my vote for the most overrated book of 2006."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a few hours to waste, go ahead.","review":"How about a book that grabs you through the first half and then provides jaw-breaking yawns to the very end? There is enough plot summary by other readers to give you the 411. I'll just add that it was a total waste of time. I should have taken a nap or cleaned out the fridge; either one would have amounted to something, whereas reading this book dulled my senses and robbed me of $4.88 (bought it at Sam's....)."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"Perhaps the movie will prove a winner because the book cannot remotely claim the title. The work is often dull and barely kept my interest. None of the characters felt genuine or likeable in any sense, and I was left not caring what happened to the lot. From the ads on television, the film seems more of a horror flick than anything else, and the exclusion of much of the tedium in the novel might save it from a similar fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"come on!!! give smith a break","review":"After reading SImple Plan, I picked up The Ruins the first time I saw it in the bookstore, and I didn't regret it. THe book was a really good piece of work. People are constantly complaining about the length of it but it was only 500 pages or so. Try reading 'IT' by Stephen King, then we will talk about a long book. I like the whole concept of the book. Although, it was a little lengthy the story made up for it. I give him credit for writing this book and I'm really looking forward to his next book, whenever that may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOOOORING!","review":"This book was dragged out so long that i lost intrest halfway through. It is NOT exciting, NOT thrilling, NOT original, NOT shocking, NOT GOOD. Ultimately the story goes nowhere.

But, I feel so strongly about this book that I felt compelled to write a review. I had high hopes for this book. We were going on a trip and I bought the audio version--VERY predictable, VERY boring...after a while you really don't care whether the main characters die or not. This book needed a really good editor before it went to press. Even my teenagers who LOVE horror/thriller books and movies wanted me to fast forward through large sections of this book. Really a waste of money and time. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!

Sure it was a bit far-fetched and maybe too predictable, but it worked. I will remember this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A short story extended into a novel","review":"This would have made a good short story but as written was waaay too long. I lost interest quickly and I tend to love stories like this. Part of my problem was that I did not care for any of the characters so could care less what happened to them. I actually found myself rooting for the plants. I would not waste my time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating almost-there thriller","review":"Smith has written a page-turner, but it's like cotton candy--tastes good going down but of no substantive value; in fact after you finish you won't feel good.Perhaps Smith meant this as an allegory about the passive yuppie-wannabes, but the characters' lack of common sense and, even more so, lack of intelligent curiosity kinda had me rooting for the, um, big bad. They have clues and they don't even look at them; they don't even try to find a way to defeat the evil.I'm sorry I spent the money on a hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of a Read","review":"Are you kidding me? It's as if Scott Smith never read a horror book in his life and thought he was creating a genre. I've read \\"Goosebumps\\" that were more entertaining. The book is about survival, or rather dying, all of which is done in a cliched and repetitive way. There is no suspense, you know what is going to happen from page 50. It is the lamest \\"evil\\" since the plant in \\"Little Shop of Horrors.\\"Stephen King's review influenced me to buy it and I feel betrayed by an author I used to truly enjoy. However, after aliens came out of people's bums in \\"Dreamcatcher\\" it shouldn't surprise me that \\"The Ruins\\" is a book King would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Terror of Tedium","review":"What Ruins? The only thing related to ruins was my ruined 3 days of trying to slog through this tedious, bloated story. It would have been better as a novella or a very short, short story. The title is a non-event. The story is 200+ pages too long. The only terror was tedium. In all my years I have only stopped reading a handful of books, giving them 1 stars. I forced myself to complete this book hence the 2 star rating. There is no terror. It is not scary. It is superficial at best and does not develop any kind of plot-line. Both my wife and I found ourselves skimming many pages as they were just too painful to read.All in all not a recommend. Save your money. Sad since Mr. Smith's first novel was terrific, \\"A Simple Plan\\". If you want to read something along this thesis try Mr. James Rollins."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary Root Canal","review":"The horror of this book is that you feel compelled to keep reading, thinking: the unsympathetic characters will develop more fully; the navel-gazing will turn to thoughtful action; the source and intelligence behind the scheming carnivore plant (which is smarter and more resourceful than any of the wretched humans) and abandoned mine site will be revealed; and some glimmer of hope will surface for these witless morons.Disappointment is your reward.We listened to the audio version while on a long vacation road trip. It was a chore, but we expected some pay off when we got to the 12th and final CD. Finishing it off was a relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me save you some time","review":"Let me save you some time before you open this 500-page \\"page turner.\\" Everybody dies. There. Don't look for more than that--everybody is going to die and nobody is going to be rescued. A plant kills them. Yup, a plant with nice red flowers on it. Oops, did I give it away? Sorry, but the plant winds up killing five good looking young tourists who are out on a lark in the Yucatan. But the killing doesn't start until about page 400, which leaves you plenty of time to think that something else is going to happen, something really big and exciting. Don't hold your breath. Nothing happens except the slow torture of the reader. Really the only fun in this novel is who gets killed first. And then when it happens you're almost thankful because something finally did happen. Don't waste your time with this one, don't buy into the hype or the good reviews. The movie bombed for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book hurt me at times. It really hurt.","review":"When the author stayed on topic, it was actually a fun read. But there is so so so much filler in place to stretch this out to a novel. Another bad thing is that many of the author's thoughts are predictable. And at times just in bad taste. This is my first Scott Smith novel and will be my last.Now, had the story been written as a short story or something like that, I think it would have been much better. It just seemed to me that the effort it took to make a novel just ruined the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of course King liked it...he wrote It!!..30 years ago!","review":"Of course Stephen King gave it a good review.....he wrote the freging concept himself. I too was drawn to all the hype this title garnered, it was suppose to be one of the best selling horror novels, it was suppose to be the next generation in great scare novels, what it turned out to be was a whole lot of nothing!... I made myself read the whole book just knowing it was going to get better, just around the next page it was going to start really rocking....nope, stayed boring the whole dang way.

No character development (characters too pathetic to develop), weak dialogue, no writing talent.

Yes it is crafted fairly well until you start seeing thru the BS that has grabbed your attention causing you to not noticed the holes. This book is a sick joke. It has no purpose. I wanted to get thru the end, thought about reading the last page but did not. I wish I had.

I kept waiting to see where the \\"ruins\\" were, but after finishing the book I now know where the \\"ruins\\" were and they weren't made of stone. I really wish I hadn't finished this book. It is kind of like the movie \\"Exorcist\\", after seeing that, I wished I hadn't. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Sadly, this book is NOT very good.

It was one of the few stories where I was actually happy for the characters to meet the ends that they did.Apparently it will be a movie later this year and now that I think about it, it was so shallowly written that perhaps Smith was writing it for the big screen instead of people who wanted to read a good novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"rwobrien says no.","review":"Probably the worst novel I have read in 25 years.

The story was dumb, the characters were badly developed, I cared not a jot for what happened to them, and the whole thing could have been summed up in about 500 not-very-interesting words.

The characters were not especially interesting or likeable, and while the situation they were in was compelling, there was no psychological payoff or resolution.

I agree, it's all those things. However, I actually enjoyed it, despite its numerous flaws. The main reason: It was really different, it kept me interested, and it's doesn't use one of the usual formula plots which I am so sick of reading over and over. (I've given up on legal thrillers completely. They're all the same drivel.) Scott Smith should be congratulated on, at least, having the guts to give it a totally unacceptable ending.

I am just past page 200 to date, waiting for something to happen and thinking of not finishing the book. ( I decided to finish the book. The best part of it occurs between page 290 and 319, the end. It didn't make the novel worth reading, however it was fast paced and written like a thriller. My opinion is unchanged.) It is outright boring.

Better luck next time for Scott Smith, and you will not regret skipping this one. Erik S."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Longest Short Story Ever Told","review":"In short, this book is a bummer. Scott Smith is a talented writer. I recommend his 'A Simple Plan' which details the downward spiral of a seemingly normal guy into a possibly deranged murderer. Its a great read with some surprising twists. But this book is another matter entirely. Although well written, it is essentially a 500 page Edgar Allen Poe short story. It locks onto you like python and never let's go. And that is the main problem. It is relentlessly negative without any real surprises after the first fifty pages. Anybody who has seen a few Tales From the Crypt episodes already knows where this story is going. The only thing missing is the closing screech of the Crypt Keeper.If you love doom, gore and depressing stories, help yourself. Me, I wish I had never picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ruins -- a simple review...","review":"Definately worth the read. Not as 'scary' as I hoped based on numerous quotes and reviews I read.The Ruins takes place in Mexico; an unlikely group of friends/tourists/strangers travel off the resort to assist a tourist find his brother (who left with a beautiful stranger, archaeologist). This group of friends follow a map to the excavation site, find the ruins, and become trapped there by the Mayans. The Ruins are controlled... by mysterious vines.Where I was not scared to the heights of sleepless nights, I did catch myself waking up scratching my arms and legs for \\"no apparent reason\\".A good, quick, creepy read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was SO disappointed!","review":"\\"A Simple Plan\\" was one of the most entertaining reads of my life, then Scott Smith went for YEARS without writing a second book. As soon as I heard about \\"The Ruins,\\" I dropped everything else to read it. I only finished reading it because I had waited so long, and because I kept thinking something good (or at least entertaining) had to come out of it. But I have to say, I can only recommend that you NEVER read this horribly depressing story devoid of entertainment value. I think Scott Smith must have waited too long, was probably under a lot of pressure to repeat his wildly successful first novel, and just couldn't come up with another good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner 'til the bitter end....","review":"A well-written thriller with compelling characters in the tradition of 'Ten Little Indians'.

The Ruins is an unrelenting and unflinching story that doesn't even attempt to give its readers even a one-page break from the horror that's been mounting since around page 30. Once Smith's cast of characters reach the ruins, there is no stopping. You see the bad side of the characters as they seek to come to terms with the truth about the ruins. Whether this involves cannibalism, self-mutilation, or just plain stupidity you are treated to it.I enjoyed this book, but it won't be for everyone. It's the kind of thing Stephen King might have written if he were able to not 'be Stephen King.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruination","review":"Dear God in Heaven .

I have not read \\"A Simple Plan\\", however I did see the movie and liked it. When I first started the book, I figured it would be about Mayan ruins, and as the story began it truly seemed like that's where it was going. I was a bit surprised when I discovered what the true evil was.Some people have complained that the characters were not terribly likeable or interesting. I disagree with this idea and say that the characters devolved over the course of their time on the \\"hill\\" and this felt true to me for what they were going through.In short, I enjoyed the book and will look for \\"A Simple Plan\\" to read next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies meets Jaws","review":"I am torn on this Novel. Do I love to hate it or hate to love it? I gave it 4 stars becuase parts of it still haunt me and make me think days after reading it- a sign that it was worth the quick read that it is. Be Warned - if you are looking for the Standard \\"King\\" style novel where the \\"good guys\\" take a beating but in the end triumph you will not be getting it. The author pounds away at you making you twist and sweat on each page as he gets more graphic with the pain and suffering. You will NOT like these characters as you see the sad under belly of what can happen when panic/fear take hold of a group. Over all- go with it if you want a swift kick in the gut but be warned it will make you squirm. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Venus flytraps finally have a mentor","review":"The paper thin characters in this book had me rooting for the vine - it just needed to eat more quickly to render this as a short story instead of a 300+ page book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I ever finished","review":"It was bad enough having to listen to the interior whining of 4 characters, but in the end I felt like I feel when I watch a bad movie to find out how it will end.It wasn't worth the time.If I had read this because of Stephen King's review, I would be twice as mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This is a fatalistic, no plot, no intrigue, could have made a decent science fiction but didn't, waste of time.

Your assumption that people the age of those in your book are complete idiots is really very irritating. Good luck if you decide to try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better at 100 pages","review":"Scott Smith took a good story and managed to drag it out for over 500 boring pages. If you like slow moving books filled with insignificant details you'll love this one. Stupid! For instance, one of the girls peed on herself and used what little water they had to wash off her foot. Sure, that could happen. And they've got a killer plant that they make no effort to stay away from. That also makes sense. If you want to save yourself the boring details that carry no suspense then read the first hundred pages and then skip to the end of the book. I would give this book 0 stars if it was an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Disturbing","review":"After reading A Simple Plan, I couldn't wait to read The Ruins. I felt so-so going in after reading some of the reviews, but what I found was a great story. I disagree with the reviewer who says the characters were unrealistic. I thought all the characters were well thought out and developed nicely. I just hope Scott Smith doesn't wait so long between novels this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable and not scary at all","review":"I think Stephen King liked this book because its basically a re-hash of many of his favorite themes.

And people wonder why the novel is fast becoming extinct...Look no further!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Course...","review":"The biggest horror in this book is how many times the author uses the phrase \\"of course...\\". If you're just starting to read this book keep count and let me know in your review. And then...the constant references to bodily excretions were just too much. This was not horror but it was horrific. I wouldn't recommended this book to anyone. The one question I would have for the author would be how much he paid Stephen King to write that glowing review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruins? What ruins?","review":"I expected a Mayan ruin to make an appearance. Maybe i'm being too literal. Then again, this story, unlike A SIMPLE PLAN, lacked subtlety and nuance. So, yeah, it's OK that I expected the ruin to figure in.Once the vine was discovered to be \\"evil\\", my left eyebrow remained cocked, a la Stephen Colbert, in highly skeptical disbelief. A vomit-eating vine with a brain is the \\"other\\". What a ridiculous premise. For this author, anyway. OK, so he's laughing all the way to the bank.Thanking Ben Stiller? I should've realized the tip off right from the get go.I will definitely skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"After the Hype","review":"The buzz generated more than deserving word-of-mouth ... and, yes, the expectations ranked high. But after all the hoopla ... Smith's novel took off with an interesting start ... until it dwindled into the level of predictable and even incorrigible. When the reader ends up breezing through the pages, discerning the suspenseful from the all-too-fantastic, the interest must have been lost somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Spot Run","review":"This book was unreadable, let alone disappointing. After the first 70 pages or so of, Jeff did this, Eric did that, Stacey made out with him...I couldn't finish this book.

I've read A Simple Plan and really liked that, but didn't know what to think The Ruins would be like since it was described as Stephen King-like. I don't usually read that style of book, but since it was written by Scott Smith and it was his first book since A Simple Plan, I just had to give it a shot. It exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy an action packed book, this is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I bought this based on Entertainment Weekly and Stephen King's rave reviews but was very disappointed. I thought it was creepy until the characters actually arrive at the ruins and the reader discovers the \\"horror\\" there. First off, the characters are underdeveloped so when terrible things begin to happen I really didn't care about any of them. Secondly, once they're stuck the strange things that happen become repetitive and instead of spooky you know the outcome quickly. A lot of gore, no sense of real horror...I rarely skim books but I wound up skimming the last 100 pages because I just wanted it to end. If you enjoy horror skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Disappointment","review":"I loved \\"A Simple Plan,\\" and I really liked about the first 50-75 pages of this book . . . but it fell apart.I don't want to give away the plot, so I won't go into specifics.But the first part did a spectacular job of ratcheting up the tension . . . so much so that I found myself really eager to get back to the book to FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS.And I kept reading, and I began to become bored -- despite the truly godawful plight of these people -- and ready for it to be over. By at least a hundred pages before the book ended it was inexcapably obvious what was going to happen to them, so all you had to do was plod along to get through the gory (reall, really gory) details.And since I don't want to give away the plot I can't go into specifics about the adversary who does all this to them. I agree with the review I read in the NY Times, though -- it becomes so over-the-top the whole affair starts to be ludicrous.Very, very, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"The beginning was good, actually almost all the way thru was good, although not original.

The characters are very boring and I found myself having no affinity for them at all. This would make a good 10 to 30 page short story, but not a novel. Smith drags this thing out WAY too long. Try something else for your hard-earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I have ever Read","review":"The whole story is just laughable, when it is supose to be \\"Scary\\". A plant with a brain! give me a break! The first time I have bought a book and have felt totaly ripped off. The worst author I have ever read. I feel sorry for who ever bought the film rights, they should stop production of the film and save there money. Use the script as a door stop! Scott Smith must be laughing all the way to the bank. I feel like a sucker to have listened to the hype of this book. I guess anyone can call themselves an Author.

I will use my copy, to start my barbaque next summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depresssssinggg!","review":"Well written, but depressing. Nothing, I repeat, nothing good ever happens. After awhile, I just wanted it to end, and thankfully, it did (with a whimper)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for nothing Stephen King!","review":"Save your cash, this book is trash. It's bad enough that the last good book Stephen King wrote was Bag of Bones, now he is recommending other people's lousy novels. The only terrifying thing about this book is that it was published and I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No climax No release No explations.","review":"I can't believe I finished this book. From about page 5 I stoped caring about the characters. I however wanted to know what was at the ruins. Each time the story got good - the point was chaged with no real explanation as to what really happened or why. I felt there was no reason for everyone's death. I am very surprised to see such high reviews from Stephen King. I really like King's books and thought since King liked it I would - wrong wrong and double wrong. I think I finished it just hoping there would be a surprise in the end and everything would be explaned. Wrong again. So no climax, no release, and no explations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious waste of time","review":"For the life of me I can't see how anyone could find this book 'intense', much less scary. The plot twists are minor league and telegraphed twenty pages in advance. You can see the ending coming almost from the moment they arrive at the ruins, and the only reason I kept reading was the belief that such a highly praised writer would never stoop to such an obvious cliche.The characters all spend a lot of time thinking back on previous times of their lives, the kind of stuff that is interesting to yourself but no one else. One character spends the biggest part of the book breathing in \\"rasping, phlegmy\\" gasps. The vine is really kind of goofy when you get right down to it, as well as inconsistent -- it might as well be yelling \\"Feed me!\\". There are a couple of gruesome scenes that feel shoe-horned in to an otherwise mundane story. I don't mind that there isn't a final explanation for it all, but there is so much left unsaid and unexplored that it feels more like lazy storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I read last year","review":"The writing isn't bad but the plot is terrible, the characters stupid and overall this book was a waste of time. I can't believe Stephen King called this a horror novel. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, Downhill after","review":"I was very excited about this book. From the title, I had hoped it was a historical horror/thriller. But I was wrong, this is a book about the survival of six young people in a Mexican rainforest. Besides the heat, the lack of shelter and food, they have to survive against a \\"monster\\". This \\"monster\\" follows and listens to them everywhere they go. The kids can't escape and they have to manage to survive.I thought the book started off very well, intense and scary, but once you find out about the monster. It was a total disappointment. There is nothing about the history of the Mayans or the ruins or even the \\"monster\\". The \\"monster\\" just got stupider and faker as the book goes on. I would call it almost \\"cheesy\\". Anyway, I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it...truly disappointed...","review":"I heard so many good things about this...waited on the paperback and bought it the day it came out...turned out to be a bore and I struggled to barely get 150 pages in. It just didn't hold my interest at all. Uninteresting and bland characters. Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"As with PolarBear, I picked this up at the airport for a quick read during the trip home. I was skimming multiple pages by the time I hit pg. 150, it has tediously slow plot development and too much descriptive narrative. I certainly can't appreciate the hype over this book because it reads like a screenplay for a 1950s \\"B\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time","review":"YIKES! I can't believe I did it again and didn't read the reviews before I bought this. Stopped reading about a third of the way through the book and couldn't wait to get it out of my sight. It was kind of like trying to read the worst B horror movie you ever tried to watch on late night TV. Repetitive narrative with no plot, no mystery, no explanations. Characters that you couldn't wait to get rid of. What a ridiculous premise and a ghastly read. Don't bother. With so many good books out there how do authors like this ever get published?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly disappointing!","review":"This book sounding suspenseful and intriguing but was probably my most disappointing read of '06.

I found it boring and offensive to the Maya."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ruined\\" expectations..","review":"Wow. All the hype..a Stephen King recomendation..how could you go wrong? But I have to say that I was really disappointed with this book. I won't give away any of the story other than..can you say \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\"? Just plain silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me?","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but I kept asking myself: \\"why don't they just burn the damn vine and get the hell out of there?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I waste my time?","review":"I started the book optimistic thanks to Stephen King but sadly I was disappointed! The characters made vital mistakes all along the way and there was never any doubt that they were trapped but I was waiting for more than just a ridiculous vine to be the enemy. I finished the book and I am still hoping for more. I lost interest immediatly but I am the type of person that has to finish a book once I start it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but distracting","review":"This was a decent little book marred by a few unfortunate choices by the author.The author has chosen to write a book about personal relationships in a confined and futile space, which works well enough if you only read it as that. However thats not whats it sold as, not what you expect reading it and not how the book itself sets it up.It creates an environment that cries out for more of a story and leaves you scratching your head: with plot holes, character issues, inconsistenties and crying why?Why? When the setting could just as easily have been something mundane like Fell down a Well or Trapped in a Mine, in which case you wouldnt spend the book going \\"Hmmm why didnt they try that or do this or explore that?????\\" and with the vague feeling that there should have been more ploting and something more should have happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"ruine","review":"\\"The Ruins\\" is cheap and sadistic storytelling with a downward trajectory of a narrative that just dips lower and lower. As a reader, even if you're not rooting for an outright happy ending, on some level you hope to see some kind of curveball thrown at you, and to witness a glimmer of hope that the situation is not as hopeless as it seems. The Ruins is the horror equivalent of the worst type of contemporary fiction, meant to do nothing much more than bum you out -- if Smith was put in charge of writing \\"Star Wars\\", Luke, Leia and Han would have been crushed in the garbage compactor on the Death Star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scott Smith Has Lost It","review":"Scott Smith's 1st novel, \\"A Simple Plan\\" was one of my all-time favorites, and I was anxious to read his latest book. What a disappointment! I quit reading when i had finished less than half of the book, and feel I should have quit long before that.The story, and the characters are disgusting and boring. I do have to say, however, that Mr. Smith has not lost his ability to write great prose, I just wish he had put that ability to better use than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruins","review":"Probably one of the worst books I ever read, to compare it to Jaws is a travesty and very misleading. It's not very suspenseful, and the characters are so stereotypical and stupid, you kind of hope they will all die. The protagonist is a man-eating plant, that they could have defeated just by setting the hill on fire. Would have been much better if the Mayan's who had them surrounded ate them instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have been RUINED by this Stupid book!","review":"I am \\"Horrified\\" that anyone would find this book a \\"Great Read.\\" The story was non-suspenseful, ho hum and extremely boring. The author neither made you care for the People in the book or want them to live in fact , I often found myself wanting them to die off! The women were stupid and brainless and the men were either corny,horny or dumber then mud. If you want a fantastic book in the Simular type of concept, Read Jeff Longs sensational BOOK, The Descent (Not the movie). This is a page tuner from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a pointless, unenjoyable, waste of time","review":"I took a chance based on Stephen King's review (professional courtesy? lost poker bet?) It started out with potential in the first chapter or two and it soon takes a nosedive. You learn all you'll ever learn about the characters and the \\"horror\\" they face (which is not scary) within the first couple chapters. The characters stagnate and are so stupid (taking tequila and no water for a trek in the rainforest) and annyoing (obsessing over whether the hotel maid has stolen my watch while facing a killer vine) I was rooting for the vine. The scenarios I started to come up with out of boredom (they kill the vine with the tequila) were more entertaining than waiting for something to happen only to find out that nothing does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Ruined","review":"Its funny all the people who read this book, and hated it. Whats even more funny is all the people who loved it, hah!I didn't know much about the book, other that the title and the reviews, and I had (and still haven't) ever really read a \\"horror\\" novel before, so I decided to give it a try.The only thing good about this book, was the marketing. I wonder if King and Scott Smith have the same publishing company, how can anyone say this \\"It works well enough, to be the book most people will be talking about this summer.\\" Yeh they'll be talking about what a giant peice of junk this book was. I feel like the vine, ooh, a vine, how scary, was reaching off the page and sucking the life out of me. I can't believe I finished this book.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm out of step here...","review":"but this book underwhelmed me. The amount of suspended disbelief that it takes to make it through all 319 pages is immeasurable. I was never drawn in, never felt empathy for the characters, never felt as it this was \\"Jaws\\" in the jungle. Wait for the library, or the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not bother","review":"I, like many people, was a big fan of Scott Smith's book, A Simple Plan. What set it apart from others in the genre was a well thought out plot with twists and turns you did not see coming. Unfortunately the same is not true of The Ruins. As engrossing as A Simple Plan's plot was, this one is just as flat out boring. I saw the end coming a third into the book but kept kidding myself that because it was Scott Smith something big would happen. Needless to say - it never did. I would rank this as mediocre in the cheap horror genre at best. I have not been this disappointed in a novel in several years. I hope Smith's next novel is better than this but am not sure I would read it to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected . . .","review":"Scott Smith gathered a great deal of attention with his genius thriller \\"A Simple Plan,\\" which is still one of my favorite books ever, but seems to fall short with this one. Maybe it was because I was expecting something similar to his first book, but I really think he took a wrong turn somewhere with this novel. This book has all the qualities of a low budget, B-Rated horror flick and wasted a lot of paper putting them shamefully into action. Besides the lack of character depth, and rambling pages of the characters trying to treat their rotting cuts and broken limbs, the \\"evil\\" monster stalking the young men and women does nothing but bring cartoonish images in my head of \\"The Little Shop of Horrors.\\" Don't waste your time with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"King mislead me!","review":"I had just finished reading King's Lisey's Story and thought it was great, couldn't put it down. So when I noticed he had wrote a review about the Ruins I thought great this will be a good one too. King said \\"the Ruins is going to be America's literary shock-show this summer, doing for vacations in Mexico what Jaws...\\" Oh Paleeze!\\" It reminded me of a teenage horror movie. The kind where it's so dumb you just have to keep watching just to mock it. I didn't expect an intellectual story, I'm used to the fantasy and suspense that King offers so I don't mind if a story is \\"unrealistic\\" but it wasn't even scary. Believe me I won't think twice about watering my Creeping Charlie. Don't waste your money. If you feel compelled to read it just out of curiosity, like a train wreck, check it out at the library. I did and thank goodness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I enjoyed the spare trajectory of his first book, A SIMPLE PLAN, and hoped for more in this one. Instead we get a very busy, rambling, noisy story full of long, tedious memories from the protagonists, and an utterly improbable story about acid-filled vines that apparently have consciousness. The story line is cluttered with unnecessary sex scenes and a seeming fascination by the author for bodily functions, for we have to know when anyone has to \\"go\\" and be treated to details of its passing. Happily, one can skip entire pages of reverie to return to the story line, if you get hooked and have to know how it ends. Boring and contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be honest....pretty bad","review":"Maybe I am missing some subtlety, and I will admit I am not a big reader of the horror genre, but this was just pretty bad on a variety of levels. I would hate for horor fans to hold this up as a masterpiece of the genre as that would just be sad.This is horribly repetitive stuff.The repetition of some events designed to build suspense I would think in a failed attempt to make this exciting somehow. There are a few moments where the reader can see that the author was building to a big 'reveal' that just wasn't interesting or scary. It is a mishmash of borrowed plots (borrowed from pretty silly sources sadly) told in an indifferent narrative style that overshadowed by the plots ridiculousness.As it is essentially a B grade monster horror movie story (a la The Blob, or Tremors (remember that one?)) this will probably make a passable short (please God make it short) popcorn movie....I just pity the actor who has to try and make a character out of what's on the page here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book...","review":"I was hooked by the title and the premise - Spooky ancient ruins in the Yucatan penninsula, but then I read the book...there aren't even any ruins to speak of, just the IDEA of ruins...the book was reasonable, building some tension, but once you figure out what is going on, it's like, huh? Are you serious? At that point you kind of have to finish the book, just out of curiosity, hoping that maybe, just maybe, some new twist or nemesis is going to enter the picture, but alas, it just keep going, and going, and then it ends. Sorry Scott Smith, you are no Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money","review":"I bought this book because I like thrillers, but this was one of the most excruciatingly bad books I have ever read. The plot was as slow as molasses, the characters one dimensional, and the sentence construction choppy. I hated everything about this book, but most of all, the two women characters who apparently were nothing more than airheads in crisis. I kept thinking the book would get better, but never did. Finally toward the end of the book, I scanned it very quickly just to get through it to see how it was going to end. I don't think I ever felt this way about a book before."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding.","review":"Granted, I didnt read all of the reviews, but am I the only one who realized that this book is merely a reworking (and a poor one, at that) of The Beach? Its the SAME STORY--only with half the substance and the addition of a ridiculous plot element. Killer vines that can mimic sounds and smells?? Riiiight. I continued to read only because I wanted to see how Smith was going to explain the vines---what they were, how they'd come into existence, what motivated them to turn \\"evil\\" and how the Mayans played into it all. And not ONE of those questions was answered. If you're considering reading The Ruins because you find the premise to be compelling, check out The Beach. It was amazing--I could not put it down and continued to think about it days after I'd finished. Not the case with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book starts out interesting but soon becomes irritatingly repetative.

I can't believe Stephen King had such high praises for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST.BOOK.EVER.","review":"Even though I looked up the book on here before I bought it, I should have given it a second thought. It had nothing but positive reviews, 4 and 5 stars. But this had to be the single most appallingly unpleasant book I've read in a long time.The story starts bleakly enough but it only gets worse. A little warning that it's the most violent and disgustingly graphic would have been nice as well. And the ending?! Can we even call it that? At least American Psycho left me with something to ponder about after I slaved through all that depravity."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books I've ever read","review":"Hey Scott Smith, give me my money back.....this was truely one of the dumbest \\"horror\\" books out there....take the personality out of the flora from Little Shop of Horrors, and you end up with this....life is too short, don't spend it reading this book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ruined alright","review":"Two words... choose death.I bought this disaster of a book because of all the glowing reviews, but I have to say that it does not live up to it's press.This is the Blair Witch project in Mexico instead of the woods. There is no real suspense here beyond how and when these characters will die... and none of them are terribly sympathetic, so I couldn't bring myself to care. I slogged through the entire thing hoping there would be some spectacular pay off at the end - there wasn't - and found myself wishing I'd skipped the whole thing and had a root canal instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointing","review":"Very slow moving until about 2/3rds of the way through. I only finished it because I wanted to know what happened at the end. For those of you that read it, I thought the end was a missed opportunity. When the Greeks were coming toward the hill calling their names, 'they' should have answered from the top of the hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome but predictable","review":"You cannot spend half the book trying to kill someone, to finally do it with no surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal, Drear, Disappointing","review":"Being all set for a great Stephen K. type thriller, I jumped into this book with great expectations,(afterall, the KING said it was great). Wow, was I disappointed. It went on and on with no redeeming qualities, and no believeable horror. I read it to the end just to see how this mess would play out and was further disappointed. I don't think it would have even made a good short story. Usually when I'm in the middle of a book I find myself looking forward to getting back to it. This one waited like a pile of dirty dishes. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prone to Depression?","review":"There can be little doubt that Smith is a fine writer. The introspective digressions of the various principal characters in Ruins, coupled with the author's intelligently spaced revelations of their pasts provide a very literary underpinning of this tale of horror and suspense. But, for a reader who slips easily into depression my recommendation is to put this one back on the shelves and look for something a bit more traditional in the science fiction genre. I had to drink Starbucks three days in a row after finishing this book, to reestablish my faith in the possibility of a happy future. I suppose, in a way, this is a compliment to the author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ruined my vacation!","review":"I picked this book to read for the times in my vacation when I am relaxing by the beach and pool coz it was recommended by Stephen King as the horror book for the new century. Well, I loved my vacation except for one thing and that is...this book! I've been reading horror novels since I was 12 and now I'm let's just say past 35. It felt like the author is trying to write a book hoping it'll be made into an awful 2-star movie in the sci-fi channel. Too simple. Too predictable. Too boring. Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying, grotesque, morbid, and depressing","review":"Not so much scary as horrifying, grotesque, morbid, and depressing. If your idea of a good read is \\"watching\\" people trapped in a horrifying situation that they can't escape from suffer, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Completely engrossing and far-fetched horror story. A simple plot so probably wouldn't make a good book report but the implausibilities are smoothed over by expert storytelling about the unexpected. Perfect summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Awful","review":"This is the worst bit of trash I have ever read. Do not waste your time or money. I really liked \\"A Simple Plan\\" and looked forward to reading this book. I was deeply disappointed as the plot is completely asinine. Not only is the title misleading, but the reader is shocked as the true scope of the story slowly comes into view-- how is it possible that someone could have thought that this was a good idea? Were the author and/or editor and/or publisher on drugs, or simply blind to the sheer stupidity of the idea? The few large words in it are repeated over and over. \\"Implacable\\" and \\"inexplicable\\" are used repeatedly-which would be my words to describe this nonsensical novel. The characterizations are trivial and predictable. One gets the feeling the author was writing this not to tell a story but to pitch a TV movie. Absolutely wretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is one of the lamest books I have read in years. It was a waste of money and my time. The story is not scary, but laughable. The ending was predictiable. With so many other books out there - do yourself a favor and don't waste your time reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but truly disappointing","review":"One word review: Ew.Multi word review: I went in thinking adventure & mystery, but it is pure horror. If you LOVE the horror genre then go for it, but I was just grossed out and profoundly disappointed in The Ruins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little Happens","review":"Interesting premise but ultimately a boring story. It's just one damn thing after another for the gringo tourists and then no real payoff at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Thriller","review":"Scott Smith's first book, A Simple Plan, was excellent and kept the reader guessing about what would happen next. It used human nature and temptations to great effect to make the reader believe and relate to how people's actions can lead to such catastrophic consequences.In The Ruins, all of that is missing. The action does not involve the reader. I was actually bored through much of it. The story was absolutely unbelievable and made no sense, and seemed only an effort to shock the reader with gory details."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only 'Ruins\\" Was The Book Itself","review":"Six college kids on break in Cancun meet and go west into the jungles of the central Yucatan. That's the entire plot and it all happens within the first 20 pages. The remaining 335 pages is constant repetition by the author in an attempt to fill out the space between the front and back covers. You need 2 hands to count the number of times the writer tells how these kids do the same walk up and down a hill in Mexico. They enter a tent, they exit a tent, they enter, exit, enter,......well, you get the picture. Even the characters thoughts are retold so often you want to scream \\"enough is enough already\\". Toss in a seemingly alive plant and still you couldn't save this fiasco. The ending, although abrupt and final, is irrelevant. The entire read was a big joke.I'll stick with Stephen King and Dean Koontz thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"I really enjoyed A Simple Plan so I was looking forward to reading Scott Smith's new book. The negative reviews say it all unfortunately -- not particulary scary, the characters are not particularly well-developed or interesting and there's certainly not much at all about the Mayans. I keep reading, hoping against hope, that there would be some twist to make the book more interesting and that the book would not end in the obvious way that became more and more inevitable as the story plodded on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruins","review":"Didn't thrill me...I was able to read, then skip chapters, and I could still figure out what happened in between. Needless to say..\\"foliage\\" didn't seem too horrifying for me. The story was centered around a group of college kids and I felt like I was reading something like \\"I know what you did last summer\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed....","review":"I think I need to go back and look at Stephen King's comments on this book, his tag line which is used to promote this book leaves me wondering what the heck he was thinking. BTW, I am a huge King fan.The story was far more repulsive than chill inducing. To me this title of this book should have been \\"My Life as a Plant\\" by Michael Myers.I would have given it another star if they would have at least did a back story on the plant and its origins. The pychological drama that unfolds between the college kids seemed thin to me. As young adults most of do and say idiotic things, wow, what a surprise.Keep browsing, there are better reads out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was rooting for the vines!","review":"This is the worst book I experienced in 2006. I listened to the audio book and stuck with it in hopes for a good ending. Nope.The mixed reviews I have seen on this book are the only interesting thing to come out of it; now I have one less thing in common with Steven King."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time","review":"Well,there's a few hours of my life that I'll never get back.I'm stubborn, so I read it to the end. A total waste of time.A Perfect Plan followed by another disappointment, The Ruins. I've had enough, I'll not bother to read anything else by Scott Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody shoot me for bothering to pick up this book.","review":"THIS BOOK IS MUCH LONGER THAN IT SHOULD BE. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THE LATER REVIEWS ON THIS BOOK. LAME.LONG.DULL.GLAD IT WAS A LIBRARY BOOK AND NOT PURCHASED, WOULD HAVE BEEN A WASTE OF HARD EARNED CASH. WANT SOMETHING GOOD TO READ, GET THE NEW BOOK BY PRESTON AND CHILD Book of the Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing drivel","review":"This book way over-promises on horror: it's tedious tale of a bunch of people with no personalities at all in a death struggle with.... Well, I won't give it away, but let's just say, haunted kitchen cabinets have been scarier. The only possible reason for reading this book is that you hate women, and enjoy stories in which they're all portrayed as shallow, weak, self-centered and dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruins","review":"The worst book I have ever read--I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 star at best","review":"It sounded like a good book but don't be deceived. Imagine me waving my hands trying to dissuade you from getting this book, few will listen and will pay the price....The writing doesn't really draw you in. It is like the difference between a radio verses stereo. You read and understand but it doesn't really get you to the place where you are experiencing the horror.The characters were unbelievably shallow and in no way likable. Certainly no one I would like to spend several days or even hours with (neither was this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my time","review":"If you like dialogue don't bother. There really wasn't any until the end when they were all getting killed. HOnestly this book seemed like it was written to be made into a horror movie. I kept reading (my fault) hoping it would get better. It didn't. The end was such a huge disapointment. Really awful book. I can't imagine anyone liking this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and silly","review":"Scott Smith's A Simple Plan was and is one of my favorite books-fantastic. I wondered whether he ever wrote another. When I saw this I had to buy it and start it right away. For the first 100 pages I thought Smith had done it again, unfortunately the hundreds of pages after were slow, drawn out, and frankly, just silly. I know in horror you must sometimes suspend judgment and reality, but this was too much, and not at all scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible letdown","review":"I don't understand what the fuss is about this book or the author. I found it ham-fisted, with crayon-drawn characters whom I could not muster a whiff of care about. The \\"villian\\" in this story is also crudely and ineptly executed, and the plot itself has too many holes that trucks could be driven through.I was bored halfway through, never in the least bit terrified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Young And The Restless Meets Little Shop Of Horrors","review":"For such a slow and calculated buildup, I expected a metric-ton more payoff than Mr. Smith gave me. Whiny, shallow characters complain for hundreds of pages in this completely laughable scenerio. The actual writing itself is not bad, but all manner of common sense for these characters gets thrown out the window. Frustrating, overly long, and ultimately, a waste of time. The predictable ending didn't help, either. This would have been an interesting short story, but certainly not a full length novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The impossible to kill kudzu in my back yard is scarier","review":"I will not beat a dead horse, since I agree with the other negative reviews.Any book where you hope all the characters die because they are so whiny and unappealing is not worth more than 2 stars. I now have a rule of thumb. I will not buy any book for which Stephen King writes a positive blurb. King is (or was til his last couple of books) one of my favorite writers, but this is the umpteenth time I've read a book he has positively blurbed. These books have been at best mediocre, and mostly have stunk. This one stunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdity Trumps Horror","review":"The biggest mystery about The Ruins is why Stephen King waxed on about it being a great summer beach read. There is little mystery here and the absurd premise spawns incredulity rather than horror.Wow! Plants that can imitate cell phones, people's voices, all while plotting the demise of anyone who wanders on to their killing hill.The Mayans, living nearby, have solved the problme of the plants invading further territory by salting the ground around the hill. So, a plant endowed with supernatural powers is defeated by a ring of Morton's.The faceless Mayans remain ushers in the this theatre of the absurd, making sure that no one leaves the hill where the plants mimic, invade and eventually conquer the hapless characters in this long awaited, but vastly disappointing second novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined!","review":"Scott Smith does a decent job of setting-up the premise and creating some palpable suspense. However, the novel is ruined by having not one likable character. These punk kids are all trapped on this mysterious Mexican hill in the middle of nowhere and home to some man-eating vines, and quite frankly, you don't really care what happens to them. The book goes nowhere, full of red-herrings, and some mildly interesting details (like the second-mind shaft or the story of the archaeologists) that never lead to anything. The storyline becomes very repetative and is only good for a few laughs during the well-written gross-out sections. Otherwise, Smith's novel is a huge disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a short story...","review":"Sorry, but I have to weigh in on the side of the disappointed. There was nothing \\"horrifying\\" about this novel, other than its length. Paragraph after paragraph of mind-numbing narrative, when simplicity would have had much greater impact. So disappointing because Mr. Smith's \\"A Simple Plan\\" was exactly that--a great story, plainly told. \\"The Ruins\\" should have been edited by about 95% and published as a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Top 10 List...","review":"... of the most terrible books I've ever read. I picked it up hoping for a quick summer beach read - the longest 300 pages later, I pushed myself to finish it just to see if indeed it could really end as horribly as it began. It did, and it is only in this one respect that the book did not disappoint my expectations. In short -- way too long, the characters are boring, and the writing is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooooo tedious","review":"a decent short story that has been dragged into a too long, dragged out novel. i made the mistake of buying it on cd for a long car trip, and found that not only is the story unbearably tedious, but the reader's monotone unbearable. awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but Gotta Be Honest","review":"I pre-ordered this book based on a couple of factors: #1 I LOVED A Simple Plan and was SO excited to see Scott Smith had FINALLY written another one; and #2 I also LOVE Stephen King and was pleased that he gave it a good review. Couldn't wait to jump in! Ugh, it was SUCH a huge disappointment I'm afraid to say. It may've kept me glued during the first phase of their confrontation with the man-eating vine, but it got way too tedious, gruesome and just plain boring. Hate to be so disappointed but it happens. I'll think twice before purchasing his next one, not at all what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Stupid plot, stupid dialogue. Is this a high school creative writing project? A total waste of time and paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining read, but...","review":"I agree with some of the previous reviewers - it's a real page-turner, but definitely a bit anticlimactic. I was annoyed with how the story wrapped up. No explanation or satisfaction at all related to the absurdity of the situation..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Simple Book","review":"Early on, I knew where all the plot trails had to end up. Along the way, equally predictable horror and gore; still, Smith's characters were interesting and complex, and therefore enough to keep me reading till the end.My $.02: a fine writer harnessed to a lame premise. Smith is a brilliant observer of humans in extremis, but horror is not his genre; the peril his characters face should be real, and of their own making -- not Audrey II.I'm sure a decent scary movie is on the boards right now; in fact, this story should have gone right to script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ten years for this?","review":"I read The Ruins with great anticipation following Stephen King's recommendation and all I can say is what a letdown.The journey of innocents into the heart of darkness echoes Blair Witch meeting Lost with a soupcon of Little Shop of Horrors, with a hill substituting for the shop.I wanted to reach into the text and throttle the characters for being so stupid, which I guess is a necessary precondition for horror. The source of the horror is so silly that it snaps any willing suspension of disbelief.If you want to read a good book about a steady downward spiral, then read Six Bad Things by Charlie Huston,a far better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and cheap scare tactics...","review":"This is the first review I have ever posted on Amazon, and I am compelled to do so because of the rot this novel is. It is basically one cheap and disgusting act after another - the author trying to one-up himself over and over and over again. Talk about being hit in the head repeatedly with the proverbial frying pan!!! There is no back story and no context to the events that occur in \\"The Ruins\\". I felt totally manipulated by each event - each more disgusting and unpalatable than the event before it. After a particularly detailed and pointless surgical procedure on one of the characters, Pablo, I began to skip ahead - and finally determined that I would not waste one more second of time on this book. I cannot believe Stephen King, an author whom I adore, recommended this book. There is no subtlety or nuance to the book. It is totally pointless, unless the point is to see if the author can out-gross himself. I would give this book ZERO stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll Find This Book Hard To Read!!","review":"This book is very hard to read because your eyes will have rolled up so far into your head you won't be able to see anyomre.I'm certainly willing to admit that it is a page turner and I found the early scenes in the mine to be rather chilling, but once you find out what the actual menace is, and what it is able to do, you'll want to kill yourself for getting that far. It's really no wonder that Stephen King enjoyed this book, since it's basically his \\"The Raft\\" stretched out to a ridiculous length. Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious book","review":"This was the most tedious and predictable book I have EVER read. Bought it because Stephen King said it was good. It was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great read!!!","review":"Scott Smith's \\"Simple Plan\\" was a really knockout hard to put down book, but \\"The Ruins\\" really falls short of his talents. It started out very good and interesting but as I kept reading it I expected to really get into it. It did not happen!!! Plain and simple it was boring and really an unrealistic story.Definetly not worth wasting your time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE ARE THE EDITORS?","review":"A compelling premise when combined with stereotypical, static characters results in a 319-page interminable read. Sadly, I find almost every book lately is an overblown short story. If memory serves Stephen King already did a similar tale with his usual panache, perhaps explaining his favorable review. See if you don't agree this book should have been trimmed by half, thereby ramping up the tension and reader enjoyment, as well as freeing time better spent on more deserving books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing story. Two dimensional characters that I really didn't care about. Descriptions of what the \\"creature\\" does to the hapless adventurers is creepy, edge-of-your-seat squirming fun but I felt there was no substance to the story. This becomes just another teenagers at the lake being picked-off one-by-one cliche.This could have been an excellent sci-fi or paranormal story but instead, I'm disappointed that I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Danger Ahead!","review":"Don't let yourself get sucked into this book; it will ensnare you and you'll regret it. This book is pure horror, without any redeeming value or payoff. I picked up this book thinking that it was a mystery or thriller, but it does not have the basic, essential elements of either of those genres. The writing is exceedingly clever and will keep the pages flying, but the emptiness at its core left me feeling depleted and depressed. Maybe fans of fantasy/horror/science fiction will like this book, but for me, it was a waste of a perfectly good afternoon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa! What a steaming pile this thing is.","review":"I can't believe Stephen King endorsed this book, let alone say it is the best horror of the new century. This is one of the absolute worst books I have ever read, and I read a lot. I am actually shocked this got published. It really feels like a rough sketch of a book. Almost like the author was attempting to outline the story to sell it, albeit in very long form, and then intended to add things later and then never did. These are important things, like character development and plot. This book has only vague sketches of either. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it in the garbage.","review":"I threw it in the garbage...that's how bad this book is. I didn't want to be responsible for anyone being exposed to this boring, ridiculous book.The Ruins misses the mark on all counts: (1)Undeveloped characters who you can't keep straight in the beginning and don't care about in the end. (2)Terror??? Where??? Maybe for a pre-teen. Truthfully, that's what I kept thinking, \\"This must have a pre-teen audience.\\" Really, the people who give this story decent reviews HAVE to be children. That's the only logical conclusion I can come to. (3) Some people have said that this book provides a look at humanity. Oh, come on! If that was the attempt, it failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"Very disappointing. A Simple Plan was a great movie. It seems to me this book was written to become a bad movie. Little imagination went into creating the plant, and the setting naturally offers a rich world of history and culture that could have lifted this book a little.Life is short, I'm sorry I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Shop of Horrors","review":"This book is just plain worthless. No intelligence at all when a plant outsmarts the human race.I have seen the vine eats human trick in \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\", funny, musical. This book is the same thing, but the author has no sense of humor;; maybe. The serious parts are actually quite amusing. I could see Tarantino directing this film as an over the top horror spoof in hombrage to the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reluctant Read","review":"This book was promising at first, then became tedious in the middle, and slowly deteriorated at the end. I am not a big fan of science-fiction and when I found what course this story was taking, I still had to see it through to the bitter end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God It's Over","review":"This is a terrible book... it's long winded and boring. The author makes you hate the characters so much that you could care less if they live or die. It had an ok start but things went down hill fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ruins is a Ruin","review":"\\"The Ruins\\" is wordy, too long, too sadistic, too gory, and too depressing. Other than that, it is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund","review":"I cannot get the time back that was wasted trying to read this drawn out go nowhere book, but I should be able to get my money back. I would feel guilty trying to sell it for a quater at a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money....","review":"Please don't waste your money on this book. There are so many others out there that are worth reading - this one isn't. The characters have no depth, the story quickly becomes predictable, and it has the overall feeling of being written for a high school project. If I could give less than 1 star, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"If you find this story tedious and boring in the beginning, don't waste additional time reading on. It doesn't get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a huge disappointment!","review":"This novel was hyped up soo much in the press and I was really anxious to read it but I was shocked at how little fright I got from it.Maybe I'm a hardened horror fan, but I found this to be neither thrilling nor horrifying. When I started the book, I had no idea what the \\"horror\\" or monster in question was. When I found out, I really tried to work with it, conceptually, but eventually, I was just bored and skipped to the end - which gave me a little satisfaction. But, I wouldn't recommend this book at all to anyone who is interested in a good horror book. You will be bored, not frightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is one book that did not deliver what was promised on the inside flap. There is not much true suspense and, most of the time the story moves much too slowly. I expected at least one \\"Ah-hah\\" moment when things are brought together to give some meaning to the plot, but this doesn't happen.The characterization is good, but the book's ending was very disappointing. Overall, I would advise that you skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"beyond bad - dont buy!","review":"The ruins is about tourists, visiting cancun, that are looking for the brother of one of them on the island. The brother is supposingly with archeologists digging out ruins. In the end - which there is not much more to this book - they get all eaten by a killer vine. Very funny also Mayans are included that basically watch them die and do nothing else in that book! I would say this is a book for 12 year olds that wanna read something \\"real scary\\". Ruins are nowhere. What a joke - I cannot believe somebody would bother writing a story like that and someone is actually publishing it. And I wouldnt bother reading but my bookclub... : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time!!","review":"I, like many of the reviewers, only kept reading this book to find out what happened in the end, and was so disappointed/depressed by the ending I'll probably never read another Scott Smith book again! What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know Stephen King and you're no Stephen King","review":"I will never get back the night I spent reading this novel. The most ridiculous storyline--unbelievable, ludicrous, pick any other synonym for silly-beyond-words. How anyone could believe this storyline and be frightened is something I can't comprehend. At some points, it is truly laughable; maybe that's why Ben Stiller has optioned the novel. I usually agree with Publishers' Weekly,but don't waste your time with this silly stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Simple Disappointment!","review":"I absolutely loved \\"A Simple Plan\\". It kept you quessing the whole time. The Ruins was not even close. It was far-fetched with very little character development; and in fact I really didn't care what happened to them. I just wanted to put them out of their misery, and for the book to be over! Scott took 12 years off, so I think he could have come up with a more plausable novel. This just dragged on and on with ridiculous situation after ridiculous situation. Save your money on this one. Re-read \\"A Simple Plan\\" or read Koontz,'s \\"Velocity\\" for more enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complex and well written, yet about nothing","review":"Sheesh, was this a disappointment. I hate to bag on a talented writer...but this one would never have made it, had it not been written by a guy with a track record. If you've read the other reviews, folks have already talked about one of the main weaknesses of the book, but let me put it in this spoiler free way: Mr. Smith ran out of gas. He spent roughly 450 pages setting up the story, setting, and most especially the \\"baddie\\", and then wraps it up in a swift 20 pages or so. I only finished it to see how he would pull it off, and it was a cheap, lame ending like you see in terrible, direct to DVD horror movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skilful writing - unoriginal story","review":"WARNING: Possible spoiler (but it might save you $$)What you have here is your basic dead teenager formula: start with five beautiful 20-somethings, trap them in a secluded location, sprinkle in man-eating vines, then start slowly killing them off. When they're all dead you've reached the end of the book. No wonder Stephen King liked it - he's followed this template in a dozen short stories.As far as the title goes, forget it. There are no ruins. My guess is that the published knew they wouldn't sell as many books if they called it \\"Killer Sentient Mexican Vines,\\" which would have been more appropriate.The two stars are for the author's craft in telling the story: Good pacing and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I placed three orders for the photo frame coasters in a wood stand ( Total of 35 ). The packaging they came in was dirty as if they were left on a shelf for months. After opening them, the sides of most of the coasters were loose. I could have glued them back together, but when you are purchasing something you shouldn't have to fix them yourself. I was very disappointed not only with the product, but also with the response from Amazon. The replacement sets that I received were just as bad. I questioned about quality control and the response was that sometimes things are good and sometimes bad. Not a kind of response from such a large company that you would expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Not very good quality...1. They are painted unevenly, so the \\"rectangle\\" in the center is anything but. These centers are crooked and lopsided on pratically every coaster in my set of 8.2. The slot for the photos is very large, allowing them to shift around and even fall out of the coaster.3. The pieces glued to the underside fall off after a couple of months of use.Something to watch out for in all glass coasters - we didn't anticipate this problem:4. Place a cool glass on one of these coasters, and the condensation forms a seal with the smooth glass, which causes the coaster to stick to the glass when lifted, and increases the odds that the coaster will fall and break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product for the price","review":"The product was good for the price. I had ordered 7 sets. Each set was sent in a separate box! I received 7 boxes!! That was quite a waste.

I don't care for these at all. They are cheaply made- the pics slide into a metal piece on the back. Mine arrived chipped and scratched.

But I'm glad I did! I think they're awesome for the price. I gave them as a Christmas gift to a friend and put some pictures in them. They were a hit! Yes, it's a little difficult to get the pictures in and out - but who cares since the price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T SET YOUR DRINK ON THE TABLE!!","review":"\\"Don't set your drink on that table!!\\" That's what my mom is always screaming at me. You think she'd learn to stay out of the basement. After all, that's my domain and if she doesn't like my mess she doesn't have to look at it! I'm almost 30 years old, you think she could cut me some slack.But until mom gives me a little more space, I have to obey her rules. After all, it's her way or the highway, and I wouldn't have time to work on my music and art if I were living under a bridge. So I picked up these coasters, and they really do the trick. They are so functional that it blows my mind. I just sit one on the table, and then I can sit my drink right on top of the thing and not worry about leaving rings on the wood. It's amazing!! And these things are easy on the eyes, too. As an artist, I can really appreciate that."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality unlike previous orders","review":"I ordred again from the same supplier. Some were good some were mis-shapen but Amazon made that right.However now I re-order and thin cheap coasters arrive. No warning of this.Very poor from a seller I will not deal with again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diminishing quality","review":"I purchased an inexpensive set like this (~8) years ago and it has held up to abuse. This set appears exactly the same from the photos but significant details are missing. The glass is 1/2 as thick as the original; therefore, I doubt these will last nearly as long as the previous set. More importantly the metal picture keeps (the base that holds the picture in place) have been discontinued for a heavy card stock and the water resistant picture covers are no longer included. I suspect this will be a obvious design flaw if you foresee condensation in your future.Admittedly pessimistic, I will likely pursue the slightly more expensive options on this site in the event these coasters fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Present","review":"Put photos in a few sets of these and gave them out as christmas presents.

Have seen them using them at their house - been going on 2 years now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coasters but cheap stand","review":"I bought 2 sets of these coasters for mother's day, one for my mother and one for my mother in law. The coasters themselves are very nice. Thick heavy and of good quality. But the wood stands that are included are a piece of crap! When I opened up the package, the two sides of the stand were completely disconnected from the bottom piece on one set and on the other set one of the sides had come off. Next time I will buy in the store..."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"these coasters seemed nice until i started looking at them closely. there's fingerprints underneath the glass on 3 out of 4. super disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift !","review":"I received a set of these coasters for a Christmas gift, I was so pleased I bought a set to give as a gift. What a great way to give pictures of the family or friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design and quality","review":"5 seconds after removing these from the box I have already decided they're never going on my coffee table. First, the \\"wood\\" holder is badly chipped and there are bits of black paint all over the coasters. But worse, the coasters themselves (which are tools meant to protect the finish of a table, if I'm not mistaken) have a metal backing with a fairly sharp edge underneath where the photo goes. It doesn't take a genius to recognize that within a few days of regular use that metal edge would cause all sorts of damage to a table much worse than a ring of moisture ever would, despite the tiny rubber feet on the bottom. As a test I found that I was easily able to shave the finish off a corner of an old table with no effort at all. Glad I only paid $10 since I'm sure I'll never get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't impressed","review":"My sister-in-law had bought something similar to this as gifts for Christmas. I thought they were really cute and wanted to get some for my step-brother. These, however, were disappointing. The picture size is very small, and the translucent paint was chipped on some of the coasters. They seem to be very cheaply made. My advice - look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"This product came in very rough condition. The coasters were enclosed in plastic that looked like it had been rolled around in a box filled with sand. The surface's of the packages were scratched and scuffed. One cannot use these to give as a gift. When the package is opened you will find that the box is too big for the coasters and is very poorly made. The box is just cheap press board glued together. Not even stapled. At least one of the coasters wasn't even square. I haven't looked at all of them yet but won't be surprised to find more unusable ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these!","review":"I would give these 0 stars if I could.It is pretty difficult to get the photos in & out of these and if you drop them or hit them together at all, the sides will chip and due to the nature of the glass, fixes are easily seen.I would not recommend these for a house with children or where things get dropped at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An ingenious twist on a legend","review":"The Golden Vine is a wonderfully written and beautifully painted book. At first glance, I was suprised at just how thick the novel is, but did not notice it by the time I had finished reading it the same day it arrived on my door step!Jai Sen's imagination is out of this world. The use of gold ink throughout the story is simply amazing. The artwork is nothing seen in todays realm of comics in the U.S. The details are microscopic and the panoramic pages simply flow perfectly from page to page. Words cannot describe how much I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Golden Vine. I picked up Garlands of Moonlight after all the buzz it received from winning the Xeric award and was pleasantly suprised by the story. The Golden Vine blows Garlands out of the water. For anybody who loves twists on past stories, japanese animation, comics, or just a great book, give The Golden Vine a browse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"Great dealer - arrived as promised in as good of condition as a paperback as old as this one could have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo.","review":"This book is an amazing accomplishment. It took me a few weeks to read, not necessarily because it's long, but because it's packed full of description and mystery, and has the ability to absolutely transport the reader to another time and place. In this case, it's the English village of Wigan, a dank coalmining town on the outskirts of London in the year 1872.We're introduced to the village and the main characters through the malarial eyes of a misfit named Blair, who although he was born in Wigan, is viewed as an outsider. He is mocked and scorned at every turn. Through keen intelligence and persistence, he solves the mysteries on an equal footing with the reader, and in the end, I was left completely satisfied.I highly, highly recommend this book, particularly for readers who enjoy crime mysteries but also for those who like a good, well-written and well-researched period piece.From the author of \\"I'm Living Your Dream Life,\\" and \\"The Things I Wish I'd Said,\\" McKenna Publishing Group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rose by MC Smith","review":"I have given this book 5 stars...I would give it ten stars if I could. An intense look at coal mining in England during the 1800s, this is a unique love story that is full of twists and turns. An excellent book..highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but for the ending","review":"The book is definitely Smith's best. Rich detail of a period of time and location not much known to me -- on top of a great mystery -- made the story that much more enjoyable. I hope Smith will consider writing a book about the exploits of the hero in Africa; there were some hints of some possible strong stories in this book. Unforunately, the ending was not up to the quality of the rest of the book, but a great read otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a so-so book","review":"Since there is no half, I would rate this 2-1/2. The only thing I like about this book is suspense and Blair's character as a smart aleck and his perservance. What I don't like about this book is that it is a slow page-turner especially from the beginning to halfway thru probably because I'm ignorant about the mine stuff. In a small way, I felt like I was reading a literature (I have nothing against literature) or stuff I couldn't comprehend or what's it all about. Four Arkady Renko novels (Gorky Park to Havana Bay) that I have read are a lot better read than this book. I was disappointed this one was not as interested as I thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arkady Redux","review":"Good writing can't hide the fact this is another Arkady Renko novel hidden among the coal mines of England. Same political intrigue, same twists and interpersonal relationships between protagonist and Higher Society. Really, nothing new here at all. But the writing is good, as good as MCS ever is, and the worldbuilding takes you into a little-explored facet of English life \\"back in the day.\\"But it's obvious that the protagonist Blair is just Arkady Renko cloned for a new era.Overall, a good novel if you like Smith. But if you're looking for something new or different from the Arkady plots of old...I'm afraid you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This is the only book I've read by Martin Cruz Smith that I could not finish. I found the characters unlikeable and the story very dreary. I completed about one eighth of the book when I decided not to continue. A major disappointment as I have ALWAYS enjoyed the author's other novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"End of the road book","review":"Kind of expensive for a mouldering old, wrinkled paperback. Next time will look for better seller and in hard cover.Possibly I should wear rubber gloves when reading if I dare."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best work yet.....","review":"I have enjoyed his other books trememdously, but this story really moved me. I now consider Martin Cruz Smith one of my favorite, if not my favorite writers. Far more compelling then anything Grisham can write. The only reason I refer to Grisham is because I see so many people reading his work, as I did,but are missing out on what truly classic story telling is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost non-stop cover to cover reading.","review":"I enjoyed his earler books and this is up to par. Always variety in his subject matter and well researched. This was a wonderful book to read on a cross country flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I was loath to pick this book up when it came out. \\"Rose\\"?! Please. Stuck with the flu, I had no choice but to pick it up - and I loved it. I've given it another try - and could hardly put it down. Evocative writing and excellent dialog really pull this book along. Is it \\"Renko in 1872\\"? There is perhaps something to that. But, I didn't care. This is a great murder mystery, with fascinating historical background"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Rose is Blighted...","review":"I won't reiterate others' comments about the plot-weaknesses (a man who can't recognize his lover when she's cleaned up? Oh, yeah, she \\"pinched\\" her face up!). I'll just mention the title character...she's appalling, in my opinion. Her self-indulgent masquerade set off a chain of events that resulted in the death of over 70 miners, yet she expresses no remorse or misgivings. She does nothing until the end to stop a miner from stalking and trying to kill Blair. I could go on, but I'll just say \\"Rose's\\" amorality & selfishness disgusted me. I wish Blair had told her, \\"Beat it, sister! I'm tired of being used by you and your dad!\\" The book gets 2 stars only because of the historical setting. Oh, and Leveret was a nice character (about the only one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW","review":"This is like reading \\"The History of Glue\\" but not nearly as exciting. Smith is a talented writer but this one is real boring except for a few decent parts spread out in the book. I'm not sure why I even finished it. Don't be fooled by the sample it sounds like it might be interesting but it sure isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rose","review":"All the readers of the book listed who have reviewed are not from England.I am a fan of Martin Cruz Smith's Arkady - 'Russian detective' books, but did not like 'Rose' at all. It was very disappointing. Whilst a lot of research had obviously been done on the workings of the British Coal Industry in the 19th centrury, Martin Cruz Smith's book gave a highly fantistical description of coal mining, and the story line was weak with unconvincing characters, poorly drawn, and unconvincing dialogue as well.I think Martin Cruz Smith should stick to writing detective stories based on the 20th Century, and ideally based in Russia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked up \\"Rose\\" after it was highly recommended by a friend. While the details of life in an 1870s English coal-mining town are exceptionally well done, I felt the overall story was flat. In fact, it seems more like Smith wanted to write a story about coal-mining and then had to contrive a plot rather than coming up with a plot and then filling in the details. The disappearance of the town's curate is only a cover for the deeper mystery of Rose herself - but that mystery isn't all that hard to figure out and makes other plot lines seem ridiculous in retrospect. While there's enough of a story here to hold one's interest through to the end, it might be better not to start it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically Impeccable Love Story","review":"What a book! For an author like Martin Cruz Smith who writes spy thrillers, this is an absolutely outstanding tour-de-force. Having come from a British mining family, I was flabbergasted at the amount of research that went into this book, and how well connected it was to the gripping plot. For those who don't like to have thrillers spoiled for them, don't read the ending and don't read the rest of the reviews after this one. For those who just enjoy good writing, even if they know the ending, ignore the squeaky wheels, savor this fascinating book, and buy a few copies for your friends for Christmas. You won't regret it.--K in the Blue Ridge"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smith again transports us to other places/times convincingly","review":"I have read every book M.C. Smith has written, and Rose is as good as any of them, which is saying a lot. Those who have trouble with some of the plot elements are, imho, judging the issues from todays standards. As for not recognizing his lover, perhaps it is a case of not seeing what we don't wish to see. Is Rose selfish? Again, one can't judge by today's habits. I recommend this book to anyone who can put aside their modern judgements and let Smith take them to another time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling story","review":"Writing a review of Martin Cruz Smith is challenging. He is the writer, I'm not. He writes a story that I had little knowledge about. Coal mining in England. The depth of his characters kept me so engaged I thought of them when I went to bed. Each had a mysterious quality that kept me guessing right to the end. I recommend the book to anyone who wants a good read that you don't figure out till the end of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get much better than this","review":"Other have described the setting and plot. It took a little while to submerse into this book but once there it was amazing. You will swear you are in that coal town. The descriptions of life; the plot; the writing were fantastic. If you are a true reader with intelligence there is no other conclusion you can reach. It's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blair is a great charcter","review":"This book is not Mr. Smith's best work as far as plot. However, his characterizations are brilliant and his characters seemingly alive. Blair, a would-be explorer who is the main character, is unforgettable for the reader, even when disgruntled, drunk, failing at his task. Rose is also worth reading for the stunning description of England's old mining towns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Club Required Reading","review":"Had this not been a \\"required reading\\" for a book club that I belong to, I probably would not have finished it. I remembered trying three times to read \\"Gorky Park\\" and having difficulty sorting through Mr. Cruz' many characters. I found this book, although not as confusing, overwhelmingly peppered with trivial details, and a plot line so weak that I kept putting it down until the night before our book club met. Can anyone really say that they didn't have this \\"surprise ending\\" figured out by the time they were half way through reading this novel? Surprising to me was the fact that several members of our group LOVED IT.

It teaches to savor all aspects, from problems (seeing how we learn from them and accepting them as growing experiences) to developing an appreciation for mundane things in our lives. It helps you connect yourself with your own unique spirituality by opening you to take a better look at the life you are leading and understand and appreciate everything you do, you are, and you see!!

Not worth full price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A headache to read, nothing but dog analogies","review":"Pages and pages of him never letting up with vague dog analogies, it was incredibly obnoxious and distracted from the point...which when he finally comes around to he explains with more freakin dog analogies. Really terrible writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"It may bring you a little peace of mind knowing that you don't have to be a pushy obnoxiousness sales person to be successful, but it really teaches little abotu being a good sales person. Look into the Gitomer Sales Bible for starters. I have years of sales experience... trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh... I could do without","review":"I could have done without reading this book. It simply stated the obvious again and again, and provided nothing substantial that I will take away and use. Here let me save you some $$$ and tell you what I got from the book: People are different and have different ways of selling according to their personalities. Groundbreaking huh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must read it - borrow it.","review":"I am a fan of Robert Kiyosaki's books and follow his Rich Dad's Advisors series. However, I believe that \\"Sales Dogs\\" is not up to quality with the rest of his books. It is slightly amusing as is, using dog breeds to describe different types of sales approaches, but has very little advice on how to actually develop salesmanship qualities - something that Robert Kiyosaki highly advises in all of his books.I read to Chapter 7 and just could not justify wasting anymore time on something that seemed to rehash the sales dog breed qualities over and over. I skimmed through the rest. If everything of importance in this book were severely edited down it would probably take up no more than a chapter.Zig Ziglar is much more informative and gives more bang for the buck in any one chapter in any one of his books compared to the whole of Sales Dogs when it comes to giving practical sales advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Hoping For!","review":"I have enjoyed (and benefited from) the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series of books, as well as the advisory series... this book, however, did not cut it. The Dog analogy goes so far over the top it loses its value; the repetition of basic points gives no depth (and therefore reduced value) to the topic of sales and generally speaking it is a boring read and does not leave you with a toolkit to be used upon completion of the book.Overall, a very big disappointment. My suggestion, look elsewhere for information on Sales!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance","review":"Well written with some interesting theories and ideas. But there is nothing here that will help you do your job better, serve your clients and customers better or most importantly go to the bank more often. Some of the ideas and analysis about personality types may be useful to sales managers, but that's about it. If you're looking for good nuts and bolts stuff that you can put to use tomorrow look into Schiffman or Sandler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed reading Rich Dad Poor Dad, Cashflow Quadrant, and the Guide to Investing, but this book does not measure up. The book repeats itself quite a bit, and although the Dog analogy is somewhat appropriate, it really gets carried away to the point of being distracting. I agree that Sales is very important to the success of a businessperson, but I don't see this book enhancing a person's sales knowledge or ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Did you read that heading? It is a waste of money considering that there are SO MANY more worthwhile books on sales. I have loved the Robert Kiyosaki books, but so far, I have found the Advisor series seriously lacking. This book MAY be for nobody; too simple and gimmicky for people experienced in sales, and too jargony and managerial for those just beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?","review":"I probably read 100 or more books each year, including a significant number of business and sales books. I enjoyed some of Robert Kiyosaki's other advisor books, but this one really [is bad].It is full of vague analogies to whatever kind of \\"dog\\" you are -the point that you do not have to be aggressive to be in sales is also foolish and false. You can certainly bring your own personality to sales or any other profession, and you SHOULD, but all this psychobabble about \\"being your own dog\\" or whatever is just that - silly psychobabbly designed to seperate you from your money and put it in an author's pocket who really has nothing useful to say.If you really want to learn something about selling that you can actually USE, read Zig Ziglar's \\"Sales 101\\" or Donald Moine's \\"Ultimate Selling Power\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit","review":"This is a cheap counterfeit scheme.

This might reflect the sensitivities of the reading public of the day, but is boring now. The big secret on which the plot hinges might have been realistic in the 18--'s, but wouldn't even cause a blink of the eye on today's soap operas. The book is way too long and I skimmed a lot of it after realizing it wasn't going anywhere for many pages.

The price is right, however, but you definitely get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"The baseball jersey I received has a different collar than the one pictured. It's much bigger & looks like it was designed for overweight players, though the rest of it fits like a standard medium. The collar pictured is way better looking. Smaller neckbands are better because they always get stretched out of shape anyway, & the bigger collar will soon get too loose & look weird. The fabric is very thin, but it would be good on hot days. Also, the grey is considerably darker than pictured. I couldn't recommend it since the collar looks sort of dorky & besides, I really don't like it when you don't receive what was pictured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball tee","review":"I think it's a nice shirt.

'A Story' or even 'A bit of a Story' is probably more acurate.The accompanying leaflet gives a little info - group, title, country, year and position of most; but not all songs; but who cares. I had forgotten Carola's earlier attempt years before she stormed to victory. Alice and Battiato's 1984 attempt had gone from my mind completely.

Mr. Scott may claim that the story has a timeless quality, but I beg to differ. One of the most endearing quality of the original story by Stevenson is the fact that the story was written about a time before the age of electricity, before exotic islands such as is the setting for the story could become tourist traps.

The language took away the \\"cozy\\" feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me feeling empty","review":"I enjoyed the characters in this book and there were even some interesting plot developments, but about half way through it stopped going anywhere. I have NOT read the Biggie books so don't have a good comparison, but I have to admit that this book sure didn't make me want to read more by this author. I found the end very unsatisfactory - it was almost like about half way through the book she lost interest and just finished it up as quickly as possible, without much thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked out great for mother's day","review":"I bought this for my wife as a mother's day gift. I chose it because it was moderately priced and stainless steel.So far we have sliced potatoes and onions. It works nicely with the standard flat blade making cuts from very, very thin to pretty thick. We haven't tried the other blades yet, but it seems to work very well as a basic slicer.One nice thing is that the blades come packed in a plastic case that keeps the organized and safe. You do need to hold onto the handle when slicing or the legs will fold under on you. It has a nice tubular stainless handle for this. The whole thing goes through the dishwasher easily.

And that about sums up the good points of this production. Said case is sized to fit four DVDs (\\"4 documentary set\\"), but contains only one DVD which holds all four presentations. The productions themselves consist of amateur quality video shot at Revolutionary War re-enactments, haphazardly edited, with intermittent and uninspired narration.Many excellent Revolutionary War documentaries exist, my own favorite being \\"Liberty!\\" Save your money on \\"Heroes and Battles\\" and apply it toward a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-enactment home movie","review":"What a waste of time. The four videos consist of war re-enactments with a tiny amount of voice-over explanation of the battle. We see endless shots of re-enactors firing their weapons.

It's obvious that they just hired some first year grad student to write it.The organic section consists of a list of reactions with little to no explanation. No mechanisms are involved and it's just expected that you memorize all 50 some pages of mechanisms.The physical section is absolutely miserable and they don't seem to want to stick to a sign convention when they talk about thermodynamics.The analytical section is not comprehensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This book was of very little help. Do not use this to help prepare for the chemistry GRE. You are better off buying individual review books. There is too much pointless information and not enough detail on important topics.

One has to wonder if the editors even bothered to edit this book, because there are many instances when they misspell words or simply leave them out altogether. On the context side, I think I can just rest my case with the fact that they did not even get the van der Waals equation of state correct. Other than these blatant errors, I feel the book is not particularly well organized - specifically in the organic chemistry section. They do not seem to follow any logical pattern and, for example, lump fairly different topics, such as SN2 and SnAR together. Overall, big disappointment. I will not be buying or recommending a Princeton Review product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bar is pretty low for review books to begin with","review":"Yes, I used it, and yes, it was nice to have a review. But it was full of typos. Important ones-- like the ones that totally change the equations they want you to memorize. Furthermore, it contains information that is just wrong (a reaction is NOT spontaneous, despite negative change in free energy, because of a high activation energy?). Low, low quality like this is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Mankiw if you can!","review":"This book has been a struggle to understand since the beginning. The explainations and definitions are described as if the author doesn't want you to comprehend the full meaning of the concepts. The examples are also terrible, it's like he's not trying to help us.

I also very much like the darkness that she and Sanderling bring to the first movement of the Fourth Concerto, a tough work to hold together, but that here seems to grow with organic inevitability as well as an unusual amount of emotional depth. The second movement has particular cogency, with Malikova clearly making an effort to characterize each episode, building the work to an unusually satisfying conclusion.She also makes a persuasive case for the neglected First Concerto (actually the largest of these three), aided in no small degree by a conductor clearly aware of the music's debt to Beethoven and Mozart. The sonics are warm and well balanced and the piano tone is gleaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wotta great deal!!!","review":"This CD came fast and just as listed, so I couldn't be happier. This seller is most excellent, and I will purchase from them again I'm sure. As for the collection itself, except for the omission of one song (\\"Hey Gyp\\") I can't think of a better collection, unless of course you want representation of Eric Burdon's first post-Animals work with War via \\"Spill the Wine\\", which is included on the Animals \\"Retrospective\\" collection. Since I'm a big enough fan of those two songs I'll probably end up getting that collection, but if you don't care about those two (I suspect most won't) you have all the other songs from that release plus more, so you really don't need anything else if you have this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent music, stands the test of time","review":"I wanted this disc as it had all of my favourite tracks by the Animals. The classics: House of the Rising Sun, Inside Looking Out, Roadrunner, Don't let me be misunderstood, Dimples, Baby let me take you home - the list goes on! 41, yes forty one, tracks, a couple maybe not as good as others but I am not going to complain. A real classic for anyone who started to listen to music in the 60's, arguably the BEST period for music, and who likes blues/rock. The fact that I already have most of the music on vinyl didn't deter me from buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TEACHING TOOL","review":"These videos follow the NIV version of the Bible word for word and make a great teaching resourse.

In addition, the velcro stuff used here is unusually grabby, making it difficult to unfasten the band quickly. K3 fans would do better with the silicone case amazon also offers with a detachable armband. In that unit, the case stays on the K3, so I reckon it will prove more durable than the Belkin, and the velcro on its armband fastener is more accommodating than on the Belkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst....Armband...Ever","review":"This armband isn't worth 5 dollars, much less 30. The bottom line up front: it doesn't fit well and it is monstrous. You had better have either a super-skinny arm or a huge one for this to fit. The velcro needed to fit onto an average arm is non-existent. Furthermore, it is big... and by big I mean HUGE. Unless you are over 6 feet tall it will most likely take up over half of your arm from your elbow to your shoulder. By the way, I am 5'11. It is by far the biggest armband I have ever seen. It looks like it is for an old Sony casette Walkman, seriously. I ended up taking the portion that disconnects from the actual armband and using it with an armband for an old Creative player. That, however, worked like a champ. Save your money; this thing is terrible.

To make matters worse, washing the shirt does not return the neck to its original shape. Other than this (which I consider crucial to the look of the shirt), the material is soft and the rest of the shirt maintains its shape. The color is just as it appears in the ad. The sizing is accurate, and it is a very comfortable shirt. I just wish someone would create a mock turtleneck that retained its shape when pulled over the head.

No amount of John Barry's musical score, or Caroline Munro in a bathing suit can save this poor man's wannabe Star Wars. Cheesy, cheap special effects that are a throwback past the silent era, are peppered gingerly throughout this movie and are over used again and again and again. Generic looking sets, pleather costumes with skull caps, some of the most underwhelming stop motion animation ever and stiff as cardboard overacting with some of the most forgettable characters can't help this stinker.

You can't but laugh at David Hasselhoff's hair as he saves the universe with his leading lady Stella Star (Bond girl Caroline Munro) whose outfit likewise was a laugh with its cape and tight fit. The science behind this film is about the worst with one of the nosiest space vacuums imaginable.Joe Spinell as the evil Count Zarth Arn brought a tear to my eye as an MST 3000 gift from the gods. I will say in a comparison to \\"Star Wars\\" the robot had more personality than 3CPO.The lines spoken in the film are gems. 5 stars on the camp and cheese scale.

It really is a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mobile ever","review":"We bought this mobile because our daughter, who was six weeks old, would always wake up as soon as we got her into her crib. if we didn't pick her up and rock her to sleep again she'd just start to cry and wake herself up all the way. with this mobile we can set her in her crib and turn it on and she watches the lights on her ceiling and the fish and is lulled back to sleep. that means we get some sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this mobile","review":"This mobile is awesome... but what's the deal with the price?? I got mine for $40 at babies-r-us. If you spend more than that, your getting ripped off!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"My oldest son is 3 1/2 and we still use his mobile every night. More because it's cool to see the fish on the ceiling than because of real need. Still works fine. So I ordered another one for my new baby. I have hopes that it lasts as long as the first one. This really is a wonderful mobile. The lights on the ceiling along with the nice lulaby work wonders. Would definitely recommend this product for all ages since it converts to a tabletop model even after the crib."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps our little guy get to sleep!","review":"This mobile is great! We've had it for about a month now and haven't had to replace the batteries yet. I use it almost every night, but pick and choose which feature to use. Some nights we only use the movement, sometimes we use the light projector on the ceiling, others we only use the light facing down. The only problem i have is that the cycle is only for about 10 minutes and that just doesn't seem long enough to help every time. 20 min would be much better. There is a remote control to operate it but you don't really need it because ANY remote control will operate it. If I'm adjusting the tv volume in my sons room while I'm rocking and feeding him in our glider it turns on the mobile...kinda funny, kinda annoying though. overall this was a great purchase, id do it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very excited about this mobile because it can convert to dresser top for later use. But when I finally opened it and put it together I soon realized the attachment does not allow you to use it on our cribs. The attachment is much too small. I immediately called the number given for Fisher-Price and the woman had no sympathy. She just said sorry. She also told me all their mobiles are the same and will not fit on anything but a standard crib with small rails. We have the Emily sleigh crib and it won't fit on any side of the crib. I do not recommend this mobile unless you have an old fashioned small railed crib. To save time, I also recommend trying the attachment before you put the whole thing together."},{"rating":"1","title":"ocean wonders mobile stops spinning","review":"the fish stop spinning, I have owned two now and both have done the same thing. Fisher price has done nothing to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I spent the better part of two afternoons putting this together for my grandson. Lo and behold, when I was finally done, it would not attach to the top crib rail, which is about two and a half inches wide. We have had two other mobiles which fit perfectly. I was also amazed that the battery box is behind a screwed on plate which means you have to disassemble the whole thing to change the batteries! Annoyed at the total waste of my time, I called FP customer service. They were not helpful at all. They suggested that my crib is a new type and that's why this doesn't fit. I told her that we have two other mobiles that are adjustable and fit perfectly. Needless to say, I got no satisfaction. We haven't decided if it's worth keeping for later when it can be used sitting on a dresser(w/o mobile) w/light show on the ceiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke immediately","review":"I got this for my daughter. She tells me that this mobile was either broken when it arrived or broke within a day or two or being put on the crib. She says it started making terrible noises - the motor appeared to have broken. My daughter contacted Fisher-Price directly and they promised her a \\"refund\\" - only $25, much less than the actual cost. She has received nothing thus far. Very disappointing. She has now purchased a Tiny Love mobile that she finds much higher quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Mobile","review":"We absolutely love this mobile! Especially the lights that project onto the ceiling and twirl around. Great product! Would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit our crib","review":"Now, I'm no professional, but it would seem to me that when you make a crib-mounted mobile, your first priorities would be to a) make it have stuff that spins around, and b) make it actually mountable on a crib. I guess they blew all their development money on the first requirement..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, but...","review":"This is another wonderful and sweet mommy saver from Fisher Price but I do wish I could change just a couple things. First, you cannot make the mobile stay on longer...if you could set it to stay on for however long you decided it would be far more convenient. Typing about convenience brings me to the second problem I have, once it has not been on for a while you can't just click the remote to activate. You have to get up, hit the button on the mobile then the remote works again. Not fun. But on the plus side, my daughter loves it...daddy loves it...I love it...my six year old loves it. The fishies and bubbles are just too cool floating around the room. Even knowing the flaws I would definately buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't adjust for railing size","review":"The top rail of our crib is by no means unusually large, so we were surprised this was manufactured for only the narrowest railing. The only sticker about it is on the mount, which does not adjust at all and is inside the box. It would have been nice to put that on the box itself!When buying baby items it can be incredibly frustrating and tedious how few items are compatible with similar items by different manufacturers. This mobile can't possibly be compatible with more than 60% of cribs, so as cute as it is save yourself some heartbreak and don't buy it. Fisher Price would do well to look at how many reviews there are with the same complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello Kitty Watch","review":"This watch sucks. It doesn't work at all. Unfortunately for me, I opened the packaging after the 30 day refund date so I couldn't return it or exchange it. I would give it zero stars if I could.

Cheerful, uplifting and the joyful kind of music that makes us glad to be alive and surrounded by livestock, pets and abundant wildlife (no matter the number of people on this planet, we are still outnumbered by the animals). This album grows on you; each year we play it more than the year before, each year friends and family request it more than the year before. It is noisy, busy, catchy and uniquely musical in the Christmas tradition. Our thanks to Phil and Bernie for gathering these wild and enduring sounds into the tunes on this album. This is a wild collection, highly creative, and a family favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Christmas music of all!","review":"This is the best! They've used animal sounds to do all the best Christmas music. My son bought this for me years ago and asked me to buy one for him since he grew up and moved away. It's a family tradition to play it ad nauseum during the holiday game playing around the kitchen table. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nifty game!","review":"I'm always on the lookout for a good game, and the Dark Horizons offerings certainly fit the bill. If you're into minis, Escape comes with those; if you're into a VERY clever means of map-making, look no further; rules that model close-combat quickly and clearly? Dark Horizons: Escape nails 'em all. A great find and fun to play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"When I first decided to buy a digital camera I had a choice of two: Sony DSC F828 and Canon Digital Rebel. I chose Sony. The picture quality that Sony produces is excellent, but Canon gives you ability to change lenses. In order to extend the zoom on my Sony camera I went on to a massive search for something that would increase 7.1x zoom. I came across this Opteka add on lens. Couple of weeks ago it arrived and it was tested immediately with disappointing results. I followed Opteka's suggestion that comes on a little leaflet, but the pictures are very blury. After trying several combinations and realising that it doesn't work properly, I gave up. Right now I am looking to replace Sony camera with EOS 350D or probably even EOS 20D. My advice is not to bother with this add on. If anyone made there Opteka Lens working on DSC F828 please share it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Georgia Buldog Tire Cover","review":"I was not pleased with the quality of this product.

Very inconvenient in quiet situations such as the college classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT DO It","review":"The only reason why I got this was because my boyfriend wanted it. What a mistake. This is the worst key finder. It goes off at any given moment, if you laugh, it goes off, if the t.v. is on, it goes off. The only enjoyment I got from this was throwing it against the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"My wife and I were looking for a way to stop mislaying our keys and thought this key finder might be useful. It responds great to whistles and claps, and any other loud noise in the room. Anytime we'd laugh, it would beep. Anytime there was a loud noise on TV or during a movie, it would beep. We even buried it under blankets and pillows and it would still pick up noises and beep at random times.We eventually broke it...which was satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whistle key finder works only when you don't want it to","review":"This key finder beeps when there are high-pitched tones on TV, when the phone rings, and when my toy poodle barks, but not when I whistle. I can even do the really loud whistle with two fingers but it doesn't respond. It's also a very unattractive, clattery, bulky hunk of plastic on the key ring. I thought maybe it was a defective one but I had purchased two of them and gave one to a friend as a joke because she is always losing her keys. She thought it was great and got a good laugh out of it, but then it annoyed her so much, she threw it away within a week. I would say it makes a good prank gift but that's about it.

It's always beeping. Don't take your keys to the movie, class, dinner, or library and they're just what need. I've been looking for a truly functional key finder for years and the only one that really really worked was a pricey sharper image key finder which isn't made anymore. I wish they made them like they make key fobs for cars. These manufacturers clearly did no real world QA whatsoever.Pros:I haven't lost my keys since I attached them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Loser Product","review":"Someone gave this to me for Christmas and my experience with it forces me to label it a loser. Half the time, it doesn't respond to the whistle;other times you have to be right on top of it for it to respond and you can just bend over and pick up your set of keys;other times, it goes off in your pocket when your other keys make a jangling noise.

It is a remarkable work as the book talks about the history, politics, economy, and society of Kuwait. It also provides detailed information about religion, weather, demography, and many more topics.The book contains magnificent data represented in many charts. In addition, the \\"Visitor Tips\\" sections are most useful and helpful for foreign visitors to Kuwait, whether the purpose of the visit is business, leisure, or work.Therefore, if that part of the world, particularly Kuwait, is of an interest to you, this book is of a great great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very warm and comforting.","review":"A book about finding answers to the meaning and purpose of life.

I love not having to dig my cell phone from my purse anymore. It's also never lost. The flap stays closed because it has a magnet inside. That means no snap or zipper to have to fool with. It attaches easily and securly to your purse, belt, belt loop, etc. The only way it could be better would be to have no flap at all but I don't see a way around that."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL MAGNETS! DO NOT BUY!","review":"Sure, a huge bucket full of letters and numbers is educational, but this particular bucket is a bad buy. The magnets are not very strong at all. And to make it worse, no one really thought of balance when designing this set of letters and numbers. Even with magnets, gravity still works. When you try to place a letter correctly, the low grade magnets and the weight of the plastic turn the letter on it's side. if you're very lucky, the magnet will stay there and just hang wrong. However, most of the letters just slide down to the floor. Maybe I just got a bad set; i don't know. what I do know is that less than half of the letters in the bucket would attract to the surface. and less than half of those would actually stay in place and upright. Most of them just end up on the floor. Buyer beware. keep your receipt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anime","review":"This is a beautiful anime with absolutely gorgeous animation and beautiful music. The plot is rich and original that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you wanting more. You just have to know who the Soldats are and the little twist of fantasy (the legend behind Noir) makes it even more interesting. My only complaint is way too many flashbacks! They flashback to scenes in the last episode or even the same episode. After awhile, the flashbacks begin to get on your nerves. Overall, this is a wonderful anime and I strongly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Noir is a classic in the making and this DVD deserves to be watched by every anime fan.

This anime is different. It is set in France and has a European feel to it. It is about two assasains trying to find-or avenge- their pasts. I recomment this for anime fans and non-anime fans alike. It is rated 15+ from it's violence(with no blood) and it's \\"mature themes\\"(their assasains, that is a muture theme I guess...)-Lord Kronos Phoenix"},{"rating":"2","title":"A series definitely worth watching","review":"This is the story of two assassins entangled in mystery. It slowly unravels itself as the episodes go by. Pictured in anamorphic widescreen and English/Japanese 5.1 Dolby mixes, this is the way the aninme should be experienced. The transfer is nearly flawless. And so is the anime. The style of music, art, and character development is superb.However, I must take off one star for a couple of reasons. The amazon.com review is truly exaggerating about the same scenes popping up, but it does happen. And it is quite annoying in some cases.The dub is not recommended. Both of the main characters barely even speak louder than a whisper, and they lack the emotion of their Japanese counterparts. That's about it.The content of this DVD is about PG-13. Even though there is a lot of killing, all of it is completely bloodless. Some mild language, no sexual content. For a series about assassins, it's pretty clean.Check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Soundtrack Instead","review":"Absolutely BEAUTIFUL music from Yuki Kajiura, who also did music for Hack Sign.Noir is all style and some substance. The concept is cool, but it goes downhill quickly after the first episode. It is unbelievable that they can gun down hordes of men and not get scathed. The action itself is stylish and unique, but again unbelievable. And why are the main characters only women? There are enough over-sexualized women power fantasies for boys to watch.If you want to see a cool and stylish action anime, buy Read or Die instead of 26 episodes of Noir at $20 a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purity and virtuosity","review":"I'm not sure what prompted me to buy this. There was something about that Rick James song that struck a chord.

The focus is on that glorious pedal steel he plays like no one else and a dreamscape inspired by time in Mexico. This is another world that Lanois invites the listener to enter. If you surrender to this music, it will become the soundtrack of your dreams. It has a very powerful pull that will take you deeper than emotion to a place of unknowing filled with incredible beauty. This is the anthesis of most music being released today, whatever the genre. It is too personal to fit any handy label. It appears that Lanois is channeling some very profound personal experiences into music that he can share with the wider world.

I listened to it 2 times just to make sure I wasn't imagining how bad it was, and then I dumped it. It was not my style, and I don't see how it could be anybody's style, but that's just me.

A definitive live collection from a hard touring band, concert versions of \\"ME 262\\" \\"Harvestor of Eyes\\" and \\"Born to be Wild\\" had me salivating like a Pavlovian dog. I felt as if I were right there at the concert. Buck Dharma's lead guitar lines pierced my ears like 10,000 needles. This is BOC the way you remember them, laser light shows, full throttle energy, and Loud. After seeing the band perform countless times in the '80's and '90s, it just seems to me that there was a certain chemistry with the 5 original members.

Lovecraft, part Robert E. Howard, part Heavy Metal (the magazine) and part Heavy Metal (the music), it's eight and a half minutes of Humboldt Select, drawn out bliss. The \\"2.0 version\\" of Astronomy on the Imaginos LP is pretty interesting (actually, that LP is way underrated), and the Metallica cover on \\"Garage, Inc.\\" is worth a spin.The DVD's very sub-par picture quality is not really a problem.

The result is brilliant and catching. \\"Astronomy\\" happens to be my favourite track on this CD; it contains wonderful musicianship, for those who love extensive guitar solos (which is my case).

It would probably help if one could reboot it remotely via the browser, but that isn't possible.When it works it works fine, but the web browser interface is too limiting and at any one time there is probably a 40-50% probability that remote control over the web will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No work-No support","review":"I purchased the gateway and three lamp modules-setup is easy and quick. From there on this is a piece of junk. Tech support from these people is non existant. The only way to get it back running is to reset the gateway and detect the modules-a little hard to do from a remote location. They need to change the name from home remote pro to remote control from your computor when you are home. Dont buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable for remote control.","review":"I bought this kit in January 2009 and it was dead at just under 8 months. RMA process was easy and smooth. When I decided to sign-up for a pro-level, the replacement and the server couldn't talk to each other and am struggling to get it to work with help of tech support and Crayon Interface (the provider). So, if this works for you out of the box (which it's more likely to), then it's a great gadget. If you however run into a trouble, it may be difficult to get it resolved by phone/email.Update: This thing is NOT reliable enough to be used for remote control. I used this in my observatory and I couldn't count how many time I am unable to control it from the HomeRemote Pro website (it was online and communicating). The button status changed and a log line was added but it didn't actually do anything. This happened about half of the time. However, when it works, it works well. The workaround is to put it on a timer to cycle its power daily."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK","review":"This is a followup to a previous review-I wish I had the time to write about a hundred of them-all would be bad. Hawking Tech. stopped supporting this piece of crap January of 2011. They kept taking my money for the hosting of their gateway, but never bothered to tell me they were discontinuing support of the product till renewal time came up this July 2011-and even then they were trying to charge my credit card. The customer support number takes you to some guy in India who was as helpful as my weiner dog. But the good side is they will give you a 'partial credit refund' if you return a working model to them. Credit on this particular piece willl be about $40.00.

You can create schedules and access your zwave network through a web portal (which connects to the gateway), but device-linking, event-notifications and cell-phone access do not work. Neither does Hawking's customer/technical support.Note that you *may* be able to use any IP video camera with this product, but you will probably have to log directly into the gateway through your LAN (admin/1234) and by-pass the gomoshi website account. But I haven't tried installing a camera, just my Leviton Vizia network.

There's no point to it, really, since there's nothing to figure out or decide for yourself. You just go where the game tells you to go and click on what you're supposed to click on and ask the questions you're supposed to ask. What's the point of that?Short, boring, pointless.

Not only does it not install, the CD Rom doesn't even begin so you can get to the installation/set-up program (and I tried every which way). Finally, like my ex, I had to do a whole system restore. Here it is, an hour and a half later, I am frustrated, my computer is finally running again, my daughter is disappointed because the game she wanted doesn't work and the money is missing.I expected better than this from Ubisoft and probably won't buy from them again based on this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real bummer for the money paid.","review":"I have to say that what I have gotten to play of this game I am so happy with.

I was looking for some Israeli movies and lucked out. This movie was easy to follow (many foreign films with subtitles are not) and it was easy to follow the storyline. I'd recommend it only for adult viewers as the sexual content is high but a very honest and realistic look at modern life in Israel. Being single in Israel is more and more common and with the traditional as well as family values still as present as ever, Zaza makes it easy to sympathize with him.This is a great film if you're interested in getting a different look at modern Israel without the politics, fighting and religious aspect. The only thing that I would change is the ending. I would have liked more closure in the end, perhaps a more smooth transition to the final scene but that final scene was a very warm and wonderful way to experience Israeli culture, music and dancing. Watch it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"This is absolutely awful. I cannot understand the high ratings, and I watch mostly foreign films only.

I spend a fair amount of time in Israel and enjoy Israeli and other foreign films. I was very disappointed in this and had a hard time finishing it. The acting and story line were good, but the film moved very slowly. Perhaps if my understanding of Hebrew was better it would have had more depth, but as it was it was dull and could have been so much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing & should have been X rated.","review":"This is a story of people adrift from any real uplifting, mutually blessing, moral values. I certainly hope that is not a standard picture of Israeli parents & relatives. The way they staked out the girl friend's apartment, rifled it with many humiliating remarks, & threatened her - with total indifference to her little girl's presence - was a great depiction of cruel, cold self righteous indignation.I found it concerning that the boyfriend liked to lie on the floor and extend his arms up in the air for the little girl to try to balance herself on his hands - all with her wearing a short skirt. Even more concerning was the bizarre scence in the bathroom with his father where the man is on his knees pressing his face into his father's crotch & making pretty strange remarks. Perhaps the movie was giving us a hint of at least one source for the tie that binds, or chokes.Altogether a very sad story for everyone involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrites and a Mama' Boy","review":"Apparently, the other reviewers saw a different film, because the one I watched was awful. The only remotely likeable character in the whole movie was the little girl. I've never been to Israel, so I can't comment on what life is like there, but I really don't believe that the losers in this film portray the typical Israeli. Basically, the film is about hypocritical old men, stupid women, and the biggest Mama's Boy of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer of a Movie","review":"The first sentence on the back of the DVD case says, \\"In the tradition of such recent comedic hits as My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Monsoon Wedding, comes this\\", etc.WRONG! That opener is the reason I chose \\"Late Marriage\\", but boy is that ever misleading; who writes those little synopses, anyway? Is there no accountability?Instead, this movie \\"treats\\" us to an unbelievably demanding and overbearing family, and the 31 year old son who tolerates their abuse. This family's behavior just stretched the limits of credulity WAY beyond acceptable boundaries. Yeah, I know it's just a movie, and one has to take these things with a grain of salt, but this one requires about ten oceans worth.Oh, and that's not to mention the abrupt and inexplicable ending.

I accidentally pushed the wet cloth a bit too far into one of the slots with a screwdriver and received a rather large jolt of electricity.While electrified, I swear I heard the sweet, sweet voices of a multitude of angels all singing in perfect harmony. That sound is with me still and I've decided to forgo the purchase of a new Denon sound system and will invest instead in a new gold-plated screwdriver so I can hear the voices again and again.Rapture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost five stars","review":"Pros: Listening to music is now a whole new experience. Everything I play sounds like the music of the spheres. The socket also clearly has some advanced AI built into it, because if try to play bad music--music that no amount of cryogenic gold plating can help, like Britney Spears or John Mayer--it'll immediately trip the circuit breaker and prevent you from being subjected to it.Cons: The T-shape on the wider plug (for you electrician nerds, for 5-20p rather than 5-15p plugs) means that unless you have any Wattgate Electron Pacifier Plugs installed to cap that up, precious electrons will leak out the side, diminishing your audio experience. They're only $29.95 per plug, and are made of the finished cryogenically treated plastic available.Because they don't include these plugs, I had to remove one star. Otherwise, great device!

They are not afraid to improve,and this performance proves that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem","review":"After all these years, DT lacks what they've always lacked; (and is what is at the heart of prog music) and that's a sense of counterpoint and harmonic development. It's all chord changes with banal melodies and fast licks. Oh sure, the chops are there. Astounding. But there's no statement. The classic bands (Yes, ELP, Gentle GIant, et al) had chops too (though not to the speed of DT) but they had something more ...SONGS. The intricacies where within the composition. This stuff sonds like one dimensional jams with fancy riffs thrown in along the way. It's barely above DraginForce -- who are a joke, but they too have blistering speed. DT never developed into what I hoped they would. They just do what they've always done, only faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs, Poor Quality","review":"The EQ/Mastering for this disc is very poor. The songs, although well performed lack bite and sound dull, lifeless and flat. Listening to the opening song (Root Of All Evil) I found the drums to be less than thunderous yet the air horn/alarm noise is up front and louder than the rest of the band. When the entire band kicks in it becomes a flat EQ/compressed mess of sound. This continutes for the entire 3 disc set. Also, I am not impressed with the orchestra. Out of tune and did not mesh well with the band. Too bad beacuse I have seen the DVD of this show and it was very impressive (first set). I also did not like how they cut out LaBrie's in between song comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless book","review":"Better to read daily articles in indian news websites .

After opening it and seeing the quality of the case, I was not impressed. There is not alot of padding on this case. It is very thin and I feel that the CD's or DVD's could be damaged in this case. Also, the zipper when opened ends up behind the binder. I had to dig my fingers up and behind the binder to find the zipper. so, now I have to make sure that I don't open the zipper all of the way or else I won't be able to close the case. For 15 dollars I think the case should be more padded and the zipper should not be falling behind the binder."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for intermediate players","review":"This is probably the best of the three volumes in this series.

I was dissapointed to receive a book with only about 50 pages, several of which were copies of other pages, and about 20 of the 50 were about an rv that is no longer on the market. I was hoping to learn some of the differences, the plus/minus between the different types of rv's, ie 5th wheels, trailers, motor homes, truck campers, etc. I think I've learned much more reading the advertising brocures of the different manufacturers and talking to salespeople about their product. I do not recommend this book. So as not to sound like sour grapes, I have purchased many how to and information type books and have never felt compelled to give a review such as this. I've wasted my money, don't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and of little value.","review":"I found this book to be very poorly written and of little value to a newcomer to the RV world. The poor grammer makes it hard to read... an editorial review was obviously omitted. The author claims to have owned six RVs, but describes only two, and only one by name. Almost half the book is devoted to a bad experience he had with one manufacturer. He uses RV jargon without explaining what it means. He gives no information about quality manufacturers or best values, and he doesn't explain the different types of RVs. He provides no information about RV associations, other sources of RV information, clubs, etc. In summary, the book fell well below expectations and will be of very little value to most readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative book for the beginners or the experts!!","review":"This book was packed full of information and wit!

For an apartment or smaller room, this subwoofer is more than ample. If you are building up a high end surround sound system in a larger room, you will probably want to move up to a 12\\" speaker and a higher end series. I definitely will always recommend klipsch speakers though. They consistently have shown me high quality and great sound over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Subwoofer","review":"This subwoofer if configured correctly does better job than other really expensive subwoofers. I hooked this up with synergy C1 and F2 speakers and boom the most awesome sound you will hear. I like the auto on function and adjustable switches in the back of the subwoofer. The tech support of Klipsch is really nice and gave me different type of setup scenarios.I recommend this product very highly. All the Klipsch speakers I have bought latetly are outstanding"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Boom, little bass.","review":"I listened to this subwoofer today in a high-end audio shop and I agree this thing is a bit slow on the response and overly boomy without much definition. It's very heavy on bass, but the overtones are excessive, which might lend themselves to bass-heavy rap music and movies, but for anyone interested in crisp full-frequency music reproduction, this is not the subwoofer to get. There is a noticeable delay in the response of this unit, and its dynamic range seems to be either all bass or nothing... there's very little in-between.This is a good example of how Klipsch has lost its reputation. They used to produce their products in Hope, Arkansas. Now, like many \\"U.S. companies\\" they contract this crap out to China -- and it sounds like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked \\"ok\\" for 2.5yrs... Now it's near death","review":"I should've dug a little deeper before this purchase. Apparently more of these issues are creeping up. Amp was never really impressive. It did the job, and sounded pretty good, but would overdo some of the dramatic lows, and then be barely audible the remainder of the time. I put in at least 5-6hrs playing with adjustments when I first set it up until I finally called it good enough. Didn't think much about it until a couple months ago when the dramatic lows would simply shake the house and cause our cats to nearly hit the roof! This would occur at the most inopportune times such as during a commercial while watching regular TV. We do not watch TV or movies, nor listen to music at loud levels (not even remotely!) I have now turned the amp off as it became embarassing when company was over this past weekend. Bottom line... for it's size, it was fairly decent, not great. 2.5 years of \\"OK\\" use though is simply unacceptable. Will NOT buy Klipsch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Google Klispch Subwoofer not working","review":"Sounded awesome but amp WILL fail.

The print isn't nearly as good as it could've been with Synapse. However, I still give it 5 stars because it's the best print of this film I've seen yet. It's watchable and the music score is good. It's 100 min. which is longer than what's previously been available. And the storyline is more twisted than I remembered. I'm a Steele fan so I have to be more forgiving because I consider this a real collector's item. So what we have here is \\"The Faceless Monster\\" version of \\"Amanti D'Oltretomba\\" (AKA \\"Nightmare Castle\\"). Just not the best print. The dubbing isn't great either but I don't care. I'm just glad to have it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFUL TRANSFER !","review":"I adore Barbara Steele, but this transfer is truly one of the worst DVD transferd ever. It looks to have been mastered from a videotape without any type of effort to clean it up whatsoever. It has a constant fluttering throughout most of the film which gives the picture a quality that is NOT in anyway seamless.The box art is [bad] and this is definateley a sub par release.In comparison with SYNAPSE'S beautiful job on CASTLE OF BLOOD starring BARBARA STEELE this disc is an atrocity.THE ONLY REASON to buy this DVD is if you are such a fanatic for BARBARA STEELE that you cannot wait for someone else to put out a better copy. Surely, and hopefully, someone will. Cuz RETROMEDIA'S release would not even be competition if someone came out with an even slightly better version.I mean they should pay people to watch this disc rather than charge them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am in Dork Heaven!","review":"I've been looking high and low for an uncut version of this movie and Retro Media has done a bang-up job of restoring it. The transfer is clear, the sound quality is top-natch and Barbara does her own dub! ( insert pathetic squeal of joy ) The still gallery was a nice bonus too. Retro Media, you are truly gods among men. Keep up the good work. So, if you're a gothic Italian horror/Barbara Steele buff, then this is a sound investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Meets the Eye","review":"This horror film is distinguished with a rather intriguing and complex plot raising it far above the routine and mundane Italian horror film genre output of the 60s. Staring the exceptionally exquisite and alluring British born beauty Barbara Steele this film is very stylish and has vividly haunting atmosphere thanks in part to Enzo Barboni's black and white cinematography and Ennio Morricone's score. In a film full of images of torture, death, lunacy and other bizarre goings on for the sake of avarice how could one go wrong indeed especially with Miss Steele in the cast? This is an effectively well crafted bit of horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not character building","review":"These cartoons are marketed for little kids.

This is an insult! I paid good money for a DVD of a favorite show. How DARE they cut out portions of the program, for ANY reason.

Simon & Sschuster, the parent company for Pocket Books, does not list this as an item on their web site, and don't seem too eager to cange that. It's quite possible that it will be released some time down the road. But it's equally possible that a new TV series will start before this book is released. I for one would most definitely love to get this Scriptbook, and all the other scriptoboks for seasons 4 thru 7. Will this happen ... maybe. I think that the previous scriptbooks did not sell a well as Simon & Schuster would have liked. And with the series no longer on TV, interest in the Buffy franchise is waining. If you've noticed, there aren't as many Buffy novels being released either.

This can be done at different levels; having faith that God will provide another to complete the growth in the seeds that you have planted.

I'm sorry to say that I don't think so. You cannot use it as a voice changer without having to record something each time. There are other voice changers that allow you to add voice effects as you speak. Not this one. That reduces the fun effect. The microphone doesn't capture the voice that well and the speakers are weak. I had to play it near someone's ear for them to hear it or tell all to stay silent. Reducing the fun even more.

The Shostakovich score compliments the screen action but draws too much attention to itself at times so that one finds oneself listening to the music more than concentrating on the play. This is probably due to my having to follow the subtitles. The experience would be undoubtedly greatly enhanced if I could understand Russian. Can one really translate Shakespeare into Russian?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The beauty of independent film.","review":"G.O.R.I. is a proof positive that you don't need big stars and $50 million dollars to make a great movie. Thoroughly engrossing from the first mysterious moments, this improvised story (shot in real time) goes from a fun little party to an emotional nightmare as more and more is revealed about the characters at the party. In the spirit of \\"The Celebration\\", this is a gritty, intense, and often very funny movie that doesn't play out like your average Hollywood fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Little to say about this film other than it is probably the most remarkable documentary I have seen. the fact that the filmmakers spent a decade off and on getting to know 'benjamin' means that two things happen: first, there's a complete intimacy and authenticity to the fragmentary shoots; second, the filmmakers don't go for quick sensationalism, and leave out just as much as you yourself would when telling the story of a close friend. It helps if you like 'Smoke's music, but it's not essential to be a hipster, the power of the voice comes through, and the makers use so many techniques to piece the film together, they totally avoid all the cliches of a music video or concert film, getting very close to the power of performance.A truly wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best turn on of all the sexy stories i've read","review":"It is by far my kind of language and it's very racy and graphic descriptions of every detail mesmerizes my own obscene mind.

After even the most cursory glance, suspicion grew among all of us about the book itself as well as the veracity and provenance of these reviews. Thus I've been moved to write a review to counterbalance some of the apparent ballot-box-stuffing going on here.The Hooker and the Nun is poorly written, riddled with typos and errors, filled with oddly offputting phrasing, and not terribly arousing. Erotica is always a crapshoot given how taste-specific the subject matter can be, but in this case the writer's personal taste and word choice got in the way of any appreciation for the work for me. If you like incredibly, run-like-a-river wet girls or weirdo anachronistic phrases like \\"the hornies\\" or \\"cum-offs\\", this is for you as the Hooker and the Nun has plenty of the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"it doesn't even deserve a star","review":"This book was terrible!

Instead they show most of the food of different cultures: Mexican, Chinese and Jewish and tell you how to make may be a couple of them (not in details), but it is not a DVD on cooking dishes, like Lidia's other DVDs...It is more about family traditions and cultures than on actual recipes and cooking...It is not what I expected to see since i wanted to learn new recipes from Lidia."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for travel","review":"Sometimes it's nice to have some protein with you that doesn't have to be refrigerated.

Bocce has provided lots of entertainment this summer! We have enjoyed several social gatherings and brought them along. Everyone enjoyed the game. My only complaint is that the balls do get pretty scuffed up when they hit the concrete, but this is expected. When the balls hit each other, small knicks but nothing major. We played in a friends' side yard and balls hit a drain pipe and the road--some scuffs. This was expected. I was somewhat upset at first, but then again, the bocce balls are not supposed to hit concrete. The carrying case is good quality.

My only A+ in grad school was a paper slamming this sorry little book. I remember Edmundson's going on for pages about how terrible Paul de Man supposedly is, and then, when it came time to illustrate WHY PdM is so bad ... Edmundson does a reading of a Wordsworth poem in what he claims is the manner of De Man, instead of looking at one of De Man's own readings! And yet this guy is a Professor ... further evidence that English is not a \\"discipline.\\"The title should be \\"Pragmatism Against Literature and Philosophy.\\" I think Edmundson has his heart in the right place, but he appears to've been spending too much time around Richard Rorty, literally and on the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"More soft-core junk.","review":"I guess the producers think this is art because of the very limited FFN: not so.

The author Tom Davis wrote this book explaining in details for unbelievable 42 manners of dogs. He artfully described in funny way but I also found that some realistic explaination hidden on it. The book gives relaxation to me as I think it is for the general dog lover and interest book reader, not for reference. The author can raise up even detailed l behavior to tell us such as 'why do wet dogs always shake on you?' or some frequent question from children such as 'why do dogs come in so many sizes, shapes, and colors? !! In summary, this book reflects broader views for dog lover in relaxing method and fitted words.

The clear advantage of the 17' is that it's considerably lighter and easier to set up.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ride-on ever!","review":"My son received this toy for Christmas, just before his second birthday. It is absolutely useless! It doesn't turn, so it is very difficult to \\"drive\\" in anything but a straight line. The wheels are so big, my son can't ride it without running over his own feet; he can only move it by taking tiny little steps. This toy might be better for a younger child, but if you have an older child that really wants to RIDE on a toy, skip this one. I'd HIGHLY recommend the Chicco Toys Play 'N Ride Train -- my son has had this for a year; he plays with it every day and it has an excellent steering mechanism so he can ride it all over the house very easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy but can get it for way cheaper from Target","review":"I bought this for my son from Target when he was about 1 and a half.

Nor the wars of carthage are mentioned or macadionian wars. It does however show other charcter's of the roman empire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly Inaccurate","review":"I thought the documentary was very well done. However, the historian who said that Jesus was rightly condemned by the Romans for \\"disturbing the peace\\" is inaccurate. The Roman Proconsul Pilate should not have judged a religious matter of the Jews. By Roman law, he could not have executed someone for religious reasons because the Jews had been granted religious autonomy some years before. This meant that Jewish leaders in Jerusalem had jurisdiction over religious matters and law, not the Romans. Romans could only intervene if the crime committed were capital or against the empire itself. There were, in fact, no legal reasons for Jesus to have been put to death by the Romans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Disappointing","review":"While others have done a decent job in describing how terrible this documentary is and how much better PBS could have done producing it, what added to my surprise apart from the poor work of scholarship, were the comments made about Jesus. Karen King, a self proclaimed expert on the history of ancient Christianity narrated a couple of incidents and attributed them to the blessed life of Jesus. Later she goes on to say that those events rightly led to the crucifixion of Jesus by the Romans. I found that rather nonsensical.Also, a great deal of time was spent narrating obscene verses from the collections of Ovid which I wonder why were found to be more relevant to the Roman Empire as compared to the political turmoil Rome was in or the military expeditions of her generals. Quite frankly, I had never imagined a PBS documentary would have disappointed me more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"This must be the worst viedo documentry of Roman history ever produced. Sigournery Weaver was the worst possible choice for narrator. Just read the comments below. The emperors are all villified. I can't believe the producres included a comment by one historian who compared Augustus' conquest of Egypt to Hitler's conquest of France! There is no attempt to understand Roman culture other than a superficial glance. The Romans are continually compared to fascists, and that is completely anachronistic. The video may get some praise for including the wily Ovid, the writer of satirical sexual escapades. But then Sigourney Weaver accuses Augustus of suppressing free speech, as if Augustus was a bloodthirsty tyrant.Purchase the Greeks instead, a series also produced by PBS but far superior. The cinematography is magnificant, the music is superb, and history is explored with more objectivity. It is also voiced over by Liam Neeson of Schindler's list fame and Star Wars:1."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY 5 YEAR OLD LOVES IT","review":"There is something funny about saying Haktak.

The lesson plan was for middle school, but with a little editing I made it Algebra I level. I kept the book as part of the lesson. The students liked the book and put the Magic Pot Function Machine to work as they studied for the test.

In between, you see how corporations and institutions 'persuade' you to buy a product, adopt a lifestyle or vote for a government. The last segment on 'narrowcasting' is extremely disturbing. What do you do when a politician says one thing to you and something else to someone else - behind your back? What do you do when data mining companies have your every last habit, bias and weakness at hand, and sell this information to those who want to influence and sway you? Are they merely giving you what you want, or is it the final invasion of your privacy? It's a totally enjoyable documentary - and it will make you think again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new legend","review":"IN MY OWN EYES LUCIANO IS A TRUE KING OF REGGAE.

His lapidary use of language is the touchstone of his writing, together with a tone which is often inadequately spoken of as ironic.These qualities are here coupled with a revenge plot which rivals the Count of Monte Christo, the grandfather of all such tales. Over the years, I have read the Demon Princes series more times than I can count; far more times than I have ever reread any other book or books.If you haven't read Vance, you must. It's as simple as that. And this imperative applies to all who have never picked up a so-called \\"science fiction\\" book. You will not become hooked on SF: you will become hooked on Jack Vance; and your world will expand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fought off my boyfriend to read it","review":"This is a fantastic collection of novellas (or maybe just short novels, I seem to recall that there is some difference). I left it lying on the coffee table one day, and from that point forward I had to keep stealing it back from my boyfriend. Every time I set it down he would grab it and start reading. We both really loved this book. Now that I got him interested in Jack Vance, I should be able to convince him to read the Dying Earth books.

This is a truth we often forget.I can resume my review with:Thankyou Mr. Vance !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Jack Vance is a great storyteller but not here. The only problem with the five novels that comprise The Demon Princes is Vance tells the same story five times. Read one - you've read them all. Same plots - same bad guys - same hero who doesn't grow. If you make it through more than a thousand pages to the ending of the fifth novel, congratulations - you'll be disappointed. I've read big sci-fi epics before - Dune, Foundation, Titan, etc. - The Demon Princes is not in their league."},{"rating":"1","title":"book was ok","review":"This book has a lot of details about his Martial Art experiences, but very little about true Ninjutsu or the training he received and yes Shinobijutsu and martial arts are two different things, it would be like the CIA practicing Karate for most of there training it would be a waist of time.

The new PMP exam is more tough, the questions are more direct.Rita's questions are more easy but answers are very different with some irrational explanation and page # reference. The Mulcahy questions were regressive in the sense that over the period of time I started answering mulcahy way of answering which was wrong so instead of building my knowledge I was getting more confused as to what was wrong or right. At time I thought it may be a deliberate attempt to make you buy more mulcahy books or courses.Many new topics from PMBOK are not covered even though I bought the cd in April 2007.

I had a hard disk crash and needed to reinstall but they (the software developer) would not allow me to do this without eating my second install which I had planned to use for my desktop (as I travel and wanted the software on both).

I enjoyed how he also dedicated some chapters to the administration and the teachers and all the things that surround the students and the teachers lives -- Affirmative Action, the school, the city, etc. It was a bit confusing since the chapters are named after a student but in between are the daily class stories so it can be a bit confusing.

Her voice has a tendency to be slightly shrill, and that needs to be avoided, but doesn't take away from this her first album.On the B-side of one of her single-cds were some nice jazz covers which I really enjoyed, too. She has talent.

I have watched it several times and found it fascinating every time. One of the more interesting things to me was that the dialog was not made up. The Germans kept meticulous records of everything they did, like counting the buttons on the clothes of people going to the gas chambers. They also recorded every word spoken by her, her interragator and her trial which brings a realism to the film that you don't find in many others. This is not an action film or a film with blood and gore. It is very disturbing, riveting film about what it was like living in Nazi Germany. There is actual film footage of her trial in the extras. I'm not sure I could do what this young woman did. A true story of quiet courage from a young woman who dared stand up to the horrors of a brutal, unrelenting tyranny.

The actors are just superb.For me it is also a relief to know that there were some goodhearted and extremely brave Germans, who thought and acted differently than the silent masses, the dull, the deaf and the blind, who \\"accepted orders\\", who \\"didn't know\\" and who \\"had no idea\\".Sophie is a hero.

Sophie Scholl, an ordinary person who along with a few others, is imprisoned for handing out leaflets against Hitler's regime. She is interviewed again and again by a guilt ridden Gestapo agent. The acting is superb, the interaction excellent, as Sophie testifies against Nazi cruelty, and testifies to her faith in God, Christ and man's inhumanity to man.

The dramatization takes this sometimes thin script and translatesthrough exceptional dramatic skill the tensions and hubris of a small group of anti-Hitler students in Munich, looking both at their opposition and its consequences to their lives. Their actions were so terribly innocent yet they were willing to pay the ultimate price for engaging in them. Particularly for students of the Holocaust and other facets of the European theater of war, the film is a very important addition. It contributes a broader dimension to Hitler's opposition and let's the public know that there were Germans who also paid with their lives to work against his evil even during the height of the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"This is a child's drum set as evidenced by the size of the drums and throne.

In this installment, King Darrow becomes jealous of Aidan, who triumphed over the Pyrthens and whom the prophet Bayard says will be the Wilderking. After Aiden's three years of study at Tambluff Castle, the king sends the young man on a fool's errand into the Feechiefen Swamp (from which no one has ever returned alive), to bring back the frog orchid that might cure Darrow's melancholy. Of course, Aiden finds help among his feechiefolk friends, but he also finds a new enemy waiting in the swamp's deepest recess masquerading as the Wilderking. The book ends on a somewhat sad, though not entirely hopeless, note and sets the stage for the climax of Book 3, for which we eagerly waited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better Than the First Book!","review":"I've got to hand it to MR.

He may be the most loyal member of King Darrow's court, but Aidan is sent on a suicide mission to the Feechiefen Swamp in order to retrieve the legendary Frog Orchid. King Darrow thinks to see the end of young Aidan, but he meets up with his friend Dobro and becomes a Feechie friend to all Feechies. There's someone impersonating the legendary Wilderking out in the Feechifen and Aidan must find out who is enslaving Feechies to the civilizers ways of war and commerce.

It was 1988. Like Buckley, one of the reviewers below, I find this to still be one of my favorite albums. I guess some of this happens to do with my love for Philip Dick's quasi-science fiction. I remember when Spin magazine (back when it didn't suck) did an interview with Sonic Youth around Christmas-time in 1987-88 and they talked about Dick's influence on their lyrical style, specifically on Sister. Sister seems a concept album to me, always a good one to turn to when you feel nihilism or a slight twinge of madness/worshiping of false idols coming on. This was the Spin Interview, I think, when Thurston Moore said that when he was a teenager, and people wanted to go see Led Zeppelin, he'd say: \\"**** Led Zep, let's go see the Ramones!\\" This has always stuck with me as being one of the great punk rock comments of all time, and sum up the sheer coolness factor of Sonic Youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot compare \\"The Light Ages\\"","review":"After I was totally overwhelmed by MacLeods tremendous novel \\"The Light Ages\\" which I read in the magnificant translation (\\"Aether\\") by Barbara Slawig I read the sequel \\"The House Of Storms\\" recently.

But while \\"Ages\\" described a dark England in the time of industrialization witch all the bad side effects magic was also a major player but not the main subeject of the book. Also the changelings were mysterious and horrific. In \\"House Of Storms\\" a civil war is the main subject beside the house itself which is more a living beeing than a building.

I wondered for a long time what happened to them until I recently found that they never stopped recording. Heartwood and her new partner have recorded for years as Wishing Chair and still tour on a limited basis. Check out any of their CD's,the sound and song quality has changed little over the years and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Economies Did Not Exhibit Modern Economic Behavior","review":"Finley in \\"The Ancient Economy,\\" presents an informed argument against the notion that ancient civilizations exhibited \\"modern\\" market behavior in the style described by Erich Roll as \\"an enormous conglomeration of interdependent markets.\\" M. Rostovtzeff's notion that trade of manufactured goods was active and important in classical economies is successfully challenged, and the reader is given an interesting peek into the process by which free, landed peoples gradually replaced slave labor in the hinterlands laying the foundation for medieval serfdom. This is an excellent (and concise!!!) introduction to the economic structure of the classical world both describing the various class structures and how each class in general viewed the economic notions of land, capital, trade, and accumulation. I definitely recommend this book to any student of economic history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ancient Economy","review":"This is a boring book about the Roman economy. Not at all interesting.

The 'H-Tech' building at madhapur is shown as \\"FAA Building\\" , cheesy models and even cheesier special effects. Every second actor or extra is an Indian, and almost 90% of the crew mentioned in the end titles are indians.Stupid movie plot (well actually may not be stupid) but the execution is right down criminal.

Her no gimmicks, no frills, no razzle-dazzle approach can be soothing and seductive. I am glad I got this album. It certainly ranks among her best.

Not the life your parents thought you would have, not even the life that you expected to have, but the whole messy, confusing, heartbreaking, yet thrilling reality. The best part is that she captures this feeling in such a light, funny way (with great dialogue!) that you don't even realize what amazing wisdom is packed into 120 pages.

She likes playing games on my laptop more, but spends a good deal of time using her leappad. It has a microphone with which she and her sister love to record themselves and play back. We've taken it with us on vacation and kept them busy when nothing else would. She's already learned all of the planets in our solar system and the moons around Jupiter and she's only 5!Good size too - easy for a small child to carry but plenty big enough to feel like something very substantial. It lets you know when the batteries need replacing, (can't remember how many AA's but very reasonable) and it lasts a long time on one set of batteries.Really a good product and I don't regret buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader is great; wish the books were as durable","review":"I've had the pink Learning System for a couple of years now and it's great. My kids were playing with it a few hours ago. It's been dropped, banged around, moved, you name it and it still works great.Be aware though that the spiral bound Leap Pad books are not nearly as durable. All of our books have ripped; I believe each one is missing at least one page.So if you're planning to invest in a Leap Pad system and the books, you should know that you'll be replacing books fairly often but you won't need to replace this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"works irratically","review":"I bought this for my three year old daughter. We had problems with the my first leappad system with it saying \\"oops, that's not a leappad cartidge\\". This one also does the same thing.

The software is great and it keeps her entertained for at least a half hour, but the craziness frustrates her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong one and a half years later!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, who at the time was just about to turn 3. From day one she has loved it! I can honestly say that she would not love learning as much as she does now if it weren't for the LeapPad!The purple and pink was a great idea from the manufacturer, she was barely interested in the green and blue.In addition to the LeapPad, the organizers and books make it a tight system. It's very difficult to lose cartridges with the organizer.It's also very stable, it's been dropped, hanged (by the pen/cord), written on and RAINED ON and it's still working flawlessly. The pages are laminated so they don't get damaged or torn either!Overall this is the BEST purchase I've made for my daughter yet. If you want your child reading and doing math quickly and having fun while learning, GET THIS NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LeapPad Excellent and Educational!!!","review":"My sister owns this Pink LeapPad and it is awesome!!!This book will teach you how to read,write,solve math problems,and play games.

Along with the Game 1 ten-second delay, there is another game where the audio is a little off from the video. Speaking of video, the video quality of the games are generally good, however there are some exceptions. I'm glad that MLB is releasing these classic World Series games on DVD. This one is very good, without the audio mistakes this is an easy five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Korean War movies","review":"This is one of the best movies made about the Korean War.

This one is worthless. First, there is no tension so when you grab a towel, you will have to hold the roll with the other hand or you will get way more than one towel. And second, depending on how you touch/hold the roll, the spindle easily knocks off the holder. It became a running joke at our house.

I heard a lot of positive things about this product, so I tried it out. Within 3 days, there was a very noticeable difference! My face was 99% clear and stayed that way the whole month. Any little blemish that popped up, the cream took care of overnight. My only complaints are that the cream is drying, and after the one month that I took it, I saw my skin was clear, so I stopped taking it. As soon as I got my period, my face broke out worse than it ever had. No worries, I purchased it again and within 3 days it was clear. I will continue to use this product, and recommend it to anyone who has mild skin issues and believes that there is NOTHING you can do, you've tried everything in everything failed. This doesn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This!","review":"I started using this product 3 almost 4 years ago and my face was clearer than it has ever been! The walmart store I do my shopping at though stopped selling it so I went a long time with out it until now. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and my face hasn't cleared up right away like other people have claimed but after a month or so it starts working very well at least from when I first used it. Like everyone else has said the cream is very harsh but I use it when my face still feels oily or greasy after washing it or on pimples I still have. It drys them up fast and stops them from getting worse. This product is a few dollars cheaper at walmart than here and I'm glad to say they finally brought it back recently. It's nice to know I can still get it here though if they're out of stock at the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Time Around","review":"In the last year or so my acne has gotten out of control, I don't know if it's hormones or what but changing my diet and excerise routine didn't help so I've been trying different products. Nothing worked, Proactive, any of the drug store brand of washes/cleansers/systems. I remembered that I had used this awhile back but had to stop because it severely dried out my skin. I decided to try it out again. It's only been 4 days and my acne is almost completely gone and what is left looks like it will be gone soon and no new break outs. I'm using this with Garnier gel-cream moisturizer and so far it seems to be helping to keep the Vanishing cream that comes in this package from drying out my skin. As for the pills, I was worried they'd taste horrible (you're supposed to chew them) but they're not even chalky and don't taste like anything. For the price it is, it definitely was worth trying again. I sincerely hopes this works for you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"Didn't think it worked for me at all.

I took the pills each day...morning and night...and it was if I had never taken it. I had zero improvement. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the product is fairly priced, it didn't make my acne worse, and when you have acne it is worth it to try out. I have had total success since with both Proactiv and University Medical's product Acne Free. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it would've worked","review":"I've seen plenty of favorable reviews on this product, but it just did not do anything for me. Neither the pills or the benzoyl peroxide improved my acne at all. I used this for a total of 3 months, I made sure I gave myself enough time to really allow the medication to get into my system.

I am the type that breaks out when my period is about to start and using this pill didn't change a thing. I broke out just as i normally would and this last month even while using the pill was nearly the worst i've had. I'm sure must just be a coincidence.

I stuck to this homeopathy routine for a whole 6 months. I never saw improvement on my skin from taking these pills. I am surprised that I stuck to this homeopathic product for a good 6 months. I think I gave this product a fair chance. This just did NOT do anything for me. This goes to show not every product works the same for everyone, but I can see it works for some people.At this point, what works the best for my skin is BC pills, vitamins and herbal tea. I started taking all that after I found out the root cause of my breakouts. My doc told me my t-levels were a little high for a female. High t-levels in a woman = hormone imbalance. If you are a woman with adult acne, get your hormones checked and find out if that is the root cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me look horrible","review":"This product did not work for me at all. I had only used it for a week when I noticed bumps everywhere on my face. These pills broke me out something horrible. I believe I came across something that is helping my breakouts internally. I like the fact that this course teaches you to control my acne from the inside with food, minerals, and vitamins. Acne is not a cure but if I can find something to keep the breakouts down (which I think I have) then that is good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Norm Show DVD","review":"The complete series of The Norm Show was a gift for my son, who is still enjoying watching all these episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I <3 the watch","review":"I have had this watch for about 2 years now!

I finally bought it and was thrilled to see how nice it looked on ... One problem: It wouldn't come off! The clasp was out of line and it took almost 5 minutes to get it off. The second time I wore it, all was fine. The third: It was stuck so badly, and it took so much effort to try to get it off, my wrist and hand actually began to swell. I ended up needing a pair of pliers to get it off. Overall, its possible I just got a bad one, but at least one other reviewer mentioned problems with the clasp (although not as severe as mine).

This game is great for both of them and keeps their attention going. They play it like war dividing the card deck up equally and then it is off to see who has the \\"Big Fish\\" who eats the little fish but WATCH OUT FOR THE PUFFER!!!Sometimes to change it up they play it \\"reversed\\" and pretend the the Little Fish wins over Big Fish and the sight of a PUFFER \\"reverses\\" which fish wins out over the other.Well thought out game and fun with lots of potential to modify it and play several ways!

But it fails to develop as it repeats the same premise over and over and over. The author never goes beyond this concept...except to tell us what not to do. The book leaves me wondering how to accomplish this surrender, other than to do nothing, which is what the author advocates. I think the book may speak more to those who have been significantly wounded by people who should have been examples of love, as those are all the examples the author uses. So if you have not been significantly wounded, you may, like I, wonder why it takes him 100 pages to get the idea across that God's love is unending, unconditional, and freely given to all, and we should live that love as children of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never watch another soap","review":"Grim, at times depressing and even harrowing, this study of working class lives in the poorest part of London, nevertheless reveals that even in the midst of depression and despair there beats at the heart of the human soul something inextinguishable. Part Ingmar berman, part Dostoevesky this film also contains two of the most searing performnces in cinema, Timothy Spall and Lesley Manville. A few lighter moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Leigh","review":"After hearing the director's commentary (sadly available only on the British DVD release, it seems), I appreciated Mike Leigh in a new way. He is, at heart, a simple storyteller who delights in letting us see real human beings in real situations, inviting us along on the journey as their lives and characters are shaped. As expected, we meet a number of struggling (and uniformly depressed) characters, all of whom have hidden depths which are revealed as the central events of the film transpire. Leigh elicits believable and affecting performances all round. Admittedly, this is even bleaker than Secrets and Lies, although there is an undercurrent of redemption as the tensions begin to resolve. As usual, this vintage Leigh offering is compelling stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shopping and the Public","review":"This is a very well- written, extremely informative and thoughtful book useful to planners and anyone interested in understanding and influencing the way in which places to shop are developed. The breadth of the book, which includes a survey of shopping through the hstory as well as an examination of modern shopping via the interent, puts the act of shopping into context by exploring the relationship between community and shopping. Is it possible for the public and local government to mold and shape where and how shopping occurs without drastically impeding the ability of retailers and other providers to sell their products? Is the modern way of shopping destructive to the structure of community? These are questions that planners and communities must address. Reading this book will place the elements of the debate into perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their earliest and the best","review":"I've seen it rated as average, scary, horrible... to me this is their best album, being the most innovative and way ahead of its time to being easily well received. Nothing from their later albums even come close, not even the highly acclaimed Daydream Nation, as they are all more rhythmic, tuneful, some are 'poppy' and easily acceptable. This album is in the ranks of Big Black, PsychoCandy (Jesus & Mary Chain), Locust Abortion Technician (But*hole Surfers) and Eleventeen (Daisy Chainsaw).If you yearn for something really different and far from the mainstream then this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but almost","review":"This is when SY were young and full of that punk rock energy and cynicism that was so popular with the underground scene at the time. They aren't peaceful and laid back like on A Thousand Leaves and Washing Machine. From the opening chord on Bad Mood to the last shriek on Shaking Hell this album will haunt you and make you feel emotions no other album can match. The music on this album isn't \\"fun\\". It is a group of artists who feel insecure and don't give a (...) about pop and use this to create an incredible sound that takes you on a journey, like most of the early SY albums. They haven't gotten the whole \\"noise\\" thing perfect yet. That would be on BMR. But this is full of youthful energy and anger and is frightening at times but is beautiful throughout. This is a great intro to SY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting beginnings","review":"\\"Confusion is Sex\\" is not the best Sonic Youth work. It's not \\"Daydream Nation\\" or \\"Washing Machine.\\" It is worth having though, if only for the tracks \\"Shaking Hell\\" and \\"I wanna be Your Dog\\". Those tracks have some of Kim Gordons best vocals on them. It has the beginnings of what make the Sonic Youth great. It's a record for Sonic Youth fans really, unless you like ultra lo fi recordings.

Idols is by far Sonic Youth's most awful record, followed by the nearly-as-awful Badmoon Rising. This record is one big heap of moody, sometimes almost scary guitar-clanging and yelling, lacking any kind of structure. Ánd if there finally is a song that comes close to being interesting, it is ruined by the ridiculous sound-\\"quality\\": it really sounds as if the band is rehearsing in a mouldy basement and someone has left his dictaphone there. The lyrics are the only good thing here, with it's wide variety of -often heavy- subjects, but the music ruins it all. I bought this when I was 16 and desperately in search of something different and experimental. God knows I was glad the day I sold this unlistenable junk and turned myself to their later records; because Sonic Youth is really not a bad band; they just used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a truely awful record","review":"Here's a riddle for all those reading: if you knew how to write truely excellent and involving melodies, why would you sit around making noise? The answer: you wouldn't. Hence, the Sonic Youth and this album. Simply put, this record is a terrible waste. None of the songs have anything even vaguely resembling what I'd call a structure or riff. Instead, they rely on one vast dissonant wave of feedback after another while the band shouts and screams various nonsensical hipster lyrics like \\"Sonic Tooth, Sonic Tooth\\" as loudly as possible. Most of the \\"songs\\" go on for way too long, and overall the record sounds like it was recorded on a shaky handheld tape recorder. In other words: pure elitist garbage. It would be years before the youth would be able to put together a good coherent song without making all kinds of gratuitous \\"experimental\\" indulgences and their first album was no exception. Avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God Is This Bad","review":"I pretty much think my heading sums up my feelings about this record. I bought after hearing how everyone proclaimed it be brilliant. Well, its not.Some people have remarked how scary, or nightmarish, this is. Well, the only way that this either is that fact that fifteen follars has to be slapped down to purchase this unlistenable album and that is fifteen dollars you will never get back(they only give you three for it at used CD stores).If you have gotten far enough to read this, then I guess I will tell you what this record sounds like: a guitar amp turned on, left with feedback only as background music, and bad beat poetry read over it all.Sonic Youth have a few good albums in their catolog, like \\"Daydream Nation\\", \\"Goo\\", Murray Street\\", but this is not one of those albums.

I give it one star for the vocabulary word list. It does not spend enough time talking about the all-important and very idiosyncratic ETS scoring algorithms. The real problem I have with this book, however, is with the way the CD-Rom is marketed. On the cover of the book there is a picture of a CD and it says \\"3 computer-adaptive tests.\\" But it turns out that the CD is only a portal to the publisher's website. There are practice tests on the website but, contrary to the verbiage on the bookcover, they are not \\"adaptive\\" in any sense. In other words, the difficulty level of the questions never changes, rendering the whole ETS scoring algorithm invalid. In fact, I'm sure they do not even use the ETS scoring algorithm, but simply count up right and wrong answers. False advertsing - ARCO/Peterson's could probably be vulnerable to legal action for this kind of deception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!

I bought the book because it stated \\"CD featuring even more practice questions and study tips\\" on the back cover. That's just another lie! The CD-Rom is superfluous and a waste of plastic, because it is essentially a web link to the publisher's web site (only 1.4MB of data on the disk! Utterly useless for a Mac user.).

With me, it is the part where the T-strap hooks into the ankle strap that digs into my inner ankle quite painfully. Loosening the strap does not work. I cannot even stand having these shoes on my feet for very long, let alone do any kind of extended walking in them. I am sorry that I ever bought these overpriced and very uncomfortable sandals.

These are the lightest sandals I have ever worn and are so super comfortable, I hope to get another good deal on them and order other colors! I also ordered the teva cork sandals and those are not as comfortable. I think it may be because the sole is not of the same thickness as the wonderful rubber but quite thin cork. I highly recommend these to anyone who has a lot of walking to do. I even think my posture has improved!

They felt comfortable when I put them on. They are a bit smaller than I'd thought they would be, despite buying my normal size. After the first day, I had a lot of left heel pain. Thinking it might be a fluke, I tried again, this time by adding an additional heel pad underneath my heels. While this made wearing them a bit easier, I was still in pain within an hour and by the end of the day, could barely walk. Anyone who has real trouble and heel pain issues might want to reconsider this sandal. So far, the sandal that works best for me is Skechers' toning sandal - the one with two thick straps across.

They have a great idea but the quality of the product is horrible. I bought my first clock and it started making this loud ticking noise 3 months after the warranty expired. The company generously offered to sell me a refurbished unti for a little less than a new one. I got the refurb thinking that my first clock was a one off. The replacement clock failed even sooner than the first. This time it wouldn't chime. I opened up the unit and the quality of construction is poor at best. They have a great idea and I loved waking up to the chime but I have issues with paying a premium price for something some poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Design","review":"I love this clock. When it works. But since it's an ALARM clock, much like a parachute, it's really only useful if it's reliable. I had one of these for years and when it started working unreliably, I thought it was just old, so I bought a new one and guess what? The brand new one was doing the same thing. The manufacturer would only offer me a store credit for one of the clocks even thought they know it has a design flaw: The batteries are laid out inside the compartment in such a way that they don't always make a good enough contact to power the clicker which rings the gong. This company is selling a product they know doesn't work correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor execution....","review":"I've been a meditator for many years now and I have always struggle to find a good timer that not only performed the function, but also had the pleasing sonic aesthetics that would not disturb my carefully cultivated mind states when signaling me.The Zen Clocks were that product. Not only pretty to look at, but pleasing to hear as well. It's a great idea, and the initial excitement of using the product would've made this review a 5 star if I had written it earlier.Unfortunately, they are overpriced and poor quality. I have owned two now, and both have stopped working, one within 8 months of purchase. If you are going to spend 100$ on a clock, you might consider how long you'd like them to last. If \\"less than a year\\" is good for you, then your set. All and all, I am disappointed.Granted, I use them quite heavily, and there are always bound to be bad ones in a batch, but two in a row is just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not reliable","review":"MUST use duracell (only product that I've ever had that was this picky on battery brand) and it has a .99 cent clock inside it which naturally is unreliable... great concept poorly executed, I would rather have paid twice as much for a good set of guts, it's a cheap Chinese plastic 2\\" clock mechanism inside.

They were very gracious about it and said they would replace it. It took over 2 months and many phone calls to get the replacement, which lasted less than a year (but 12 1/2 months from my original purchase, including the 2 months I waited for my replacement) before it completely stopped functioning. They were not so gracious this time and said it was out of warranty and I could buy a new one for $70 plus shipping. I expected that a $100 alarm clock would last longer than this piece of shoddy merchandise. I also expected to be treated with less double speak than I was by this company. I'd advise you to save your money and go with one of those nature sounds clocks. I did and am so much more pleased than I ever was with the Now and Zen rip off.

To me it was not a repair policy at all.Having two of their products both break within a year or so just does not seem right to me. I wonder how many other people have experienced the Zen clock's electronic works just stop working.Sincerely,Dom"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very cheap clock","review":"I just received this clock as a present, and it is a piece of garbage. It LOOKS nice, but the quality of the clock is poor. It's just glued-together wood.

It stopped working almost immediately, for no reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well made","review":"I had this clock several years ago. It worked a little over a month, then didn't chime. I tried to take it back, but since the 30 day period was over, I was told to mail it to the manufacturer which was not cheap. Since I wasn't really very happy with the tinny chime, I didn't bother.

I was hesitant because of the mixed reviews, quality issues, numerous reports of poor customer service and an F rating w/ the Better Business Bureau. But, I decided to take a chance because it seemed like the best made chime alarm clock out there. Well, it arrived today. They shipped it in its original box, not packed inside of a shipping box. The outside of the box was pretty beat up and it looks like it's an old box that's been re-used. Used or New? Can't tell, didn't even open it. Given the way they shipped it, there is no way I am keeping this. Sending it back to them tomorrow. Sad too, because I was thinking of buying a couple of them for gifts for special friends if the clock was as nice as I had hoped. Even though it is expensive, I was going to splurge if it was a really nice product. Sadly, the company lost not only my current sale but also potential future sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely alarm clock, great purchase!!!","review":"I would definitely recommend the Zen Alarm clock to others....it's a wonderful way to wake up in the morning : ) It's a soothing alarm clock instead of a startling one and it has a beautiful design also.

Luckily, I've been within my year's warranty each time, but the hassle is beyond frustrating. The most recent replacement clock they sent me is clearly used and has been refurbished. There's a nick in the wooden lid, it came with the batteries installed and battery cover loose, etc. It seems they're getting tired of replacing my clock...but not as tired as I am of dealing with them. Each time I get a new Now & Zen clock, I set it gently on my nightstand, and there it sits for about seven months, obediently ringing each morning, until the one morning it decides not to wake me for work. Battery replacement, turning it off and on, plugging it in, etc. -- nothing works. The darn things just seem to die of natural causes and there's no resuscitation possible...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could only have sold in a world before customer reviews","review":"We had our first Now & Zen digital alarm clock for less than a year when the LCD digits started failing.

You have got to be kidding me. N&Z, we paid $140 for what is likely $30 worth of parts. You know your stuff has quality problems.

Counting Crows fairly quickly fell into obscurity after this album, but it was--is a masterpiece. Very, very little filler here.

Other than their first big hit \\"Mr. Jones\\", this also includes \\"Round Here\\", \\"Omaha\\", \\"Rain King\\", and the closer \\"Murder of One\\". All these songs are excellent, and many of the others are just as good.

Other great songs here are \\"Round Here,\\" \\"Omaha\\" \\"Mr. Jones\\" \\"Blue Buildings\\" \\"Raining in Baltimore\\"-the latter two are slow songs filled with emotion--After listening you'll either want to smile or cry.All I can say is that this album will make you feel something for it if you give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent words at last!","review":"Finally, a generation X cd whose words pass the mediocre range!

Adam Duritz has an ear and a rhythm that few lyricists bother to develop anymore, and he sings with an intensity to match Bono of U2. Much has been made of Van Morrison's influence, but this disc belongs in a (slightly) different strain of music typefied by lesser singer-songwriters such as James Taylor and Jackson Browne. The album shares its strengths and weaknesses with those sorts: The better realized songs are highly personal and moving; the lesser ones are highly personal and self-pitying. Duritz manages to find a healthy balance between revelation and whining for most of the record, and it comes off well."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahhhhhhh Adam!","review":"Adam Duritz's voice is like ...having a 'good' cry...a a hot cup of tea, brandy in front of a fire with a lover, a warm slipper on a sore foot at the end of a hard day.

I have taken several opera classes in the past, and I have learned that one should be able to understand an entire opera from the music alone--all lyrics aside. The Counting Crows perfect this art in August and Everything After. If you really listen to the music, you can see that every song defines itself, even without the amazing lyrics (which are pure genius in themselves). I was disappointed in reading other reviews that no one really raved about Anna Begins, by far what I consider to be the best song on the album. It is such a powerful statement about love and falling in love that it sometimes can make me cry. Listen to it again and again, and then get the lyrics out and really look at what they're saying.

(If not, check it out...it's a classic, for sure.)I'm not wild about the demos that follow the album on disc one. I suppose they're notable for historical reasons, to show where the band came from.The live show on disc 2, on the other hand, is pretty spectacular. Supposedly, it's from the last show of the August & Everything After tour, a time I remember as being pretty difficult for the band (if the numerous show cancellations of the time period are any indication). The angst and energy really shows through...in particular, \\"Round Here\\" is as brilliant here as it's ever sounded.My Biggest Complaint: I only wish the Deluxe Edition series would go down in price. $24 for two CDs?

I have listened to this CD 1000 times and it still remains my favorite. Awesome song writting and vocals.

Great storytelling, great vocals, and great vibes start at the front and go right to the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"This set looks gr8 only in the foto. In reality, it has a very dull look. Not worth buying. I got 2 queen sets and greatly disappointed with this purchase from Amazon! Price is cheap, so is the quality of the Comforter set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If the price is too good to be true, it probably is!","review":"Just got this and took it out of the bag and immediately noticed the horrible stitching, the cheap underlining, the shoddy batting used (thicker in some spots, virtually none in others), and the coarseness of the top fabric. For the price, this would only be good for decorating an unused spare bedroom or worse.If you plan on actively using this comforter on your bed, I highly recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comforter set not a 'comforter' set","review":"The colors are much darker than the picture and the 'comforter' is not a comforter, it's more like a spread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too intense for younger kids; riveting for me.","review":"Creep's time travelling adventures may be too harrowing for younger readers; in the past he is subjected to apalling child labor (slavery) and physical abuse. However, this is an important subject for older kids. The book is intriguing and suspenseful, and will keep you reading so you will learn some general history in a uniquely concrete, real way. I couldn't put the book down; but I felt the end did not explain everything to my satisfaction, the novel's only drawback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and enlivening","review":"If you're thinking you'd like to get a boat and push off for more than a few days, you should defintiely read this book first. It's not a manual for sailing, but rather a manual for preparing to sail. It's full of the basic kinds of information that budding cruisers need to know to help them decide if the life is right for them, while still including enough detail about boat types and systems to show that you don't have to be a rocket scientist to cruise successfully. This should definitely NOT be your boat's bible, but it's a very good and entertaining start to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tips","review":"Over all I thought there were a lot of good tips and insight in this book. I do agree with a previous review that the author does tend to glorify wooden boats a bit. It was a good purchase, I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better books on this topic.","review":"I found the book to be like reading a bunch of commandements, \\"if you.... you will never go cruising\\", or \\"don't ever.... or you will never go cruising\\". If you like to be lectured to or preached at, you will probably enjoy this book. I, and I guess that I am like most people who would be interested in reading a book like this, would rather hear about other peoples experiences, and judge for myself how they might apply to my situation, than be told there is only one way to do things, and that is the authors way. A better book is Jim Howard's Handbook of Offshore Cruising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Overly opinionated and very preachy. If you need to hear that you ought to eat out less often if you want to save money for a sailing adventure then this is the book for you. One of the worst I've encountered. I mean truly nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"The book is in good condition. The jacket was worn and tattered, but does not inhibit my attention to the written word within. Also it appears it was once part of the inventory of a certain local library. All in all a very pleasureable purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Start","review":"It just seemed that some of the first few chapters were redundant; like pages were just trying to be filled to create this book. Around chapter 7, the book starts to open up to information about actually cruising and I am finding useful information from an experience and knowledgeable cruiser. But the first six were rough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book starts with a couple of very good chapters, but then goes downhill fast. Mr Trfethen is an ad man who jumps from point to point giving the reader the \\"sound bites\\" of his profession and then quickly moving on with little solid information. He's stuck with double ended, full keel boats who days of glory are properly gone.There are lots of well written text out there on crusing, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly opinionated and not highly accurate...","review":"The book does have some good points if you can wade through the fluff. His obvious scorn for all \\"plastic\\" boats and the manufacturers that build them is quite obvious. He makes no bones about the fact if you buy anything other than a wooden boat for less than $50,000 you're a fool. I still would have given the book three stars until I got to his section on batteries. In two wiring diagrams he showed a direct short across the battery terminals that would cook the batteries if it didn't burn the boat up first! Fortunately he admits he is no electrical expert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent presriptive work.","review":"Exellent prescriptive work by Jimmy Buffetts greatest pubicist.This strongly opinionated book concentrates on turning the cruising dream into reality.It looses nothing from this although Trefethens preference for wooden boats is a self indulgence which stands in the way of mass appeal.Pitched at the would be could be cruising sailor it provides sound practical advice on funding the adventure and the essentials in establishing and maintaining the lifestyle. Trefethen, a self confessed \\"parrothead\\"has a lot to answer for.I own six Jimmy Buffett albums since reading his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"self indulgent &very opinionated","review":"This book is so full of waffle and technical innacuracies, dangerous ones at that, see the chapter on wiring a battery. You either agree with his attitude or yours doesn't count. You must do this, you must do that. My way is best, no other way counts runs all through this book. He is uncompromising and dictatorial and I'd hate to crew for him. I also wonder if his family life is as described in the book as it sounds so soap opera stereo typical, incidents pulled right from a tv show. It is not much help if you don't have money as he writes from a position of starting off with a healthy amount. All in all there are many more interesting and accurate and helpful books on this subject"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a practical sourse of information","review":"Ok if you need som basic advice about making a decision to live aboard. Mostly it is posturing by the author and not much by way of real information, or thought provoking stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Date, Opinionated, Lots of fluff, no real substance","review":"The writer presents a great many generalizations, filled with opinions not backed up by any substance. A great deal of fluff but no real information is presented. Questionable guidance such as when rewiring the old boat you just bought remove your shore power connections because you're going to want to be like \\"real cruisers\\" anchoring out with them instead of docking at a marina. Financial advice is also along the same lines - save for 5 years, sell your house, you'll need about $3,000 - $5,000 per person per year - no mention of health insurance, etc. Fix up your boat as you go along - just shove off as soon as its sea worthy. The book is quite dated - with chapters on electronics amusing at best. Advice: Find a book that was written in the last year or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad News Waste Of Money!!","review":"Are you people deaf? I've heard better sound quality on a dictating machine!

However, there are two tracks with the same music, and there aren't important musics from the cartoon's soundtracks. But there are great music such \\"Astérix est lá\\" and \\"The Look out is out\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"I hate reading reviews of this book. They all generally go, \\"check this out. he's an undertaker, and a poet. isn't that wacky?\\" They point out the novelty of the author over the fact that he is an excellent author. In this book, Thomas Lynch eloquently discusses both halves of his lives. Every time a friend of mine tells me that he or she wants to be cremated i always try and disuade him or her by using the arguments Lynch makes in this book. A truly excellent read. One of the few books I have read more than once. I just read that he has a second collection of essays. I haven't read it, but i plan to include it in my next amazon purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A man's viewpoint on sex and death (and is there any other?)","review":"We are as fascinated by death as we are inclined to ignore it.This book offers a look into what we find fascinating, but be advised: there is no small amount of voyeurism involved and the authortakes a man's view which means that he has little sympathy for eyes other than his own. This is not Jessica Mitford.It's a male failing to fail to see things from a woman's point of view. Most women, who have learned since childhood to read as men read and to see as men see will likely not mind. Not overmuch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"There are some funny and insightful parts to this book, but overall it is depressing and not worth my time to read it. Lynch never tells too much about himself or his family, but can tell you all about the locals. He goes on and on and on until he returns to his main themes, so you never quite get to know his true self. He is very senstive and caring toward the people he must deal with and it makes one wonder if all funeral directors are as compassionate. You can definately pick up in any chapter and not have missed a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Secrets","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book that touches on the innermost fears all of us have about death and burial. In a setting in Michigan with which I am most familiar, having grown up nearby, I was taken back to times I had forgotten about, and thoughts of what lies ahead for all of us. A must read for those who need a good cry and a good laugh. I guarantee this book will evoke alot of memories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but disappointing","review":"A very well written book that is also very disappointing.

Gave my copy to a young mortuary arts student."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure this is a good book for some, but not me.","review":"I enjoy reading about the perspectives of mortuary science professionals. This book got way off topic on more than one occasion. Part of the reason the profession appeals to me is their unique perspective on death, so this really seemed like a bullseye for me.

I had no preconceived notions (didn't know who she was), so I could simply enjoy her heartfelt singing. There are many high points to this album, notably her sensitive reading of \\"The Twelth of Never\\" -- never heard such a simple and lovely rendition of this song -- as well, as \\"Have I Told You Lately.\\" The low points are primarily \\"(You Make Me Feel Like a) Natural Woman,\\" mostly due to the copycat backup and background vocals, and \\"Downtown,\\" which sounds uninspired. I know this is Jane's debut, and what else I've heard of her I quite like. Let's hope that her recordings get distributed here in the US -- why keep her voice and talent across the Atlantic (across \`the pond'?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction or supplement to Bourdieu's theory","review":"I wish I had known about this book while fighting my way through \\"Outline of a Theory of Practice\\". Bourdieu is a compelling social scientist and his ideas only look better after seeing them dissected and explained in this collection of interviews and speeches. Like \\"Power/Knowledge\\", a collection of interviews, speeches, and other works by Foucault, this work gives readers a \\"second chance\\" to enter an important body of theoretical work. Of course some chapters are more compelling than others, but the good ones are very good indeed, and I found soemthing useful in just about every one. If I had to pick an unforgettable passage in this book, it would be where Bourdieu explained why he writes in such a difficult way--it is on purpose! In sum: this book makes a terribly important but often difficult body of scholarship more accessible."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW THIS","review":"This product is educational and everything, but just at what it says under features...\\"Requires additional fee for this service\\".I suggest you pay attention to this because you probably weren't suspecting that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Frustrated Customer","review":"This has got to be the best learning toy \\"idea\\" yet. I love the concept of downloading new material as the child grows. I also love the idea that all four of my kids (ages 2 and up) can benifit from one purchase. Unfortunatley, it is still just an idea. An iquest, Imagination Desk, Leap Pad and Mindstation were all recieved as gifts two months ago. I promptly signed up for service online and waited patiently for my Leappond magazine and removable tray needed for the Leap Pad. It is now June and I am still waiting. Customer service only helped when a supervisor was brought in to handle my account. I was accused of lying and then hung up on. I am sorry I just read the reviews for these products. I may have returned them to the store if I knew how difficult it would be to get these toys up and running. Three months of my 6 free are now gone. I will rewrite my review if, when it does get fixed, the \\"idea\\" is still worth it. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective, but costly product.","review":"I bought the Leappad Advantage...which included the Leappad, MindStation, and a 6-month membership to Leap's Pond Magazine and Leap's Activity Sheets. This is an excellent product with great educational value, BUT only having ONE cartridge is really starting to get on my nerves. Luckily for me I only have one child using this 'system' and trying to work with only one cartridge is really annoying. The download isn't exactly what I would call 'quick', so having to download the sheets and the magazine's SEPARATELY (which can only be played with one at a time) doesn't even make sense. The MindStation should come with a MINIMUM of THREE cartridges to make it more convenient. I have read that additional cartridges are available, but I haven't seen any. And hopefully when I do find them, they won't cost me [alot]."},{"rating":"2","title":"UPDATE: The mindstation does not have a subscription cost any longer","review":"I haven't purchase the mindstation yet...but I am going to.I wanted everyone to know that I called Leapfrog today April 2007 and they said they used to have a yearly fee to download from their site after you purchased the mindstation BUT they no longer charge that fee.All you have to do is buy mindstation then you have unlimited downloads no extra fees.Call them for yourself.Alot of the previous reviews mentioned that charge so I wanted everyone to know the latest."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT COME WITH EVERY THING NEEDED.","review":"when I purchased this product it asked me if I would like to purchase the required batteries.

So my review is this, it might be a wonderful product if we were able to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Supported by LeapFrog","review":"This product is no longer supported by the company. Which means there are no downloads available anymore...I don't know why it's still for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindstation works great","review":"I read all the negative reviews and they made me apprehensive about buying the mindstation for my son's turbo twist spelling (TTS). Amazon also lists the mindstation as discontinued. But my 1st grade son has a spelling list that he'd love to have the TTS help him with; so i went internet searching and found the mindstation USB at outpost.com for [$$$]. received it, plugged it in to my XP PC's USB port, created an account on leapfrog.com, typed in my son's spelling list, and it works GREAT. I don't know what the fuss is about (maybe an earlier version didn't work well?) and don't know why [amazon] have the mindstation discontined, but it does the trick for me. i do not work for leapfrog - i am just a 'joe consumer'. recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What internet connection?","review":"While my son was thrilled to receive this as a gift, we were not prepared for the fact that the internet service would be down while they are upgrading. The message on the sight simply says \\"check back soon\\" with no information as to how long the site will be unavailable. With a brand new toy, why do they need to be down for upgrading? This should have been taken care of before the toy was introduced. We have, in effect, purchased a toy that you cannot use. Furthermore, there is no way to find out when the toy can be used. Seems like a waste of money to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this product!!!...","review":"I have never felt so ripped off. After buying two Iquests (one for each of my kids) and the Mind Station, I have discovered two things: 1) Mind Station doesn't work, and 2) LeapFrog doesn't give a hoot. I have spent HOURS on the phone with LeapFrog tech support, to no avail. I am now in the process of trying to exchange the serial port version (nowhere does this website show the necessary port connections) for the USB version. I've argued until I'm blue in the face. I'm not thrilled at spending the kind of money I have for the Iquests if they can't be upgraded with the Mind Station.In the future, I'll avoid anything made by Leapfrog. BAD company to deal with, and I doubt I'll ever trust them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings about this gadget.","review":"The Mind Station is helpful if you use all of the other toys. I liked it because I could put my children's weekly spelling list on it for the Turbo Spelling for them to practice each week. One of the downsides is that I had to buy an additional memory cartridge for my second child. Another disadvantage is that you have to buy a subscription in order to keep using it after the initial free 6 month period after purchase. So, I haven't seen my kids really using it that much since the inital month or two after it was first given to them. We have the Turbo Spelling and the Leap Pad, but only use the Mind Station with the Turbo Spelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Operator Error","review":"I have read most of the reviews of the mind station...I believe that the majority of the problem is, we as a society, want things now and do not want to read the directions and take the time to do things correctly. My experience has been problem free with this device. It works just as the directions say and it does not require an ac adapter. I have seen great progress in my son's test scores and he enjoys adding new material to his iquest. My advice is read the directions, follow the directions and take the time to do it correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mindstation greatly expands Leapfrog Toys' Capabilities","review":"This Toy is a wonderful addition to our Leapfrog set. I homeschool my 6 year old daughter and the Mindstation allows me to customize spelling lists for her Turbo-twist spelling, and download activities for her leap pad learning system. She loves playing with these \\"toys\\" and doesn't care that she's learning \\"schoolwork\\" while playing. She can log on by herself and download more spelling words if she wants to. We can also see how she's doing because the website creates progress reports.This was definitely a good investment! It was also incredibly easy to install! The Mindstation also works well with Windows XP."},{"rating":"2","title":"best educational toy we've purchased!","review":"The turbo twist spelling is a terrific educational tool, however, it is worth the extra $$ for the mind station. My first grader struggled with his weekly spelling tests. He was even put in a special group that only tested on half of the words. It really became a chore and he was getting discouraged. For Christmas he received turbo twist spelling and the mind station which enabled us to download just his spelling words for the week. He has scored 100 on every exam since then and scored extra points for challenge words as well!!! I am amazed at what a difference this has made. We have all of his tests since Christmas on the fridge. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!","review":"I recently bought a Never Ending Mind Station and blank cartridges off of Ebay, thinking that it would be great to upgrade the Turbo Twist games I have had for 2 years. What a waste of money! It was only after I had bought the mind station new in the box that I found out that LeapFrog doesn't support this device anymore. In fact, there is nothing on their site for this product except a section to download a owners manual in case you lost the one you have. After contacting LeapFrog on their Facebook page, I was told that there was no support or upgrades for this product anymore. What a waste of 20 dollars for something that has no use!I strongly recommend for any parent who sees one of these on Ebay or even on CragisList NOT to buy it.

Selections are limited, but the Activity Sheets are new every week, more selections are available as time goes on. The ability to enter a child's spelling word list from school into the Speller via MindStation has been a big help to homework.Downside: unit is very light without batteries (we use a 6V DC adapter) and easily slides around on the desk. Leap Pad does not offer an adapter which seems odd, as this unit will most likely stay in the same nook next to a single computer. However they are readily available so this is a minor concern. Cartridge must be removed and reinserted if website is closed and later revisited.Overall a quality product that delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of extra cost!!!","review":"The Leapfrog products are great and educational, but I do not like that after you purchase a product like the Turbo Twist speller you buy the Mind Station and then you have a monthly fee that is not heavily advertised on the packaging of this product.

There was only one cartridge with the unit they received for Christmas and I've searched the stores but cannot find other cartridges. In order for one child to use the cartridge, I have to erase information on there for another child. The other complaint is that the pages it prints out don't stay in place on the Leap Pad. Therefore, you touch the pen to the word or picture and it will tell you the wrong thing. You have to hold the paper perfectly still....one slip and you lose it! It's totally aggravating and had we not received it as a gift I would never had bought one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great teaching tool!","review":"At Christmas we purchased a Turbo Twist-Spelling and a Turbo Twist-Math for our 2 children (ages 8 & 11). After seeing that the kids really did enjoy using the products we decided to invest (A VERY SMALL INEXPENSIVE INVESTMENT) in the Mind Station so that we could download spelling lists and math problems from the LeapFrog website. Downloading the activities is as easy as ordering from Amazon.com!! As a teacher, I was so impressed to see that there was a fun way for kids to drill for their spelling tests and learn those so important math facts. As a parent it simplified the homework process. The kids can now practice those important skills in the car while travelling to after school activities or while waiting in the Dr. office! I am very impressed and can also find uses for these in a classroom. Thanks LeapFrog for the great teaching and learning tools!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leap Tray should come with Leap Pad!","review":"Like the previous poster I had quite the ordeal getting my LeapTray. In fact, it just arrived yesterday and now we only have 3 months left on our \\"Free\\" subscriptions. It's a shame that they just can't include it. I would strongly suggest to anyone ordering for Christmas that they go ahead to register to get the tray coming - i wouldn't want to wait for the after Christmas rush.That said, the Mind Station works great for the spelling words on the Turbo Twist. I wish I could put more in at a time - and that they had Abeka stuff in their preset lists. I haven't gotten to DL a Leap Pad activity since i need another cartridge.I too wish they would make more of the add-on's free though, or at least give you an easier way to add spelling words than thru the web site.But, the kids love the toys and that is what counts - shhh, don't tell them they are learning too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the cartridges?","review":"These are very educational toys, and my chlidren really enjoy them and cannot put them down. I purchased the Turbo Twist Spelling for my 8 year old and the Leap Pad Learning System for my 4 year old. The only problem I have with them is finding additional cartridges for the mind station. We have two toys and one cartridge. This has caused a problem with my children because they both want to use the cartridge. I have exhausted my search to find additional cartridges. If the cartridges were made available in toy stores, I would absolutely give it 5 stars. They are great learning toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to pay a yearly subscription fee","review":"To enter in your child's own weekly spelling lists on the Leapfrog Turbo Twist Spell you have to have a Mind Station and pay for a subscription to Leapfrog's online service.

Its a \\"fun\\" way to have the kids learn their words. But, we discovered you need more than one cartridge if you have more than one game or child. The cartridges stay in the toy till you want to download new words. So 2 kids with different words...thus, the need for 2 cartridges! Of course they don't mention that on the box.

On both computers in our home, we get errors telling us that the transfer was interrupted, check the cable connection from the Mind Station to the computer and make sure the cartridge is inserted fully into the Mind Station...both are OK.The Leapfrog help site states that this is caused by insufficient battery power but these batteries are BRAND NEW!

I thought it would be nice to be able to download new activities from home, so I bought him the mind station. I was, however, disappointed when I discovered that the choices of new activities include a total sum of two coloring books - both of which were too basic for him. If my kid can already count to a hundred, he does not need a toy that teaches him to count to three. Do not buy this toy for the imagination desk unless your child is starting from the very beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aggravated Grandpa","review":"While the lead pad is a wonderful toy for my 5 year old granddaughter, it has it's shortcomings. First, when you buy the mindstation, it comes with only one cartridge and no tray. Improvision here I come, scotch tape. Also, to print the activity sheets, you don't find out till you have problems that there is additional software you must download in order to print the sheets. I'm computer literate, and it took me 1 hour to print the first activity sheets. After that, it's a breeze. The tray should come with the mindstation--that's bogus that it doesn't. Also, where in God's name can you find extra cartridges. They are more rare than some art paintings. Get it together Leap Frog, and you'll have a great toy, but right now, you are aggravating many of us with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content delivery problems","review":"In regards to content for the Leap Pad, the concept is good, but activity delivery is terrible. I don't have a slow computer, but the activity sheets take forever to print, the audio tracks take all day to download, and it's simply impossible to get the sheets aligned on the Leap Pad toy. It would be a little less offensive if you could download audio and print the activity pages at the same time. It would also be helpful if there were better instructions available for aligning the printed pages on the toy. All in all, it's a lot of money for questionable content."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"As I had heard there was a compatibility issue with this product and only those items manufactured after August 2002 would be USB compatible, I called ahead to customer service to ensure this item was USB compatible.

The games bring back great memories and will be a treasured keepsake in my home forever. What keeps it from being five stars is the video quality for the Padres game is erratic, and the stats shown on the back for the 1999 Braves game differ. For the pitcher stats, it states Jason Grimsley didn't walk anyone when in reality, he walked two batters. Those flaws certainly don't prevent me from recommending this to all Yankees fans.

The band apparently left their instruments at home when they recorded \\"Back into Blue\\". The album is filled with poppish studio synthesizer which strikes this listener as both shallow and hollow.

Turn the dial and it will then tell you the music of the country. Another turn of the dial, and it tells you the currency, population, etc. Now touch another country or state, and it will tell you how far apart they are, how long it takes to drive it (or even fly on a plane!)It is a fantastic learning tool for the whole family.

In the middle of the game it starts the game all over and within 5 minutes of using it, it no longer accepts touch with the stylus.I am not sure if we should bother another exchange or not.

The formula remains the same with Harriet's angelic voice and David's jangly guitar. \\"Blind\\" is a masterpiece because it never tires the listener. In fact, you can listen to this cd over and over again and still think you heard just one song. In other words, the music is amazing and Harriet's vocals have a heavenly flow on every track. The lyrics are dark at times but always take you on a journey that only The Sundays can guide. My favorite tracks are \\"life and soul\\" and \\"24 hours\\" on this disc but they are all excellent. What else is to be expected from a group that has released just three albums in ten years but another amazing work from The Sundays with \\"Blind\\". You need complete your music collection with all their albums but you cannot go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fullfills the expectations created by their impressive debut","review":"One thing for which the Sundays deserve extra credit for is the fact that they have chosen to be melodic and abstract rather than catchy or easy .

Harriet Wheeler sings like an angel while her husband's sweet guitar compositions keep getting more and more fascinating as seconds go by .

Simply brilliant - neither of the other albums come close (although I love them both as well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wistful","review":"This is a chilling, wintry album with extraordinary power in songs like \\"I Feel\\", \\"God\\" (what a simple but effective buildup, what a performance) and \\"Medicine.\\" Harriet Wheeler sings harmony with herself more, while the essential elements that made the Sundays' previous album so important remain intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bland\\" would be a more accurate title","review":"Disclaimer: Big time fans of The Sundays should not read this review since they obviously will not like it. This review is for casual listeners to give them an unbiased account of the music on the album. Thank you.For the rest of us, The Sundays sophomore album is largely a snoozefest of interchangeable songs. If you've heard the band's one big original hit, \\"Here is Where the Story Ends\\" from their debut album, you know the drill; mid tempo accoustic rock augmented by Harriet Wheeler's little girl voice. The problem is that the band rarely comes up with a good hook to give its songs vitality. It is no accident that by far the best performance here is the rousing cover version of The Stones' \\"Wild Horses.\\" The sharpness of Jagger-Richards's songwriting makes the rest of the material pale even more in comparison.Overall, a bland period piece with one cover track to at least partially redeem it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of the three Sundays albums I keep with this","review":"So beautifull, so dark, so poetic, so sensual, so melancholic, what else can we say? how can we better express our sorrow for love lost? how can we be more nostalgic about somebody or self death as in \\"goodbye\\"? how can we express our sexual desire for someone as in \\"more\\"? or love ourselves as in \\"love\\"? like this songs theres a whole bunch of ways to express that kind of human feelings, this album is full of beautifull emotions and that make it so special , every human being with blood on their veins should have it if at least once in the lifetime has feel love, depression, melancholy, hope and sadnessHM"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD!!!!","review":"Why don't DVD of this movie????

The characters act like human embodiments of cartoon figures. Even the famous \\"hat scene\\" turned from a superb, amusing set piece into a bad clown act.The Marseilles scenery is magnificent, yet the whole is horribly stage-bound. Scores of super-close pictures of Horst Buccholz's face (in unmatching sizes) but not much of Leslie Caron's gracefulness and beauty. Maurice Chevalier is restrained and touching, but everybody else is in a high school farce. YOU MUST WATCH THE ORIGINAL: The Marseilles trilogy from the early 30s--better, funnier, more touching, a work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this time........","review":"I am afraid I cannot endorse this movie as I have endorsed the majority of the others I've purchased. It was fraught with silliness, drunkness, lust, and french immorality. It also has a typical ending with an improbable conclusion. I was hoping for more of the English type films which are the best. Fanny was very disappointing because she fell so quickly for the rich old dirty man.....who by his own admission at the end played the adulterer. This was typical (dirty) french poetry.

People forget that bands that were playing then (Tool, Nine Inch Nails) also had a lot to do with the way coontemporary rock is played.

I really thought it was going to be a dog. But, being such an extreme fan of the original, I was still looking forward to how it would be. I was especially irked by the removal of the skill system, a system that I thought made the game more like an RPG instead of just a first person action adventure game. After I played it, I was very impressed. It looks graphically stunning, has even more player freedom than the first Deus Ex, and even more endings. I loved playing through this game. It is a bit easier than the first one, but still squarely in the right range of difficulty to maintain my interest, but not make me too frustrated that I get killed in the same area over and over.In the final analysis, this is a spectacular game much like the first, but the original Deus Ex is still my favorite game of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool but not the best","review":"If you liked the first one you will like this one.But do not I repeat do not buy this for your child thats it short and sweet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Ted, Shoddy!!","review":"What a waste of time buying DX:IW was.

It's HORRIBLE, absolutely horrible. I can't beleive it, they so blatantly cater to the console gamers, but WE made this game big.It works out, i guess, pc gamers get crappy ports of Grand Theft Auto, because that belongs to console.

DX1 had huge levels. The graphics are sweet, but c'mon, all the levels are in darkness. I'm sick of games doing this \\"darkness\\" thing, I spent practically the whole game in nightvision mode. The time you'll get out of this is alright, but I only got about 15 hours, DX1 took me over a day of game time to finish. I'm not a huge fan of cinema scenes, but DX2 doesn't even have one!

As a game I was very disappointed. First of all, I wasn't able to move the pointer to select anyoptions. Only in game play was I able to move my character. Secondly, instead of just collecting ammo, I was forced to pick up the same weapon multiple times which used up the space of my tool belt. If one gun ran out of ammo then every gun was out of ammo. That was just a waste of space. I also felt limited by the small selection of tools. Not even the cheat codes would entirely work. For example, the unlimited ammo only gave me a few extra clips. The guns themselves were not even very good. The sniper rifle didn't \\"snipe.\\" The clips were very small in the ammo capacity and the shots were very weak.

Basically, this game lacks so much of the depth, intelligence, and COMPLEXITY of the first game, I can't bring myself to keep playing it.

The most revolutionary thing they did in this game was put in the console market nowing it it is going to sell well becuase it has a great name.

Despite this, they have decided to allow other NVIDIA cards to work with the game, although they are worse than the card that they don't allow. I'm going to start a holdout on Eidos merchandise because of their idiocy with system requirements and bugs in the games, and i would reccommend you do too. This game cost me 50 bucks, and if i were you be sure you check every square inch of the game before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was so excited to get this game for christmas...Unfortunately, I did not read the fine print on the back of the box.Heck I bought this computer less than a year ago, should run the game right?WRONG!!!!This game is VERY selective about the graphic cards it will play on. Unfortunately, I now have a $40.00 coaster... or I can invest in a new card.I am wiser now, I won't buy an Eidos game anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even worth stealing","review":"The first game was great and iv played it at least 10 times. but this game sucks the gaphics are not great theres maybe 2 hours of game play and the ending is the same as the last game.

But what happened? Well I don't know but this just isn't the sequel to Deus Ex that I was hoping for.First off Alex Brandon's soundtrack to DX 1 was the best of any game I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. It was perfect for the game but it is just a let down here. They also did the unthinkable by taking away the points system. The levels are too small as well, and where in DX 1 there were so many ways of advancing in a level, IW is pretty straight forward comparitively speaking. This game was a total let down for me and as much as I wanted to love it, after beating it several times I just couldn't. And Gameplay? What gameplay? If you are thinking about buying it and really loved Deus Ex 1 you might want to skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashing Disappointment","review":"One of the best PC games ever (Deus Ex) has been ruined in a lame-ass console port sequel. The maps are tiny because they were simultaneously developed for XBox, which only has 64 Meg of Ram. Similarly, the outdoor environments are claustrophobic, and there's never many characters onscreen at any one time. The text is HUGE (again, lame-ass console port) and the gameplay has been dumbed down. The story is interesting, but so many off-topic journeys are possible that you completely lose track of the through-line. Buy CHROME instead, the awesome and exciting sci-fi PC shooter which is the game INVISIBLE WAR should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"in answer to your question","review":"I'm the US editor for this book, and I wanted to answer the questions below. It was brought to our attention late in the game (by Oliver Sacks, no less) that zinc (I believe) was known in Asia before phosphorus was known in Europe, making the latter the 14th element discovered on a world-scale. However, because the book has a European focus, and there phosphorus was #13, we decided to keep the title as it was.Naturally, I'm rating this book with 5 stars not just because I want to sell lots of copies but because we wouldn't have acquired it otherwise. It is great fun, especially the material on spontaneous human combustion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana's Incesticide","review":"This is Nirvanas 3rd album.Its some of their more early stuff.Its got at least 5 really great songs on it. The picture on the cover is something that I think is pretty cool. The name is a little wierd but its from Nirvana so youve gotta love it.There is a remix for the song Polly on this cd which is a great song off their earlier cd Nevermind.The best song on the whole cd is Anyerism which has cool lyrics and sounds great.This isnt the best cd from Nirvana.In Utero is the best cd they ever made but its from Nirvana so I like it.Its worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the reviewer below me-","review":"-Why did you review this? You've probably never even heard of this album! And if you're going to talk about that 'Appetite for Destruction' hairmetal bulls**t then go talk about it in a review for that album. Well I actually like 'Welcome to the Jungle' and 'Sweet Child o' Mine' but that was all, hah! Now I'm reviewing the album! But seriously dude, I'm almost positive you've never thought this existed much less even listened to it, this was not a big album, it didn't even go platinum. You probably saw it right next to Nevermind and decided to give it a horrid review just because it was Nirvana! One thing: LISTEN BEFORE YOU REVIEW!About this album: I actually enjoy it, it isn't my personal favorite of the bands but its still good. I recommend it for die-hards and other big Nirvana fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm over 13, just dont wanna sign up","review":"This album was made to \\"get rid of all the false fans who liked us only for smells like teen spirit\\" as kurt said once. While it helped, it didnt reach their goal. Kurt kept encouraging people to NOT buy their albums and go to their concerts. He didnt like the feeling of being \\"too famous\\".Well, this is a good album nonetheless. It has a few songs from older albums. The songs sound a lot more like bleach, not in utero or nevermind. My personal favorite is sliver because it is very fast-paced and the lyrics are,though repetitive, very fun.Downer,from bleach, is still a great closer. I feel just like kurt. Too many people only like nirvana becuase of nevermind and smells like teen spirit. Please, put down nevermind and listen to incesticide. If you like it, and be honest to yourself, you are a true fan. If not, then go back to your little shell and listen to lithium a 1000000 more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Nevermind","review":"I thought Incesticide showed a much more raw side of Nirvana that I prefer. The Molly's Lips cover and Anerurysm are awesome. It is also cool because it contains some of their late 80s stuff as well as some more recent stuff w/ Grohl @ the drums.Good stuff...well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Nirvana","review":"How can you tell true Nirvana fans from the majoral posers? Ask a true fan what their favorite Nirvana album is and their answer will probably be \\"Incesticide\\". Why? Take a listen. This album is \\"grunge\\" at it's finest moment. \\"Dive\\",\\"Aero-Zeppelin\\",\\"Sliver\\",\\"Turnaround\\",\\"Stain\\",\\"Big,Long,Now\\" & \\"Anuerysm\\" are some, if not, the BEST songs by the band. I have owned this CD since it came out in 92 and it still continues to blow me away. Do yourself a favor, if you don't own this CD, get it! Who knows? It's not a very popular album and I'm surprised it hasn't been discontinued. So get it now while you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM SUCKS","review":"This is really a horrible album from a horrible band. If you want to listen to real rock the try some Guns N' Roses."},{"rating":"1","title":"sickening, painful","review":"Nirvana is the worst band to ever have the misfortune of being put together. Kurt Complain, or whatever his name is, is painful to listen to. I (as well as alot of people) measure a musician, by ability to play and ability to create. People, Kurt has neither. If you want real rock, get Appetitie for Destruction by Guns N Roses."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST formaly released Nirvana album of all!!!!","review":"This album is defenatly the best one of the 6 formally released. Its raw and different than what you might hear from Nirvana on some of the other albums. This album includes some of the best Nirvana songs like, 'Dive', and 'Anuersym'. And some of the most unique tracks such as,'Hairspray Queen', or 'Big Long Now', which were rarely played live. A Nirvana collection isnt complete without this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"well this album is great. from dive, to stain, to sliver, to the rest. this albums is great. from the early nirvana to the popular nirvana. super catchy songs like aneurysm and sliver. they were just great. they did an amazing job with covering molly's lips and son of a gun. those songs sound incredible. nirvana was amazing. and will ever be. this album is pretty good. big long now is ..wow. awesome. they're all good. this album really deserves those 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"my nirvana collection","review":"this is an album full with rarities and good songs, i enjoy it to much, and i need it to replace the old one that i lost with this"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Nirvana cd of their career.","review":"This cd kills.

Best song is Dive which can be played over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some ok songs...","review":"INCESTICIDE got some decent Nirvana songs like DIVE, ANEURYSM and Sliver...but is by far the worst album by nirvana...Nevermind and In Utero are good albuns, but this one and their debut BLEACH are really not so good...Well, the nirvana mania is totally unexplicable...i think if someone deserve to be a Grunge legend, it got to be Alice in Chains, 100 times better than nirvana..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana Compilation","review":"Incesticide was released to capitalize on the mammoth success of Nevermind. The album collects early singles, b-sides and outtakes. The album was most people's introduction to the fact that the band had released music prior to Nevermind. The album's first two songs, \\"Dive\\" & \\"Sliver\\", made up the band's first single. They are both short, but extremely powerful. The album contains some incredible work in addition to \\"Dive\\" and \\"sliver\\", most notably \\"Aneurysm\\". The song is a furious workout with squealing guitars , feedback, power drumming and amid all the noise, an incredible catchy melody. Other strong cuts include \\"Molly's Lips\\", \\"Beeswax\\", \\"Stain\\" \\"Hairspray Queen\\" and \\"Been A Son\\". There are some forgettable numbers like \\"Mexican Seafood\\" and \\"Aero Zeppelin\\", but overall, Incesticide is better than your average compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY Nirvana experience...","review":"This was MY Nirvana album I was listenening to in Jr. High... Nevermind was great, but that was the polished up multi-platinum monster that made them famous, everone heard \\"Come as you are\\" or \\"Teen Spirit\\"... but these were the gems to me \\"Dive\\", \\"Sliver\\" \\"Mexican Seafood\\"... those songs are the ones that take me back... to the good ol' days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont listen to it if u dont understand music","review":"This is by far the best album by Nirvana. Many people enjoy the more radio friendly songs but thats just because they dont understand music. The album goes from an upbeat beginning to a rather somber ending and can play with your emotions like no other Nirvana album. The guitar playing flows along with the moods as it goes from rather simple chords to a little more complex as the album progresses to its more angry side. Anyone who wants to here real music should listen to the last 5 songs or so on this album. Most people just dont understand how music works and dont get the pure ride of listening to the music. When u begin to understand music, then buy Incesticide. Otherwise, stick to the horribly awful music of the present."},{"rating":"2","title":"WEIRD BUT GREAT STUFF","review":"This album is fantastic,it's a break for all of those Nevermind super popular songs,the stuff on this album is very rare and really cool,songs are weird and dark,which is good,this album has been underrated but it's really good,take a time to listen carefully to it and realize how beautiful is all that guitar noise and screaming,it's awesome,i highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's ok, but...","review":"the album is fine. it's loads better than most b-side albums. it's not as good as any of the albums that came before or after it, which is only to be expected...this is a collection of bootlegs and b-sides, after all. But I am obligated to say that \\"Hairspray Queen\\" is one of the greatest songs - EVER - by Nirvana, and that it should have appeared on \\"Bleach\\". Novoselic's bassline is completely toked out, and Kurt's vocals are, shall we say, interesting. To be precise, he sounds like a pig having sex. His guitar is okay, and Channing's drums are cloddish, which add to the song's tone. It's great. You could buy it just for this song, but there are other good ones. Find them for yourself, though. Rating - 4 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"this is a really good collection of nirvana leftovers and b-sides. but this is no half-assed compilation. it's a roaring journey through cobain's disturbing world, where innocense and experience walk hand in hand, particularly on songs like, 'sliver,' and, 'aero-zeppelin.'probably two of the best songs on this album are, 'molly's lips,' and, 'son of a gun,' which are both vaselines (a terrific but obscure scottish band), covers. these new re-workings don't even compare to the originals, and sound completely different.unfortunately, this album has it's share of dross as well, particularly the pointless punk-rock version of, 'polly,\\" (compared to the spare beauty of the original. overall, a very worthy purchace"},{"rating":"2","title":"1, 3, and 5 stars...","review":"A handfull of essentials, a handfull 3.5 stars, and a handfull of garbage.Don't feel like you fail as a fan if a third of what you hear on this album makes you feel like it was a waste of your money. Die hard fan or not, no one should feel compelled to like an album just because they like the band. Songs like Sliver and Aneurysm own hard, and a couple songs like Dive most fans of the band will like. There's also some garbage mixed in though that only hardcore-nothing-Nirvana-does-isn't-totally-awsome-fans would really enjoy.Bottom line: Either find a cheap used copy, or listen to the tracks online and download the ones that don't blow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for the hardcore fans!!!","review":"Okay now lets get something straight! This album is only for hardcore Nirvana fans. If there's fans(like me) who likes Nirvana's 1st album \\"Bleach\\", then they would like \\"Incesticide\\" too, there's no doubt about that.Kurt Cobain couldn't put all the songs in Bleach so he had to put them in Intestiside, but all the songs from Bleach and Incesticide were written together."},{"rating":"1","title":"More misses than hits...","review":"Although Incesticide contains Sliver, Dive, and Molly's Lips (by the Vaselines) which are all excellent. The rest of the CD however is not very good at all. Some of the songs are too boring or repetitive. Fans of In Utero might like this one, but if you like the great melodies and excellent lyrics of Nevermind and Unplugged you should skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nirvana changed the face of Rock--For the worst!","review":"What a gyp! The only good song on here is Aneurysm! The rest is awful, tuneless noize muzak! I think I'll pass on this one, and every one of Nirvana's plethora o' peddlings of Crock Pot Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor !","review":"Nothing else to say, the only good cd from this band is MTV unplugged.The music of Nirvana is far superior in acoustic version in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"DDDisguisting!!!!!!!!!!! Where's the 0-star slot????","review":"That \\"song\\" Beeswax is disguisting. It says that Kurt has got his...omph spayed! It has all sorts of other bad and offensive lyrics. Hairspray Queen is a perverted and irritating noise. Mexican Seafood is bad too. Complete with lyrics that refer to a yeast infection and Kurt's health problems (foot fungas,dandruff,diahrrea,etc.). So don't get this CD. It's gross. And it's the one with the warning sticker and explicit lyrics, not In Utero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"...along with a rocking version of \\"Polly\\". Not too much to say, but if you like Nirvana this is a gotta-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but may not be everyones flavor","review":"This is a good album. But it is not as polished as the bigger albums such as Nevermind or In Utero. It is not nearly as pop like as the others but It has some things to offer. If you are an off and on fan then you may not care for it much. It is much closer to the the sound that was coming out in the beginning days of \\"grunge\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"In my opinion, the best Nirvana","review":"This album went by so fast in the 90's, that I barely remember it coming out. Luckily, a friend picked it up recently at a second-run store. This is in my mind the best Nirvana album I've ever heard. It's more punk than the poppy Nevermind, more avant-garde than the fairly New Wave In Utero, and it's funny. Kurt did have a sense of humor, it's just that sometimes he got packaged otherwise. The liner notes are great too, giving a little taste of some of the things Kurt was thinking before In Utero.When I was a kid, Nirvana was the big name, but Pearl Jam was my band. The heroin induced pop of Nevermind wasn't as appealing as the soulful Eddie Vedder. Now that first Pearl Jam CD sounds overwrought, and In Utero and this CD actually sound like music for adults. Give it a shot, but unless you like the stranger, more dissonant side of music, you probably won't like it.Mexican Seafood is the pick of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grunge at its Best!","review":"This CD is one of my favorite Nirvana Albums. All the songs are very good and really shows the talent Kurt has for creating genious songs. The CD has some punk influence however has many great Grunge sounds. I believe this CD is the best pure \\"Grunge\\" CD ever! And I really reccomend it to any Nirvana fan as well as good rock music fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A softer Nirvana CD","review":"This is one of my favorite Nirvana CDs. It is the least \\"screamed\\" Nirvana song, although Dive is very loud and energenic. Sliver and Aero Zepplin are some of my favorite softer Nirvana songs, and are on this CD . If you are a hardcore Nirvana fan, this is a great CD, sort of the opposite of Bleach, and equally uncommon. If you want a more broad spectrum of Nirvana songs as a begining for listening you would probably be more interested in Nevermind or In Utero."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Compilation, Flexing Their Strongest Muscles","review":"Surprised to see the mediocre reviews, I consider this one of the best representations of Nirvana's sound. It begins with about ten short, fast punk tunes, all repetitive but very dancable - then you get some of their more complex, deeper tunes with lots of twists, turns and vocal surprises. Much better representation of their early years than BLEACH, and a great example of what they are capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"I found this alboum great!

Of course, no one resource will give you EVERYTHING you need for a certification exam, so I also recommend taking some practice exams.

I bought it because I like Christian Kane and that's the only reason it earned a star. Granted the two actors in the movie had a lot of dialogue to memorize, but this was like 2 people talking to each other throughout the whole movie, I thought there was going to be action. Five minutes before it ended it actually decided to add a plot to it and quite frankly the surprise ending made me think, 'WHO CARES?\\" and \\"I'm glad it's over\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing attempt at noir","review":"Main problem is that the plot doesn't make much sense, and the couple at the center of the action are not very engaging, or even interesting. The strongest part of the movie is the 'ghost town' setting in the second half, but a lot of this potential is squandered by meaningless 'twists'. The ending is unconvincing and unsatisfying, as well as leaving an unpleasant taste behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor editing and straight-to-dvd acting","review":"Wound up watching this one night when I had a bad bout of insomnia. The whole plot didn't make much sense. The writer should have spent more time on the script. I would chock that up to mediocre writing and bad editing. Miner and Kane's characters were not as developed as a viewer would hope; and, yes, I agree with many others that Miner's attempt at a Southern accent was poor. When I got to the end of the movie, it actually took me a few minutes to figure out just what the hell happened. The whole \\"are they, or aren't they dead\\" thing was just dumb. All the earmarks of a straight to vid movie: lame plot, bad acting and a gratuitous sex scene -- that somehow didn't show a whole lot (go figure).In short, skip this one. You'd be better off watching Warren Beatty's 'Bonnie and Clyde' or even \\"Last Man Standing\\". This one is for hardcore Kane fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hide","review":"This is one of those movies you aren't sure how it ends. If you are a fan of Christian Kane you will like it. It's a film that you go on a wild ride with a guy and his girl. But, there is a darkness to it that you can't tell if it's real or dream. Christian does the part Billy really good kind of scary good. Rachel does an awesome job that you can't tell who she is because she is Betty. The best way I can put it is the film is Bonnie and Clyde meets Silence of the Lambs. Sounds weird I know but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerzees 50/50 Safety Green Tshirt","review":"5 stars, fast shipping. Just what I ordered.

I was finishing high school on Oahu when Keola and Kapono was starting the revival of real Hawaiian music and would go into Waikiki to listen to their show. The music still gives me chills.

I remember my first time hearing Undone- The Sweater Song back in 1994. I thought it was quirky and cool and promptly went out to get their CD. And when that one recently got scratched up by my young daughter, I went out to buy another copy. Yeah, it is that good.Undone, Buddy Holly, and Say It Ain't So (my very favorite) were the singles and they are great, but so are the remaining tracks. In fact, if Only In Dreams wasn't eight minutes long, I would have wished for it to be a single. I love the slow build up and the memorable bass line to this song. Holiday is another good, upbeat song.Get this album if you liked any of the singles off of it. I doubt you'll be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"putting the weez, ease, tease and yes please!- into weezer","review":"this is an absolutely amazing album. the material for all of the songs whether the instrumental, the lyrics or all of the emotion each member puts into his work-- is what makes this album one of the legends of legendary alternative music. this album is best for those first getting into weezer. the songs are fun and catchy but also reveal more of the emotional side of weezer that isn't shown as obviously in their later albums. although pinkerton is my personal favorite weezer cd, blue is better in different ways. blue is the cd that makes weezer fans weezer fans but pinkerton is the cd that keeps weezer fans weezer fans. this is really a phenomenal cd, and i really don't say that often. for the people who are just getting into weezer, this is the cd you MUST buy first and for those wondrous people who have already discovered the benefits of weezer-blue is a must-have in your collection!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome music for the ages","review":"terrific songs like \\"buddy holly\\" and other hits define this album as a classic. They are a really good band, and if you want one cd of theirs, get this one. There is a great \\"vibe\\" (I hate that word) about it, making it a classic cd for anyone and everyone. These guys know how to rock, thats all I have to say. I am occasionally a little put off by the emo-type complaining on some songs (I hate emo music a LOT) but these guys make it work by making good arrangements that don't emphasize dumbness. A very worthwhile cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Blue Album: Where it all began","review":"Weezer is my favorite band. I started liking them as soon as I bought this CD, their first effort, which was released in 1994. Each track is excellently written and sung by lead singer Rivers Cuomo and played just as well by the rest of the band. At no point does the album become monotonous or repetitive; each track has a distinctive sound of its own. I recommend this album as one of the best I have ever listened to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece","review":"I bought this cd the other day because I decided to give Weezer a chance. I'm very glad I bought it. This album is gonna go down as being one of the most important albums in history. Everything on it is amazing. \\"Say It Ain't So\\" is breath taking. The lyrics are works of poetry and the guitar solo is one of the best I've ever heard; it's simple, yet the sound of it is just great. BUY THIS ALBUM! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Amazon purchase and it still works 12 years later","review":"Which, is probably more than I can say for most purchases I've ever made. Times have changed a lot but this song is still on my iPhone (I didn't even have a cell phone when I bought this - my dad just had a car phone). Music is a personal taste of course so reviewing CDs seem a bit odd but the Blue Album is probably Weezer's second best after Pinkerton. I'd recommend it anytime you're looking for the drive down the 90s memory lane. Of course these days I'd say buy it electronically and have it instantly but that wasn't and option back in the day. My only negative to this product is that these days, I don't even have a CD player anymore ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"permant resident of my discman","review":"This is my 2nd time puchasing this cd.

Undone, and Buddy Holly are classics. I can still remember seeing those videos in 94 for the first time and this being the first album I ever bought and I still listen to it. Much better than any rock you will hear these days. The lyrics are genius, the music is genius, The singer (Rivers Cuomo) is a genius. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite cd, to date","review":"I got this cd when it first came out, i was 13, and it was the first time I ever got that warm feeling in my stomach from listening to music.

Many hardcore fans would probably ridicule me for deciding that this CD was catchy and had good melody. However, I now believe that this CD, the Blue Album, is not only the best Weezer CD available, but more importantly, perhaps the most important CD of the 1990's.Rivers Cuomo has a talent many music-writers can only dream of. He has, in my eyes, created 4 (5 if you count The Lion and The Witch, their live CD) albums that are flawless. Every track on this CD, especially, has its own.. soul.. if you will. It is not lyrically bound to any stereotypes of the other songs. Every track, such as the catchy Buddy Holly, to the awe-inspiring In the Garage, sounds awesome. Pick this one up if you don't have it.=w="},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU CAN\\"T TURN IT OFF!!!","review":"this cd is amazing.

This really brought back memories of the new wave-punk of the seventies and eighties, and this CD was executed with all the passion and intensity of the times - with no 90's waffling or overproduced [stuff]... that permeated so many similar sounding bands of the time.Give these 'weezers' a try if you are still a fan of the power-punk-pop thing of the late 70's early 80's (my high school daze).

And aside from their radio-friendly \\"Buddy Holly\\" the other tracks deserve a chance as well. When this album first came out way back when i was a seventh grader, I didn't even like them. I was basically sick of the buddy holly/mary tyler moore schtick...Now, however, 6 years later and much wiser, I can truly appreciate them....and myself...if you give this album a chance, you won't be disappointed...yet it you are, just put \\"Say it Ain't So\\" on continuous repeat!

Very catchy songs that will stick in your head for days. The one disagreement I have with many other reviewers is that this is an upbeat peppy, album. Interviews with the Cuomo will reveal the same. I'd say about half of the songs here relay quite a bit of sadness, disillusionment, and heartbreak (which make them better than the throwaway lyrics on some other songs). This album is more sludge metal-pop than punk-pop (which I can't stand today).The additional material on this album- some of it is worthy like \\"Suzanne\\" and \\"Jamie,\\" but other tracks seem added just for curiousity factor. Check out the Deluxe edition of Slanted & Enchanted as a model for how additional material on reissues should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blue Album Rocks!","review":"It's been almost ten years since this album was released but I have never grown tired of listening to it. The song melodies are catchy and the lyrics are thought-provoking. The Blue Album is one of the best works to come out of the mid-1990s and was the perfect alternative to grunge. In my opinion, an outstanding collection of songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"When Maladroit came out earlier this year, a lot of people were buying it and raving about it. I had never really heard Weezer before (except for \\"Keep Fishin'\\"), but I thought that it was worth the money to give it a try. A friend of mine who has liked Weezer for a while said \\"No, start with the basics. Buy the blue album.\\" I bought it, and it is great.Every song has a certain feel to it, and they're all fun to listen to. Some are more upbeat (\\"Buddy Holly\\" \\"No One Else\\"), and some are more on the slow side (\\"Only in Dreams\\" \\"Holiday\\"), but I gotta say I love them all. Yeah, they are somewhat on the simple side, but if you actually listen to them, they all have something to say. Rivers Cuomo is quite skilled with a pen and a piece of paper.The best song without a doubt is \\"Only in Dreams\\".I love this cd.

With songs like \\"Say it aint so\\" and \\"Only in Dreams\\" you never want the cd to be over. I think this cd is a perfect blend of different kinds of music.

A job well done weezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"if you own only 1 weezer album this would be the one. personally i like \\"pinkerton\\" slightly better, but \\"blue\\" appeals to a wider audience i think. every song on this record is great, although \\"surf wax america\\" isnt one of my favorites. but i know many fans like it. my personal favorite song is \\"say it ain't so\\". i just cant get enough of it. everytime i hear the intro to this song i smile because i love it so much. and something about Rivers voice just gets to me. its so unique and amazing and i cant get enough. everyone should own a little weez."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"In the Garage\\" - Grade A garage rock","review":"This album was an excellent debut for Weezer. With only 10 songs, this album is as good as an album with 18 songs. 10 tracks, 10 good songs. Without this album Weezer wouldn't be where they are today. The highlights of the album are \\"My name is Jonas, Undone-the Sweater song, Say it ain't so, In the garage, & Only in dreams.\\" I'm not saying that the other songs weren't any good, they just weren't as good as the songs that I just mentioned.

If you are reading this and are considering buying your first Weezer album, buy this one.

Everyone knows \\"Buddy Holly,\\" but I think \\"Undone-The Sweater Song,\\" \\"Say It Ain't So,\\" and \\"Only in Dreams\\" are even better.

Weezer has got a great beat that has been working since 1994, even if this was there first and currently as of 1999, their latest CD. Say It Ain't So's melody has a lot of feeling in it, that I can relate to. Undone is a song you can sing over and over, and what to say about Buddy Holly? It speaks for itself.If you like Weezer, Try some Starflyer 59, and some Sunny Day Real Estate.

It's ridiculous. After hearing the first couple of songs it's like there was no energy. Yes Buddy Holly was excellent. All of the tracks sound the same,[...]Trust me this cd isn't anything special.

Every song that Weezer has ever released as a single has been pretty good or at least decent. I know Im gonna get told off for this one but Weezer is the like 90's version of CCR. Rivers is a pretty decent guitar player, well when he tries anyways.This album has three songs that I like. I got this because of the song 'Buddy Holly' I love that song, and its a really good song, not a searous song by any means but a pretty good song. 'The Sweater song' is alright and 'Say It Aint So' is the best song on the album because it is the one with the most supstance to it.All the songs on the album have pretty good guitar work like I said but its nothing to listen to repeatedly or anything but its worth getting for 'Buddy Holly' and 'Say It Aint So' wait never mind I still wouldnt recomend getting this album I would just say wait for Weezer to come out with a greatest hits or a best of."},{"rating":"1","title":"weezer ain't that good","review":"yeah whatever. This album is not a classic by any means, and people are saying it's the group's best ever, so i don't think the group's that great either. Best song BY FAR: Say it ain't so. All the others are either sub-par or just bad. By the way, you should listen to Nirvana if you want real grunge."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather crappy C.D.","review":"It would seem that Weezer's recent track \\"Beverly Hills\\" is one of few I like from the group, for this album didn't really appeal to me at all. In many cases, especially for track #9 (Holiday), the lyrics are hugely lame, sometimes trying to fit the word \\"anyway\\" into one syllable, or choosing the topic of destroying sweaters. Despite this, I was able to mildly enjoy two tracks on this C.D., one of them being \\"Buddy Holly\\". This tune is a blend of hard guitars and a melody somewhat similar to Waltzing Matilda. Once again the lyrics are pretty uninteresting, but the progressions and all are fairly good. This song and many of the other tracks are actually very similar to The Ramones, for the chord progressions used are often simple, and when combined with the vocals have a very comparable feel. I would definitely not recommend Weezer's blue album, for what this band is doing on it isn't all that exciting.Recommended tunes:Buddy HollyUndone- the Sweater Song"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boaring, Inain","review":"This is one of those cds that gets a five star rating because the only people who would ever bother looking it up are the handful of people who actually like it. People who don't like this type of music genneraly havn't heard of Weezer (rightfully so) and those who do, gennerally opt to listen to MUCH better bands in the same genera (ie: Built to Spill, Sunny Day Realestate, heck even Modest Mouse). Do yourselfe a favor: if you came here to give this album glowing reviews or to (ack!) actually by it, go check out some of the aforementioned bands just to see how truely boaring and uninspired Weezer realy is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experience!!!","review":"This transaction went like a charm!!

There intricate mold of garage rock, and airwave friendly popish sound is absoulute brillance. Rivers Cuomo(Vocals) has a noteable sound that brings emotion as well as a sort of comic blend in his lyrics. The entire album is a giant hook from the begining, it never once puts down the extremes of the melodies they provide. They prove that not only can they put out catchy songs about whatever and make it good, they can also have an 8 min ballad that causes you to listen to every bit of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"A very nice, polished CD that is good from beginning to end, from \\"My Name is Jonas\\" until \\"Only in Dreams\\". The little sticker on the front always has 3 or 4 of the hits, but all 10 songs deserve to be on that sticker! Features catchy songs like \\"Buddy Holly\\" and \\"Undone-the Sweater Song\\", you'll definitely be pushing repeat on your CD player! A must buy for any rock fan. I didnt know what type of music i liked until i bought this CD, and now i know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic down to the small print","review":"In the early ninties, it was all about MC Hammer and who could have the biggest flat top. From these trying times emerged a band truly devoted to the rock scene. Weezer is a band known for it's catchy lyrics and deep thoughts. With some amazing guitar riffs and lyrics that relate, the band puts together what can be called their best album. This album has sold consistently for the past 8 years, proving it's strength through time. With ten songs including the hit \\"Buddy Holly\\" this CD is sure to please anyone.

The \\"Blue Album\\" is one of the tops in this genre. Right from the anthemic \\"My Name is Jonas\\" to the beatiful yet hard hitting \\"Only In Dreams\\", the listener gets hooked in, and they never let you go. The release of the deluxe edition is really neat. The second cd is filled with awesome nuggets of weezer goodness, some not previously available on disc, and others that are just plain awesome. I heart Weezer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer is the bomb","review":"Let's face it, about all these reviews have come to the same conclusion and that would be that this CD is the best. With that out of the way I'd just like to say that I for one am glad that Weezer isn't extremely popular and aren't all over MTV and the radio. This kind of overexposure kills the music the band becomes all about image and it seems like everyone is a fan. When a band has a smaller but strong following that isn't just following some trend like all those Ricky Martin fans that's when you can measure true musicall success. That your fans will love you even if you aren't the most famous or best looking. Well I hope this makes sense and I got a little off topic but anyways Weezer rules 'nough said"},{"rating":"2","title":"just great","review":"This cd is awesome. Just as the other reviews mentioned, it's hard to classify them. That's because they play what they feel, and it sounds good. They're just fun songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"say it aint so! \\"","review":"(laughs) ok, ok! I know im some one who likes metal but i realy love weezer i been to one of their concerts and i realy enjoy it! I mean its music so i guess i have the right to like both deathmetal and this genre of music, right ? Well, i think so ! I realy enjoy the song \\"say it ain so\\" great complex sound with some nice 80's guitar soft riffs!! Laters !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This is great!","review":"If you are a Weezer fan and/or a Blue Album fan, than this is a must have. The first disc is classic but it's the second disc that makes this worthwhile. The second disc is awesome. The music is right in line with the rest of the style of the first disc and rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good music","review":"I'm mostly a classic rock fan stuck in the 60's and 70's, but Weezer caught my attention upon immediately hearing them for their talent at writing hooky pop songs.

Did not return the item because not worth enough to return. Waited two+ weeks to arrive.

Beware when buying from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing - it couldn't grip me","review":"A big fan of thrillers I reread this book that I owned when I was young. It couldn't hold my attention. The language is vague, the characters unclear. The plot is in itself interesting but I found the book overall fragmented. My conclusion surprises me but hey, it is what it is ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the odd title?","review":"I love Ludlum's work. It's very gripping and has me reading well into the night until my eyes redden and tear from exhaustion. Trevayne is no exception. Very intricately woven, meticulously detailed, engrossingly complex. Excellent characterizations.My only gripe: Why oh why, Robert, did you not title it in the same format as all your other books before and since?!?! You could have called it \\"The Trevayne Commission\\" or something like that. Now instead it sticks out like a sore thumb amidst your prolific output."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lesson in American Finance","review":"This book would have been more suitable as a graduate level business course text book rather than as a \\"suspence\\" novel. It was boring. Although Ludlum is a favorite author, this boring attempt at suspence took him down in my estimation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"This book actually demonstrates that Ludlum can develop a character and have him or her be more than flat. Trevayne is well done. Besides that, the plot is great and is backed up as always by Ludlum's incredible gift for research. Read this book with no qualms."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This book was slow to start, boring in the middle...and I just couldn't get enough interest in it to finish it. The premises are dated and the constant politically-incorrect comments on race and gender were jarring. There really isn't enough story, good writing or interesting characters here - yes, a waste of time. There are so many good books out there - this just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Ludlum","review":"Ludlum dashed off this novel in a high dudgeon over Watergate and published it under a pseudonym. Better for his reputation if he had never admitted his authorship. As others have said, the plot is not believable. And parts of the book are about as interesting as a bank examiner's report. (I finished the book only because it was the only one I had on the beach.) Aside from his laborious pacing, Ludlum fails to show much, if any, understanding of finance and business; his descriptions of the villain-company's ledgers are filled with meaningless and unrealistic jargon, making them impenetrable. His descriptions of political relationships are nearly as nave. Ludlum should stick to the thriller parts, where his writing is truly gripping; in this book, the best part is where Bonner stalks and \\"disables\\" the Mafia heavies."},{"rating":"1","title":"too boring.. too lengthy","review":"Got frustrated reading this book. No pace. Not for Alistair McLean kind of readers. You can easily quit reading this book even if you are in the middle. I only completed it for the heck of it.. wonder why I started reading it at all. I should have read Detective(Arthur Hailey) instead. Would have insured I finish it in the same night, rather than spread it out over almost 2 weeks, as Trevayne did. However, Trevayne and Bonner did make a good combo. Both had a great character. The only interesting points in the novel are when these two are in conversation or Trevayne is with Sam. Nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next best thing to being there!","review":"I can not understand how you can sell this terrific seven cassette box set for so little money. I do however think that you should list it under the travel section and include it in your BoxSet Special Category which you do not. I think a lot more people would see it. I originally saw this series on my local PBS station WXEL - This is an excellent primer on the British Isles and I used it as a blueprint for my last trip there.Mr. Evans is superb as is the photography and the choice of subjects-it is more than a travelogue-it is a history, social study, and an equisite photo journey all wrapped up in one great series.I highly recommend it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing and funny","review":"Listening to this book I found myself laughing. The essay regarding his first sexual encounter had to be the funniest of them all. Ford has a way of pointing out the abserdities of life and the oddities in people. I like the fact he is a down to earth kind of guy and a true gay man. this book however would appeal to both gay and straight alike because it is quite funny. The only thing I did not like about this audio production was the two songs included at the end of each section. I would have preferred another essay or two in place of the songs. Still I enjoyed it and hope there will be another volume on audio. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"Terrible. I LOVE alternative music, but this trash is hardly worth listening to.I understand this is \\"experimental\\" and \\"innovational\\" but it is a loose can of worms. None of the music is melodic. Some of the riffs are pretty neat with interesting rhythems and intruiging sounds but when Thurston Moore or Kim Gordon (who was 39 when this was recorded. Waaaay past her prime if you ask me) tries to sing, it all falls apart.The guitarists are very, very talented and deserve recognition. But, honestly, I can't see how they can't be like the Pixies and be talented but produce GOOD and LISTENABLE music at the same time. I gave it 2 stars because \\"Drunken Butterfly\\" Is an awesome song and actually worth listening to all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Plain and Boring","review":"This album is really lame, predictable and boring compared to most of their stuff. It's hard to listen to the whole way through, it's just too boring. You should probably check out some of their older stuff before thinking of buying this. Then, listen to some samples or download some songs before making any big decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"Clearly I'm far too closed minded for this album. If I wanted to listen to people screaming and crashing and banging completely out of sync I'd open my window at 5am while the neighbors are screaming at each other again and the early-bird construction crew is cutting concrete outside my apartment while the garbage truck is slamming the dumpster onto the pavement repeatedly. Absolutely no musicality, no message, NO TALENT.If I wanted to hear this I could go down to the local foundary yard and listen to them cutting steel.. FOR FREE.I could go into a blow-by-blow for each track on why it's musical murder but that would be a grand waste of my time. Horrible.This is one band that the indie snobs made it \\"uncool\\" to dislike, so everyone looks around like \\"wow this is flippin genious\\" while in their heads they can't believe that everyone else likes them and they don't. GET OVER IT. You want arty music, go listen to Sigur Ros or Godspeed you Black Emperor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish Fulfillment","review":"This is an album full of different styles of songs, using three vocalists, and provoking a wide range of emotions.Most of the songs are just outright exciting, full of fast, loud guitars with weird tunings, and with vocals that perfectly fit the music.There is more than just noise in these songs though, with some showing a delicate and intricate structure, such as Theresa's Sound-world and the haunting beauty of Lee's vocals on Wish Fulfillment.Both of those transport me to a different world full of wonder and mysticism.There are tracks that grab you, and make you want to join in despite yourself, Drunken Butterfly and Chapel Hill being fine examples, and more traditional rock efforts such as Sugar Kane with its Stones inspired riff.Whatever mood I am in, this album has something to fit it, and I always regret that it ends after 59 minutes.There are so many great Sonic Youth albums that it seems a crime to pick a favorite, but if I were pushed, I would choose Dirty."},{"rating":"2","title":"noise made beautiful","review":"this is my favorite sonic youth album.'91-'92 were great years for me in music,in that so many great albums came out during this period,most of which i have or will rate eventually.\\"100%\\",\\"swimsuit issue\\",\\"drunken butterfly\\",\\"shoot\\",\\"sugar kane\\",\\"nic fit\\",and \\"on the strip\\" are my personal favs.if you like noise done right and haven't checked out this band yet than i would start here.if you like this than you are bound to like others like \\"goo\\" and \\"daydream nation\\".many have taken gordon and moores cues and used them as if they were their own.never forget where it came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER","review":"Seriously this album is uncompromisngly good, never gets old. If you don't get it keep listening. It's quality stands up to the Beatles even. Far and away Sonic Youth's Best album it is definately, with Nevermind, the two most important albums since the Beatles broke up. No Lie. A Must have for every teenager, whether they want it or not. I mean...Swimsuit Issue!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Strong CD from one of the best bands of all time","review":"now first off if your are new to sonic youth or you want to check them out i actually say get this over \\"daydream nation\\" or \\"sister\\" this is a great album and u can hear the major difference of what being signed to a major label does. this is the easiest sonic youth album to find by far. now to the real purpose i wrote this review this cd is great dont get me wrong, but i much rather prefer the stoner-noise-confusion-riot-mayhem sound of \\"bad moon rising\\" or \\"confusion is sex/kill yr idols\\" to this if you have heard sonic youth before and you love the sons were they go into the weird noises and odd guitar work and tunings than totally go buy those two cds listed previously. sonic youth is one of the best bands ever, and dont put them out till you give them a chance they rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy SY is a good SY","review":"After the failure of Goo (musically rather than commercially, of course), Dirty finds Sonic Youth riding the wave of the grunge movement and disposing of the half-hearted 'noise-rock for the masses' attitude of its predecessor. But as they showed on Sister, hard and fast suits them just fine, and here they employ that tactic while also mixing it up with epics such as the beautiful 'Theresa's Sound-World'. Overall, a satisfying listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Sonic Youth Album","review":"Dirty is the best example of Sonic Youth under a major label. This album, unlike those preceding it, isn't a collection of songs that have a central feel to them. It's just a collection of songs, most of them good. This album is also the most basically song structured album, another result of them signing with Geffen. Some of the highlights off of the album are the incredibly catchy Sugarkane, the political Chapel Hill, and their single 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Youth at their best.","review":"This album is the perfect mix between the strange ambience of \\"Daydream Nation\\" and the pop sensibility of \\"Goo.\\"It is Sonic Youth's most diverse album and the only completely unlistenable song on here is \\"Nic Fit.\\" (where sonic youth decided they would discard Butch Vig's fantastic production and produce the track themselves, it is only 56 seconds long and i still can't get through it. [you'll have to hear to understand.])Thurston Moore, Kim Gordon and Steve Shelley all give their respective best performances here (Wish Fullfillment, Drunken Butterfly and Chappel Hill (which is arguably Shelleys best performance compared to \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\" on E.V.O.L.) respectively). The band together also gives their best performances on this album, the beautifully sombre \\"Theresa's Sound World.\\" and the unbelievably cathcy \\"Chappel Hill\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 100% great buy, Favorite SY album","review":"\\"100%\\" one of my favorite tracks written for a dear friend of theirs that is no longer with them is amazing. \\"Wish Fulfillment\\", \\"Sugar Kane\\", \\"Purr\\", \\"Drunken Butterfly\\" are all very good tracks as well. To sum it up in a few short words this is the disc that got me hooked on Sonic Youth. Some of the best lyrics I've heard from T. Moore. Definetly a good all around album with great riffs good melodies. If you like Nirvana, Sex Pistols, The Descendents, I think you'll love SY Dirty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The building of a man.","review":"I like the flow of the book. This book show what life is really like. A young man put in a position that had to other posibility but to make him a HERO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes Nowhere","review":"Maybe this book gets better towards the end, but I could only slog through the first half before giving up. I feel like there is a story in there somewhere, but it gets lost in the half-statements. I almost feel like you have to read this book twice - once to have everything explained, then again to understand all the cryptic statements made before things are explained.The characters are largely interchangeable. I put the book down for a few days, and when I came back, I couldn't tell who was who.I probably would have liked this book if I could figure out what was going on. Since I couldn't, I decided it wasn't worth the frustration to keep going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Good","review":"I'm not sure if I could honestly say this is my favorite Drake book, but I'd be hard pressed to come up with one I liked more. The action of course is top notch. (It's a David Drake book so that's sorta a given.) However it's the mental process' of the characters that makes this superb.If you've ever read any of his short stories set in \\"The Fleet\\" universe then you have some understanding of exactly how dark David Drake can write. There is a very similar feel to the characters in Redliners as in those short stories but with one twist. In Redliners there is redemption for the soldiers, a sort of fighting through purgatory to reach grace type of thing.It's truly wonderfully done and i'd recommend this novel to anyone even mildly interested in military sci-fi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus on the Shell Shocked","review":"I really liked this book. When it comes to action (which all the guys seem to feel was well done) I'm kind of non-discriminate. What I realy liked the book was the psychology of the Redliners. To the reviewer who gave it one star below because of xenophobia & a battle against \\"gooks\\"--this is Sci-Fi, they were \\"Spooks\\" or \\"Kenandru\\" dear, and if you read further you discover they are limitted by their psychology to see the war with humans as only all or nothing. Also, the guy who killed the school kids was nearly psychologically destroyed by it. The way he \\"deals with it\\" in the final chapters had me in tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Dave says","review":"I've known Dave since the early 90s. He used to say that the Reaches trilogy was his best book, but since writing Redliners, that's what he points to. He and I both have heard from combat vets about how healing this book is. I put forward that it can help anyone who has suffered any trauma. As Dave says - because it shows 'you're not alone.' Of course, if you aren't into realistic warfare scenes, you wont' be reading Drake. The cover painting says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Drake left out a plot","review":"I have read only a few of this author's work, this one was disappointing. In the chapter entitled Into the Fire the redlined troops finally capture a live Kalendru, and they interrogate the alien. We, the readers, learn how .any aliens landed on the planet, how their aircrafts also exploded, how the plant life killed the aliens and other drival. In the next chapter we learn the humans are looking for a \\"door\\" to an underground chamber that holds the key to \\"turning off\\" the flora trying to kill everyone. Supposedly the humans got this info during the interrogation. HUH????? This was not in the interrogation!! I am supposing the author slipped up. Then in the last chapter before the epilogue we find many children of the Kalendru are with the humans. Again HUH?? Then then book ends and we have now idea what happened to the colonists. Again HUH?? How are we to rate a book with no apparent ending?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drake writes a excellent book","review":"Have read books before which pit a small group of people against seemingly insurmountable odds but Drake's attention to detail and character development makes the book a keeper....Have read others he has written for the Honorverse and they are also entertaining and keep your attention.Did not want to put this one down....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Very few books do I give up on and quit reading them but Redliners was one of the few. I read approx. 1/3 of it and it seemed like it was stuck in a black hole going no where. I tried, really I tried but just couldn't seem to stand the boredom and finally gave up. Maybe if I had continued to read it might have gained some speed but decided that there are too many good books to read to continue to waste time with this one. Would not even recommend it to the most dedicated sy-fy reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"A good read by a good author. I do like David Drakes novels. The plot and action make you want to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent SciFi with a twist.","review":"The idea of the jungle being the enemy was a new concept. A excellent read while showing the problems of veterans and the fears of the civilians towards veterans. A real page turner. A must read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly great but felt cheated with the ending","review":"I liked this book. I liked the hard scifi, military action and creative alien enemies. Author had me engrossed through most of the book with a very creative plot and colorful narration. First chapter had me hooked and I invested in the book and enjoyed the read until the end. There isnt and ending really and no payoff for the reading investment. It strikes the me author had to make a deadline and wrote a 5 page ending to wrap up the prior 300 pages. I was so invested and wanted to know where things were going I felt cheated and angry after reading the conclusion and can only give it 2 stars. Investment in a couple of chapters to provide a comprehensive and satisfying conclusion would have made this a 5 star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action-filled novel with veterans of war as the focus","review":"Redliners starts with riveting action that continues to the last page. The characters have depth that is often missing from novels whose primary focus is the effect of war on the human spirit. Only in the last two chapters does the overarching plot become clear. Drake could have dropped a few hints along the way to spice the imagination. The novel could be easily translated into a screenplay, and likely would do well at the box office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegatables made easy!","review":"I own a copy of this book which is absolutely in tatters because I use it so much. I would like to order a couple for friends and a new copy for myself because it is a favorite. It is grouped by season, by vegatable and every recipe I've tried ( and I don't think there's but 2 in the book I haven't tried!) is a winner. I have a large garden and often turn to this book when I have a glut of a particular fruit or vegatable. The receipes are for real people faced with the what to cook quick and easy question we face every night. Where else could I find a recipe for everything from spaghetti squash to pesto? I own a ton of cook books but this one has the most down to earth, easy to follow and realistic recipes I've found in a long time. There are very few recipes with odd ball ingredients that you would have to purchase specific for that one dish. Try it!

I also don't recommend plugging in 50 for aesthetic reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check it out of library, but don't buy it","review":"Though I have read and thoroughly enjoyed other Agatha Raisin mysteries, The Terrible Tourist is really a terrible book. Lots of sad drinking and sad sex, combined with very little plot make this book both boring and discouraging. (You may have murderous thoughts about Agatha before you finish!). If you must read it, check it out from the library. You won't want this one on your shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible is right!","review":"After reading this book I would swear off Beaton forever if it weren't for the fact so many people seem to enjoy them. This was my first shot at an Agatha Raisin book, and it was terrible. The cast of characters was unbelievable. Agatha follows her ex-fiancee to Cyprus. She follows him around moon-eyed and sulky because he doesn't receive her with open arms. She spends the whole book acting like an attention-starved puppy. James treats her badly, insults her, belittles her and she still goes back for more stomping around and getting angry when he doesn't fall at her feet. As for the actual mystery, it was a little more plausible, but still took way too long to solve. The book could have been much shorter and still gotten the point across. I hope her other Agatha Raisin books are better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a miss","review":"Although I've read all the Agatha Raisin books, I'm not a fan. This one is easily the worst of the series. If you want to try M. C. Beaton, read the infinitely superior Hamish Macbeth books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded, predictable, labored","review":"The other reviews of this book have pretty much covered the story line. M C Beaton is struggling to make a story out of this murder, and she labors too long over it. Agatha has too many close calls that are not believable and a story line that is full of holes--any detective in real life would have solved this murder in 24 hours. M C Beaton, like so many other popular authors (e.g., the old Robert Parker), is being forced to write books at too rapid a pace without time to properly think out the story line or do the necessary rewriting. I will miss Macbeth and Raisin if they blunder off into stupidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agatha Raisin and The Terrible Writer(s)","review":"I have read every book by the author \\"M.C.Beaton\\" and I must say that since rereading \\"Agatha Raisin and the Terrible Tourist\\" I am more than convinced that M.C.Beaton must be a pseudonym for Multiple Contributors Beat 'em. The writing style of this book is not the same as other Agatha books. This one reads like a travelogue. It also is from a male point of view. The plot is boring,the characters are shallow to the point of stupidity and even the reasoning doesn't fit our Agatha. I've done some research on this author and still feel that the Agatha novels are written either by several contributors or \\"the author\\" has a split personality! This novel is not even related to the good Agatha stories. If any of you fans out there can clear this up for me, please do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and full of inaccuracies!","review":"Boring, predictable, and full of inaccuracies! I would definitely not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was disappointed!!!!","review":"The story line is well explained above so will just commit on my thoughts. I did not enjoy this book as well as the others. Agatha and James move on to Cyprus and leave the friendly place of Carsely. I have come to like the local characters in Carsely and missed them being in the book. The conflict between Agatha and James is beginning to remind me of a \\"Soap\\" on TV and I don't like that. I also can do without Charles, he is a pain, in my openion. Hopefully Ms. Beaton will move the next book back to Carsely and the people I have come to like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I Read It?","review":"I can't review this book yet as I have not read this one.I read the reviews because I am up to the 6th book and feel I must read it to fnd out what is going to happen with James and Agatha. I left Agatha at the airport, leaving for Cypress.I love the series, however, after reading all the reviews, I am not so keen on reading \\"Agatha and the Terrible Tourist\\" but I don't want to miss out on any thing so read it I will.I am getting tired of Agatha's obssession with James. I really wish she would get over him already. I find it very painful to read and, at times, annoying.I like Agatha, but do hav a problem with her drinking and her nastiness. I like that she is outspoken, but sometimes she is just plain rude.I love the village, love the characters who live in the village, and I love Agatha's cottage, would love to visit Cotswold.I'll come back after I have read the book, with my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING Book, You have to read this!","review":"My review probably won't make a difference since I agree with everyone else that this is an amazing book. I usually make my purchasing decisions based on the number of reviews, so I just wanted to throw another one in to boost the ratings.The story is so incredibly told and the characters are so complex that you're completely surprised that the write could fit so much within the page limitations of the book. A Must Buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like verbal abuse, this is your book!","review":"Pros: The book was short so the assualt on your senses were minimal. The sex scenes were good, if you're into that.Cons: Even though he never physically hit her, the verbal abuse was bad enough. He actually called her a B@#$% more than once! How the hell is that romantic? He treated her like she was someone off the streets but referred to her as his wife in the same breath. He actually called her a \\"slut.\\" They bickered and fought throughout the entire book. At the end, I was left with the feeling that maybe it was better if they stayed apart. His family didn't like her, she didn't like his family and I wonder if they felt anything other than an erotic lust! He was aggressive and high handed, yet the reader is to believe that she just succumbed everytime he touched her? Oh puh-leeze!"},{"rating":"2","title":"recommend","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The character of Isobel is a very strong willed character with an acid tongue. In a lot of romances novels I read the women characters are so weak and needy it makes me want to hurl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I remember this well, this was when MMA was still being called the term NHB(No-Holds-Barred) and examines fights around the world. You see glimpses of true Vale Tudo in Brazil, where headbutts, knees and elbows really don't have the rulings and restrictions held in UFC and Pride, and is closest to a street fight as there are no gloves. This is the highlight if you can't seem to find fights from Brazil.Fights around the world here in bare knuckle MMA, showed the interviews of each fighters mentality in the ring/cage, and their backgrounds.You'll see originators here, Frank Shamrock, Enson Inoue, Randy Couture, Kevin Randleman.It's a look into early MMA, the views before UFC blew up onto basic cable reruns, and is violent in examining the growing pains. You can tell these were the early years as today most professional fighters are very well balanced in all aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite NHB docs","review":"One of my favorite NHB docs. Got a good length to it and its pretty entertaining. The enson section is my favorite, dude really had the mind of a warrior.

Awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely worth the time it takes to watch!","review":"not only was this poorly done as a documentary, most of it seems to play out as a wwe promo video with lots of a-typical aggressive rap and \\"metal\\" music playing during most match highlights. this video is not even close to being as professional, atmospheric, and entertaining as \\"the smashing machine\\" and \\"choke\\". altogether it may be worth a rent (depending on if you think you can tolerate the horribly overdubbed music), but is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH BUYING!!! the only redeeming quality about this dvd is the interviews with some of the fighters like jackson, cotoure, and randleman- but then the film turns right around and portrays a meat-headed view of the sport. not good at all. anyone with a camera and access to the fighters could have accomplished the same product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable, thought-provoking novel.","review":"When I first saw the title of this novel, I laughed aloud. After finding out a little about it, I was hesitant to read it. I worried it would be more depressing than comic. Now that I've finally read it, I want to say how touching it was. Stein writes very well and this strange but wonderful novel is a true gift. It was one of those rare books that had me fighting sleep because I wanted to finish one more page, one more chapter. The ending is a delight -- written with such clarity, it could stand on its own apart from the novel. Can't wait to read \\"Touch and Go\\" -- short stories by Stein!

His idea of innovation is to go a little crazy with italics in unexpected places. Readers feel flattered, unthreatened. Moody is a \\"safe\\" writer--he'll never take you any place that might unsettle you. The occasional comparisons to Cheever and Updike are especially troubling, because as a stylist Moody has few discernible gifts other than the colloquial crispness one associates with overexcited magazine features. Moody is not a major writer. That he is mistaken for one, and promoted as one, and accepted as one, says a lot about the decline of literary fiction in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best thing that's been written in a long time","review":"Rick Moody is certainly a giant in literature, up there with Delillo and Pynchon.

It's not as bad as some of the other customers here have noted. It's not as if the guy has no talent. It's just that there's nothing remarkable about the talent. There's nothing original, nothing striking. He's earnest, sure, and that should count for something. But he's also trivial. This is a book of trifles. It's a book you can read fast--even skim--with full assurance that you're not missing anything.

So I picked up a paperback copy of \\"Demonology,\\" thinking that it would be equally engaging. I was wrong. I couldn't make it past the first few stories, they were all very thin and flat, and as I was reading, I couldn't help but think, \\"Who cares?\\" The first story, \\"The Mansion on the Hill,\\" was unbelievably slow and tedious to get through, the same was true as I gave him another chance and started reading the subsequent stories, hoping in vain that things would get better. A real disappointment. I would drift off as I was reading, and could have skipped pages and still known what was going on in the plot. A very empty, unsatisfying read.

They're the literary equivalent of someone whispering in your ear when you're trying to watch on a movie, they jolt you from your absorption and leave you unsure of what is going on.Second, this collection is very uneven. A few stories are very good, several are passable, and many are downright infuriating to try and grasp the point of. I don't believe \\"literary fiction\\" has to wear its incomprehensibility and pretentiousness like a badge of honor, in order to garner admiration.Thirdly, the characters have little to no depth, with the exception of a few narrators. We get their physical descriptions, what music they like, and where they shop, yet nothing about what they believe in, what they enjoy doing in their spare time, their political stands, etc. Brand names do not a multi-dimensional character make.My recommendation: Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the 3rd or 4th worst writer of his generation","review":"The most appealing thing about this book is the candy on the cover. These stories are, in a word, dull. No memorable characters. No gripping--or even mildly interesting--plots.One editorial review in praise of this book is telling. It calls the collection \\"finely crafted\\" which I suppose is roughly equivalent to praising a movie for its cinematography: it's fine if you're in to that sort of thing, but don't expect too much in the way of entertainment.In my opinion, it's Rick Moody's \\"style\\" that is largely to blame for the crappiness of this book. A guy in a chicken suit crashing a wedding ought to be interesting. But in Rick Moody's meandering, digressive prose, even this quirky scenario manages to become quite tiresome.If you enjoy overblown language and slim plots, you may enjoy this book.

This book is also worth reading if you just want to find out a little bit more about, mainstream alternative versus underground punk and / or no wave.My only gripe is that I wish the author would release another edition that goes past Sonic Youth in 1994.

Considering the price, and the ridiculously short run time of the DVD, this is very poor value for money - especially when you consider there's a second volume that could easily fill out this disc.

Should have known it was too good to be true. I'm not sure who recorded this or where they got the Marc Bolan vocal tracks, but this is NOT true Marc Bolan/T. Rex music. These are someone else's arrangements of Marc Bolan/T. Rex songs, using the vocal tracks (some of which are very poor quality, sounding like a transister radio held up to a cassette recorder's external microphone) and dubbing them with new instrumental arrangements. For example, \\"Jeepster\\": fun little rock song, right? Not on this album! It's a slow, romantic ballad with cheesy keyboard and electric piano. Truly awful! I broke my copy in half and threw it away! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An abomination, must be heard to be believed","review":"Marc Bolan was a startlingly unique talent, marrying Tolkeinesque whimsy with stripped down rockabilly hooks. He deserves a career spanning two-disc, charting both hits and worthy album tracks. Unfortunately, what we have here are T. Rex classics featuring horrendous overdubs, obviously added during the last few years. The effect is similar to the Hank Williams recordings MGM issued in the sixties, featuring syrupy strings and percussion. This compilation should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Buy!","review":"As manager of \\"The Oktoberfest Webring,\\" I am always on the lookout for CD's of good Oktoberfest music. For the most part, this particular CD fills the bill quite nicely. It features 42 selections, giving a total of about 53 minutes of music. All but three of the numbers feature a joyous mixed chorus, ably accompanied by a typical German oom-pah band. In my opinion, three numbers really do not belong on this disc because of their unusual instrumentation and arrangements. Even so, I give this CD two thumbs up, as it will, on the whole, provide excellent background music for any Oktoberfest celebration or German theme party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock album of the past 10 years","review":"The only bad thing you can say about the Arc Angels debut album is where is the follow up? Double Trouble came together with Charlie Sexton and Doyle Bramhall after the death of SRV and made the greatest rock album of the 1990's. Every song is catchy and rocks. Definitely a stranded on a desert island pick. Hey guys, put this band back together!! The parts are great, yes, but the sum known as the Arc Angels must pick up where it left off!! Please!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arc Angels LP","review":"Simply amazing! This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

His guitar playing and vocals were awesome. All I could say was \\"who is this guy and why havent I heard of him?\\" Needless to say, I checked the web and found that he was a member of the Arc Angels. So I tracked down this album and it is great Texas rock. Stevie Ray would be very proud with his rhythm section hooking up with these 2 great guitar slingers (Charlie Sexton is the other). I will highly recommend this album to my friends. My 2 favorite cuts are \\"Living In A Dream\\" and \\"Sent by Angels\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly talented, soulful true rock","review":"This is a CD for rock lovers with heart & soul.....already a classic. It is in my CD player all the time; I listen over & over & over. As with other \\"supergroups\\" that only resulted in one release before disbanding, it is without compare. Amazing musical talent coupled with sincere, soulful yet rocking vocals by Doyle II and Charlie , plus the unmatched rhythm section of Chris & Tommy. No money better spent on music than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another little band from Texas? ... not just!","review":"The saddest thing about the existence of this band is that they don't anymore. Still in all, it was great just to get at least one superb effort out of them. Released in 1992, it was nice to hear such a likeable CD from Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon after the death of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Double Trouble has proven over and over again what an explosive rhythm section they are.The band, fronted by guitarists/singers Doyle Bramhall II and Charlie Sexton, present a powerful display of blistering dual lead guitar.For those heavy into different styles of southern rock with a blues tinge, this one's a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and formulaic","review":"With the cast of musicians assembled here, I expected a great deal more and thought this music would have more staying power. I just listened to \\"Arc Angels\\" again and can only wonder what might have been had the band stayed away from clichés and worn-out themes centered on \\"having a good time\\" and instead gotten down to business and played like these guys could have.We are left with a moment in time, dated and formulaic with moments when everything clicks, but these moments are too infrequent and brief to sustain interest. Update: I have to admit I am puzzled by all the \\"unhelpful\\" votes for this negative review. So I listened to this CD again, or tried to, and have to stick with impression that though there is a lot of talent here, the music does not sustain much interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas Style Rock","review":"I bought this CD when it was first released. I listened to it a lot until I purchased DOYLE BRAMHALL'S compact disc, JELLYCREAM. I recorded this two together along with DOYLE BRAMHALL'S compact disc WELCOME. A classic selection of rock, funk, blues, and with two blazing guitar players and blistering vocals to match. If you can find this CD, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas Rock","review":"Terrific recordings by Sexton,Bramhall and the group.

Great songs, great hooks, raucous and exuberant playing ankered down by one of the best rythm sections out there. I have bought many CD's with the SHANNON / LAYTON team and have yet to be let down. This is a great combination. SEXTON and BRAMHALL write great material and handle the guitars expertly. While not a pyrotechnic guitar CD it has enough hot guitar work on it to satisfy most guitar nuts. The emphasis seems to be more on the songs and they have succeeded in crafting a cohesive CD without any fillers. Every song has it's place. My favourites are 'SHAPE I'M IN' and 'TOO MANY WAYS TO FALL'. But as they are all brilliant, that may well change by next week.

His music is beautiful and dramatic at the same time, and at least to my ears, his greatest work. But not on this recording; the violins sound scrappy, and wrong notes abound. And the sound is awful, to say nothing about the pathetic artwork on the cover. I think even I could draw a better rendering of Jennifer Jones as the heroine of the story. But I suppose until the Elmer Bernstein version comes out on cd, (now that was a beautiful soundtrack) this one will have to do.

The Nutella sachets came loosely packed in a postal box. There were 72 of them (2 cases worth), but I had to count them all to determine whether I even got what I paid for.I thought I was ordering two cases as illustrated in the photo but my shipment did not include the Nutella branded box which appears in the photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the nutella, not the delivery","review":"These individual nutella packets are going to be great for school lunches, but I was very disappointed with how they arrived. I expected them to come in a case like the one pictured, and instead received them crammed into a flat rate mailing envelope, with several of the packets squashed. I was charged 10.88 in shipping fees. Not cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw away 80% of the shipment","review":"The packets were pictured in a display box, which is how I wanted to receive them. Not only did they come without the box, but they were also busted open, I assume due to a change in air pressure during transit. Because I couldn't trust that, though, I had to throw most of the order away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nutella Mess - Packets Leaked in Both Boxes. Ruined!","review":"Fairly simple. Take a great product like Nutella. Package in convenient single servings (great for camping) and sell them. Ordered 2 boxes for a trip to Everest this Spring. Opened both boxes and discovered a mess - leaked packets everywhere. Don't waste your time or money. Better off buying a container from the store. I'm sure this not the first time this has happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Product Package","review":"I thought this would be a good idea for travel, but I was wrong.

I found myself deeply involved in the characters of these stories to the point of thinking about them as I went to sleep at night. All three books in the trilogy are filled with gripping adventure, heart wrenching drama and God's grace as Tracie Peterson weaves His goodness into each situation. Grace Hawkins, Karen Pierce and Miranda Colton are heroins that come to life.While I was somewhat disappointed with the second book in the trilogy, the final book tied it all together and brought some very pleasant surprises. I was not disappointed with the actual outcome in all three. Tracie Peterson kept me hooked throughtout the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cd. is the best metal Cd. to come out of the '90's","review":"I picked this Cd. up at a record store for the art work. Besides awesome artwork, it also contain's some awesome material too. The music buuilds like a wave throughout the Cd. It is VERY HEAVY. Not fast, just slow churning riffs that remind me of Black Sabbath on mescaline. Buy it A.S.A.P. You will not be dissapointed. This is the best band in the underground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close to winning the ugly beauty pageant","review":"Whether this album came out right before or right after Kurt's suicide, this album does not prove or point out anything having to do with Kurt's death.Now that that's out of the way.Pretty overwhelming punk/grunge legend is an excellent mirror image of depression and frustration with visions of anerexia, bolemia (forgive me, I can't spell that word)... and I'm sure there's a sugar plum fairy in there somewhere. In that context, the best highlights are \\"Doll Parts\\", \\"Credit in the Straight World\\", \\"She Walks\\", and \\"Rock Star\\". \\"Violet\\" is pretty much the album's shining star. \\"Miss World\\" is the spit in the face at glamour worshippers.

Kristen was an amazing songwriter and one of the best bass player's of her era, and she could sing a lick too. After listening to Janitor Joe's \\"Big Metal Birds\\" CD, I now know why I love this album so much. For years I couldn't understand why I enjoyed this CD as much as I did, since I think Courtney is a talentless psycho who steals ideas, sounds, and fashions from others, and Eric Erlandson is a below average guitarist at best who's working at a Dairy Queen in Idaho right now. So yeah, this album is great, but give credit where credit is due. Celebrity Skin is garbage, Pretty on the Inside is garbage.

I don't think I have ever wanted to listen to an ablum non-stop like this. Ever time it was over I played it again. It starts off with Voliet which is about Courtney's confussion over her feeling for Kurt and Billy Corgan. It's just such an amazing song that you would be ok if that was the first and last song on the ablum. But then Miss.World comes on. Every song is followed by other great song! It's so pure. The whole record is completly pure and raw. There even a song on there call I think I would Die, and Courtney and the girl from Babes In Toyland wrote that together. It's great ablum, you're going to Wish the record never ends. It's a great reminder of how Pure Music was back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Live Through This is one of the best rock records ever made. Courtney Love is a lyrical genius and has written 3 of the best rock albums of the 90's. I find it extremely annoying that every Hole review mentions or compares them to Nirvana. Courtney is a very talented woman in her own right and was respected for her music before Kurt was even in the picture.I find it disgusting how this amazingly talented woman has done so much and has never gotten credit for anything. Kurt worshippers have turned Courtney into some 'talentless evil loony'. People cant stand her because she's vulgar and loud and speaks her mind. I find it refreshing. She's real. She doesnt care about being proper..she is who she is and makes incredibley raw passionate music."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of hole... ever","review":"okay, ill be honest about it. I think courtney love is an obnoxious self centered mess but I was and am a hole fan. I have been since I was 16 years old am now 32 and still love em.

The cd was before they got all polished with celebrity skin and it was more raw. Its pure energy.I don't think there was a week that went by through high school that this cd didn't wind up in the cd player, that and babes n toylands pain killers. It takes me back.Geeks do not have pedigreesOr perfect punk-rock resumesOr anorexic magazinesIt smells like girl, it smells like girl!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, Honest and Misunderstood","review":"This album is often perceived as a response to the death of Kurt Cobain, although many of the songs were written before the marriage, and certainly before the death. Live Through This chronicles several years of Courtney Love's life, from dating Kurt Cobain (Doll Parts), having Frances taken by child services (Plump), rape (Asking For It), domestic abuse (Jennifer's Body), to her falling short of society's expectations in general. It's a triumph for feminism, and a memoir of survival in a very different time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ACT OF REBELLION","review":"There are times in the annals of rock & roll when you hear an artist struggle against the limitations of rock. Sly & The Family Stone's THERE'S A RIOT GOIN' ON, Bruce Springsteen's NEBRASKA------all are wrtten and sung as if rock had become part of the problem, not the solution. LIVE THROUGH THIS is such an album---it is an open, bitter act of rebellion on the part of Courtney Love against sexism, against the apolitical \\"political correctness\\" of punk/grunge itself, something which claimed Kurt Cobain's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of 90's grunge......","review":"Live Through This is the defining album of the 90's just as Sergeant Pepper was the defining album of the 60's.

Courtney obviously ripped off Kurt's songs when he died. To prove my point check out later Hole albums that were (gasp) actually written by Hole. They suck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thief!","review":"This album should have been named \\"Hole Featuring Kurt Cobain\\". Thats what it is. Think about it. Just imagine Kurt Singing these songs instead of Courtney. It's so easy especially on Plump. Theres actually a version of Asking For It with Kurt singing on it. There is proof that Drown Soda and Old Age are actually Nirvana songs. In one of his last interviews, Kurt even said that Coutney tried to convince him to give Heart-shaped Box to her! This isn't a bad album, but Courtney doesn't deserve so much praise for music she didn't write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her Best","review":"It's funny but when you look at Courtney, you wonder how could this chick be a punk rocker. She seems so straight edged. I don't think that that is her on the front cover unless she just has too much makeup on. Still I am impressed. I just can't imagine her acting very hardcore around David Arquette. I don't think he would tolerate it. Oh yeah the album isn't very good. You should just probably buy the \\"Friends\\" second season on DVD. That's when Courtney really shows her true colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off plus some","review":"To those of you who think this album is so great and who think Courtney Love is so great, I have something that may change your mind.

A lot of people do not like her but I do. When she screams \\"someday you will ache like I ache\\", I can wholly identify with that. Forget her other albums, this one is by far the best. I hate to compare her with John Lennon, but the only other album that spews so much venom out of the speakers is his \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" LP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much of a review but don't miss Live Through This","review":"Live Through This is perfect if you're a teenage girl and you need someone to identify with.

Apart from EVERY HOUSE SHOULD HAVE ONE. As a woman its easy to relate to the issues raised on the album, the scathing anger of a woman scorned in part for being ostentacious and in another part for being a woman full stop. This is a beautifully executed album, melodic, loud with layers of angst and screams throughout. This is not an attempt to match Nirvana's Nevermind. It's its own entity. I've said enough - just buy it. It'll change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I have always wanted to get this album after hearing the clips on amazon, and when finally got it and I have to say it became one of my all time favorite albums.

Buy this album now."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a rush!","review":"I bought this Cd when it first came out and I STILL listen to it almost everyday! If you were around and moshing during the riot grrl and grunge era then your going to love this cd! The Queen of grunge, Courtney love, really has a way of getting her anger and emotions through to the listeners through her songs. The majorities of the songs are fast paced and jammed pack with emotions. I know that many people have a problem with Courtney Love's personal life but do yourselves a favor forget about all that and just listen to the songs...she really is a talented. With Courtney's emotion filled voice and raw guitar riffs, Eric's brilliant guitar skills, Patty's AMAZING drumming, and Kristen's beautiful background vox, piano and superior bass skills Hole truly one of those bands you'll never forget or get tired of.

I hear \\"celebrity skin\\" (I love it) on the radio every now and then and decided to buy one of the band's album when I recently found out who sang it. I bought this album because it got better reviews than Celebrity Skin and I'm so glad I did. It's one of the influential, extravagant, continually awesome albums I ever heard, and the greatest \\"chick rock\\" album. Every single song is different and brilliant. This is one of my top 10 favorite albums ever and Hole's best.

Courtney Love ( the vocalist) said in 1991:\\"There's a part of me that wants to have a grindcore band and another that wants to have a Raspberries-type pop band.\\" And \\"Live Through This\\" shows a great connection of these parts of her soul.P.S.

Ptoooey!!","review":"My wife and I have about 800 CDs in our collection, and this is the only one I've begged her not to play when I'm around. This album goes beyond dislike, past hatred, all the way to a spine-clenching anger that something like this could ever be released on a major label while so many fine bands--and, for that matter, so many barely mediocre bands--go unheard. Courtney Love can't carry a tune, the lyrics would get a D in a third-grade poetry class, and the music----what music? This is the only Hole album I've heard, so I don't know whether \\"Live Through This\\" is representative of the band or just a hideous aberration. With luck it will remain the only Hole album I've heard, since my wife, praise Allah, apparently doesn't feel the urge to go out and buy any others.

Numbers 21 states that in response to the people's complaints and disobedience, \\"the Lord sent venomous snakes among them\\". This contrasts to the Kimmel version in which the snakes were knowingly waiting for the cloud, with which God surrounded Israel, to be lifted so they could attack. Big difference between God's intention and snakes intention! Really too bad, since the story is a foreshadowing of the lifting up of Jesus on the cross to save us from our sins/eternal health and not just the first use of a snake to be associated with physical health/hippocratic oath.

It also comes with a carrying case, which the plug fits nicely in and its sturdy material.My one wish is that it would be louder, there isnt much OOOMPH to its speakers so if you take it with you outside make sure its not somewhere loud, but this wasnt meant to be used as a stand alone speaker system for the beach, it would be better to get a Portable CD player, or another system that has bigger speakers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When I travel this speaker goes with me!","review":"Logitech mm32 Portable Speaker System for iPod (Black)I never leave home without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but decent sound","review":"The Logitech mm32 Portable Speaker is small yet produces a good quality of sound. Its sleek single cylinder design makes it small enough to carry without having to deal with multi-speakers. The speaker system comes with the speakers, carrying case, AC adaptor (5.5V output, which is detachable), built in output jack, and multiple cradles for various iPods you may have. The sound quality is good but it won't blow away a boom box. This Logitech was designed for a hearing range of 10-15 feet. So, it's perfect for being indoors, or at close range outside. The system does not charge your iPod so make sure you have done that before you leave the house. You can increase the strength of the sound volume by changing the iPod settings in your iTunes but, I wouldn't recommend that since the quality of sound will diminish. The speaker system is easy to use for it only has an on off switch and a volume adjuster.

We purchased this as a gift for our daughter for Christmas. I have a different set already,for my player, that is plug and play and recharges the iPod at the same time. The description of this does not make it clear that it does neither. You have to plug in the player with a wire that fits up through the bottom of the space between the speakers, it's very awkward and does not hold the player steady. And it does not charge the player. Not worth the money or effort. Sent it back for a refund. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought this for traveling with my iPod and had very low expectation. Should be low cost, small and not totally flimsy.The size and premise of these speakers are exactly what I was looking for. But the sound, oh the sound, is complete garbage.I wasn't expecting much, not a lot of power, and not top shelf sound definition, but these start distorting the bass at about 25% of their max output, forcing you to turn the sound way down. You can get better sound and more juice out of those $7 unpowered cheap speakers you can find anywhere. A work around is to cut off the extreme bass with EQ. but couldn't they figure that out in the design stages?If you care about sound quality do yourself a favor and skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech mm32","review":"I was hoping for a speaker unit I could use in a bus without a radio.

There are some comments that provide a story of Ukrainian-Polish relationships, so I will not tell it again.The only thing to remember is that Polish people were murdering Ukrainians with great brutality, and Ukrainians were acting equally toward them too.

The Ukrainians feel that it was a necessary struggle for Ukrainian independence against centuries of Polish colonialism and oppression - on the Ukrainian ethnic territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"This book tells us about a well hidden secret that Ukrainian historians tried to suppress for a long time. And they had plenty of allies in doing this. Today, there are no Polish village communities in Wolyn and East Galicia (Ukraine), in opposition to numerous Polish communities in Belarus and Lithuania which exist. Piotrowski explains why this is so. All because of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists, organisations that orchestrated a genocidal campaign to wipe out the Poles of Wolyn and East Galicia. Interestingly enough, it was not even Stalin that destroyed completely the Poles of Wolyn. Despite expulsions from Belarus, Poles survived there. In Ukraine, specifically in Wolyn and East Galicia, the Poles were largely murdered in their homes and later the Soviet expulsion was accompanied by the OUN-UPA terror in the form of collective murders in order to force the remnants of the Polish community from the territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"German Industrial Band: Trauma's \\"Construct\\"","review":"I recently purchased \\"Fractal Vol. I\\" by German Industrial band, Trauma, and was very pleased with the dark textures, tones, and overall feel the music left me with.

I found and purchased \\"Construct\\", hoping for the same dark and ethereal textures and tones, but alas! This music, although industrial, is also more like Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk at times, which I like, particularly because there are elements of older analog sounds.

When the Dangaioh does its transformation, it is quite smooth and fluid. But the second and third installments are pretty much low-end anime even for the 80's. I would've been much happier if this DVD release had only the first episode rather than the second and third; it would make more logical sense anyway!

The fact that she and her husband kept Jessica from going back to the Schmidts as a baby and then argued that the girl was bonded to them as a toddler was completely and totally selfish on their part. They put their needs before Jessica's. And her self-proclaimed naivete about the media, movie deals and such was too much to believe.

I am reading the entertianment section now where he drones on about how much he hates Anime (um, I think most of the population disagrees with you there!) and how stupid Japanese TV shows are (as if American news is not as biased and gossipy as Japanese). Seriously, don't buy this book unless you want to be talked out of going to Japan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Collectors","review":"It's surprising to me that a band that played this long and extensively left only 21 recordings, and that no reissue existed until now.

The sound is spacious, and the performance remains one of the best ever recorded. At this price, it is a steal! Only the Solti recording on DECCA offers so great a recording at so low a price. Best to have both! Equally impressive is Kubelik's second recording of the 8th on Audite, also with his Bavarians, who long have been one of the great Mahlerian orchestras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous","review":"I first heard this group during the closing credits of the movie \\"Conviction\\". Fell in love with the song \\"Heaven & Hell\\" and the lead singers voice. Still like the song and the voice but I found all the songs to be the same tone/tempo/speed...each one sounded so much like the one before and the one before that. I kept waiting for something to burst through but it never happened and then the CD was over and I have yet to listen again. So dissappointed, they sound like they are really capable of so much more but I just didn't hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"10th edition is a step in the wrong direction","review":"I usually find the Delorme Atalas & Gazetteers to be the most useful of maps. My old PA A&G was falling apart, so I put it in recycling and bought the newest edition. It's a bit of a disappointment. The place names are much bigger, the road lines are much thicker, and it's just generally harder to get an idea of the topography. If I wanted just a road atlas, I'd buy Rand McNally."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Dull Book","review":"Nancy receives a moonstone as a gift from an anonymous person. Mr. Drew enlists Nancy to help him with his latest case. The Bowens, a missionary couple, have recently returned from Africa and have been looking for their granddaughter without success. The girl went to live with her other grandmother in the town of Deep River after the deaths of her parents when she was a baby. However, the grandmother died shortly after that and all trace of the girl has been lost. When the girls arrive in Deep River they see Moonstone Castle in the distance and decide to explore it. This was a very boring book with a dull mystery and almost zero action. The summary in the book suggests that the castle is haunted, but that is never really mentioned in the book itself. Nancy doesn't do any brilliant detective work to find the missing girl, instead she basically stumbles upon her. I'd only recommend getting this book to complete your set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the roots","review":"Well this is definitly Mark's best album since Longnecks & Short Stories.Genuine Honky Tonk at the best.My recommendation is :Buy this record!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem!","review":"Look, if you're really into the BPB, you MUST buy this CD! The first 10 tunes on the CD really show what virtuoso musicians these guys are -- playing cartoon music, within the big band form, at an extremely high level. The best way to describe it is to say that it's like Carl Stalling, Eugene Poddany, and Duke Ellington decided to collaborate on a score. The last 3 tunes are the BPB in it's natural state... swinging HARD and all Gordon with brilliant takes on Christmas classics. AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Phatt Band Christmas","review":"my dad likes the Big Phatt band, wanted christmas album, only saw this and figured it was not what he wanted because it is an animated movie \\"soundtrack\\".

The Warner Bros. characters are hilarious on the bonus cd. I recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spacey Superheroey Action","review":"And by \\"spacey\\" I don't only mean happening in outer space. This is also one of Grant Morrison's strangest tales. It starts as a pretty straighforward adventure of the JLA against Lex Luthor and his Injustice Gang. What the superheros of the JLA, including Superman and Wonder Woman, don't know is that the choices they make in defeating the Lex Luthor might endanger the whole planet and leave it open for an invasion by Darkseid.Then things get weird.This story arc is hailed as Morrison's best in his long run on JLA and I recommend it fully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really cool","review":"\\"Rock of Ages\\" is the best superhero comic book story ever written. Part 5 was so good, I needed a cigarette.Grant Morrison's talent on the JLA is that he handles all of the characters better than anyone else. His Superman is very Superman. His Batman is extremely clever and competant. The Martian Manhunter is patient and wise, Wonder Woman is strong, and Green Lantern is a bit clueless but very capable. This is pure fun the way superhero comics are meant to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a really good action movie...","review":"The only real flaw with this JLA collection is that it seems to go on for too long. However, it continues the trend of top-notch storytelling that has become the book's trademark.

It has characters hopping through unidentifed spaces and times to counteract an evil we don't understand for unexplained reasons, interacting with bizarre and unnecessary characters. Maybe I missed something, but I sure didn't \\"get it\\" the first time. At least we got to meet Hourman for the first time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst, so far...","review":"Horrible. They're young. They're old. It's the past. It's the future. Nothing is as it seems. Nothing makes sense. It's just a bunch of garbbled trash. Poor Grant Morrison had to be under the influence of some illegal drug to actually think this mess made any sense. Stay off the dope, man. It messes up your mind. I had to force myself to finish this. It was painful, but I did it. Horrible. Awful. Please, don't waste your money. I'll tell you all you need to know... at the end they disband the JLA. Why they do is not important, because in the very next issue (JLA: Strength in Numbers) they re-group. Skip this book and go straight to \\"Strength in Numbers\\", which is far superior than any of the previously published JLA books (Rock of Ages, being the worse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Morrison is good, he's very good...","review":"But when he tries to do this complex space opera stuff, it goes awry. The same thing that happened with JLA happened with New X-Men. By the time he got to his final story-line, it was a jumble of confused action sequences. Compare that to Morrison's Cassandra Nova stories from earlier in the series.Likewise, Morrison's first JLA story arc (New World Order) is some of the best mainstream comic book story telling I've ever seen. But by the time he got to World War III, everything was confused and jumbled again.Rock of Ages is like that as well, although it has one saving grace, the unsettling future world run by Darkeseid. he struck gold with that part of the book, but then lost it after the showdown with Darkseid.Still, I think Morrison is one of the best writers in comics. Check out his We3 series, probably one of the creepiest things he's ever done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like every other","review":"This book is like everyother how to get through life books.

I was disappointed. The recipes for the cookies are vague at best. \\"Roll cookie dough into small balls\\"; would that be 3/4\\"? or 1\\"? Okay, so I decided I would use the yield to figure out how many cookies the batch yields then work backwards from there to figure out the size of the dough balls.... well, there's no yield in any of the cookie recipes either.You simply mix the 3 or 4 ingredients together and \\"drop balls of dough onto greased cookie sheet.\\" The recipes sound delicious, don't get me wrong. I would think that the author has used these recipes and baked the items that she's compiled into a book and put her name on.

You will find lots of ideas in this book. Starting with a cake mix you end up with brownies, cookies, muffins, and other items. Or if you just want to take the basic cake recipe and make it into something unusual how about using fruit fillings in a cake, or applesauce, or Butterfinger candy bars. The author also includes some children's recipes and other unique ideas like a Jack-O-Lantern cake that uses two bundt cakes with the flat side put together.The book is spiral bound to lay flat and has a protective plastic covering, as should all cookbooks. 101 Things to Do With a Cake Mix is recommended for anyone looking for creative ways to create the extraordinary from an ordinary cake mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought this for my son","review":"my son buys cake mix and likes to experiment..so here you go.a little go along gift...i'm sure he will have adaptations to whatever recipe he chooses..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this one","review":"I used this one a couple of times- it is a great idea book- I actually used one of the recipe's for the cheesecake topping (chocolate) again and again for my eclair topping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun gift","review":"fun little book loaded with easy recipes. plan on giving as a gift at christmas, also purchased one for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooking with Cake Mix","review":"10l Things To Do with a Cake Mix Book.This is a wonderful book if you like to do alot of baking with cake mix.Different ideas what to do with cake mix and cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"My sister loves this book","review":"I got this for my sister for Christmas one year.

I have the \\"Cake Mix Doctor\\" and use it frequently for a quick, easy, and very good looking product. Wish I could say that \\"101\\" was the same. Directions are unclear or missing. It is easy to prop on the counter, most ingredients are easily obtainable, but spend the extra few bucks and get the \\"Cake Mix Doctor\\" for its completeness and a lot more recipes.

Unfortunately, the results have been hit and miss. The directions are incomplete at best and downright frustrating at worst. Instructions like \\"pour batter\\" when the batter is actually as thick as biscuit dough can be very confusing...I questioned if my batter was the right consistency, double checking the instructions. The Cherry Pie-filling Cake was dry and crumbly! How is that possible with all those cherries? I am a seasoned cook and receive compliments on my baking regularly. With 2 teenagers at home I was looking for quick recipes to stay ahead of their appetites. I was hoping this cookbook would be quick and easy... it is, but the results are only adequate. P.S.

It is an affirmation that, \\" what a man soweth... he shall surely reap\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior to Volume 1","review":"This second installment of 'Crisis on Multiple Earths' is much more effective as a back story to 'Crisis on Infinite Earths'. You will see the original appearance of the Red Tornado (II), who plays pivotal roles in these pages, as well as later in the Crisis, and more recently as a mentor to 'Young Justice'. You will also see what appears to be the first encounter between the alternate versions of Superman. And you will see fun cosmic connections occur between other less obvious parallel characters.You will also experience a universe shaking battle with a stellar superbeing. The 'awsome' factor of this particular battle is lessened by the silliness of the villain, but overall it's still a good multiverse in peril tale, and a fun read.The overall quality of the writing and art was more conducive to easy reading than the previous volume of 'Crisis on Multiple Earths'; and the fun factor just felt higher overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love me some JLA/JSA!","review":"Although I grew up with the \\"Bronze Age\\" DC Universe, these 1960's team-ups are great, cheesy fun. You can really sense the changes coming when Denny O'Neil took over the writing, he brought the characters into the \\"relevence\\" of the late 60's/early 70's but still maintained respect for the older Golden Age JSA. Good stuff & recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have for collectors","review":"This, and all the crisis series, were written (and drawn) many, many years ago. Compared to what we read these days it's a completely different story.Not just some characters are not with us anymore, but the way comics were viewed was a lot different as well. Basically a lot more writing and a lot less put into the drawing quality.I do enjoy both, a good story and the way comics are drawn today. While it's hard to get a good story these days,pictures are getting better and better, and if you are selectiveyou will find some really good pieces of art/work around.About this one in particular... If you want to have a piece ofhistory, and enjoy a good story too, don't mind average drawing quality, then this is the comic for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back stroy for Crisis on INFINITE earths.","review":"What has not been said about the the three volumes of the Crisis on Multiple Earths books is that they are a collection of JLA story arcs that first introduced the concept of the multi-universe. These stories help you understand why DC needed the Crisis on Infinte Earth story. The first volume covers events on Earth-1, Earth-2, Earth-3, and Earth-A. If you want to understand what the heck that means you'll have to read the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Picking Up","review":"I remember reading the \\"Changewinds\\" saga in three books several years back. I've never forgotten the story. The adventures of two young women in alternate universes makes for a compelling read.

It's one of the few novels I remember describing in detail to a friend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Being the first Chalker book I read, I was quite impressed with it.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive crap","review":"I read bad books all the time but rarely is there one I can not finish. This is one I couldn't. The characters are boring whinny and constantly forgetting the things they just learned. The world the story takes place in is interesting but that is not enough. It's one of those books where the characters are constantly being redescribed. The book seems to be written as a self help book for teenagers with body image problems. Maybe it would be therapeutic for some. Otherwise total crapfest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comics Best Dressed","review":"I love this item.

Then I can change the font and add an image. With the Platinum 8, I have not been able to do that at all. I tried to do their \\"Mail Merge\\", even had the instructions in front of me, but it would not work.

This is my third updated version. The previous version was Gold 2. I have to agree with the other two who wrote their reviews, in that I was disappointed. What I really missed was the rotating screen saver. Another feature that was changed was the art format, which you could open like a book. I'm fortunate in that I still have the Gold 2. If this is your first version of CreataCard, it's worth the buy. If you have, as I do, Gold 2, save your money.

Having studied viruses for years, with an interest in such viruses as Ebola, I can confidently say that this is NATURE working to maintain a population balance. These viruses appeared from the rainforests because humans interfered where they should not be i.e. deforestation and are NOT the result of mad scientists. A well written book, but fiction all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Very poor camera work, low quality, low quantity, expensive, DVD format is worse to navigate than VHS, not recommended.

So Dan is awakened to attack the awakened dead.This game may be challenging though.And also you know,I suggest you buy the strategy guide.Get this game,it's fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game was not worth the money...The first Medievil was 100 times better","review":"Okay so if you played the first Medievil game you will notice the difference in overall actions and screen panning difficulties this game has. I notice that when trying to kill a zombie or are being surrounded by a few of them you have to run, dash around and swipe them with your sword and this gets annoying because the sword isnt soo quick or swift this time which can result to your life gauge being eaten up so quick. Which brings me to my only positive remark about this game is that when you go to refill your life gauge it is quicker than before. This game isnt worth the money and the levels aren't near as fun as from the first medievil game.Sincerely,an honest reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Gothic games","review":"There are a few ups and downs to the game such as rotation of the camera angle and it isn't quite as believable as the first game, but still good in many ways. I understand how many gamers are confused about the ending leaving a cliffhanger. Well here is a secret that some of you may not know: you'll witness a happy ending between Dan and Kiya if you manage to win the game by missing at least one chalace. Getting them all haves the gamer witnessing the cliffhanger. I just wish they would have put it the other way around. I recommend this game to any horror/gothic fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointing","review":"Medievil 2. I imangined this to be as good as its prolouge.

I carefully packed it in another box and returned it. The repair shop said the they received it broken and sent a picture of a press in a box with a broken handle. Said they would gladly send it back as is, but I would have to pay shipping. It cost me over a $100 to get it fixed and returned. They either replaced the handle with a used one, or did not replace it at all. Three months later it stopped heating again. This time they told me to open it and replace a thermistor which they sold to me. That component burnt out at least two more times and changing that part became routine. Now the press would not even turn on. I don't believe that I got 20 hours of use out of it.

We bought this unit to make ironing school clothes go faster, and maybe even press some of my husband's work shirts. The unit is well made, and heats up evenly and fast. The steam reservoir is generous and provides a nice burst of steam- really helps to get the wrinkles out!Kids cotton shirts come out great- just two presses (I can only fit 1/2 the shirt on the press at a time)with a bit of starch and they go to school looking neat. Pants are still a bit of trouble- especially in the seat area. I like to press the legs and then iron the rest.As with typing... practice makes perfect. I know in a few more days I will have it down to a science.The unit is heavy and well balanced, but does tip when applying the lock for the press. It may be worthwhile to invest in the customized stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T PURCHASE!!!","review":"ASIN: BOOOPSP15GI too loved the steam press at first!

It is nice to see a few tracks highlight bands in their prime like Weezer and Counting Crows, but most other big name tracks either simply get by or disappoint with blatant throwaways while the lesser known artists often attempt something memorable though usually come off as third-rate renditions of someone else or just generically \\"alternative\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright Compilation","review":"Ok the only reason I bought this cd was it had a rare Nirvana song on it.

So if you've played NCAA 06 (which has a FANTASTIC running game), going back to Madden's is a big step backwards. NCAA is alot more fluid, realistic and -- most importantly -- FUN!They have added updates that nobody wants. QB Visions is poorly executed. The joystick is too sensitive, making it nearly impossible to pick up the game and play it right out of the box.Nothing much was added to Franchise. There is a new 'NFL Superstar' mode, which seems pretty cheezy. It's mostly you just reading emails and newspapers in between games...fun right?EA needs to quit adding new features and focus on the overall gameplay. Madden 06 just isn't fun to play. Maybe that's because it still feels like Madden 2003, except with more difficult controls this time around.Sadly, there are no other options for NFL games this year (thanks to the monopoly EA has with the league). If you want a good football fix that's FUN TO PLAY, pick up NCAA 06."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUINED","review":"I don't understand why EA would completely change their passing system. Maybe because they have no competition they feel like they can mess the game up and increase the price. If it ain't broke don't fix it.The passing cone is slow, the defense knows exactly where the ball is going, and it's just a pain in the butt. Who would want the offense to be more difficult? If you have a bad qb just make the ratings worse, don't make it impossible to throw the ball. Best of all you can't turn it off to play online.Also little changes like switching the defensive players and speed burst buttons are an unneeded pain. Good job ruining the best game ever. Honestly, if it was exactly like 05 with updated rosters, and improved online play I would have been happier and probably given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!!!","review":"Madden has added so much crap over the years that the game is no longer any fun to play.

Isnt that a monopoly or whatever? ESPN 2k5 will be the game I continue to play until EAs contract runs out. ESPN is smoother, more realistic, and just quite frankly a more fun game to play.

I feel like I am being forced to use the joysticks when I am used to the old style directional pad. The graphics appear to be worse sometimes.(2004 style) I guess we are all expecting great abnormal changes and all we get is the same game with a few changes. I guess if you are a true madden fan you must own a copy but the only reason why I wont return this game is because of the yearly tournaments we have for madden. All I can say is that we all hope madden and EA shape up and bring something worth it for 2007. Maybe a live halftime show with real cheerleaders or the owners walking around the feild like Jerry Jones does. SOMETHING never seen before like ESPN did with ESPN 05.

I tweaked the rosters, adjusted the players' numbers, then started playing. The best thing one can say about the QB Vision control is that you can immediately turn it off. Too bad every time on defense you have to watch the computer use it. This Madden is a clone of last year's Madden besides the stupid Superstar mode (and the useless QB Vision), which you might never even play because everyone knows Franchise is where it's at. Oh yeah even the repetitive Tony Bruno is back to ensure you hit the mute button every time you go to your roster. NCAA for the last two years is so much better than Madden it's not even debatable.

Madden played the coward this year by buying all of the NFLPA credits, so they wouldn't get overtaken by ESPN's NFL 2K6(ESPN 2K5 is a far better game than Madden 2005, *check out my review on it*). They knew that ESPN's game had been creeping up on them for years and would finally pass them up on sales this year. But, the p*ssy Madden owners were too scared to allow that. So they bought up the credits and put out an exact replica of Madden 2005 (Madden 2006). The only difference is the Accurate Passing. I heard it's not that great. What's a matter EA Sports?

Elastica are another.Elastica fuses the angular riffs of Wire and the Stranglers with big, catchy hooks that can instantly win you over. None of the members of the group are instrumentally dextrous, but they more than make up for it with their enthusiasm in playing, which shines through the nature of their songs, all which would sound perfect as singles. My personal favourites are Connection, the one with the riff stolen from Wire about hearts and spades; Stutter, the two minute twenty second burst of punk energy about a speech impendiment (not really); Waking Up, a song that I believe we can all relate to and Never Here, which is heartbreakingly beautiful and romantic in ways I can't express."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply one of the best bands I have ever heard","review":"A chance encounter with \\"Connection\\" on local music-video television was all it took to send me down one of the most aurally pleasing paths I have ever encountered.

It was very important to me to be able to seal up linens, pillows, and any other large fabric items so that I didn't transport any critters to my new place. These bags were terrible. The white tabs that help to \\"seal\\" the bags were constantly falling off. The handle, where you are supposed to grab and carry, is glued shut and came apart in a number of my bags, thus creating an opening the bag. Even when the zippered top was closed, putting pressure on the bag caused it to pop open. If you need a large, sealing plastic bag, don't buy these! I found the large Ziploc brand ones work far better, with a double closure that ensures it doesn't pop open and a handle that is above the sealed part, thus ensuring that any handle issues aren't going to create openings when you don't want them."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO Arashi!","review":"While Arashi is not very well known in the USA, it should be.

After reading it, I purchased this book in hopes that updated information concerning mixed gasses and decompression models would be discussed. Much of this book is basic OW information with the history of dive tables and a discussion of profiles which have indicated an increased risk of DCS. Very little here for Technical Diving, except an overabundance of warnings about diving beyond 100' (which is well within the range of even basic OW cert). I had hoped for information for those of us who understand the risks and pursue depth as a means of exploring wrecks and caves that the rest of the world never sees.

This changes them from punks with memories stretching back no further than the last Pixies album into folk blues aesthetes with historical credibility. It forces the listener to concentrate on the songs and the abilities of their performers. It transcends inclusive musical boundaries and appeals to a wider range of listeners. It's Nirvana for your mom!Not to mention the fact that stripping down these songs makes them sound much more emotional. Instead of the juvenile angst of a fun punk song we get slow, somber meditations. It can be more depressing. In some situations I prefer this. It speaks to me, while Nevermind justs sings to me, if you understand me (you don't, but don't worry about it). And finally: Kurt sings like he's not long to live, which he hadn't, and that is what makes a blues singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumb","review":"Ok so I'm just being funny when I put that title. This isn't a dumb album. This is a good album. It's the only Nirvana album anyone should buy. I would give this 5 stars but.....some of the best songs on this album aren't even theirs. \\"The Man who sold the world\\", \\"Lake of Fire\\", \\"Jesus Don't want me for a sunbeam\\", and \\"Where did you sleep last night?\\" are all great songs but they aren't Nirvana songs. If the entire album was all original stuff that was only made by Nirvana and no other band it would be better. But it's more like a compilation of some of Nirvana's favorite songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album, but not even close to nirvanas best","review":"anyone who thinks this album is one of nirvanas best does not really like nirvana. this is by far the worst nirvana album. it is still great compared to most of the garbage out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old Nirvana","review":"I had this on cassette years ago, and my son listened to it when he was young.

'Unplugged on MTV' records are usually just plain boring, but Nirvana does hypnotic versions of Nirvana classics as well as cover songs by somewhat obscure bands like Meat Puppets (three songs actually), in a stripped-down way.It's hard to say exactly what makes this record so good, but if you want to know I suggest you listen to the cover of 'Jesus Don't Want Be For A Sunbeam'. There's a word for it: magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't have this cd there is something wrong.","review":"To me, if you don't own this cd it's like saying you don't own a Beatles cd. Every track off this cd is breath taking. To know NOTHING was edited and they filmed the show continously with mistakes and all makes it all the better and real. To me, this was one of the band's most personal performances. Amazing lyrics, amazing sound, and heart. If you don't own this, you should no matter what you listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"great show, couple of rare songs","review":"Hey, i consider myself almost a Nirvana & Pearl Jam historian so if i get to snobby or intelectual in this review then just stop reading because i hate that. but anyway I think that Nirvana did a great unplugged show and im glad that they didn't do teen spirit because it wouldn't have went over very well acoustic, but other songs that really went great like come as you are, about a girl, dumb, and pennyroyal tea, were very great. i especially like the superb covers of Huddie Ledbetter's \\"Where did you sleep Last Night\\" and David Bowie's \\"The man who sold the world,\\" mostly because i have yet to find a good recording of the original where did you sleep last night. besides that i love the 3 tracks with the Meat Puppets and All apologies is always great. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible..","review":"I guess this is the closest I'll ever get to seeing Nirvana live, and judging from this CD it would've been an amazing experience. Kurt's vocals ranged from raw and angry, hoarse, and some songs soft and gentle. There are lots of different types on songs on here, and in my opinion, they're all great. Chris and Dave were also talented musicians. All the music is emotional and personal and they play with all they're got. Come As You Are, Plateau, and a lot of the other songs are haunting and you can feel Kurt's pain in the way he attacks some songs like Where Did You Sleep Last Night and Lake of Fire, which are both Meat Puppets covers. Songs like Jesus Don't Want Me For a Sunbeam show their softer side. Kurt's death was really a tragedy in the music world in which he never felt like he belonged, but Nirvana's songs, which revolutionized music of the time, left a lasting impression that won't be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cobain's Brilliant Last Stand","review":"This is a towering, trandescent live acoustic performance that Kurt Cobain & the gang recorded for MTV in November 1993, just five months prior to Cobain's untimely demise. The band perform eight originals including \\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"All Apologies,\\" as well as six cover songs, including David Bowie's \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" & three songs by the Meat Puppets (who guest perform on the songs). Anyone who never heard the talent in Cobain's singing, songwriting, and guitar-playing on Nirvana's full-throttle studio records before, OR the talent of Cobain's bandmates Krist Novelselic & Dave Grohl, absolutely MUST give \\"MTV Unplugged In New York\\" a listen. The band's stripped-down approach to the material brings out the beauty in the songs for ALL to hear. Heck, you can even play this Nirvana album for your grandmother, and chances are she'll love it. It's a gorgeous live performance, and a powerful final testament to the talent & genius of Kurt Cobain & his band."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.I.P Kurdt","review":"I bought this album after having bought the 4 studio albums and having read Kurt's biography, heavier than heaven (which by the way is an incredible book and i strongly recommend you read it). I was not disappointed. I sincerely feel this album is the best Nirvana album, despite it not being entirely original. With the live CD Kurt demonstrates why Nirvana are the best grunge band in the world ever, by showing an electricity that has not since been emulated by anyone. It is impossible to name the best song on the album, but All Apologies remains a true classic. I was also pleasantly surprised by \\"Jesus doesn't want me for a Sunbeam\\" for whihc Krist plays accordion.If you have any doubts about buying this CD then splash out, as it is an excellent addition to ANY record collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best \\"Unplugged set\\" ever","review":"Nirvana throws down a guantlet of acoustic songs(not only includiding their singles like other bands) that not only encompases the acoustic setting but great songs in general that captivates the mind and soul. I've personally listened to this cd time and time again since I was about 13, and it's still an emotional landmark as far as music goes.Greatness and diversity defined. *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nirvana Album!","review":"I am not a Nirvana fan at all. I have heard all their stuff and dont see what the big deal about them is. But the CD is totally awesome. I just watched a special on MTV which had eyewitness which people that was their talked about the music and their was the whole unplugged show. Nirvana I think showed that they didnt have to play Smells Like Teen Spirit or Heart Shaped-Box to be good. Infact this was better. Tracks: Pennyroyal Tea, Where Did You Sleep Last Night, and the Meat Puppets cover of Lake of Fire are the highlights of this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD I recomend it to all music fans","review":"Unplugged is a very good example of how great Nirvana really is. This band has never put out a bad album. It's pretty funny too, you get to know how the band members are really like in between songs. there are some of the best songs I have heard on this album including A Solo \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" and \\"Where did you sleep last night?\\" written by Huddie Ledbetter (Leadbelly). I got this CD in 96' as a birthday present. It does make a good gift, you won't be sorry you got this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah uh huh","review":"One of the only good things MTV ever did, besides producing wonderful movies like \\"Dead Man on Campus.\\" This CD is a classic. Doesn't deserve 5 stars because they played covers, (which is cheating.) Naturally, 2 of the best tracks on here are \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" and \\"Jesus Doesn't Want me for a Sunbeam\\", covers of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana's Best","review":"In my opinion this is Nirvana's best cd. Yes better than Nevermind. While Nevermind is great and genre defining Unplugged shows exactly how versatile Nirvana was and gives you an idea of what direction they may have taken had Cobain not (allegedly) committed suicide. The slower songs on here are both beautiful and haunting. Jesus Don't Want Me for a Sunbeam, Pennyroyal Tea, Lake of Fire, About a Girl are amazing. But Where Did You Sleep Last Night is the BEST!!! This song is even more haunting than the original by the great bluesman Leadbelly. It still gives me chills everytime I hear it. They did this song tremendous justice. And I think Leadbelly would approve of it himself. If you own only one Nirvana CD this should be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you go wrong with this cd?","review":"This was probably one of the most amazing performances of the bands career. Unfortunatly it ended, and is tied to the death of Cobain. As you listen through the tracks of the cd you get a comprehensive look into the groups unity. And as you'll notice they didn't cover the song \\"Smells like teen spirit\\". This is because it was a pivital point in the bands evolution. I believe that if Cobain did not die, Nirvana would be a band unlike any others that we know. And most of all, listen closely to the very end of the last song. Cobain puts so much emotion and pure energy into the last part of it. It almost sounds like something was tearing him up inside and it was coming out at the end of the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the essence of a powerful live performance","review":"Unplugged in NY shows more than just a concert setlist. It is Nirvana's legacy that puts you right into the audience of this live, almost 100% unplugged performance. It was good to see some of the Meat Puppets be featured in the liner notes as they played a major role.Good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"As Nirvana's last performance ever, they really outdid themselves here. Leaving out their mainstream nightmares (Smells like Teen Spirt, Rape Me) that created a base of mostly superficial fans, and bringing out the best of their \\"bottom of the closet\\" music really brought a new light to the end of the Nirvana epic.Highlights of the CD: Man who sold the world (originally and David Bowie song), Plateu, On a plain, Lake of Fire.This is definatly my favorite CD in my entire collection. I reccomend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential","review":"This is one of my very favorite CDs. I'm sure I can't say more than has already been said in the other reviews.

I watched the show on MTV and can tell you it was one of the best live shows I've ever seen. Unfortunately, Kurt Cobain would commit suicide, making it their last show. Many people wonder what Nirvana would be like today if Kurt didn't commit suicide but I say LEAVE IT BE. Don't go pestering his already-tortured soul.

And...I don't say that often about albums. This is one of those albums you can listen to for days and never get tired of it. Kurt Cobain and Co. were at their best here...and it shows! They sound sooo much better in acoustic...it begs the question as to why they really needed electric guitars at all?! All of the songs are filled with such emotion, it is so easy to get attached to them and never let go. It is a tragedy that Kurt Cobain committed suicide at the height of his success. It's really sad to know that we won't be treated to any more live gems like this. Thank goodness MTV was smart enough to record this live masterpiece! The whole thing stands out. There is not one song that is better than any other. This CD should be part of every rock collection! So, if you haven't bought it yet...this is one you definitely want to get your hands on. It's a modern classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Music","review":"\\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\\" is a a Leadbelly cover that Cobain makes his own and is bone chilling to say the least given the circumstances following this performance.

RIP Kurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Album","review":"There is an on honest an very moving atmosphere on this Nirvana album which sadly would their final. The half-acoustic approach really reveals how great Nirvana's best songs are and that they work very well outside the traditional Nirvana concept. Some of them actually works better than on the studio albums; moreover there are some great cover-versions here, not least the outsstanding David Bowie song \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" - and the sad \\"Jesus Doesn't Want me for a Sunbeam\\". The cello played by Lori Goldston really add new dimensions to many of these songs.On three tracks Nirvarna is supported by the Kirkwood brothers and they play Meat Puppets songs together. Of those both \\"Oh Me\\" and \\"Lake of Fire\\" sound like Nirvana songs.Great moving album and also a little sad - especially when you come to think about that these recordings were among the very last that Curt Kobain lived to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near-perfect unintentional goodbye","review":"It's amazing, but not unexpected, to see such a lack of pretense throughout these acoustic translations of much heavier material. The entire concert was bathed in Cobain's tragic warmth and frazzled soul, injecting a tremendous amount of integrity into nearly every strum and vocalization, while the band backs up at their restrained best, revealing a side seldom seen, and one fans were most fortunate to have seen before the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurt is God","review":"This is an album you can listen to 1000 times and not get sick of. It is the best album I have ever heard. I do cry when I listen to this because you can feel Kurt's pain. The last track makes me want to cry most, when Kurt screams. This album truley shows Nirvana's talent. You must get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I bought this as a gift for my husband 2 years ago & was recently informed that the album was a little warped when he received it.

His music isn't.","review":"Everything that is said nowadays about Kurt Cobain seems to be an epitaph to him, and likewise a pall hangs over much of his band's music. But this is a wonderful album, full of light and power, and has some of the greatest moments in 90s music - such as the stunning \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\" that finishes the show, and the stripped-down \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", somehow both portents of what was to happen just five months after this show was recorded.These songs, along with covers of several Meat Puppets numbers, his yearning \\"About A Girl\\" and the worldly-wise sounding Bowie cover \\"The Man...\\" make for an album as memorable as the studio albums Nirvana produced.For once, the hype that surrounded Nirvana was justified, even if the hype contributed to Cobain's suicide. This album displays the genius of the Nirvana leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best!!!","review":"one of Nirvana's best!! You never realize how complex Nirvana songs are until you hear this album. I really hate how people keep connecting Kurt's death with this album.

Kurt pays homage to some of his musical influences to great effect rounding off the performance with a rendition of Leadbelly's 'Where Did You Sleep Last Night' that is so heartfelt and gutsy that he almost sounds possessed by the great Blues songwriter. The rawness of this song befits the tone of all the preceding tracks which are typically moody and dark but also deeply passionate and musical. Even the Meat Puppets quirky tunes are made to sound quite melodic.Their own songs translate beautifully in the unplugged format, the inclusion of a cello and extra guitarist Pat Smear adds to the dynamic of classics like Polly and About A Girl, while the softer songs from In Utero - Dumb and All Apologies - actually end up sounding better unplugged than the studio versions (if that were possible)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm impressed.","review":"I'm not a Nirvana fan.

I would recommend this to anyone who has any interested in Nirvana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Album","review":"This is a great MTV Unplugged album from Nirvana that not only has their songs, but a few covers (done very well) also. The live version of About a Girl (from Bleach) sounds almost just as good as the original version of it. And the non-Nirvana Song \\"the Man who sold the World\\", is probably my favorite song on the CD. Other songs are OK, but this is definitely a must-buy for all Nirvana fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"MTV Unplugged 1993","review":"This is a nice album, no drugged up bass guitar goin mental, no scary vocals, just chilling haunting vocals and nice slow music...

And the quitest too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"arguably the best Nirvana album","review":"Nirvana is NOT a band that's about being pre-packaged or polished, so it's in an acoustic setting that their talent really shows. Kurt's characteristic grumble is accentuated throughout the album giving the whole thing a more personal feel to it. There are many good tracks from previous cds, but my personal favorites are the way Nirvana covers Jesus Doesn't Want Me For A Sunbeam by the Vasolines and my personal favorites The Man Who Sold the World by David Bowie and Where Did You Sleep Last Night by legendary bluesman, Leadbelly. The best tracks from Nirvana's stuff are Come As You Are, Polly, Dumb, and the lamenting Something in the Way. This album is beautifully constructed and the performances well-executed, the only low part in my opinion, is Plateau, which features Kurt screeching \\"Sitting on the top with a bucket and a mop and an illustrated book about birds\\". But I highly recomend the cd otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got Ripped off","review":"This item was listed as A DVD! it is an audio CD only.Very misleading webpage...an intentional move to sell this item.A rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A DVD !!!","review":"i think it's sad that amazon puts this into DVD section and give DVD specs, when it's an audio CD.

I doubt anyone who favors their music will endure such a pretentious form of rock music.There are terrific acoustic/folk musicians but Nirvana is out of this league.3.This show is fake emotional and misleading. That's why we got a lot of self-destructive whiners aka Post-grunge to ruin music. I guarantee all of them are inspired by this show.

One of the greatest bands of all time performs an amazing set for MTV's legendary show \\"Unplugged\\", resulting in one of the most memorable live performances of our time. Frontman and musical genius Kurt Cobain leads the willing audience through 14 tracks of complete and utter musical bliss. Every single track is simply put amazing, in many ways this was not just a live performance or an album...it was an experience.R.I.P.Kurt Cobain"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best Nirvana CD ever","review":"This CD goes a long way to disprove any doubters out there that thought that Nirvana was some sort of gimmick. Their musical talent, performance skills and musical tastes are on wide display in this live performance.

This one is a prize in my personal CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"This CD is absolutely phenomenal!

This is a staple in any serious music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows what the band can really do.","review":"I was listening to this album and thinking to myself that not only can Nirvana rock, but they can als play beautiful music. Kurt Cobain's great voice singing some of the tracks on the album will give you chills. This shows really what the band is capable of making as a group. Only once in lifetime will you hear the biggest rock band at the time shred the electric and sing wonderful songs. I give you my highest reccomendation possible to listen to this album. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"summarys are overratted","review":"I love Nirvana and you should definitly buy this album if youre a fan....but David Bowie's Man Who Sold the World is way better than Kurt's...no offense to Kurt or anything, he did a good job, but Bowie is GOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana, Like You Have Never Seen Them Before","review":"In this recording Nirvana are stripped down to their musical essentials, and it just goes to show that it is their talent that makes them great, not the distortion. In my opinion this is one of the best live recordings done by any artist. The set includes both original material, as well as a number of covers. Kurt seems to be at his best, and his gravelly voice suits the mood and atmosphere perfectly. My personal favourite is \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", a solo preformance by Kurt. There isn't a bad song on the album, and it exposes a brand new side to the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nirvana","review":"From the beginning to the end, this CD has the ability to render one speechless. The first notes suck you in, and keep you spellbound until the last. Where Did You Sleep Last Night? still has the ability to cause chills down ones' spine, even if you knew nothing about Nirvana or Kurt Cobain. In so many ways, it's impossible to rate the songs on this CD. Some stand out more than others. Some merely embrace you for a matter of minutes before disappearing into applause. Many take you by surprise. The power in this album, in these songs, is that it's not the Nirvana you're used to. It's something new. In many ways, this was just Kurt Cobain. If that, for nothing else, it is definitely worth buying. You won't regret a second of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most powerful cd's of all time","review":"This cd is by far Nirvanas most powerful work. It offers a wide range of beautiful,haunting ,and all around powerful acoustic offerings from one of the greatest musical acts of all time. This cd will leave any listener drained from all the emotions Cobain conveys. This cd shows the musical genius of the band at it's zenith. At the end of WHERE DID YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT,Cobain lets out impassioned screams at the top of his lungs,and then suddenly all goes queit and you hear Kurt sigh. It literally almost brings me to tears. Why did he end his life. Buy this cd.It is a testament to the genius of Nirvana,in particular THE LATE,GREAT,KURT COBAIN...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the world's masterpieces","review":"This album is breathtaking. Kurdt Kobain's emotions were true and conveyed in his songs. Not a single song is worthy of being skipped- every one here is great. However, the last one is especially wonderful. Where Did You Sleep Last Night is just as good as the other songs, until Kurdt's last verse. He truly puts his soul into that song like nothing I've ever heard before. His last few words end in primal screams like nothing you've ever heard before. These are a man's cries, of whom will soon commit suicide, transformed into music. There is really nothing like that song.It makes you especially sad he died. After reading books about him, you really begin to understand him. His death was a horrible tragedy, and no popular band since has reached the level Nirvana reached. Kurt was a good guy, misunderstood and confused, but he never meant anyone harm. It is greatly unfortunate he died in such a tragic way.Rest in Peace Kurt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to your shop","review":"Don't know why I waited so long to get this for my shop.

The shock of the drop caused a heavy transformer inside to shear two legs off at the joint between the transformer body and the lead to the circuit card.As a design observation, the support of the transformer is totally inadequate. Any tool in a shop environment should be able to withstand an applied shock load without sustaining damage. The wire-wrap tie used to support the transformer provides some vertical support, but minimal lateral support. Unfortunately, if the relay init is dropped, the lateral direction is the most likely force application direction. Thus, I am left to try and obtain a replacement transformer or purchase a new unit. Before doing so, I will definately look for alternate products on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice remote","review":"Nice remote. More sturdy than the ShopFox one I previously purchased.

Installation is simple (just plug the receiver into the wall, then plug the dust collector into the outlet on the receiver), and a wall mounting bracket is provided. The Long Ranger is rated at 20 amps, but my dust collector draws somewhat more than that in starting up (I had an electrician check it when he installed a new circuit in my shop for it), and the Long Ranger has never complained.Though the instructions warn that certain types of motors (Shop Vacs were mentioned specifically) might cause interference, I've had no trouble -- the switch performs perfectly from anywhere in my shop, and it's a lot more convenient than running over to the dust collector every time I start up a power tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the convenience or the price.","review":"I am really happy with this purchase.

So in preparation for a loud stadium, the team has NO hand signals, silent counts, etc to help freshman execute? Terrible. Long Bombs are incredibly easy to complete on both sides, which makes for high scores and - SURPRISE EA SPORTS!- boring games.The title has gone downhill dramatically since 2004. To not even tweak the create-a-school option is just plain lazy. Makes you think about the amount of time they put into the game and where it is focused.

Ill give this game one more year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same features as before, plus some major flaws","review":"This game has the same features as before,so in theory, if you a true fan of the series you would be happy, right? Wrong, same features don't cut it, add to that some major flaws in online and solo play, and you would be wasting your money, like I did, if you buy this piece of crap.The most frustrating flaw that's made me sell my copy or just give it away, is that the game slows down so much during key plays, that you just don't get a chance to execute of control the action, and the computer more than often will come up with a BS play to beat you, when otherwise, if the play didn't slow down you would prevail. The crazy thing is that the same happens online, which makes it the worst playing experience I've had with an EA Sports product. I was a big fan of this series, but now I am seriously disappointed.I reccommend playing the NFLA 2k and the ESPN branded games...a lot cheaper, simpler and flawless during play. My 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay this is the deal.","review":"The graphics are good the game looks good. Got some cool features so it must be a good game right? ehh wrong.The problem with this game is that it has a certain program that when ever you start winning it comes back and beats you. It has happened to me and my friends several times. I once had a RB break 7 tackles for a TD and I lost the game because of that. Another thing is it's main focus is on scoring. Your DB can't play Defense worth crap. They will always get burn no matter what. Its total crap. I prefer 2005 over '06. 2005 is more Defense and you have to acctually work for a TD or a point instead of throwing up a ball and having your reciever come down with it every time.Save your money and buy another game."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for gamecube?","review":"I was really looking foward to getting Ncaa and Madden 06 this year.

The biggest BS play on the game is the unrealistic HB direct which gurantees you at least 15 yards. The only way to stop it is by sending a heavy outside blitz every play, and believe me there are knuckle heads that do it every play online. Also in online play people have mastered glitching the game which slows down the connection in pivotol moments to make you play like crap. Also some dorks figured out how to snap the ball to the WR for at least 30 yard gains on every play.

The gameplay is much better then years before and it does feel more and more liek a real football simulation. I am not a big fan of the Madden series... well let me take that back, I love the Madden series, but would rather go for the NCAA title more... but anyway I think it is starting to get up there as being equal to, or even greater then madden.

Run plays have holes opening like they really do on the gridiron and passing for 600 yards a game isn't much of a possibility anymore. The Mascot Game is still useless though. Bring back College Classics from 2000 and 2001!Some of the controls have changed and new features, like the juke stick and impact players, have been added, making this the best video game football simulation to ever hit the PS2 or any other platform.Let's GOOOO MOUNTAINEERS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment","review":"I'm really dissapointed in NCAA 2006.

For one thing, theres just not enough to do. You just play the game, and if you are good and pick a posistion that gets touches the ball alot (ex. QB) Than you can win the heisman in your first year (as I did) and the game is pretty much beaten. Because EA spent so much time developing \\"race for the heisman,\\" they didn't really spend enough time on the dynasty mode which is still pretty much the same as last year. The only difference is the in-season recruiting which is fun, but at the same time overrated and frustrating. If you own NCAA 2005, or even 2004, I dont recomend you get this game.

It's typical \\"alternative\\" rock with distorted guitars (and on Geffen! What a surprise!), so if that ain't your thing, don't get it, but since Alt. Rock is atill really popular, I think most people will like it. It's nothing amazing, but I can't find much fault with it other than the fact it's quite dull.

I didn't find myself humming along to anything on second or third listenings either. If you want to hear a good Remy Zero album go buy \\"The Golden Hum\\" or \\"Villa Elaine\\".

How shocking then, that he co-authored a book that condemns abstinence from the product funding his \\"research\\". There is a reason that this \\"work\\" is not considered significant, relevant or important by any recognized mental health group.Don't ask a shoe salesman if you need new shoes, and don't disregard the overwhelming majority of mental health workers and doctors, because of a book co-authored by a man funded by the alcohol industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, OK","review":"If you don't want to get clean and sober, don't go to AA or NA and by all means repudiate the 12 steps.

The only reason you got a nudge from the judge was because your drinking or drugging got so bad that even the police could notice. When the public takes an interest in your habits they are no longer private business.

People who are mandated to go to 12-Step programs by the courts do not have to stay once their obligation is fulfilled. People who do stay get help. For me the combination of 12-Step programs, therapy and religion has brought me the recovery from addiction that I prayed for before I even knew what praying really meant. Stanton Peele's book is reactionary and uses fear tactics to sell books and inflate the author's ego. I am sad that he chooses to attack programs that have such a wonderful track record. Psychology has been helpful to me over the years, but 12-Step programs (the people, the principles, the literature, and the meetings) have saved my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality","review":"Recently the gal who started Moderation Management as a response to AA was convicted of killing two people in a drunken driving accident.

I stay free from drugs and alcohol with daily contact with a 12 step program, whether it's meetings, friends, prayer, etc. It is clearly stated that it is a SPIRITUAL NOT RELIGIOUS PROGRAM. And \\"God\\" is of YOUR UNDERSTANDING. The basis is that without faith in something greater than yourself...you will pick up.

Everything about this program looks like they did it on the cheap, but the story is so compelling that you'll probably watch it once if you've seen the Ben Kingsley version.

I have beaten the game twice in about a 40 to 60 hours span b/c i tried going every where and getting the best iteams and weapons before i was going to defeat the last boss.

This game is an instant classic among RPG's. From the very first word of this game, the story has you entrapped in its flow. Everything you do, has something to do with the story line unlike some games. There are good twists and turns that keep you playing. The additions system is an interesting challege, but it does get a little annoying when have to kill an enemy and you mess up your addition. The chracters are eye-candy. The voice acting is in all the right places at all the right times. The control is easy to remeber. I didnt like that I was on a fixed path, you should of had a chance to wonder freely, or even better they should of given the option of a fixed path for begining RPGers. The Dragoons are the coolest part of this game. Their spells are awesome to witness. I recomend this game to anyone who apprecitates a fun and intersting game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is all eye-candy and not much else.","review":"While the graphics (especially the FMVs) are breathtaking to behold, that's where the good stuff ends.

An off day with your timing may lead to frustration and death, but it's worth it. You can pick favorites and not be in trouble for leaving a character out, which I always like.

Some things i like about RPGs is unieqness(i dont know if thats a word)and length.And boy does this RPG have both.This game is on the Playstation and it has 4 discs but with length comes a problem not letting the game get old. The game is addictive to a certain point but then it seems like the storys reppetitive.There is however a very cool unieqness about this game.Additions.When you attack you must hit the X button at rite time to continue the attack.As you complete the attack you get spirit points which give you the power to become a dragoon a powerful \\"thing\\" with good magic and strong attack.Well as u totally complete the attacks they level up with so many completions.As your charecter levels up you get different attacks to level up.

There are afew areas where the graphics shine. If your hoping for a role playing game that allows you to effect the story line, this is not it. The nost challanging part of this game is fighting a handfull of monsters (each of these battles takes a minium of 1/2 hour). This game pushes you though a horribly long story line, battel sequences are extrealy repetive, and travel between towns is poorly animated. I found the best part of this game is the attack additions. Spells and time spent as a dragoon is extreamly limited and the endinig is disapponting especially after playing for over 60 hours. My advice is save your money and keep looking, better games are out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playstation's best work.","review":"The Legend Of Dragoon is one of the best Playstation RPG's out there. It has great in-combat options, like, turn into a Dragoon. The game is a little long, and dosen't offer a lot of save points off the main map, but that is what makes the game great. The graphics are amazing! It feels like your watching a movie! Even though there isn't a lot of combat in the game, and the bosses arn't very challenging, it still is a great game. The game offers a lot of well-preapered charcters, and a lot of strategy. It relates a little to the Final Fantasy series, but has a whole different plot. If you wanna buy a good RPG game this is it. The Legend of Dragoon offers a lot of enemies, but focuses on Dragons, and Sandora soldiers. What makes the game so special, is that it offers an option in combat to turn into a Dragoon. Dragoons are legendary cratures that can deafeat the dragons.

I will admit, the animation is pretty good, though, for PS one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh! i shiver at the sound of this game","review":"I'm just really glad that i played this game at my friends house instead of getting it myself.i have to admit though,i did like this game at the very beggining.i did like the additions before they became an essential part of winning any battle.a lot of people like this game.well,im really into the final fantasy series.this game....its just ugh! On the second disc the plot starts dragging along with a bunch of other mini-plots added to it.i didnt like this game but maybe this is because im a eally haardcore gamer and im used to the final fantasy queality games.i have to say,though,the graphics in this game were incredible.the CG movies are the best ive seen.they actually set competition for the final fantasy VIII movies.anyway,unless you are a newcomer to rpg's,I say skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Reviews","review":"Ok, personally i think this game is amazing. The FMVs are spectacular, the spells are very fun to watch, and the Addition system adds a great touch to the game. But I can see why some people dont like it. The story can be shallow at times but I think it moves along at a good pace. The battle system can become annoying, I have friends who are totaly sick off pulling of Additions, and they say the spells take too long. I think that the Additions make the game challenging. I Like the fact that the other characters level up as well as the ones you are using. But the Dragoon leveling up can be very time consuming. To sum it up, this game is great for most RPG fans, but its definetly not something for first timers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game, excellent condition","review":"It's great to be able to relive the classics like this. The only complaint I could possibly make, was that the image was of an original printing version of the game, and the version mailed to me was a \\"Greatest Hits\\" second edition (which would drop the value of the game tremendously, but I got it \\"new\\" for $14 so who am I to complain?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SQUARESOFT RIVAL","review":"This game was one of the greatest game i ever played. I have to say that the graphics of this game was a perfect ten. There is no way you can badmouth the storyline and the cinematic movies and i have to say that this game is good enough to challenge Final Fantasy 7 as One of the best RPG's ever made. Seeing how other Sony RPG were so disappointing, Sony reedemed theirselves with this powerful Four disk adventure. It is game worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mastepiece","review":"Now, you have probably heard alot of reviews saying: oh the grammar is bad, and the music is redundant, and BLAH BLAH BLAH. But PLEASE!!!!! Who really pays attention to that stuff. Oh and to the person who said this game is at a third grade reading level, i've got news for you. In both FF8 and FF9 they say things like: \\"Squall your so stubborn\\" and \\"Already?my charm must be working.\\" I mean I'm not dissing either of those games because I have them and LOVE them, but lay off okay. And though the cinematics aren't very frequent they are KICK ASS!! Like in the second disc where it shows the dragoon war, can it get ANY BETTER?!?! So though there are a few grammatical errors, this is a must have for any gamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars From a Veteran Gamer.","review":"I've nearly finished this game and I must say I have really enjoyed playing it. The storyline is engaging, the characters interact well and the graphics and sound are pretty. Once you get the hang of how to make the characters do their special attacks, you can really do some damage. Be prepared to hang in there for 70+ hours, though - this game has four CDs. Each CD is a different Chapter in the story. I can't give Prima's Strategy Guide for this game five stars, though. It helped me once when I was stuck, but it is surprisingly vague in most of its walk-throughs (as a lot of these guides tend to be). I consider Legend of Dragoon a fine addition to my RPG collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite game of all time!","review":"I got this game as a gift and wasn't sure about it, but after popping it in i couldn't put it down!

This game is nothing but a merchandising blitz created by a company with absolutely no worthwhile experience in the genre. They simply grabbed a few random RPGs from their local EB and jumbled the plots into one less than cohesive whole. I've played this same exact story, with the exact same characters, in several different RPGs. And what about the gameplay? Slow and clunky control, random encounters that occur with every other step, and pretty painted backgrounds that fast become horrifying jumbles of pixels as soon as a fight begins. The list, my friends, can go on forever. This game could have been so much more, but the lack of heart and a little originality turned it into one huge mistake of Sony's part, and I'm sure they're still smarting from the blow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great visuals but thats all...","review":"Once you get past the eye candy this is really a very poor RPG made worse by an awful translation. Uninteresting characters and a weak story combined with CONSTANT...and I do mean CONSTANT...random battles make this a title to avoid.

A very good storyline and character development. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First PSone Game I Ever Played...and Still the Best!!","review":"This was an amazing game!! The story-line was complex and engrossing, the characters were well developed, the plot had unexpected twists and turns, and the attack sequences that you had to master were both challenging and fun!! I would recommend this game to both long-time RPG fans and those just starting out. It takes a while to play through all four discs but it is WELL WORTH IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An underestimated RPG","review":"Legend of Dragoon was a good RPG. The battle system consisted of the traditional turn-based battles. Each charcter had 3 to 5 unique combos that you had to learn. Yes had to, without the combos fights are pretty futile. The boss fights are very fun to play and watch, as your charcters {as well as bosses} do flashy exagerated moves. That alone makes battles funner than your average RPG. The storyline is pretty original with its share of twists. All is not well however, for the game takes a serious downfall in character design. You'd find yourself thinking \\"haven't I seen him in another RPG?\\" To make matters worse, due to the characters wearing obvious colors, \\"via - Power Rangers\\" you'll know your future party members before they even join.

One thing would happen to one person and it would follow suit. The gaining of the gems, the losing of the gems and so on. Gah. That and I've never actually had a game which offended me as much as this one did. The whole thing where every girl in it is helpless and clingy to the 'big strong males' really urked me. Except for Rose, who later obtains the spell 'Death Gate' Which sounded cool as all heck, but it made me actually put the game down for quite a while. This makes you curious if Rose is even really a human female.Blah, I would not suggest this game to anyone.

With that out of the way I advise you run when you see this game. It just bad, bad translation, bad fighting system, bad ending. I mean \\"COME ON!\\" if I spend 50 of the \\"80\\" hours playing this pile o' poo at least let the ending be good. But nooo it had to be as dumb as the rest of the game. Sony needs to look at this game then go to repent. The figting system is just LAME! I can't recall all the times I was sent into a cursing tirade when I did not press the action button in time and my character got slaped silly. The translation is horrible and the story weak at best.

Taking a risk, I bought the game, and found it to be one of the best RPGs I have ever played.Dragoon takes elements from Super Mario RPG by using timed attacks, or \\"additions\\". It must be said that it is a unique system of combat that will make the gamer have to \\"get into\\" the game to do good.Along with gameplay, the graphics shine above any other rpg, including Final Fantasy 8. The story is great, and I thought about it even when I wasn't playing it. Worried about replay value? Don't worry, because the game spans 4cds and takes around 70-80 hours to beat.If you are even remotely into rpgs, and you are looking for a great title for the summer, buy this game immediatly. You will be thanking yourself afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very addicting, after a while","review":"I have to admit that I was like many people who compared this game to Final Fantasy. I thought the beginning of the game was kind of boring, but since I paid my money for it I did not stop playing it. After a while I started to get really addicted to it. I learned to love it. No it isn't Final Fantasy, that was established with the name of the game, there aren't very many games that are Final Fantasy.

The central figure in this series, Lou Boldt, reminds me a lot of the policemen Delaney in Lawrence Saunders early \\"Deadly Sin\\" books from the 70's (before he began writing the shallow \\"McNally\\" stuff), which also included well-rounded characters, and were an engrossing read.

Kurt doesn't screech or howl, but sings by barely opening his mouth. It is rather melancholy and when you listen to it, you can't help but think what was to happen. The song choices are marvellous. Kurt does a version of David Bowie's Man who sold the World (it contains the line \\"I must have died alone, a long long time ago.\\") There is a scary version of Where did you sleep last night and three Meatpuppet tunes. The rendition of Oh me is simple and moving. And there are the Nirvana songs that without their loud guitarwork see more brilliant and shows off Kurt's talent as an ironic and superb songwriter. Haunting and beautiful, this album is perhaps one of the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The men who rocked the world.","review":"This album was a success in many ways, but one of them is that I think it was like hearing your favorite band for the very first time again, and at this point, \\"Nirvana\\" was alot of people's favorite band. It also showed people that the band could do more than just rock, and highlighted the musical and songwriting skills of the group. This disc is also about 1/3 covers, while still including all the \\"Nirvana\\" songs that should have been. Every track here is good, but my faves would have to be Bowie's \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\", the Meat Puppets \\"Lake Of Fire\\", and their own \\"Something In The Way\\". While their other live disc \\"From The Muddy Banks Of The Wishka\\" may be a better representation of the band, this one is more essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a beautiful rememberance of one of Hawaii's premiers","review":"This album is destined to become a keepsake as one of the finest groups to develop in Hawaii.

If you have never heard Sonic Youth, this album is a good overall picture of their entire discography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Directionless","review":"OK, this is where I got off the SY bandwagon once and for all. Jet Set Etc. was bad enough, but this was the pits, and I wasn't going to sit around pretending that these languid, aimless ditties had any worth (of course with the usual caveat - The Diamond Sea is amazing). This was a once great and powerful band whose creative faculties had utterly dried up, and this is from a huge erstwhile fan. So I just tuned SY out of my life for over a decade, til a friend recently lent me Sonic Nurse and I found they had inexplicably found a new lease on creative life.Anyway, the 2 stars are for Diamond Sea, the rest of the album is sonic (and lyric) garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"People in Texas Should'nt Listen To Sonic Youth","review":"To the Texan: Just because you get your favorite bands off the top ten like most mindless drones, doesn't mean you have to knock on the one of the first (Glenn Branca) pioneers of expirimental indie.

Right now this and Murray St are the two sonic youth cds to which i am listening most frequently"},{"rating":"2","title":"uneven but worthwile","review":"this is definitely one of the essential SY albums. there are a handful of incredible songs, but the album really falls apart a few songs in. The Diamond Sea combines one of the most beautiful and timeless melodies the band has ever penned with a long, mesmerizing foray into pure noise bilss. other highlights: Becuz (a great song and one of my all-time favorite Kim Gordon vocal performances) Unwind, Saucer-Like, and Junkie's Promise (which rocks harder and more unconventionally than any song from Dirty). Skip Tracer isn't bad, but in general i don't like music behind poetry/spoken word performances. it's decent (but not great) as poetry, but i'd rather hear it spoken solo. No Queen Blues is ok but not bnecessary. The title track has some excellent guitar work but i hate the lyrics and Kim's delivery is a dissappointment after the beguiling Becuz. this album is a great addition to any SY collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Sonic Youth album","review":"This the best Sonic Youth album to start off with and their best period.

I was already firmly into SY, my life forever changed by Daydream Nation and Dirty. I have kept up with the band since then, and recently picked up this album in CD format. Looking back now, I see how it was a stage in the band's evolution, from earlier noise-rock to more extended compositions. Diamond Sea is worth the price of the CD alone. I think this is the missing link between the Daydream (and earlier)/Dirty stage to the Thousand Leaves stage (their finest hour ??). A must for serious fans, and not a bad starting place for the curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, did I listen to the same album?","review":"This was the last Sonic Youth album I purchased.

It reminds me of One Thousand Leaves....boring, slow, out of tune and downright bad. At least One Thousand Leaves had the song Sunday which is awsome, but Washing Machine lacks any stand out songs.

It doesn't seem like anyone learned anything from the life events that would help them move on or become a better person. There is just utter sadness.

I also noticed that Jun was spiraling into mental instability, but who wouldn't after being forced into becoming a demonic assassin?One of my favorite episodes in this volume was \\"Cat.\\" It was my favorite because it presented a look at love twisted into hatred, and it showed me just how thin the line between those two emotions truly was.If you're the sort of person who can stand violence, bloodshed, and hints of yuri (lesbianism to you non-anime people), then Devil Lady is the anime for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect quality","review":"I got this gadget only because i was getting a cheap price for a refurbished product.

The graphics are like the same as the one for SNES and the sound is pretty good too but I don't like how it saves after you beat a level it just makes it too easy. The bonus levels are also pretty good but the graphics arn't that good in them except for the sniping game. Their are also different options like DK Barrels off/on or Save Barrels off/on which means you have to beat the game three times.

Rare did a good job before with their original game squeezing 32 bit technology into the 16 bit Super Nintendo. Unfortunately they had to remove some of the best features that made this game so popular: Superb stereo soundtrack and both characters on the screen at the same time. There are also many places in which the game slows down significantly because the poor little Game Boy can't take more than 5 moving characters at once. The playability also seems to have declined.

If you are looking for an X Men movie with more mature subject matter this is in your wheelhouse. The movie is done as a motion comic which views basically as a comic panel with the motion consisting of lips moving (like a dubbed movie) or some body parts moving but NOT full animation. I was hesitant at first but when you watch the movie after a while the story takes over and you forget about the motion. (In fact I bought the next 2 titles, Dangerous and Torn) The other complaint is that the movie is shown in episode style and the episodes are short, like under 15 minutes each, and they have a long credit sequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good anime cartoon Marvel fan","review":"Awesome cartoon,enjoyed it Really like X men Will get more in time they did awesomely translating this to DVD cool"},{"rating":"1","title":"good story but \\"not a movie\\"","review":"I bought this at wal-mart yesterday... animated X-Men movie for $15 with a story by Joss Whedon?!?

Basically they scanned the comic panels into a computer & used photoshop to turn, angle & warp the image to give it the appearance of really crappy animation.Then they remove the word bubbles and hire voice actors. The voice acting was not half bad but nobody in their right mind would pay $15 for a movie that is just comic panels flashed on the screen while people read the text. At least when they did it for the Watchman graphic novel it was during the watchmen hype when the movie was out AND they said straight on the package it was a motion comic.... this is just shameless money grubbing and nowhere on the packaging does this say anything about being a motion comic.I made it through the first episode but they couldn't even make the credits smooth... this is going back tomorrow morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing!!!!","review":"My son and I viewed this DVD and it was excellent.

This is false advertising. No where in the product description does it tell you that it is a motion comic.

You should display that some where. Second you don't need to purchase this, if you have xbox live you can get it from off of the zune media section, netflixs, and off of the ps3.

If you loved the original comic run of this story line, then you will love this as well. Now, would I have liked them to do a full-on animated movie of this like DC has been doing with their releases in recent years? For sure. But since this is what they are giving us, I'll take it. To hear voices put to the characters was very cool. To see the original Cassaday artwork brought to \\"life\\", again very cool.I certainly think there is plenty of room for this type of animation - and that's what it is, another type of animation. Not bad (by any account), just different.My only dissapointment is that this is not the full comic run and that actually gets teased near the end of the video.

For no apparent reason this time. I mean, worse so than normal.- Kitty (Shadowcat) seems like she's a 13 year old girl who woke up 30 one day.- Emma Frost isn't poorly done.- Beast... well, let's put it this way, Joss Whedon sucks.There are better X-men TV series out there. X-men Evolution was amazing. That series was proof that you can take artistic liberties with a franchise and build something great out of it.

I used the PS2 port; didn't try USB. Did try various surfaces -- wooden desktop, mousepad, paper, etc. -- but nothing cured the problem. Tried convincing myself that I just needed a new system but couldn't buy it. Returned them both and have settled on a Logitech cordless ball version, which works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable","review":"I bought this mouse because I thought it would last longer the the standard ball mouse.

So it's better if you are left-handed and/or have smaller hands. If I was left-handed, I would not be happy with the release of this mouse. I would be angry at Microsoft for not making their Explorer in a left-handed variant. I hate the thumb button on each side - there is no hope of using the opposite side button, except with your ring finger or pinky (as I keep my middle finger on the wheel and ring on the right-click). Also, the thumb buttons are poorly positioned and very loose, and I found myself accidnetally depressing them at unwanted times (which, depending on how they are programed, can be VERY bad in a game). If you are left-handed, okay. If you are looking at this mouse instead of the Explorer because you have small hands, try the Logitech MouseMan Wheel Optical. At least that's blue. They freakin took away the keen grey finish from the explorer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just not worth the money","review":"After 5 days I unplugged and repackaged this mouse for return.I found that without the mousepad,it made enough noise on my desk that I eventually put the mousepad back.Also,I found I myself accidentally hitting the left side button sending me \\"back\\" when surfing the web.It could be me,but I do not like the design of these side buttons.I noticed no actual improvement over my Microsoft Wheel Mouse, and realized popping that little ball out 3 or 4 times a year isn't all that big a deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for 3d games","review":"To the reviewer who said it's lousy for games....I beg to differ. I play Half-Life Team Fortress Classic (mostly as a sniper) and the accuracy and response speed is unmatched by any ball based mouse that I've used. This is the mouse 3d gamers have been waiting for. As much as I hate the company Microsoft, I have to commend them with this great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, high quality mouse","review":"I just received the mouse a few days ago. At first when I installed it, I didn't like it, but it grew on me. It took an hour or two to get used to the optical mouse compared my previous one (a Logitech Mouseman 3-button, the one that fits your whole hand) and being a guy with big hands it wasn't easy.Now there is no problem at all! I trained myself in a few hours to get used to the new configuration and to use it well. I do find that it tracks differently from a mouse ball, it's more accurate and less sloppy. The precision is fantastic! Once you install the software that comes with it, and I highly recommend you do, it's just a matter adjusting the settings to your personal favorite. Then you'll faster with your mouse than you ever thought!I highly recommend this mouse for anyone who needs a new mouse. It is too expensive to just buy outright though. Wait until your mouse breaks or the price comes down another 5-10 dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows the competition into the dirt!","review":"OK, I'll make this short and sweet. I have for some time tolerated many different types of mouse, many bought as a false economy - \\"A cheap mouse is all I need\\". Wrong! After having seen the older Intellimouse Explorer that my good friend Bazzroid had bought recently I thought perhaps my mind would be changed. However, I came to the conclusion that it was overpriced and unwieldly. A truly MAJOR disappointment! Not so with the new Intellimouse Optical. This revision on the older product now gives both left and right-handed users a chance to experience the delights of 'no-ball' action. Let's just say that after having tried one I had to buy it. My old mouse went where it belonged, in the trash can. My friend Bazzroid took one look at this new model and knew he had to get his Explorer version swapped for the Optical. He's still looking for a buyer. No luck so far! If you're in the market for a new mouse then look no further. Get one - TODAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mouse","review":"I got this mouse for Christmas, and so far I love it. After getting used to a wheelie mouse at work and not having one at home, I'd been meaning to pick one up for some time now. This mouse moves extremely smoothly over my mousepad, and has a cheerful looking red light shining out the back (palm) end. The only complaint I have with the mouse is that the two side buttons are too easily pressed while just moving the mouse around, especially when you have to pick up the mouse and reposition it. You have to make sure to grab the mouse at the base, below the buttons while you're moving it around or picking it up. Still, the side buttons are quite useful for web surfing. The thumb button takes you back a page, the finger button takes you forward. Of course, the button action can be customized to suit your needs with the Intellimouse software. Definitely a worthy addition for anyone tired of cleaning out those gunky rollers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Feel and Responsiveness","review":"I was looking for a new mouse to upgrade from my existing MS 3-Button Intellimouse. I loved many of the features of my old mouse. The shape, and the scroll-button functionality were great.Unfortunately, I began to struggle with the mouse ball sticking a bit. The general lack of responsiveness for drawing programs, and other detail sensitive applications led me to purchase the optical mouse.I noticed an immediate improvement in responsiveness in ALL mouse movements while using the MS IntelliMouse Optical. This makes pointing, clicking and scrolling much more responsive, and less frustrating.If you are looking for a mouse with that maintains the features of the traditional IntelliMouse, but offers added functionality and responsiveness, this is a great pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this before buying the product!","review":"I bought two for my computers - one with Windows ME and the other with Windows 2000 installed. The one with the Windows 2000 worked fine, except it won't scroll forwards and backbards when using Netscape. The one installed on the Windows ME was a nightmare! First, it did not have the proper driver in the box (a 3.1 driver was included and is not compatible with Windows ME. Second, even after loading the 3.2 driver from the web it did not work properly. At one point, I was without mouse use and spent over 10 hours on the phone with microsoft and still it is not working. Currently, Microsoft has escalated the case so a senior technician will call me back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse","review":"There isn't really anything revolutionary about this \\"modern\\" pointing device since optical pointing devices have been with us since the 80's. However, previous implementations of the optical mouse required a special mouse-pad with a printed matrix pattern from which the mouse determines precise movement. The IntelliMouse Optical has no such requirement -- you don't even need a mousepad.PROS: no mouse ball to clean, never skips, no left/right hand bias, fast mouse rate (due to USB interface) which makes it great for gaming, and (for the conservative) it matches the rest of your computer (if your computer is beige).CONS: it's a bit too light (weight wise), not too ergonomic (unlike the right-hand biased IntelliMouse Explorer), red \\"taillight\\" can get irritating if you leave your computer overnight and it's a bit expensive for a pointing device (although still worth it for me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest!!","review":"I just got my new intellimouse optical today and I am already sold on it. I was so tired of cleaning the ball on my convential mouse. I love the way this one just glides on the desk with total control.

Microsoft acknowledges the problem (KB Article ID: Q274796) and asks me to wait patiently for a fix, or to return it for a refund... So if you plan to use it on ME with Netscape, you better wait until Microsoft fixes this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Ok, I got this mouse way back in October of 2000. I don't know how I could live without it. It is sturdy, contrary to many people's belief that dropping it will hurt the optical sensor--I've dropped it many times and it works just the same. The only thing I don't like about the mouse is sometimes the cursor on the screen will suddenly go to the upper-right of the screen. I'm an avid gamer, and this can get annoying when your in the middle of a fight. But the mouse is so smooth I don't have the guts to go buy a different mouse. Highly recommended to a gamer or someone who uses a mouse all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent buy - I love it.","review":"I have to say, I got a great deal on this mouse.

This mouse also looks very cool... there is a neat light that glows out the bottom when your computer's on and it also has a little tail light. The precision and fast response time of the mouse is amazing...a vast improvement over traditional mouses (mice?). The two extra buttons on the side also come in very handy.. they are precongifured to be used as back and forward buttons for internet browsing, a very useful feature, but you can change them to do a lot of other things. The only problem that I've had is that it is sometimes diffucult to avoid pressing the \\"forward\\" button by accident but it's not a big thing. Highly recomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive","review":"Love this mouse, feels right in you're hands, glides smoothly, very accurate, and looks great (love the red light).

It WORKS GREAT with a mouse pad, and works FLAWLESSLY WITHOUT A MOUSEPAD. Other people complain about the software, but you dont even have to install the software for the mouse to work.

This mouse beats anything that Logitech currently offers, and I've been a fan of their mice for years. This mouse has control I've only dreamed of, and has excellent adjustment software. There's only one reason I'm giving this mouse 4 stars, though, and that was the installation. I felt queasy switching over from a PS/2 mouse to a USB mouse, and I was right. It took me about five reboots and two software reinstallations before I got the mouse to work right, and I could take the old mouse offline. If you are a beginner computer user, you might want to have someone who knows what to do install the mouse for you.

The vest is filled with cheap memory foam inserts about a half-inch think and did not keep my dog afloat- fortunately he is a good swimmer because this vest didn't do much. It was also very difficult to use the handle to pick up the dog from the water to get him back on the boat because there is so little support underneath and the straps appear to cut into the dogs stomach.

I'll admit they might not seem as out there but this was a logical step-forward from Dirty and it improved on some of Dirty's flaws ( which you can easily see ).And yes you could see that there's more of pop influence in what they were doing but it's done elegantly and there's nothing superficial in it's execution.

Nevertheless, the \\"cool\\" factor elevates this game above other luck-based games."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flight into fantasy","review":"I personally collect dragons and I thought this game would be a nice addition. I got it because the figures were done well but the game itself seeemed intriguing. When we played it (we're in our late 20s), we had lots of fun.

The sound and images are superb. A very emaciated Claudio Abbado gives the music all his talent, and the BPO responds and plays in typically superb style of the highest standard. The possibility of switching to the Orchestra's view of Abbado is amazing, and ideal for the Abbado worshippers. The performances are, in my opinion, better than the CD set by Abbado and the BPO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is a very enjoyable 'best of' collection by Chris Rice. He combines solid Christian lyrics with a pleasant mellow sound.One song on here that is very good and is a challenge to Christians is \\"Go Light Your World.\\" His admonition to go and make a difference to those who don't know Christ is particularly good. Another one that I had never heard before is \\"Mama Prays.\\" It is one that should really remind parents of the importance of praying for their children.There are several other very good songs and none that I dislike. Three of the songs in this collection are also on his 'Snapshots: Live and Fan Favorites' CD. Those are the following: 'Deep Enough to Dream,' 'Cartoons,' and 'Come to Jesus'.For anyone who has children of any age, 'Cartoons' is a must have song. It will provide lots of entertainment and fun to the young and young at heart.I would recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"My son has this CD and we now purchased another one for a friend's birthday.

It seemed comfortable overall and well-made. We will save it for a future baby (either ours or a friend's). A couple of minor issues: the hood part fastens with Velcro under the chin. This was problematic for my daughter since her under-the-chin area is not very big. The hat kept riding up and she ended up mouthing the chin section. She didn't really mind but it was not easy to keep in place. It would've been easier to have a hat that just fit on top of her head rather than a hood-like piece. Also, in order for this to be a pumpkin-shaped suit, it's very padded and puffy. I think my girl would've been way too warm if I had left her in it for more than 10 minutes at a time. It would've been great if we had taken her outside but she's still too young to trick-or-treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot....","review":"This dvd contains 2 old Gamera movies that have been issued and reissued a dozen times, this is just 1 more with few surprises.

I bought this dvd and have no complaints. I can only say that if you have never seen them and you're under the age of thirty, you might want to rent them first. But if you're into the old Japanese monster movies, this should be right up your alley. To me, good monster movies are made with rubber suits, model cities and wires everywhere!

They were made to scare and have lots of fun doing it. They gave me nightmares years ago. I am older and wiser now. I still had to turn the light on and look around the bed. I really enjoyed watching them again. My family once again not as amused as I was. However these movies brought back vivid memories of the early seventies and what a great time that was. As with alot of the older movies the moviegoer was left to use their imagination. Especially with scantilly clad women running around. Those were some hot looking vampire babes. Makes you almost want to get bit in the neck. With the new vampire genre, I find myself addicted to Count Yorga, Blacula, and those movie heros or villians that graced the big screen in my youth. I cant wait to watch these movies again and especially play them during a Halloween movie extravaganza."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cropped and flawed movie","review":"Review of the dvd;Cropped on top and bottom from 1.33:1 to 1.77:1. However, you don't realy miss much. While it is a make or break deal with many hammer movies the end up with the nudity being cut off, this one has none and the increase in picture quality over the old 1.33:1 vhs makes up for it.Now for the movie it'self;Vincent Price hit the nail on the head when he said Robert Quary couldn't act. And Quarry's influencing the director to cut all the planned nudity turned what could have been a decent vamp flick into a tame piece of garbage, and deprived us of some decent possible video of the lovely Judy Lang (dead ringer for Lysette Anthony)Shame she did so few things."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blast from the past","review":"There hasnt been any great Vampire pics for decades now, not since the great days of Christopher Lee at Hammer and there have only been a few from the US, the original Dracula and then Count Yorga.

These are both traditional vampire tales very much influenced by dracula but yet still very american. I think any vampire fan can enjoy these bite fests as Yorga sinks his teeth into you! The movies are early seventies and are not a liberated as what would come with full nudity and such just a few years later. Although 'daughters of darkness' was around at this time. So to me these flicks are very good vamp flicks that are similiar to older movies but they have more blood in them. The prints look very good on this dvd too and perhaps someone will do a blu ray version with both flicks on it. why not? vamp flicks have always been hot and blue in nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"they picked the wrong songs.","review":"sonic youth are a great band, there is no doubt about it. and i do love most of the songs on this cd, but they don't work together. sonic youth isn't the type of band who gets a best of album. you could put them on a mix tape, but that's it. sonic youth do albums. not hits.take your money and buy a copy of the s/t ep. you could probably find it on ebay. or get a copy of \\"nyc ghosts and flowers\\" or maybe \\"sister.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoping this will do the trick.","review":"I got this for my 11 year old daughter who has trouble (still) with her multiplication facts.

The open-cell foam rubber pad disintegrated -- probably due to some of the chemicals in sweat and <shudder!> ear wax. 3. The mic could not be clipped in a position that excluded road noise and included our voices -- we ran down our TalkAbout radios' batteries because wind and road noise triggered the VOX switch, also jamming our communications. 4. It wasn't the most sanitary solution going (see 2). ... For cyclists (bicycle and motorcycle), I recommend the headset/boom mic combination.

It's told out of order, and I usually don't like flashbacks. It's believable, and I usually don't like stories that seem like real life. However, I really enjoyed this film. Peter & Vandy is a bit like a cross between About Last Night and Memento.Ritter and Weixler have terrific chemistry together--the scenes they're in play out very smoothly (almost predictably, but not in a bad way). It's also nice to notice little things (both verbal and physical) that connect various scenes. Kudos to continuity.Peter and Vandy is similar to About Last Night, but without so much pathos. P&V; concentrates on what brings these two people together and how they become what they are.

The sample style is nice to listen to, but was totally played out years before this came out.At least Beck does not rap on this cd.The beck i really enjoy is the beck who makes up goofy songs based on obscure folk masters such as woody guthrie.i think becks version of electronica and rapping are really wrong and embaressing. the same problem i have with dub narcotic sound system. If he wants to be taken seriously in those feilds he needs to put much more effort in to it.his pop melodies are quite nice. however i could just buy a motown record, and get something truly emotional and truly amazing.at least beck is not doing grunge.i wish he would stick to roots. i think he's looking in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lyrics are downers","review":"Beck's music is OK (though it is too self-consciously trying to be strange), but his lyrics are the pits. Of course, the lyrics are very abstract and many times seem to make no sense at all. That alone wouldn't bother me, but the words that Beck seems to randomly string together finally end up \\"coagulating\\" into a picture of depression, death, decay, social decadence, and so on. There are many references to death, garbage, rot, nooses, and other wonderful topics. Beck's state of mind seems to be terribly bleak (or maybe it's all just a con, an act. Either way, I don't like it).This guy is the new Dylan? That's an insult to Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best!","review":"I have heard a lot of different albums and songs, but Becks songs are amazing on Odelay.

Can't wait for the next release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty weird...in a good way","review":"Beck is the king of innovative sampling. There are so many weird sounds on this album (not to mention weird lyrics) that it's a wonder that it makes any sense at all. Somehow, it does.It would be easy to dismiss this guy as just some kid obsessed with copping every sound snippet he can find, and jumbling it all together like some strange tossed salad. Add some wacked-out, nonsensical lyrics (at least *I* can't figure out what the heck he's talking about), and there you have it. But that view would be underestimating Beck's talent. This is a pretty cool album. I don't think it's any sort of timeless classic, but it's great in its own warped way.Comparing him with Bob Dylan may be a stretch. The only similarity I can think of is that I couldn't figure out what the heck Dylan was singing about half the time either. Nevertheless, Beck is on to something here."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for Universal Music Company (Deluxe Edition) 5 for Beck","review":"Just wanted to add a comment to the comments. Although it's pointed out that the Booklet is a disappointment because of the 'High School interviews', what makes it worse is it appears these are fictional or scripted. Someone trying to be funny. I could have seen some worth if they were real, but what's the point otherwise. They still might've been okay but there's like 10 of them. Maybe 2-3 could've been cute, othewise it's a complete waste of 5 pages of the booklet. Now go out and buy everything Beck ever did."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Album of all time!","review":"If you have the choice to listen to one CD on repeat for the rest of your life, then I urge you, choose Beck's Odelay. It is endlessly intruiging, and it's musical songwriting can keep you thinking for hours on what it means. It's one album you'll never get sick of, because its layered sounds and ample samples (pretty catchy, eh?) are enough to keep your head spinning forever. A karate chop to the waning grunge era, this effort proves there is hope for alternative music in the future. It features delicious rhymes such as those in \\"Where It's At\\" and \\"Hotwax\\", twangy folk hooks like \\"Sissyneck\\" and \\"Lord Only Knows\\", and space-age cyber raps like \\"High 5 (Rock the Catskills)\\" and \\"Novacane\\", Odelay definetly is the album with the most to offer I've seen in a long time, and will see for a long time. Hopefully those tired bands like Matchbox 20 and Tonic will give this an ear and realize that we're all sick of useless angst and we want to be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD...what can I say it kicks @ss!!","review":"Beck is one hell of a musician and this CD only proves this. He has the ability to create different types of music throughout his albums. For instance he went from pay no mind to Novacane, to Nobody's fault but my own. That takes talent which I think he definately has. Some people complain that he does too much sampling in this CD, but those samples are what make some of the songs so interesting. I highly reccomend this CD for anyone looking for a multitalented musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"People are complaining that Beck just isn't Beck any more. So what? Listen to Mechanical Animals, then ACS, and tell me; is Manson still Manson? No, he's changed A LOT. Does that make his music bad? No! Just different. Same goes for Beck. He's still just as good, only different."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER","review":"This cd is better than any cd I have ever heard in my life. You should DEFINITELY get it!

This weird album gives you extraordinary lyrics. At times, you'll hear rhythms that sound better before the proceeding record plays. Mainly, this album would remind you of Hip-Hop.Relative tracks that caught my ears pleasantly were the laid-back \\"Lord Only Knows,\\" the Punk \\"The New Pollution,\\" the dizzying \\"Direlect,\\" \\"Novacane,\\" the peaceful \\"Jack-ass,\\" the somewhat club-sounding \\"Where It's At,\\" the rocker \\"Minus,\\" \\"Sissyneck,\\" and the slowest song on this record, \\"Ramshackle.\\"If you have an open-mind and could tolerate eclectic rhythms, then you'll enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Excellent?","review":"I chose 2 bought this record after I had bought his newest album \\"Midnite Vultures\\". Because Midnite Vultures is the 1st time that i listen 2 beck, the songs r really wonderful so i decided 2 collect all of his albums. When the 1st time that i listen 2 this cd, I hated it, i thought only Devi's Haircut and New Pollution are good. However, after i had read the reviews on amazon.com, i tried 2 pay more effort on listening this cd, and pay more attention 2 the songs that the customers suggested, then i liked it. But i still not agree with the people say \\"every song can b released as a single\\". After all, Odelay is not perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone Says This Is A Classic But I Can't See Why","review":"There seems to be a huge amount of hype about this album that I cannot understand. I have tried to listen to it 4 times now but have never got to the end. It is a mish-mash of chants and sounds with no 'real' songs. Even 'Where It's At' loses it's appeal after you've sat through the first seven songs. Maybe it couldn't live up to all of the hype but it's dreadful. Make very sure you are a Beck fan before you buy this. When I hear an album as bad as this it makes me wonder about the artist who made it. Surely they could spot it was poor after the hundreds of times they must have heard it while recording and producing it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Samples Galore","review":"Beck samples the heck out of every imaginable music/noise source, then throws it all together into a strange mixture. He has the same approach to lyrics -- just a bunch of word collages and nonsensical snippets strung together.So does it make anything worth listening to? Not really. This stuff gets annoying fast. Strip all of the weird samples and noises out of the music, and the melodies (if you can even call them that) are extremely weak.If this guy is the next Bob Dylan, (Yeah...Right!!!), then the best I can say is that at least his voice isn't as whiny as Dylan's."},{"rating":"2","title":"guest starring charlie haden","review":"for all the hype i'ma have to say that i think mutations is a better album and sea change is a little bit worse!! nineteen ninety-six musta been cool oh wait i was there. p.s. charlie haden isn't much of a star, whoops."},{"rating":"1","title":"An over rated bomb","review":"Just a bunch of sound collages and sampling.

So far it's his most popular album, so if you're looking for some Beck after hearing a tune on the radio this is probably the one you want to go for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Just Don't Get It, Do I?","review":"After hearing and reading the critical ravings from the four corners of the earth praising this album, I desperately wanted to like it. I listened...and listened...and I just can't hear what a large majority of listeners seem to hear. This sounds like cleverly constructed collages of noise instead of actual songs. Perhaps the aural equivalent of carelessly flung blobs of paint on a tilted canvass and then passed off as abstract art. This evidently appeals to quite a few folks out there. As for me, I find the whole thing rather unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding!","review":"I waited a long to buy this (I always loved \\"...and a microphone\\"), but what a HUGE disappointment. If you are over forty-four years old and were aware of music since you were ten, don't waste your time on this. This album is the DEFINTION of derivative. I will only listen to it once, because I got tired of writing down each song's obvious original infuence: Strawberry Alarm Clock, Zappa, Country Joe and the Fish, oh my goodness, this guy should be paying these groups royalties for this rip off!

Actually, that's an understatement. I was curb-kicked. Then beaten mercilessly. This album is awkward in many places, far too busy in many others, and just plain boring. Beck's techno skills pale in comparison to the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, and his rapping (if you can call it that) is lame. This CD is just plain weak. Don't buy it.

In a typically self-staged and produced film, Karajan tries hard to portray himself as somewhat of a \`serious' musician.

There are small, almost unnoticable lines in the film but you can barely see them. Also, the film becomes very noticeable over the window when I turn a my desk lamp on (about 1.5 feet away). It is still slightly drafty (I think it's just a cheap window) but the film cuts the draft down noticeably. Saw a commercial for Duck brand film that is sold in WalMart stores, probably would have bought that in-store to save on the 80% s&h; charge.A note: 3M is back at they're old tricks, practically giving away their double stick tape (retails for about $6) so you buy their film for $10. It may be more economical for you to buy the 3M tape, which I hear is the best, and use it on Duck brand film. For the same price as the 2-window 3M kit you can get a 5-window Duck kit (3M's version is $18). However, I personally don't know if Duck is any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff works... but the description is wrong","review":"I ordered the 2 window size - 2PK (Doesn't this mean 2 pack?) and only 1 box came in the mail.

I ordered 3 boxes thinking it would cover six 5x7 windows, every box has the same contents so its not a packaging error.on a better note, I made what I did get work, easy to install and looks fine, does the job.

Unfortunately we have a \\"soft loft\\" style condo with a few exposed brick walls and rough finished wooden window frames. And, our bedroom windows are the type that crank open...not the normal up/down open type. This made cutting the plastic to fit nearly impossible. With the crank and locks all around the window itself, we did our best to fit the plastic up to the edges of the window just shy of the cranks/locks. Even using the hair dryer, we couldn't get the plastic tight on the windows. I guess it still helps a little, but we were hoping for a better fit.

I have painted brick and the tape stuck just fine on it after applying some heat to it. Not sure if it will take up the paint or not. I decided to apply to the brick instead of the metal surround in order to seals off all cracks. While my bricks still feel cold to the touch the area around the fireplace is much warmer now than before. Application wasnt too bad. I started at the top applying heat with a hair drying making sure it was stuck before doing sides and bottom. For the sides do not peel the tape backing off all at once but do it in sections.

I'd actually already seen it WITH him, and HE even knows the movie is bad! Although Max never made it big in Hollywood (he was on a couple of daytime soap operas for awhile, and did some off-Broadway shows), see if you can pick out James Spader, most recently the star in the fantastic Boston Legal TV series, now in re-runs. I think Max told me this was one, if not the first, of James' first acting jobs, too. There are also a couple of cameo scenes by a couple of \\"B\\" TV actors (Lou Ferrigno being one)... and those actors you see occasionally in bit parts, but can never remember their names.If you like bad acting and bad plots, this movie is for you!

If she needed to do this in order to find herself... but she shouldn't leave her children to be brought up by her nanny, because she lived the same situation herself and I guess she didn't like it. I think when you have children you can't think just about yourself all the time. You have duties! On the subject of being treated like a doll,I think she was in a confortable situation and she wasn't really interested in changing it. Because if she wasn't happy with so many things that were happening in her marriage she should try talking to her husband and not wait until her husband said or did something about it.

Nora today would not, of course, face the lies and deceit necessary to pay for her husband's health-giving trip. Still, though, how many wives today feel trapped by their roles as wives and mothers, with no real outlet to discover their true selves, their true strengths? Women may have more freedoms, but how many times, when a mother leaves her husband and children, do we assume something is wrong with her, that she is just being selfish, and not look at what her husband, and society, has done to make her feel she must take this desperate step.

A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Album","review":"\\"American Thighs\\" truly is one of the most beautiful albums of the 1990's. Nina Gordon and Louise Post harmonize beautifully in their sing-song voices on almost every track, as well as adding a wicked, fuzzy guitar solo. I've had this album since 1994, when I was but a little girl. I first heard \\"Seether\\" on the radio, and I fell in love with it almost instantly. In my opinion, \\"American Thighs\\" is a better album than \\"Eight Arms to Hold You,\\" maybe because the band had not recieved such critical acclaim until after \\"Thighs\\" was released. Tracks like \\"All Hail Me,\\" \\"Seether,\\" and \\"Victrola\\" showcase the band's hard rock and grunge sensibilities, whereas \\"Fly,\\" \\"Twinstar,\\" and \\"Sleeping Where I Want\\" show off their softer side. This album is a perfect mix of fuzzy, distorted guitars, pleasant vocals, and melody. This is grunge for girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"All hail them.","review":"I remember when \\"Veruca Salt\\" came out, they had alot of hype around them. This album justified it. The success came from well crafted alt-rock songs, catchy and grungy, and great harmonizing between the two girls. Maybe not perfect, but it was a good combination. I saw them open for \\"Hole\\" once, and \\"VS\\" blew them away. The big hit here is \\"Seether\\", and while some tracks rock like that, others show the softer side of the band. I think every song here is good, especially \\"All Hail Me\\" and \\"Twinstar\\". I'm not sure if they're still a band, and I know they had other albums, but I suspect this will always be their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought into the hype","review":"Seether was a good song by an otherwise marginally talented band. The comparison to Hole is somewhat amusing from other reviewers as that band is a prime example of what a hack Courtney Love is. Ergo any band that emulates that one, is just a bad copy of a bad copy.Go buy Elastica's self titled debut if you want a great cd from the 1990's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speak Up For Middle Age American Males Everywhere","review":"If you want american thighs try AC DCs \\"Rock Me All Night Long.\\" Whispy voices Of \\"American Thighs\\" made the lyrics unintelligable.

O.K. coming from a local garage, not O.K. if you're paying $ for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little mellower than Eight Arms..., but to good use","review":"My first exposure to Veruca Salt, a number of years ago, was their album Eight Arms To Hold You, which remains my favorite. This album is a bit mellower. The guitars aren't as dominant, the lyrics aren't as angry, and the overall feel is a touch quieter. These are not bad things though; if you were listening to hear the words and not to bang your head, you might actually prefer this album to their other work. Some of the earlier tracks on the album have quite an edge to them all the same, especially the opening \\"Get Back,\\" which would fit just fine on Eight Arms, in my opinion. It trails off a bit at the end, and that's why I didn't give it five stars; this is an album I listen to the first two thirds of pretty often, and the last few tracks of not so much at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Seether is the center of it all\\"","review":"American Thighs is one of my favorite albums of all time. Almost ten years after its release, I still reach for this CD as much as ever. This album has so much to offer from the heavier tracks with the disturbing lyrics like \\"Seether\\" and \\"All Hail Me\\" to fun rocking numbers like \\"Victrola\\" and \\"Number One Blind\\" (I love the line \\"Levelor, which of us is blind\\") to beautiful tracks like \\"Wolf\\" and \\"Celebrate You.\\" American Thighs has it all...well, except song lyrics (what's up with that?). By the way, these girls know how to rock! Get ready to hold on tight when the axes suddenly fall in \\"Get Back\\"! They are excellent guitarists and vocalists. If you do not have this CD, you are missing out big time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Been in my collection for years and still a top favorite","review":"The title says most of what I have to say, but if you don't want to take my word for it just listen to the songs below for a taste of girls rockin hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the fire?","review":"I don't make a habit of writing bad reviews, but I don't see why everyone's so praiseworthy of this effort.I love girl rock, and I bought this album after being impressed with Seether and Volcano Girls (the latter from a different record) I was discouraged when I realised almost every song on this album sounded like a 2nd rate SeetherI like the progressive slow chugging of 25, and the smouldering afore-mentioned Seether (and there are a couple more standout tracks that stick in your head) but as a whole I don't think this album stands up well at all. It lacks the fire that made Volcano Girls such a good tune, and to me the songs melt together into one slow, trudging mess of samey guitar-pop, every song with far too little to distinguish it from the one preceding.I like a challenging listen but I've heard this loads and still don't see the attraction.Too poppy to be a good indie album, not enough memorable tunes to be a good pop album; this was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent","review":"I found this accesory for my talkabouts excelent.

This is a priority one for any anime fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song-For-Song, a Near Perfect CD","review":"Transcendental Blues is yet another classic Steve Earle album offering a nearly flawless set of Rock, Mellow Rock and Folk songs. Similar to Jerusalem, these guitar-based songs are organic, free of polish and carry the same grassroots/Americana feel as The Jayhawks, John Melloncamp and old electric Neil Young. Not a bad song on the CD. I continue to make the Springsteen comparison because of basic similarities: both delivery highly charged lyrics addressing politics, social issues and are revered within the music industry. Earle enjoys significant recognition, but not always with the casual music fan - if you like Springsteen, you should try Steve Earle.GENRES: Rock, Mellow Rock, Folk.BUY IF YOU LIKE: Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, John Prine, The Jayhawks, John Melloncamp.MUST HEAR TRACKS: \\"Transcendental Blues,\\" \\"Everyone's In Love With You,\\" \\"Another Town,\\" \\"I Can Wait,\\" \\"Steve's Last Ramble,\\" \\"Lonelier Than This,\\" \\"When I Fall.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcendental Genre Hopping","review":"In what was his most genre-defiant album since his masterworkCopperhead Road, Steve Earle stuffed \\"Transcendental Blues\\" with every idea he wanted to. There's everything from his standard randy country-folk, a bit ofRubber SoulBeatles, a dab ofByrdsianpsychedelic folk, and even an Irish Stomper in the concert fave \\"Galway Girl.\\" However, despite the title, the album is rarely transcendent, even if it does touch the blues at times.TBlues is still pretty much what we Steve Earle fans would expect. Earle maintains his excellent songwriting, penning a pair of great songs in the title song and the album's closer, \\"Jonathan's Song.\\" The latter, a somber and funny look at his ultimate passing on, is sparse and lovely. It ranks as one of his best. While casual fans might find \\"Transcendental Blues\\" to be a bit too eclectic (I'd suggestEl CorazónorWashington Square Serenadeas starting points), it is still a solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...with a dark cloud hangin' down low.\\"","review":"I grew up listening to this guy and four years ago he dropped THIS on us. I'd bought this as a present for my dad (who introduced me to Steve Earle) and I ended up keeping it for myself and wearing out that copy. Three copies later, it still remains one of my faves and I still believe this to be Steve's best recording. It doesn't matter how rock you are, how country you are, or how hip you are. EVERYONE will find something to love here. I just re-bought it last weekend on a road-trip to a Metallica concert so take that for what it's worth.Transcendental Blues may be the album of Steve's career. As much as I love \\"El Corazon\\", \\"Jerusalum\\", \\"I Feel Alright\\", and \\"The Hard Way\\" (Billy Austin never loses it's impact), this is still my favorite of his. If America had any taste in music whatsoever, this would have gotten a Grammy. That's all I have to say about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I read a semi-negative review of the record before I heard the album, but prepared myself to to disregard the negative critique. Sadly, I have to agree with the anonymous reviewer's opinion: I was let down. I will give this CD some more chances, but I'm not humming any of the songs, nothing is stuck in my head. The song where he duets with a woman (forgive me, I forget the title and collaborator) is a welcome change of pace. I enjoy Steve rocking out for the most part, which he doesn't do here. That said, ''I Ain't Ever Satisfied\\" is my fave Earle tune, so I can dig the country slanted slower stuff...but this record didn't do it for me--not yet anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"I'm willing to give this some more listens, but on first go through, I'm not particularly impressed by this CD. Some reviewers suggest that some of Earle's earlier material is better, so maybe I should check out some of that stuff. Anyway, I became aware of Steve Earle through the \\"if you like ..., you'll like ... \\" I just don't understand the grounds for all the rave reviews given. His songs are more interesting than the straight Nashville commercial releases, but I don't believe his material compares favorably with some others in the alt country genre. For example, I just don't feel that Earle's songs hold a candle compared to those of James McMurtry, an Austin based country-rocker. A fair bit of Mcmurtry's material rocks just as hard as Earle's, but JM's material has much greater thematic range and vividness of character and narrative. Try out James McMurtry's \\"Too Long in the Wasteland\\", \\"Candyland\\" or \\"Walk Between the Raindrops\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's whining again","review":"After a true album of the year bid in THE MOUNTAIN, I was really looking forward to Steve Earle's next work. Trans. Blues heads right back to the generic, me-too, whining stuff that he did before. The lyrics are average and the music is not remarkable. I don't think it was the booze and drugs that have held him back. I think his music has held him back back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Transcendental Here","review":"Like a few other reviewers (yes, we are in the minority) I really, really wanted to like this album, my first by Steve Earle. I purchased it after buying Jimmie Dale Gilmore's new CD, based on Amazon's recommendation and the many, many positive reviews already posted. However, I'm disappointed in the lack of variety in the selections and in the production. The music absolutely so overwhelms Mr. Earle's vocals that half the time I had no idea what he was singing about. On the other hand, I can't say enough about Mr. Gilmore's new CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Earle effort by far","review":"I can't imagine anyone who has heard much Earle giving a high rating to this awful CD. I can only assume the high rating come from recent fans brain dead from listening to the radio. Compared to that stuff maybe it sounds good. Let me say I'm a big Steve fan and I've heard most of his albums. This sounds like bad outtakes from Revolver or Rubber Soul. Do yourself a favor and go get \\"Guitar Town\\" or \\"The Mountain\\" and hear some great Steve music. I saw him on Austin City Limits playing songs from this CD and they were just as bad live as they are here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Steve Earle as Guitar Town","review":"I haven't bought a Steve Earle album since Guitar Town, which I purchased back around 1989. I should have listened to a few of the sample tracks before buying Transcendental Blues, because this album doesn't sound anything like what I expected. Some of the tracks still retain the unique Steve Earle country/rockabilly sound, but most of the songs remind me more of Elvis Costello than they do Steve Earle, and I'm not an Elvis Costello fan by any stretch. And on top of that, one of the tracks concludes with a profanity that will prevent me from playing this album whenever my seven-year-old is within earshot. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"earle preaches flat","review":"there are no new themes or rhythms here. should the earth be populated with humans? overrun with humans? no"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Since Steve Got out of Jail!","review":"Steve Earle's creative output since 1995 has been staggering. 5 albums, a book of short stories, poetry, a record label, support of numerous causes (and I'm definitely missing somethings).

Are you blues different when you bounce off the bottom? When you transcend your demons are there new ones waiting? Or are blues still the blues?In chasing the answers to questions such as those, Steve Earle crafted one of his finest albums in \\"Transcendental Blues,\\" a collection that teeters on the edge, drawing both from his country rebel roots and his traditionalist leanings. He distills the heartbreak and essence of loneliness, then turns the tables and celebrates the urges and desires of living with equal aplomb. Mr. Earle melds genres here, while weaving vivid tales.This is one of those CDs I listen to intently, put aside, then invaribly put back at the top of the stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Gem","review":"Like another reviewer did, I pulled this off a dusty shelf and listened to it again recently ... and was blown away all over again. This is a total gem of an album. Great songs, great performance and singing by Steve. That emotional thump that makes good albums rise to greatness. This one has it all. As others have noted, Steve Earle is amazingly consistent and has released loads of great music over the past three decades. He is one of America's true musical treasures, yet he still doesn't get the respect he deserves. If you have enjoyed any of Steve Earle's music and somehow missed hearing this album, don't put it off any longer. You NEED to have this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Earle is God","review":"If Steve Earle isn't God, he's about as close as the musical world is going to get for a good long time. He is something almost unheard of in modern music--a rock-n-roll original. He blends rock, folk, country, bluegrass, and pretty much anything else he can get his hands on into a truly unique musical mix. I Feel Alright and El Corazon are two of the finest recordings I've ever run into; Transcendental Blues is probably going to be on that list after a few more listens. \\"The Galway Girl\\", \\"All My Life\\", and \\"Steve's Last Ramble\\" are absolute classics. Hopefully this disc will finally get Steve Earle recognized for the songwriting genius he clearly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"time to refill the tank","review":"I'm a huge Steve Earle fan - of both his CDs and his concerts. But being a fan doesn't automatically make every song/CD a good one. TB has little to hold my interest. Occasional cliches are OK, but they're spread across the lyric sheet like wild fire (pun intended). And the music just lies there - bits and pieces of earlier songs pop up all over, but never establish a singular identity. \\"Until the Day I Die\\" shows he can still approach the good stuff. Maybe true art really does come from pain, and now that Steve's \\"feeling alright\\" perhaps he's lost the edge. But I doubt it. I've been with him since \\"Guitar Town\\" first made me an Earle addict. I prefer to think TB is just a lull. Afterall, I've got years of great music listening to thank Steve for. For now, if you're a newcomer, buy \\"Essential SE,\\" listen for a week, and then buy his last four CDs - and wait for his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"STEVE'S BLUES DO NOT TRANSCEND ANYTHING","review":"I READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS HERE BEFORE BUYING THIS RECORDING; COULDN'T WAIT.

THERE IS NOTHING THAT STANDS OUT, NOTHING SPECIAL ON THIS RELEASE TO BRING ME BACK, AS THERE HAVE BEEN ON HIS LAST SEVERAL RELEASES. I LISTENED TO THIS CD MANY TIMES, HOPING THAT SOMETHING WOULD GRAB MY EAR. TO MANY RABID FANS, AN ARTIST CANNOT MAKE A BAD RECORDING, BUT IN MR. EARLE'S CASE, THIS IS ONE.

Is it a wonderful album, Yes. In my timeline of great artists it progresses as such: Dylan, Young, Springsteen, Earle (no disrespect to Petty, et al). I feel that there is nothing Earle could do in his career that would enhance his stature in my eyes. This CD, which has remained on my player for a month straight, is phenomenal. At this point (after five albums since his rebirth) there is nothing I can say that hasn't been said by others. The artist is unbelievable, the music intoxicating and the muscianship staunch. If you don't already follow Steve Earle you are missing out on an important piece of American music. If you are....I am preaching to the choir.

That said there are a number of incredible songs on this cd- Steve's Last ramble, Lonelier Than this, until the day I die, another Town.

The one down-side is that the CD doesn't really do the songs justice because they sound so much better live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"This is Steve Earle's most experimental album. It is a mixture of country, rock, blues, folk, and even has a celtic moment on it. There is some beautiful music on this one. My favorite song is Over Yonder (Jonathan's Song) which is an ode to his cell mate when he was in jail. Also has really great songs like The Boy Who Never Cried and Steve's Last Ramble which IMO are personal songs about Earle himself. Favorites include Transcendental Blues, Everyone's In Love With You, Another Town, The Boy Who Never Cried, Steve's Last Ramble, The Galway Girl, Lonlier Than This, I Don't Want To Lose You Yet, Halo 'Round The Moon, and Over Yonder (Jonathan's Song).

Each problem has six different clues. Students usually work in groups of four. Each student reads his/her clue(s), and the group tries to find the answer together. There are problems for different grade levels and for different math strands. There is an index that helps you find a concept quickly, such as geometry or number sense. Each of the six clues are coded so that you can easily tell if groups have accidentally mixed them. The only thing that might make you uneasy is that there is no answer key. The point is for the group to agree on an answer, and this ensures that the teacher doesn't \\"spill the beans\\" too soon. It encourages the kids to justify and explain their reasoning to the teacher before they move on to the next problem, which is a good thing.

This is the second worst game I've ever played (the worst being Superman 64). If you are considering buying this game, press the back button on your browser IMMEDIATELY to save yourself [money] and a LOT of grief. It is impossible to hit your enemies because you can't even face them. The graphics are choppy and looked like somebody cranked this thing out in their basement in the space of a week. On top of that, there are probably 4 or 5 sound effects in the whole game, and all of the characters sound pretty much identical. Do you like elevator music? I hope so, because this sorry excuse for a video game is LOADED with it! All in all, this distressing title is downright awful. Avoid it at all costs. So start punching that back button!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The force is strong with this one...","review":"Jpb is THE BEST! The controls can be a pain in the butt, but it's easy to master.

This is a really bad game, I mean really. It has average psx graphics but that's besides the point. The point is that this game isn't even worth renting. All you do is go around and kill some stupid droids. Everything looks the same and you soon realize that this game is going nowhere fast (remember The Tick for SNES?) It seems that since this game had the words \\"Star Wars\\" in it, that everyone thought it would be great and went out and bought it. Well at least that's what it seems like.......it's the second best selling psx game on Amazon! Just save yourself the money and go out and buy something at least decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply awesome","review":"The graphics are top-notch, the fighting is incredible, and this is one of the best games I have ever played, on any system.

If you like Star Wars, this will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the best LucasArts game of all time","review":"On the back of the case the games motto says: deflect. defeat. destroy. Well...uh...you kinda get that \\"destroy\\" feeling when you fire a laser back to who shot it. This game is incredibly fast paced- a definite rent more than once or buy for fans who enjoy fighting games. The controls aren't the greatest, like jumping on really thin hunks of land, but it only takes 10 minutes to master the controls of your character's inner Jedi lightsabering skills. A couple great additions to this game is deflecting lasers or bullets, and the 2 player mode. Teach you're friends how to play and use the Obi-Won Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn duo. You can also do pretty cool combos to chop you're enemies into bite-size pieces. Overall this game is a must, and I reccommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Phantom Menace","review":"You would think that a game based on jedi light saber fighting would be a guaranteed hit, but Lucas Arts missed their mark again. The fighting is similar to the first Phantom Menace game, but enough already with the jumps. Hello video game developers- you do not need jumping in a 3D game, this isn't Mario Bros. It's disappointing when you work your way through a level only to be stopped at the end trying to jump from one ledge to the next. Also the game play is lacking. I've only had the game a short time and I've had screen freezes a few times. I encountered the same problem in Phantom Menace. If you're a Star Wars fan, I guess you have to get it, but if you're choosing between the 2 titles, I would recommend Phantom Menace over Power Battles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Had read some decent previews about this game, comparing it to Gauntlet and the likes. Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. It was great to be back in the world of Star Wars, but the graphics are quite inferior to what you would expect from Lucas and even sub-par for any game with the Playstation technology. The characters abilities are very limited at best. The concept of using a light saber is very intriguing, but when it gets down to it, shooting would be a lot more fun and the light saber is very limited in what it can do. Slash, Slash, Slash. In addition, movement in general is stilted. I played this game on \\"easy\\" mode for about ten minutes and decided to play one of my old sword-weilding games, MediEval and had a lot more fun and enjoyed the graphics ten fold. The only reason I give this game two stars is because it carries the Star Wars name.

But watch his films and you will see stilted performances, bad composition, bad lighting, and just generally bad choices. Read this book, and you will understand why...he may be a great writer, but he has an appalling lack of understanding for the medium of film. He may understand stage acting, but he has no clue when it comes to film performance. Seriously, bad acting cannot be excused in film, because hundreds of takes could be done for any scene. Yet somehow Mamet can take a great actor together with great writing and turn out the weakest performances imaginable...watch his films if you have any doubts. He has no place directing film...he only got to do so because of his genius reputation in the theater...and he has even less justification to write a book telling others how to do so.

David Mamet has a forty-year career in the theater and in film because he KNOWS THINGS. In his books, like this one, he shares THOSE THINGS.Any intelligent reader picks the grain and leaves the chaff behind. You don't have to direct your actors to be \\"wooden\\" or \\"stilted.\\" In fact, he never asks you to, not even in his equally excellent book on acting (/True and False/). If you are wise, however, you do consider what the shot means, how it is a unit of the scene, how to tell the story efficiently with action - in short, you master the vital parts of filmmaking FIRST.This isn't a technical manual - lots of good ones already exist - but a provocative, and therefore challenging, attempt to address the underlying principles behind making a film. If more film schools insisted their students master these concepts (yes, I have a friend who went through the directing program at AFI), we'd have less dreck at the cineplex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows how montage is used to get the maximum effect.","review":"A summary of the russian filmakers beutiful theory of montage.

I began CEREUS with high hopes. But something began scratching me at the back of the neck about halfway through. And then I had it! Sisters, each protective of the other. One bolder and less inclined to just accept her lot in life. Abusive, rapist father. Hmmmm... Gay and lesbian themes. Runaway sister, lost to the other. Missing, then recovered letters. !Alice Walker's THE COLOR PURPLE, anyone?CEREUS was a decent story; its descriptions were lush and lovely; and it was worth reading, but come on. Give me a break.

I don't know about other people who've read this book, but I thought the Nurse was a great narrator. I haven't come across such a sensitive and observant character in a long time. Also, the issue of incest and sisterhood is so universal that if it does merge with other stories, I don't think that it automatically scuffs off of the Color Purple.

If you enjoy role-playing games with a lot of complicated puzzles you should buy this.

The graphics are just about the same as the origional, and the spell system is the same too.

There were no mini-games to distract you from the boring story line, and there just wasn't much to do other than go straight through. I need a little diversity in the RPGS that I play, and this one just didn't have it. I am also not a fan of games where you have to angle the screen just right to be able to trigger events or to get items. Some of the features were interesting, such as the different tools each character used, but I just couldn't stay interested in this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"wild arms","review":"game is action paced.great story line.lots of great side quest.the playable characters,with they tools and theyabilities gave you lots of fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Give up -stay with it!!!","review":"The game is extremely complex at first, but after pplaying for a while I found it really intruiquing.

I just wish it did a little better job protecting the headrests of the back seats as well (though it has to go around them to stay in place so I assumed this was going to be the case upon purchase). I find that I still have to cover those up in order for no dog hair mess on them. My favorite part of the cover is if you have a large dog like I do, then there are slits to get a harness buckled into the seat belts or to seat a passenger in the back with the dog and still let them wear their seat belt. I have used it to take my dog to the beach and it protected my seats from my wet dog and the sand no problem. Just pulled it out, shook it out and washed it, and didn't have to vacuum any sand out of the car! That was nice. Seems sturdy and like it's going to last, so well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous to pets","review":"The underside of this product is very slippery.Because it is slippery it shifts in the front and along the sides. It doesnt protect when it shifts. If it were not such slippery material it would be a good product. The danger occurs when your pet exits the car. When exiting the car our dog used his back legs to shove off as usual, the cover slipped and he landed straight on the asphault on his face. I am amazed this product is getting good reviews. Beware, your pet is in danger if you have leather seats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits nicely, but HOLDS ODORS, it STINKS","review":"This thing works good except that it holds odors and stinks all the time. You wash it and it smells OK. Your dog gets on it once or twice after a walk or a run in the park, and it will hold every odor forever. After a few days, it smells like your dog X10. So if you REALLY like the way your dog smells, you might be in heaven, but most folks will probably hate the odors that come from having this in your car on a hot summer day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"I have an airedale terrier that is really anxious/excited during car rides, so I needed something to protect my leather seats for a long car trip. I drive a Toyota Land Cruiser and it fits well (isn't too short). I was hesitant to purchase this, but have been really pleased with it! I was afraid the cover would slide around, as my dog moves A LOT, but I haven't had a problem with the seats being exposed! This has been perfect for protecting the leather from nails/dirt, but he also had an abcess that opened on the way to the vet and nothing leaked through the cover. The cover is really easy to put in/take out and really stays in place. I would recommend this to any pet owner with cloth or leather seats. Also, it's really easy to wash.

The only real problem I have with it is that the attachment system expects your car to have standard headrests on the back seat (the kind that are supported on sliding metal posts) so the strap to hold the cover up can go around the posts. Unfortunately, my Nissan Altima has short faux headrests that are part of the seat, so that doesn't work on my car. :( I was able to rig it up by running the strap through the plastic shoulder seatbelt guides--it's not perfect, and it sags in the middle, but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"No es para todos los carros o camionetas","review":"LOs agujeros de donde se sostiene el forro protector no aplican para todos las camionetas, no tiene buen acabado, se notan las costuras"},{"rating":"1","title":"PERFECT FOR THE MONEY!","review":"Item arrived as described and is well made.

There just isn't enough material to cover the front part of the seat bottom, and it also needs some sort of attachment strap at the center of that section. Every time my dog moves around in the back seat, that front lower portion pulls back, exposing the seat to his nails. Needs some further refinement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat Cover","review":"I have a 2011 Honda Accord with leather seats and this seat cover works beautifully. I have a border collie/pug mix that weights 45lbs and a boston terrier that weights 18lbs and they are both ALL over the place in the back seat. I've had other seat covers that slide all over the place and end up not really protecting the seat, but not this one. I put it on and haven't had to adjust it since.There are only a few things I would change if I could:1. The seat belt slots do not have velcro. At the end of the day, I'm not sure how much difference this would actually make, but I'd feel better if I could seal those openings closed.2. Color options. From what I saw the only option was brown/tan. Which looks great...especially since the seat cover stays where it is supposed to...but I can't think help but think how much nicer it would look if I could've gotten black to match the rest of my interior. Again, something that doesn't REALLY matter as long as the seat cover is doing it's job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cover","review":"This is very good quality cover for my cover-the only problem is that I have nothing to hook the front of the blanket so that the blanket does not ride up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you have an HHR","review":"I love that this cover is thick, it is a good quality material and holds up in the wash. I don't like the seat belt holes - dog hair gets right through them & all over my seats, defeating the purpose of this cover. Also, the only thing that keeps it in place in my car are the straps that go around the headrests. The plastic bars that supposedly hold it in place between the seat and seat back do not fit into the little crevice in my car. Maybe it was designed for those cars where the seat actually lifts when the seat back is folded down but in my car the seat back just folds right over the seat itself so there is not the same space in between to secure these bars. Also the elastic does not fit securely around the bottoms of the seats in my car. Possibly another flaw for using this seat cover for certain cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper Product Solvit?","review":"I already own this product number and bought it in 2010. It is a heavy twill and works well. I just bought another to replace it as some of the gromets are pulling out. I received this seat cover made of micro-suede with a satin backing. Really? My dogs will go through that in a few months not to mention the satin backing sliding around. Too bad they cheapened the product. I am returning it..didn't even bother to unfold it. I would have paid more for the same product I received in 2010."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit","review":"Does not stay on the seat at all.

I didn't experience the smell issues discussed by other customers. The problem was that at least 3 hooks, and plastic clips broke within the first 30 days, even though my dog doesn't move around much, and is very small. Now this thing is basically just a blanket... which I could have purchased for a lot less money.Pros: Material is thick enough that your dog's paws wont damage your leather seats.Cons: All the material that holds the product up on your headrests is very weak. Even a slight pull will ruin this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well thought out!!!!","review":"I purchased this seat cover for my Audi a4. I figured this is a lot easier than taking a blanket in and out every time I want to bring my dog somewhere. Boy, was I wrong. This cover is extremely slippery on the underside, my dog slides all over the place and struggles to stay sitting up. Luckily my grandmother is a seamstress, So I've modified the cover so that it actually locks into my seat belt buckles. Now all I have to do is find a way to keep the bottom half secured. Overall the product gets a 3. I couldve designed a better cover in my sleep. Obviously the person who designed this cover did not have pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Intended to protect leather seats, but cover does not stay in place.

Very easy to install and is quality made. The only drawback for me (which may not be for some) are the slits for the seatbelts.

I just put a towel over the slits and all is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hair of the dog...","review":"goes on the cover, not on the seat. Just as advertised.

They have also started to take on an incredible color since putting them under a new T5 high output fluorescent light.I want to stress that this is NOT an instant gratification thing.

You can telnet to the switch and breakout of the console into the lcli.

It is in fact highly perfumed (read the ingredients list!) I got burned by the deceptive labeling on this one... now I have to throw out a 6-pack of this soap. I got home with this and thought it smelled perfume-y before I opened the cellophane packaging but I thought maybe it was just residual from the shelf at the store. When I did open it I was sorry! My eyes began to sting and my sinuses swell, before I had even opened the individual boxes. Then I looked at the ingredients list and Fragrance is listed. Dumb me... I was taken in my the lies on the main label and hadn't bothered to read the ingredients. Who would think that something clearly labeled Unscented is actually Very Scented... you can smell this stuff from across the room.

I don't see \\"Monster\\" up here at Amazon though it's available from Tim Kerr records.Newcomers to the Pere Ubu thing may not find this collection as accessible as some of the band's later albums but either way, Pere Ubu is an education as much as it is a musical experience and I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend that you give this band at least a few chances to catch you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Band Needs to be Signed","review":"This CD is very good hard rock, and this band needs to be signed to a major label.

Redd Foxx had to be one of the funniest people on TV; his portrayal of Fred Sanford was impeccable. Demond Wilson as Lamont Sanford was an excellent foil to Fred.There are several classic episodes in this set that I'm sure many people will recall. There are some episodes from the original British version (Steptoe & Son) that have been rewritten for the American version. There are a couple of episodes written by the great writer team from The Andy Griffith Show, Everett Greenbaum & Jim Fritzell. There's also an episode that Richard Pryor co-wrote. Probably, the biggest improvement in the second season was the slight shift in attitude of the character Lamont. It's a subtle difference but the character is not quite as caustic.Buy this & enjoy one of the greatest comedy series that's ever been produced for American television."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest!","review":"Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson are one of the greatest TV comedy teams of all time...right up there with Kramden & Norton, Andy & Barney and Lucy & Desi. These two guys had such a great rapport with love and respect for each other that shone throughout each episode. SANFORD AND SON had a lot of things going for it that superceded anything against it. The show also had consistently terrific studio audiences that helped the viewers laff factor; (ie.) Foxx could deliver a lame line and still get guffaws from the audience which made me laugh even harder! In this collection, Aunt Esther finally makes her first appearance (replacing the so-so Aunt Ethel) and begins her reign with a boom and a swing from her purse. Julio (Gregory Sierra) moves in next door which brings some of my favorite all-time episodes. Nathaniel Taylor's character Rollo gets more defined and the comedy gets even greater. DO NOT PASS THIS COLLECTION BY.....THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST TELEVISION COMEDIES OF ALL TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"Five stars for the show...but one star DVD release, February 20, 2009Like I said this is a five star show. The DVD package is poor and the show IS NOT IN BROADCAST ORDER. I am only on the third season and so far every episode is there, but like I said it is NOT in broadcast order. If you love Sanford and Son like I do you have no choice but to buy this, but be educated about your purchase. DVD's were bought new and skip and FREEZE up due to duel layering. This is our only choice to own...so I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I bought the book not really knowing that it was about racing.

I was surprised by how much I liked the characters. McCrumb is a fine storyteller and even makes NASCAR interesting. Don't let the racing element of this book put you off. Sharyn once again delivers a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"some good parts - many bad","review":"This book has been out awhile but in July 2010 it was briefly offered for free for the Kindle and that's when I got it. A NASCAR fan for most of my life, I thought it would be a good read. To me, this book appears to be a collection of short stories tied together with chapters surrounding a Dale Earnhart memorial tour theme. That's not so bad except the connecting chapters are, for the most part, poorly written trivia conversations. It's as if the author was forced to do this against her will because it's obvious not much effort went into them. parts of the book, however, are good. If you are a critical reader (I'm not) you might give this a one star rating - if you finished it. Those connecting chapters I mentioned will make you grit your teeth. If you are one of those readers that love to read and can read anything, it's maybe a three or four. No way this is a five star book. That said, the author is a talented writer and I would read other books she's writtened."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BIG STAR SHINING","review":"here again, a great driver who worked hard to overcome any obstacles in his way. could have been more careful with the gift GOD gave him,,,his life. but, i like this writer and it was worth reading. dh"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight to Victory Lane!","review":"I have read all of Sharyn McCrumb's novels, and I usually love each one more than the last! Her latest, \\"St. Dale,\\" is no exception! I was a McCrumb fan long before I became a NASCAR fan, but I did have the privilege of seeing Dale Sr. race at Bristol in the spring of 2000--right after I became engaged to a true NASCAR fan who set out to immediately convert me to the world of fast cars and \\"rubbin' is racin'\\"! As a result of his efforts, I was watching the race in February 2001, and felt the shock of Dale's death along with the millions of other racing fans. Sharyn McCrumb's novel captures the essence of the complex world of NASCAR and its fans. This is one of her best, and I can't wait for my husband to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching book for all Earnhardt fans","review":"St. Dale was a great book.

I have very long combination wavy/wooly hair, which I usually wear in its natural state. When I want to straighten my hair for a more conventional look, it's quite a project. However, this comb works. It heats relatively quickly and smoothly glides through my hair without pulling or tangling. It has a nice weight, wide teeth, and easy-to-use controls. I especially appreciate the plastic bumpers at each end of the comb to help prevent burning the skin. My only complaint is that it's bulky, and this makes handling a bit awkward. Still, for the price, it's an efficient, well-made tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Tools Professional Pressing Comb w/multi heat control","review":"This product, in my opinion, is the best on the market.

Her words are more than words, they are everybody's thoughts. While reading the book you'll feel a deep connection to the writer and share her emotions. Her ability to express her thoughts & feelings through poetry is very intellectual and provoking. This book has poems for every occasion, reading a poem or two in the morning is the perfect way to star your day and a great way to end it as well.My favorite poems are Wake Up, Cover 2 Cover & Troubled.I give this book 5 stars because it provokes people think, you feel a real connection to the writer BUT it's not too heavy to read.. the book contains a lot of poems which are funny and not so serious. I would recommend this book for everybody, not only people who like poems because this book actually welcomed me (along with some others) to the beautiful world of poetry.

Vol 1 is great, and I would recommend that.However, after vol 2. they americanized the names, which I think was stupid. Also, some of their technical terms for driving (understeer, oversteer, etc) in their glossary are lame. Maybe they need to find somebody who actual understands road racing to help explain some of it.Last of all, the scale for the map of Gunma prefecture is off by a large margin. It looks like they gave it a 200km (124miles) scale. This is absurd, since it makes Gunma approx maybe 1000+ km (600+ miles) tall and wide. Impossible since Japan isn't even that wide/tall there. I know.. I lived near that area.

Even though its a low budget feature, this film is filled with adventure and wonder, true to its genre. The model effects still hold up fairly well, even if the dinosaurs don't.

Both quartets on these dates in 1962, the first Wynton Kelly, Vernon Martin and Roy Haynes, the second Andrew Hill, Martin and Henry Duncan more than ably keep the pace with the man - an absolute giant of the jazz idiom."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUGS BUGS BUGS!!!","review":"STAY AWAY - WILL CRASH YOUR SYSTEM CONSTANTLY - EA HAS LIED BY SUGGESTING THIS IS NOT A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM.

That's right, in its haste to get the game out as quickly as possible, there's no way that EA could have tested this game. If they had, they would have experienced the shut down that everyone else has. It is incredibly frustrating when you finish a great game only to have the PSP shut down before you can get it saved. The first time this happened to me I had to start from the beginning and redo training camp. Totally unacceptable. If EA had competition, they would be crushed. But they don't and they know it. They know that they can put any junk out on the market and people will buy it because they have no other alternative if they want to play football. The sad thing is that if it weren't for this major and a few other minor glitches, this could have been a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA Sports - It ISN'T in the Game","review":"This is a disasterous game. You can not make it through Franchise mode without playing the same game 4 times because of the software conflicts which turns off the system COMPLETELY! Along with it shutting off the PSP, the graphics are not that far from the playstation and there is NO Play REVIEWS!? no challenges? I thought this year there are challenges. Again, too bad Madden signed his life over to EA Sports. Do not buy this game, Seriously. EA Games on the other hand has BURNOUT LEGENDS. IT IS A WORTHY GAME, The Graphics are outstanding. I suppose each division of EA has it's own standards. Dont fault EA GAMES, FAULT EA SPORTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a great game","review":"I agree with what the others have said about this game. Very buggy. The worst of it is that the game freezes up and shuts down by itself, so if you don't save periodically in the middle of a game you can lose an entire game you've played. Also, online play is almost impossible. I have yet to connect to someone and get through even an entire quarter. And it shows i have a strong signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Online Users Don't Waste Your money On This Game!!!","review":"Ok I a bigtime online user for ea sports...I must admit this game is very bad for online play. It boots you out of almost every game you play. after every play you have to sit there and wait for the game to continue because it freezes. so one game may take you up to two hours to complete depending on the Lagging. It's messed up when you play a two hour game just to get disconnected at the end... even if you're winning 100 - 0, you still get a loss and a DNF %, this is the dumbest online game ever. Do Not waste your money on this dumb game, wait until ea get's off their behinds and make online gaming work."},{"rating":"1","title":"EA wanted to meet a time to market date, not quality","review":"This game contains MANY bugs. The game will crash while you are saving it, causing you to have to start over from the begining. The game will crash if you get a high score. The game will crash just about any time it feels like it. I have played this game for about 10 hours and have had 4 catastrophic failures.EA clearly wanted to get this game out before the NFL season was over, but unfortunately, that means that they skipped QA.I was planning on purchasing their NBA game, but now I definately will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"SERIOUS BUGS AND DEFECTS!","review":"To give EA Sports credit, the graphics are awesome, even on such a small screen as the PSP. For the first hour or so, I really enjoyed it despite the constant lag-time between plays and such--then I decided to start a season with my favorite team. That is when everyone seems to suffer from sudden crashes. A bug in the program causes your PSP to shut off. You lose any unsaved info and must completely restart. EA Sports/Tiburon has issued a \\"work around\\" that unfortunately DOES NOT WORK.I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME!!! ...at least until they come out with an actual patch or replacement. If you doubt what countless others are reporting, rent the game at Blockbuster. I guarantee you, you'll be glad you saved your $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Game Ever","review":"Lag Lag Lag and Loading Loading LoadingThe game suffers from Loading problems as well as lagging problems.Everytime you score a touchdown... the game pauses for 2 seconds and then resumes(did I score that touchdown or not!). Not to mention the time between plays is awful, play control is one of the weakest attempts to date in a Madden game and it is downright bad.The game has tons of bugs as well... the most recent was during draft mode... you can't even read the school names(it is black on black).Did EA test this... How do I get my 50 dollars back?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - Wait and/or Pray for A Bug-Free Re-Release -","review":"Look, despite the title of my review WHEN this game works - its fantastic. Granted the menu load times and frame rate absolutely exceed the basic hardware capabilities of the PSP - but WHEN it works it is classic EA quality of gameplay and realism.The problem is that it doesn't really work. If you choose to play in \\"Franchise\\" mode (the only way to simulate a season of play) this game will repetitively crash at the completion of each game forcing you to play and re-play the same game several times ( I played the Chiefs 5x this week) before you get lucky, the game works, and you can move on. Its horrible that EA released this game and I'm very sorry I rushed to buy the first version released.EA's Web site notes that the problem is not widespread, but the existence of a pre-fab response to this bug, and numerous complaints on user forums suggest otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"insane game","review":"madden 06 has great graphics and plays good to. you have to update your psp before you can play the game. overall the game is fun and is fast at loading.so i recomend this game to you if you are getting one."},{"rating":"1","title":"More bugs in a day than in all other games for a year","review":"Essentially, that's the review. I have eight other games and only one of them has ever crashed the system on me. Madden does it regularly. Now I can cope with the annoying bugs mentioned all over the place, and the slow load times, and frequent pauses, becasue when it works, it's great.But when OUT-OF-THE-BOX, it comes up with a \\"load failure\\" message and then proceeds to crash on the second franchise game of the season every time, killing the system, this game becomes my first ever 1-star rating.Well done, EA. This sets a new low for production quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor excuse for a Madden game","review":"I am a huge fan of both the PSP and Madden. The combination of Madden on the PSP was a matched made in heaven, until I played it.The game play is decent, it feels like Madden and is fun. Its fun until you run into all the bugs. Most I could live with, but it actually causes PSP to shut down. This is unacceptable, and as of today (9/29/05) Electronic Arts (the publisher of the game) has not offered any solution. I would stay far away from this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game, but you never know when it's going to crash.","review":"I enjoy playing this game and will continue to play it. As others have pointed out, it crashes in Franchise mode, and there is also a problem with \\"stuttering.\\" When it pauses in between interceptions, kickoffs, 4th downs and such, it makes you hold your breath for a second wondering if it's going to crash again.I save almost after every score I make so I don't have to play the whole game over again. This definitely gets annoying because the franchise file size is huge (it takes about 50 seconds to save to your memory card!). EA really messed up on this one. Is there anything we, as customers, can do about this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love untested software this is a great game for you!","review":"With EA's exclusive hold no the NFL license it was a shock that they released a Madden game on the PSP that underwent absolutely no QA testing. A shock in bizarro world anyway. EA did not let laggy play, long load times, sporadic crashing, flickering screens and non-existant online play stop them from releasing this craptacular excuse for a football game. If this game was a football team, then it would be a football team made up of 3rd grade girls.Franchise mode crashes sporadically after the game is over (no save for you!). According to EA support the online mode is really not ready yet, it's still in testing!And still they suxored me for $50US.I understand a patch will be out in September of 2006, but it will cost $50. </sarcasm>"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!! Worth 50cents, not 50 dollars!","review":"(Same complaint as everybody else on lag, shutoffs, etc). One thing no one has mentioned before: in franchise mode, when you train the players in the minigames, after you complete a minigame, there is a small clip of the player walking off the field, you'll notice that the legs of the player looks very gross and disgusting (like the flesh had been dipped in acid!). Apparently, the pixels for the legs were NOT completed yet by EA (gamemaker). Very disgusting to see (almost like each player had a million sores on their legs)!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"madden 2006 for psp","review":"I am VERY disappointed!!!!!!!!!I had much higher expectations of this game. EA Sports did not deliver as advertised. Don't get me wrong, I love my psp, BUT...if I'm paying the same price for what I paid for the PS2 version, I have the same expectations. The game has too many delays and pauses in the game play and it does not have the some of the key features I enjoy on the psp version. I am a ten (plus) year madden player and I've got to say, if sony expects to keep people interested and buying the psp line, they are going to have to do much better than this.

I am afraid to say that it has not lived up to my expectations. This text, for a technical exposition, is very poorly written, incorrect derivations and equations abound, incomplete or absent explanations for derivations seem to be the norm. The authour makes conclusions without justification and leaves it up to the reader to 'guess' for him or herself. Typographical errors are the bane of any technical book and make reading it difficult and frustrating at the best of times. This book has much potential and I sincerely hope that any subsequent editions will overcome its current shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating technical book.","review":"I visited this book with certain technical questions in mind. I was offered great hope by its Table of Contents: it certainly looked like a thorough coverage of the DSL technology. Maybe it really is. But the way the materials are written renders the book almost useless. There exist numerous erroneous equations as if the book was not proof-read at all. I was also disturbed by the fact that very few (almost no) explanations are offered after equations, tables and figures are presented or derived. Instead of being told, readers are expected to guess what the writer's intentions are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good topic, very badly written","review":"I bought this book with great expectations. It covered all relevant subjects related to DSL. Even the first chapter summarizing POTs cable plant was encouraging. But, the book is horrible. Things are just thrown together without explaining clearly any of the subjects. Despite all the bad reviews you might be tempted to buy this book because there is not another book that covers all the DSL related material included in this book. Don't!There are many good books on communication theory that cover equalization, echo cancellation, adaptive filtering, error correcting codes, noise, etc. It might be necessary to read some of these general books + a simple book on DSL to cover the same material as this book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably good, but putrid writing style","review":"There seems to be a lot of useful information in this text, but to get to it you must wade through a small mountain of transposed dependent clauses, misuse of plural case, typographical error, and generally putrid writing style.

The late Esther Rolle as Florida Evans was first seen on MAUDE. As Florida's husband James Evans Sr.,is John Amos. The most popular character is their son James Jr. or J.J.,played by Jimmie Walker. His trademark catchphrase is \\"Dynomite!!\\" Janet DuBois is J.J. sister. DuBois's vocal is heard in the Jeffersons' theme song.

With most of the laughs provided (in my view) by the head man of the Evans' household, James (John Amos). Mr. Amos can be very, very funny (doing a lot with just a stare from those big eyes of his). The frequent family altercations between James Sr. and James Jr. (Jimmie Walker) make for some delightful comic moments.So, if you want to dive back into some classic 1970s television, grab this \\"Good Times Season One\\" boxed set on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"$41 for a tiny 130 page $1.95 paperback!","review":"This is a very interesting read, but no amount of brilliance can excuse the moral cruelty of charging $41 for a pocket size paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brown Sugar 3: When....","review":"The title should be Brown Sugar 3: When Depressed/Drunk Writers Work...this book sucked royally.

Too bad lyrics weren't included in the booklet! If I may be picky, I would have also liked it more were the photos in color.

Nearly every angle of SDS, from its original split from its parent body, the League for Industrial Democracy to the 68 showdown is covered. Also this is a very fresh history, written soon after SDS died. Little analysis here, and Sale avoids making judgement on the merits of early SDS vs. late SDS. He isn't trying to score political points or make political justifications as many 60's histories do. For that, you should read Todd Gitlin. But for straight up intensely researched and documented history this is only real source. Someone needs to reprint this soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN!","review":"I am usually skeptical of bands doing cover songs and there are a lot of bands out there who feel they have been influenced by DEVO - so I was a little worried that it would end up sounding too much like DEVO!

It doesn't stink, but doesn't provoke any intelligent thoughts, either. The pre-occupation with sex would definitely not be suitable for kids (though little kids know everything, anyway...) If kids need to see a pre-occupation with sex, let them see \\"Tom Jones\\". At least it's an excellent adaptation of a classic, and has no crude nudity.

The second half of the book is cobbled together from three interviews done over a number of years. There are no real new insights into the man behind the all the bravado and rhetoric.The translation into English from the original French was not very well done. There are numerous spelling mistakes and errors. There are black and white photographs in the main text, but many of these are poorly reproduced.

His sentences sometimes go on for five lines or more. Some of these sentences contain ten or more different ideas and address many different subjects. Although the plot was interesting the style ruined the book for me. The other annoying trait has to do with the clothing worn by the wife of the main character.

However it is that same said familiarity which l'm sure will endear this recording to fans of Schmoelling and T.D. alike. Johannes has not redefined his sound, but compounded it to great effect and l myself would not be without this album for one second as repeated listens prove that the 74min playing time just sails by time and again!!!

The fact that you cannot move the location of the holes is a plus to us...it means fewer moving parts decreasing the chance that something will break and it ensures uniformity.

His spineless book Hip-Hop America is nothing but a bad imitation of authors like Ronin Ro. George's book is nothing but slapped-together articles that cheerfully say nothing but, \\"Gee, hip-hop is reaching middle America today!\\" This was said years ago by more talented younger writers. George is an old coot whose last two novels stank, a docile writer who ran back to the rap genre he abandoned-- only after it became obvious that his sappy romance novels wouldn't sell.

If you're some [like me] who has never taken rap music seriously before, Nelson will make you sit up and take notice. Like Bill Rhoden in the NY Times, Nelson George may not be someone you always agree with, but he is a writer who commands respect and attention.

Anyone looking for a deeper understanding of hip-hop (as a progressive artisan culture born from the capitalist wasteland) will be greatly disappointed. George tells of a bizarro world at the intersection of Wall Street and Madison Avenue. It is a pitiful tale of the appropriation of rap music (not to be confused with hip-hop culture) and George's own journalistic misfocus in a consumer society.

That aside, this book was an easy read about the studly NFL quarterback who falls in love with the \\"hidden\\" model. How many of us spent time in high school gazing at the dreamy quarterback across the room while wishing that he would start looking for more in a girl than just the hot looks? Sadly, I know I did. What happens when this quarterback finally finds out the truth about what is on the other side of the frumpy clothes will have to be discovered by reading the book. It's a fast read and one of Brown's books that I will probably visit again in the future. I do recommend that you read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sandra Brown","review":"\\"The Rana Look\\" by Sandra Brown is one of the author's earlier Loveswept works and one her best. In 211 pages, Ms. Brown gives the reader a story that beauty is not always everything.

Her eyesight failing, I went to the library to pick up some large print books for her, and this happened to be one I chose. She was still unable to read, so I offered to read to her. This stuff just can NOT be read aloud, and certainly not by a middle-aged man to his elderly mother. Whenever we got to one of the \\"steamy\\" parts, I'd get the giggles and be unable to continue. Mom had a pretty good chuckle herself. If this story (and its ilk) defines the sort of \\"romance\\" that women are looking for in their lives, well...I'm not sure what to say. I have to believe, though, that there must be better stuff available than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fugitive Shoes","review":"Once again, Erin has done it again!

The item arrived as expected. When I opened the box I noticed that the product was not the same. First thing is that I did not receive the explosion color, instead I received the two tone green color. I did not like it very much but it is not too bad.And second I did not receive the item as Amazon describes it. Amazon says that it has a pair of EMG 81/85 pickups, but the guitar came with differents pickups which are not even like the EMG. Very bad pickups. I guess I will have to buy EMG pickups separately.

AM or FM reception on this was mediocre at best, & forget any shortwave programming. I added a Terk powered antenna, which didn't help. I bought this radio used on Ebay for my Mom, and I just sold it back on Ebay for a $20.00 loss, but at least it won't be wasting space anymore! By the way, $180.00 list price for this POS??

Basically, you'll be acquiring some fake looking cabinet, a cheesy cloth grill, and a tuner whose quality is distinctly less than a $5.00 cheap-o from Dollar General. If you think you're going to enjoy shortwave broadcasts, think again. Both bands come up with barely audible static. Even the FM reception is tinny and static-ky, and drifts off station like the FM radios back in the 1960's.Apparently a lot of people are VERY UNHAPPY with this engineering mess because the company will come up with any excuse to keep from honoring their warranty.

However, if you want to add a cool retro touch to your home or office, and you also want a radio with modern electronics and decent sound, this could fill the bill. Although it is constructed from modern materials, it is well-made and doesn't look cheap, at least to me. I don't use it for shortwave, but it does a great job of pulling in AM and FM stations in my steel-frame office building. It's a great conversation piece that everyone notices. It met my expecations and I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This radio is not a replica of the 960. In fact nearly every claim made for it is false.

The only downside is that there isn't a flat bottom on it, so it's possible to push the disc blades out of place from the bottom when picking up the box.

Keeps the blades clean and sharp and safe from kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this recommended?","review":"It may be a fine product but it does NOT work with the 7 cup model.

I purchased them for a Xmas gift. Unfortunately when my mom and dad opened them Christmas morning all excited about the disc holder. They do not go together. This food processor had the discs attached to a plastic tube that hooks into the bottom of the processor, the disc holder has space for the discs that don't already come attached, that they would come apart and go into the disc holder box. I know this is hard to understand, but all I can say is make sure that if you purchase this disc holder that you get a Cuisinart food processor that has one tube and several discs and not several discs that each have there own tubes riveted and attached together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locked Itself- Permanently!","review":"A blade holder is a great idea.

I've actually had to take it apart from the bottom to get to my blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is a MUST HAVE","review":"If you bought the food processor which I am assuming you did since you are looking at this. Do yourself a favor and buy it. Unless you have some other way of properly and safely storing those extremely sharp blades this is the way to go. My only superficial gripe is that you cant buy this in a matching color to the food processor (unless of course you bought the white one). But it stores the blades just fine. its not oversized. Its completely functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I ordered this blade & disc holder to protect myself and my family from the sharp items.The discs & blades fit nicely into the container and then it locks with a plastic twist knob, which is quite small.The lock jammed, I couldn't get the blades out and when I looked underneath the spring had come off.

But it does deserve five stars because it does what it is supposed to. I have no problems with the latch it works as designedbut it is plastic, like all plastics you can't treat it rough or it will break. You have to handle it carefully and treat with reasonable care. mine already fell off the shelve and didn't break but it didn't fall far. I might need another one if we expand the set to include more disc and blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storage","review":"Great storage, keeps blades clean. If the lock was easier to turn with wet hands I'd give it 5 stars.Now if they would just make a covered disc blade holder to hold all the blades. Granted, that may be too big and heavy when loaded.
