More likely she was interviewed about everything she liked and some of her thoughts and some unknown writer did it. However, unlike most people, I don't hate her. I mean, what do you expect? She was born a rich heiress, had good looks, and that pretty much got her through in life. We are all what we are raised to be, and there is no telling what any of you people who criticize her would have become if you grew up like her. I do, however, think that she is the worst possible role model a girl could have. There is more to life than fashion and materials. I am a guy, but if honestly asked, I would love to live a life like hers, and anyone who says they wouldn't are lying. She probably won't end up being much of a contribution to the world, but ask yourself; is that her fault or the people who raised her?Anyways, the book is DEFINITELY not recommended 0/100"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parade of the freak","review":"Paris is such a filty street rat, she thinks that she is so cute saying things in a nasal annoying voice and being so arrogant, she is a sl*t, and its true, she is a freak, she actually has ADD, but thats no excuse for her extremely distasteful existence.

Considering she is a celebrity don't celebrity's usually have jobs? (And a job does not include a stupid reality show which was pretty much Paris doing what she normally does but they threw in some cows.)

We were using a walkie-talkie, but this is way more cool for her age.They are pretty cool and almost a year later we still use them alot. The pictures don't come out as nearly as what they show.

When she received it, she gave one of the phones to her 9 year old brother. They had fun with it for about 2 hours, then my son accidentally dropped the phone and now it doesn't work. He didn't even drop it far and it was on carpet. If this phone can't withstand being dropped onto a carpeted floor by a 9 year old, it's worthless. It's geared toward children. It should be more durable than it is. I feel bad that my daughter was so excited about this and now she's been let down because it's a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a cell phone","review":"I bought the Chatnow 2 pack for my two daughters (9 and 7 years old).

I have to wear support 24 hrs, due to the increased size & heaviness, and frequent leaking of my breasts. This bra is still comfy while sleeping.

Very Good."},{"rating":"2","title":"exhausting","review":"This is a tape that really makes you sweat! The instructor moves from exercise to exercise, and from muscle group to muscle group, at a rapid pace. The cuing is excellent, and the perkiness level kept to a minimum. What really got me to buy the tape in the first place, though, is the fact that aside from weights no special equipment is needed (you can safely use a chair instead of a tall box).The main reason that this tape does not get 5 stars from me is that it does not target a few of the muscles, most notably the abductors and adductors for the legs. Still, the Firm manages to crunch in a heck of a lot into this brief, all-around session. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners","review":"This tape says that it is for beginners through advanced. I'm young, not overweight, and used to walking a brisk mile daily. The first time that I did the tape I was terribly soar the next day. The following day was even worse, I missed a day from work.

Definitely not for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tape is The Tortoise, spliced and diced","review":"I bought this hoping to add another Firm tape to my collection, and it turned out to be \\"The Tortoise\\" tape, spliced and re-edited, with the warmup dance and abs sections removed.

Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"After reading all of the rave reviews of this tape, I just HAD to have a copy of my own, so I got 1. First of all, let me say that Tracie is THE BEST Firm instructor. Her cueing & pointers are top-notch. The workout is challanging & thorough. Like others have said, it's a mixture of Tortoise & Hare minus any cardio or ab work. After doing this workout 3x a week for 3 weeks, I'm seeing serious muscle in my upper body. I follow this workout with Sculpted Buns, Hips & Thighs for ab & floor work. If you're lucky enough to find a copy, GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not do this tape if you're a beginner! It's tough!","review":"When I first got this tape, I couldn't get through the whole thing. But after a couple of times, I was able to. It uses a barbell, which I don't own, so I use my own heavy dumbbells, but at the end, go to lower poundage because my legs wouldn't do anymore! If you want an excellent leg work, here it is! Since it uses a large step for exercises, it's a nice cardio workout. Tracie is one of the best instructors the Firm has! She makes it look like she's working hard right along with you which is a great motivator."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video is excellent,","review":"This video is fantastic, you get results in no time at all.

You gather at the funeral of the town's great lady and conspire. You watch as the family of the deceased wait to divide the spoils and you pray that Dr. Jim Jaspers doesn't open his mouth about you. This novella and collection of short stories center on a tight knit community that revolves around the local theatre and university. Almost all may have something to hide.

Great work and would highly recommend this book to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Rococo, not Gothic","review":"As one who has lived in the south for over 35 years, I found The Cabal to be very disappointing. The book promised to be about southern life. Instead I found a book that was full of spoiled, excluding people who I would avoid at all costs. In the title story, the self-absorption of the fully two-dimensional characters was really disappointing. They were only interested in reputation, sex, and money. There is so much more in life, and in my opinion it is a novelist's responsibilty to explore these other areas. The other stories, with the possible exception of The Big Cleanup, were no better. I was left feeling rather soiled by shallowness after reading this book. For a much more accurate and developed picture of southern life, I recommend Lee Smith. Leave this fluff behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a little \\"Feh\\"","review":"I liked this book (which I listened to on audiotape) a lot but agree with the reviewer who complained about the ending. Overall, the writing is wonderful, the characterizations sharp, the intermingling of many stories effective. BUT, at the end you are still left wondering about motivations, particularly of the central character. Though things were tied up neatly, I at least was left somewhat unsatisfied. It won't stop me from reading her other books though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard Caulk","review":"I recently purchased a tube of Loctite Polyseamseal Tub & Tile caulk to use in a bathroom that I was refurbishing.

The product surface dried very quickly and pull away when I removed masking tape that I had applied to the adjacent walls (less than a minute after finishing the caulking). I had to reapply! In addition, the dried product had a high degree of shrinkage and was full of air bubble holes. After all my work, this product only detracted from the result.

Also, it lacked much of the brilliance or sparkle that I saw in the other ring.

Sony also tells you to make sure you have the latest firmware update (the latest is v4.90), but they know that once you get the \\"NO DISC\\" error regardless of the type of disc, it's too late...the software won't read the update disc either.This is such a widespread problem, and Sony is well aware, but once your warranty expires, you're on your own.The BDP S300 is nothing more than an expensive doorstop. Better to research and buy another brand that is up to date and much more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never works","review":"This is the worse purchase I have made.

About a month ago, the unit displayed a \\"no disc\\" error message on the front whenever any disc was inserted. All the troubleshooting tricks (disc cleaning, rebooting, etc.) failed to help. I couldn't upgrade the firmware because the burned disc also would not be accepted. Since it was out of warranty, Sony would not exchange or repair unless I payed the $149 standard (for any problem)repair fee. I'm disappointed but not bitter.

Sometimes it will have an error where it justs loads forever (eventually you figure it out). I usually open it up and put a disk in, come back in 5 minutes when the menu is up, then hit play, then come back in another 5 to 10 minutes after the movie has actually loaded and just rewind a little.The fast forward settings are irritating. It just takes seconds for it to change speeds.It even takes 9 seconds for my LCD to disconnect from it.

Then the firmware updates Sony issues are windows only - they distribute .exe self extracting files which expand to provide a .iso - no idea why the geniuses there haven't worked out that they could just distribute the .iso and save Mac users like me the headache of having to use a windows machine somewhere to update the firmware.Basically, I regret this purchase and recommend that you pass on this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Slow","review":"I can't believe how incredibly slow this player is in loading disks, powering up and even ejecting disks.

We updated (my computer scientist son is a systems analyst) to FW 4.3, then FW 4.4, then FW 4.5. The first two firmware updates did nothing to fix the Blu-Ray-playback freeze-ups (regular DVDs still played fine). The most recent FW 4.5 caused the s300 to fail to load any types of disks. I suspect that something beyond simple software problems is affecting the S300. I am quite surprised because I have never had a problem with Sony (five receivers, four DVD players, two CD players, two tape decks in over 30 years).Based on my reading of Internet blogs at various sites, I suspect that the S300 has a part that fails within a too-short period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I ever bought this piece of garbage!","review":"I can't tell you how disappointed I am with Sony and this product.

I faithfully mailed in the coupon, original receipt and the UPC bar code cut from the side of the box. It's now been over four months and I have received nothing from either manufacturer.

The plot is about as novel and engaging as the average episode of any of the several mediocre cop shows that populate our major-network TV schedules -- the shows you might watch if nothing else is on.

However, as many Zappos reviews can attest, Clarks' sizing is often a half to a whole size off. But buying a half-size lower doesn't take care of the problem. The shoe will not flex at the proper place, and will lead to a lot of discomfort. I bought the size 8 and wore them on vacation, thinking they'd be a great walking shoe. They were comfortable for the first 1-2 hours, but for the next 2-4 hours, they caused intense pain because they didn't flex at the same place where my foot would flex.

If my camera is out of focus it's the optics. That's why glasses and contact lenses are used...to correct the optics. I'd be leery of anyone who rates this book at five stars. They probably have a vested interest or they are into mind games because the laws of light are not altered by muscles.Now, if a person who removes their correction (glasses/contacts) they may be able to squint and see better. That is done by limiting off axis rays and only allowing a narrow band of light to enter through the pupil. Again, muscles in the eye didn't affect the optics, only the beam of light was limited.

It has five light setting options (I have no use for the night vision option, but hey - it's there anyway), they all have different beam characteristic, pick the one that suits you.

I complained to my girlfriend and she said there's a circle of light on my face which includes my eyes. I put the light on her but the light shadow is lower, starting just below her eyes. Our heads must be shaped differently. So depending on your head shape, the light may or may not work for you.As others have noted, the switch is also kind of a pain, since it's recessed and requires it to be pressed just ever so, and you have to go through all the modes just to turn the darn thing off.On the bright side (pun intended), this thing is rated at 28 lumens but seems brighter than my Princeton Tec Remix rated at 100 lumens. However, I'm using the Princeton because it doesn't bleed the light into my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Bought two of these at a local home supply store but returned them after trying them out at home.

I do use them on a daily basis, but both broke repeatedly over just a few months of use. They simply (literally) fall apart. They can be repaired--for a while--but when you need a headlight in the wilderness, you need something reliable.

The protagonists in this novel are well-developed and come across as real and admirable people with real feelings and flaws.

I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is terrible. I am not a hair whiz, but this book should be called \\"Ponytails.\\" I am usually not this critical of things, but I am just so upset that I wasted my money on this. This book was just too basic.

If there were pictures of the kinds of braids it was covering or even a discription of what kind on braids are in here or even a back cover review of what is in this book. But sorrifully NO.

Otherwise I would recommend this product to anyone. In fact, my Mom is ordering one for herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and convenient","review":"This bag was so much easier than a box, and no tape needed, as in years past. You don't have to fold the limbs up as much. I didn't have to take apart the middle and top section of my tree. It fit my 7 1/2\\" tree very easily in two sections. It seems nice and tough, and no tears were created in transporting it to my garage. I wrapped a washcloth around the bottom of the tree, since my plugs are missing, and wrapped it with a rubber-band. I don't think it is at risk of poking through the tough bag, and it looks like it will hold up for years to come. The handles were touch enough for transporting.It set up against my wall the long way up and down quite nicely, with no problems. The zipper zips both ways which is a nice little feature for slipping things into the bag. I had no problem fitting the stand into the bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in product","review":"Not of the quality of a Rubbermaid product(so I thought).

Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handles tore off on first use","review":"This bag cannot handle the weight of 6 foot artificial Christmas tree. Sure, the tree fits into the bag perfectly. But after carrying the bag a short distance, the fabric handles tore away from the bag, leaving holes in the bag. Without handles, this bag is practically impossible to move.Rubbermaid could fix this problem by having the handle fabric wrap all the way under the bag.Don't buy this unless you're filling it with cotton balls, helium balloons, or packing peanuts. It cannot carry heavy items like a fake tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"The bag ripped at the zipper once the tree was nicely packed.

Also purchased a 7.5' tree (after christmas sale at sams club) and put it in the bag. Tree fit easily into the bag, bag zipped up easily. Bag appears to be about 60-70%% full with my tree. Picked the bag up with both handles, and one handle immediately ripped from the bag, even before I got the bag off of the ground. Surprisingly, other handle is intact, and is able to support weight of tree alone, but you can't carry the bag with one handle, too unwieldy, and I expect 2nd handle to tear from bag if I use it this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Room for my tree and more","review":"This bag was much larger than I thought. I had room for my tree and decorations. Yes, my tree is only 4 1/2 feet but I got over the big tree stuff long ago. Now all I have to do is get out this bag and a small plastic bin that has door decorations for outside and it is Christmas. No more arguments with the husband about how many more boxes do we need to get out of the shed. Time will tell on how long it will hold up. It seems pretty sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unhappy","review":"I ordered this bag and got the confirmation through email. 3 days later I was notified that the order was canceled - no reason.

Sure enough, it ripped right by the handles. It's not sturdy enough to hold a tree. Maybe if it was a lightweight tree, it would be OK, but alas, mine, not so much. The plus is that it keeps dust out (hence the 2 starts). The minus is that if you rip holes in it, dust get in anyway. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"After placing my tree in the bag, I grabbed the handles to move it and the straps ripped right off. My tree isn't that heavy and you can lift the tree by one hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Christmas Tree Bag","review":"This bag is not as substantial I thought it would be after reading the description. Before we even completed packing the tree, a tear occurred in a seam. The tree fit the bag, so the tear didn't result from forcing a too big tree into a too small bag, nor did we puncture the bag. Evidently, we received the bag with a weakened area in the seam near the tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea in theory.","review":"Tree bags sound great, but unlike the picture, the bag has no shape and is a bulky mess when filled with a Christmas tree. Storage is almost impossible because the bag lacks structure. Also, it's hard to shove a small tree in this bag (mine was just 6ft); I can't imagine people who purchased it for larger trees. Will find another option for my tree in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"This only lasted one storage time before it ended up trashed, unfortunately. It just wasn't very sturdy at all, and the handles didn't hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last 30 seconds","review":"As other reviews stated, this bag tears easily. I ignored the bad reviews because I really needed a bag to put my Christmas Tree away and I thought the others maybe got a lemon. As another person noted, the picture is misleading too, it is not rectangular but more like a big duffle bag. It did fit our 7.5 foot tree without a problem but ripped right at the zipper seam when my husband attempted to zip it up. Luckily, Amazon CS is great and is accepting the return. I got a replacement bag at wal mart for the same price that has wheels and seems to handle the weight better. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WATER RESISTANT","review":"Bought these after last Christmas...I purchased 6 & stored in our basement.

Now Frank Hopkins led people to believe that his exploits were fact so I have no problem with anyone setting the record straight. However the manner in which this was done in this book was mean spirited, tasteless, rude, insensitive and showed a definite lack of character on the part of the authors. Both Frank Hopkins & his wife are dead and can't respond. So if you want a book about Hidalgo DON\\"T buy this one.

Hopkins may have been charlatan, like so many others of his time and ours, who attempts to mold their personal history to their own advantage. However the question arises who are the debunkers? Why do they care? The legend of Hidalgo is inspirational. Hopkins' thoughts on conservation and horse care and training were ahead of their time. So what if he repeated what he heard. It's what he chose to repeat that is worth noting. It's the thought that an old man could create a false biography that still endures fifty years after his death that makes it great. Was he real man or legend? In another fifty years will it matter? I much prefer the west of legend over the west of fact. Enjoy the legend, savor it, don't fall prey, to whiny self styled western historians who obviously have a bone to pick. Enjoy Hopkins writings and skip the rest.

HOWEVER, if you are looking for a book that covers the Have Gun, Will Travel TV show, this is NOT the book. Amazon offers The Have Gun Will Travel Companion by Rayburn and Grams and it's far more retailed. Heck, the first season's episodes list the dates the episodes were filmed. Rothel's doesn't. The Rayburn book is 500 pages thick and covers nothing but the Have Gun program, Rothels is half the number of pages and only spends a part of this book covering the Have Gun program.

When Oddjob throws his hat and cuts off the head of the statue, it freezes. I though I had a defective disc but it seems all discs had this problem. It is very noticable.

The video quality and audio is amazing. I do not care about the order of the films in the box sets. With this kind of quality I think need to repurchase all the films again. My only complaint with this set is that I got a bad disc 1 of The Living Daylights. It is virtually unreadable after the amusement park section. I wonder if this is just me or if it is a glitch for everyone else. Check it out right after the Vienna man is killed by the sliding doors, my disc basically dies at that point.

What is not is extraordinary is the packaging of the movies. Why are all the movie randomly put together?These DVD come in a wafer thin cases popular now, the individual dvd booklets do not fit in the DVD case. Instead they fit loosely in the collection's box.On the whole the collection feels cheap, its not but it feels that way. The DVDs are a great improvement over the last release, but the Bond bootleg DVDs that flooded the marked last year had better overall quality and packaging. Even the art work on these DVDs appear amateurish.What is most disappointing is there is no way to display the collection. After seeing the UK release of the collection the American DVD collection is major let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single titles - like in England","review":"I've had the opportunity to see the remastered Goldfinger and it looks brilliant.What is not brilliant is the decision to bundle these movies together in sets of 10 in North America, while Amazon UK allows you to buy individual movies.This kind of double-standard is wrong, particularly as many consumers have already paid for the first-generation dvd. It's time the money men making these decisions knew they'd probably have higher sales if we could actually buy only the films we wanted.I trust single titles will be coming out soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be taken advantage of","review":"The best thing consumers could do is to not buy these boxed sets. There is no reason why these videos could not be sold individually, in chronological sets, or by actor. It reflects a contempt for the consumer to think we would all be gulable enough to buy certain movies of this franchise that we really don't want, but must buy in order to get the movies we do want.As for me, I'm going to wait until I am able to buy the movies I want, not what the manufacturer wants me to buy. If they don't change their packaging, I guess I can live without these videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Very disapointed to see how they group these films.

The special features are great and the quality of the picture is unbeatable.

No Roger Moore for me.","review":"I will not EVER buy a James Bond compilation with Roger Moore. The only reason they continue to package James Bond movies this way is because they know that very few would spend good money on any Bond film from between Connery and Dalton. Except for Moore, I LOVE JAMES BOND, but I will do without because of this kind of sleazy packaging. And there are hordes of fans like me. MGM could have made tons more money if they had released these singly. Greed has cost the movie studios yet again. Stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No choice? No Thanks!","review":"I'm glad to see these remastered especially w/ the addition of the DTS soundtrack. In my opinion, the only good Bond's were Moore, Bronsan, and the best was Mr.Connery.

Otherwise I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"***JUST SICK OF THE SAME RELEASES OVER & OVER","review":"How many ultimate collections could there possible be?

The sound quality is very good, and it is one of the few chances to hear the band with a symphony as backup.

It also includes a 2nd disc of unreleased material from the tour that was not included on the vinyl version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Live","review":"If you like music by rock stars that is accompanied by orchestral music to enhance the sound, you should give this album a listen. I loved this album as a download, and decided to purchase. I do not regret getting the album. Very good music ensemble, with ELP and accompanists. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Dead","review":"The 2 \\"Works\\" studio albums are not ELP at their best, although \\"Works 1\\" includes few of ELP classics (like Pirates and Concerto and Fanfare, that personaly i think has too many live versions). \\"Works live\\" sounds tired and heavy as the 2 studio albums, plus a \\"bonus\\" of a \\"flat\\" sound. The earlier \\"Welcome back my friends...\\" from 1974 is much better and \\"happier\\" album, that represents the good old ELP. 25 years after the recording, \\"Works live\\" sounds boring, tired, fat and unimportant album. No wonder, that it took them one more album to end the band for the first time - they locked their musical direction in a dead end street as a band, (and if i understand right, their relations were as bad at this time). Lucky us - 15 years later, during their comeback, they recorded a great live album (Royal Albert Hall, 1992) that brought us back the good old spirit, and also sounds much better. The rest, including Greg Lake's voice - is history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound is terrible","review":"This CD contains the most classically oriented music of ELP. This was live recording with an orchestra at a large stadium in Canada. The pieces are great but the sound mix is terrible. The bass is very tiny and very un-bassa like. Overall I would say this CD is a Big goose egg. I am suprised that the record company even released this one because of the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up and read the book!","review":"Garrett has authored a novel that literally wakes the reader up! \\"The Awakening\\" has action, visuals like none other, and non-stop movement in this amazing novel. Garrett's command of the language is impressive and the creativity blows the reader away. I recommend this book to all who love fantasy that is \\"real\\" which makes little sense, but is the best way I can describe the author's refreshingly unique style.

An ancient stone sculpted shaped in the form of a woman overlooks the palace where generations of Pasha family members and servants have abided for generations. The Stone Woman is an engaging, literate, accurately detailed, highly recommended novel of personalities and events as the family becomes scattered across Europe, in a time of political unrest and the clash of major power politics under the likes of Bismarck, Disraeli, and the Russian Tsar. Also highly recommended reading are the Tariq Ali's first two novels in his planned \\"Islamic Quartet\\", Shadows Of The Pomegranate and The Book Of Saladin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, keeps you thinking.....","review":"At first when I found this movie on HBO, I only continued to watch it because it had one of my favorite actors in it, Sam Neill. But, I soon found myself unable to turn it off. It had everything a great movie should have, a wonderful plot, believable actors and a great ending. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. It also had some very interesting theological views which were discussed by Neill, that really had you thinking for days after the movie was viewed......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical movie","review":"This is a beautifully done, magical movie. The video quality of the DVD is fairly good but not great. There are many times when non-moving images (background walls, etc.) become static and \\"refresh\\" only twice a second: very distracting when you watch for it. It is also in the less desirable non-anamorphic widescreen, with two-channel stereo. Rachel Portman's score is gorgeous, and at times sounds more like Ralph Vaughan Williams than RVW does himself (aside from the actual RVW piece used in the film). The picture transfer is clean. It deserves a better digital transfer, however. Still, better than VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great scenery, but otherwise dull","review":"Even Elle Macpherson's estimable talents are not enough to make up for this film's dull, predictable plot and heavy handed attempts at symbolism. The acting and production are competent if uninspired. Also the DVD is letterboxed 4:3 ratio rather than true 16:9. This is not a terrible movie, but ultimately there's only one, well two, good reasons to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased Customer","review":"Received this DVD in excellent condition and in a very timely manner.

Why is my beef that she's skinny? Norman Lindsay painted lovely big Rubenesque women. The dimensions of queen Latifah might not have been as, er, crowd-pleasing but would at least have been real. If people want to look at Elle, there are a million websites. Some of us prefer real actors, real women, and accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Correctness 101","review":"Sirens is an excellent PC movie (this is scorn, incidentally). The up-front story concerns sexual repression, but consider how the repression is escaped from: The wife cheats on her clergyman husband (ironically played by the unfaithful Grant) and it is made clear that not only is this not wrong, but that she is also a better person for having put a knife in her husband's back.It should be popular with American women...."},{"rating":"2","title":"So I'm an Elle fan... Hugh Grant was great, too.","review":"This is definitely one of those \\"don't watch it with your kids\\" movies. There are quite a few scenes with nudity and no real overt sex, but enough implied sex that aren't just for anybody.I'm a fan of Elle and although this movie went a little slow here and there, it was a very good buy. I bought this one after seeing it on cable and decided it was worthy to be in the collection.Australia is beautiful. The women are beautiful. The subject matter is at times abstract, and at times, intense beyond belief.The church telling an artist to no longer paint the overt sexuality of his times, his life... well, it does certainly make for good subject exploration. The minister (Hugh) sent to give the message to the artist and his lovely wife are drawn by these luscious frolicing sirens into that sexuality. They are changed forever.Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free your inner goddess","review":"Hugh Grant stars in this movie about a young reverend and his wife sent to Australia to minister to the flock. The reverend is asked to investigate an artist who painted a controversial work call \\"Crucified Venus.\\" The reverand, who considers himself a progressive, is shocked at the amoral atmosphere surrounding the painter, his wife, and the three models living at his estate.

I would recomend this book to anyone from ages 12 and up. This book has some mild violence and lots of suspense. For example, when Viola is found dead in the river below a famous bridge, everyone begins to wonder if someone had supposedly pushed her that night or if it was a suicidal act. Also, towards the middle of the story, another murder happens with one of Viola's friends. This story gave so much detail that I was able to draw vivid pictures in my mind. I hope you enjoy the thrilling and exciting story, A Christmas Journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I am in awe of Ancient Roman technology. The way they were able to build a harbor on the island of Ventotene, and to provide fresh water to the island through a system of cisterns and tunnels is amazing.

It's amazing that they have to spend hours decompressing before they can come to the surface.It would have been nice if they could have explored the shipwrecks more extensively, I wish they had had more footage and more in-depth coverage of what they found.

The story leads to very predictable places, but Clea DuVall and Darryl Hannah are each absolutely stunning. A fan (more of an obsessor) of Clea DuVall, I HAD to have this film - and it is FAR better than the Astronaut's Wife or Little Witches - but not nearly as good as Girl, Interrupted or But I'm a Cheerleader.I'd only recommend this to people who want to watch acting, and don't need a very interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring","review":"I went out and bought this video based on reviews I'd read here and was overwhelmingly disappointed. I painfully sat through this entire movie waiting, hoping, praying for something interesting to happen, but unfortunately, IT NEVER DID.

The interaction between Clea DuVall(Cally) who by the way was great in \\"But I'm a Cheerleader\\" and Daryl Hannah(Sabine), was confusing as to what the real attraction was between them, so instead you got a lot of mindless dialogue.

It made me feel that it is my duty to inform the public of how atrocious it is. The acting of Daryl Hannah was pathetically dramatic. She gave the impression of a combination of helplessness and wanting to seduce everything that she was confronted with. Acting was dry. I felt bad for Clea DuVall.

She's been told little about her mother, except that she had to leave Cally and her father because she got in trouble for her political activities. Cally becomes convinced that the woman she meets in San Francisco (Daryl Hannah) is her mother, and she tries to become friends with the woman. As she learns more about the woman and her father, she also begins to understand herself better. The story is simple and straight forward, and the style and acting are extremely low-key. Although the movie is not great by any standards, it is fairly likeable. Look fast for a quick appearance by Blue's Traveller.

He covers the security issues thoroughly. As one reads the book, it becomes clear that Microsoft has not and apparantly has no plans to beef up security for Access. It is plagued with holes.

These forms have saved me countless hours in programming. These savings alone pay for the cost of the book many times over.I spent quite a bit of time researching Access security through the Microsoft website and this was a complete waste of time. There are holes in the security that MS doesn't even mention (what a surprise).This book is well worth the money for anyone who is serious about securing their proprietary efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I recently purchased Garry's book. It provided me security solutions that I never read in any other Access book before.Every subject is described in great detail and the downloadable sample forms and functions make it easy to quickly create a secure database.When I got stuck on an issue, I emailed Garry and asked his team for some advice. I wasn't sure if anyone on his team would even respond. However, Garry himself answered the question within less than 1 hour and provided me the answer to the problem.Now -- in my opionion -- that absolutely awesome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Security for Access","review":"All of the other reviews pretty much say it all, but I wanted to place a more recent review in the list. Although I have just started using some of the basics Gary clearly discusses, I am anxious to get to the rest. Being able to secure Access has always been in the back of my mind. Now I know I can tackle the issue and get it done in a consistent manner that I can carry into all my Access projects.

The Summer Breeze is so quiet and smooth that I hear many sounds at night that had been masked by the pulsing sound emitted by the Original.High speed is just enough slower than the Hunter Original that it does not dry out my nose and throat as the old one did.

Yea they cost a little more but the 13 years we lived their they never made a sound, or were unbalanced always worked and ran all year.When I built this home we went to Home Depot and liked the look of the cheaper fans they sold. But the quailty was not the same as the Hunters. In fact within 2 years replaced 2 already. I went back to the Hunters and bought this one.

I will say that although I am not the person who assembled and installed it, it seemed to be pretty easy to do both. I really like the antique brass finish; I was having a diffcult time locating a ceiling fan with this type of finish in any of the big box stores or home improvement stores and came across this on on Amazon.

His short stories about his experiences as a new counselor are pretty dry and written with a sense of humor that I simply don't find funny.

First of all Chicago-16 (1982) is leaps and bounds better than this album for many reasons. This album is way to poppy and not only that most of the songs are so bad Stay The Night, Along Comes A Woman, Prima Donna and more the lyrics are terrible the only good song here is Hard Habit To Break and the only reason that song is good is because Bill Champlin/Peter Cetera do a great job singing together.Chicago in the 1980's is mostly forgetable their songs all sound the same and they are all mostly ballads for the mindless masses. Not that there is anything wrong with some pop music i like some of it but please stick to Chicago-16."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first one they got right after \\"10\\"","review":"The death of Terry Kath after Chicago X must have hit the group pretty hard. A couple of singles off of \\"Hot Streets\\" and the \\"Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Love Me Tomorrow\\" duo off of XVI were pretty much all they had to show for in this period. Along comes XVII, and suddenly they're back on the charts with four singles (and matching MTV videos) such as \\"Hard Habit to Break\\", and \\"You're the Inspiration\\". They had found their roots again, and it paid off for them. Sadly, Peter Cetera was not staying long afterward, but this album is a good representation of his later Chicago offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this album when it first came out","review":"I had this record when it first came out!

Alwyn Barr wrote a wonderful account of the Texas brigade commanded by Camille Jules Marie, Prince de Polignac. Not only was his research meticulous, but his writing flows through the pages. Polignac's men fought in some of the largest battles west of the Mississippi--Sterling Plantation, Mansfield, Pleasant Hill, and Yellow Bayou--and proved themselves good soldiers. This book deserves to be on the shelves of anyone with an interest in the Trans-Mississippi Confederacy or in Confederate brigades in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wild Baron","review":"I enjoyed this book,It was different from her other books, It covered the good and bad of the complete family of the Wild Baron.

If you are constantly arguing with the author, \\"Barons don't that\\", \\"That's not how people talked inthe Regency period,\\" \\"how modern!\\" then you cannot relax and enjoy the story. In addition, the writing and editing were so scatterbrained, you would think this book had been written in one caffeine-binge weekend.

Robin Hood is alive and well, and fighting the Sheriff of Nottingham. Circe is capturing men with her magical wiles. And so on. Throughout this gorgeous romp, we see our friend Silverlock emerge from his coccoon to become a real man and a decent human being.This review cannot do justice to what is a gorgeous voyage through the Commonwealth.

There are many glaring examples of a poor understanding of English usage and grammar in the very first section of this book alone.

We're supposed to look upon the exploits of these shallow and self-centered 70s people as great fun? Sorry, but I don't buy it. Anybody who thinks Maupin's \\"tales\\" depict some kind of Utopian past needs to shake the cobwebs out of their head and get a life.

Now, as a young woman on her own for the first time, I totally identify with Mary Anne Singleton's quest for independance and a new life in \\"Tales of the City.\\" I now also understand how friends can become adjunct family. I can't wait to re-read these books again and again, hoping to understand even more as I get older. The only down-side is that life seems oddly dull by comparison to Maupin's twisted, witty, and very special world."},{"rating":"2","title":"It sucked me in!","review":"Reading Maupin's books, you would think that the only place in the world to live is San Franscisco. Sometimes, I agree.The characters are wonderful, and over the course of the series, the core inidividuals change. Some of them grow up, others regress. I read all six books in a week, and I was left wishing for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first volume is the best","review":"This, the first volume is Maupin's TALES OF THE CITY series, is by far the best. It is the first book to make me laugh out loud in years. It is warm, funny (make that HILARIOUS), and fascinating. I just couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, none of the rest of the volumes live up to the quality of the first. The second book is less amusing and less interesting, and the others aren't worth your time at all. But *this* one! Oh yeah! Buy it and read it. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you will laugh again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I purchased this because I spent my twenties in SF and am currently raising my own family here. The storyline is pretty lame and the name-dropping gets incredibly irritating. While it is interesting to hear the names of locations that are and were staples of SF in the 1970s, the clothing brand dropping is cringe-worthly. When I finished this book I literally let out a sigh of relief and wished I had those hours of my life back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unabashedly SF-centric soap opera","review":"Midwesterner Mary Ann Singleton falls in love with San Francisco while on vacation and makes an abrupt decision to relocate. She takes an apartment at 28 Barbary Lane, owned by the mysterious but kindly Anna Madrigal. This provides our entry into a world of lovingly-drawn characters from both the gay-friendly, bohemian, pre-AIDS world of 1970s SF and the stuffy, gossiping, status-conscious world of high society. One of the major delights of this novel is the way author Armistead Maupin draws these characters into each other's orbits in unexpected ways, providing quite a bit of overlap between two seemingly incompatible worlds. Maupin is a very gifted writer of telling vignettes and humorous dialogue. He stumbles toward the end when he reveals a truly depraved character without dealing adequately with the issues he raises. But, otherwise, this book is full of people I want to know and know more about. Thankfully, there are five more books in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down","review":"This is one of those books you don't want to stop reading because each chapter leaves you hanging for the next.

To me, it lacked richness and colorful descriptions, and very little \\"happened\\" except for the most mundane of situations. San Francisco just didn't \\"come through\\" the pages for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay. No more.","review":"After reading this, I found it hard to remember exactly what had happened in it.

Truly orgasmic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer reading","review":"Maupin's tale of San Fransisco is a fun-filled jaunt through the lives of the deliciously sinful characters that surround 28 Barbary Lane. Sex, drugs, and maybe not so much rock n' roll (this is the 70's - let's stick to disco) permeate the atmosphere as a cast of over 10 loveable people discover their place in the world. This is a plot that will not draw you in the way it could, nor are the intriguing characters all that worthy of sympathy. However I find myself in quite an introspective mood after reading a few chapters, as I ask myself the same questions posed to Mary Ann, Mrs. Madgrigal, and the others. My advice: take this series to the beach, and have fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dickens of 1970s San Francisco? Nah--but a fun read...","review":"\\"Tales of the City\\" by Maupin is a fun, nostalgic romp through 1970s San Francisco. Set in the disco, drug, and easy sex days in the nation's hippest city-still coming down from its Summer of Love high-\\"Tales of the City\\" weaves the stories of several characters in gripping and fun serial fashion.Maupin originally wrote the vignettes as a series of newspaper columns. The book collected these columns together, so you can whip through the stories without having to wait for another installment. And you will whip through this book. The length of the chapters and the cliff-hanger prose ensures a quick read.It's a fun if not deep book. It's especially interesting if you live in or often visit San Francisco. For really that's what this book is: a love story about a city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotion and intrigue","review":"The compelling story of an apartment building brimming with some of the most interesting San Fransiscan characters one could imagine.

How could I return to my dull life after such pleasure and joy! Well I did, and a year later (the day I saw the 'Tales' mini-series at a film festival) I came out to my best friend.

The next day I go to Best Buy and get it with out even looking at the list of the songs on back. We put the CD in the car and go for a long drive and the songs are way to short. But what really makes me mad is no \\"Amarillo by Morning\\". How do you leave that song off? The second disk has about fifteen songs I would gladly give up if they would have put \\"Amarillo by Morning\\" on there instead.This is not the First time George has let me down. Every time he comes to Arizona for a concert and I fork over the hefty price to see him, he will not change his concert play list to allow for \\"Ocean Front Property in Arizona\\" How do you come to Arizona and not play that song?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 'Ol George","review":"My favorite country star, George sings a smooth melody often intermingled with lyrics that play off words or phrases with more than one possible meaning.

Strait has had many, many #1 Country hits, but the count according to Billboard stands at 39, now achieved with his new single (and ONLY new recording on this collection) \\"I Hate Everything\\". Then, of course, it has been mentioned here before, many of the songs here have been edited and it shows. Some songs sound as if someone has come into your room and randomly lowered the volume. This is awful! I guess they have been edited to have enough space on the discs to include all of his \\"51 #1s\\". Here we go again. In short: I am very disappointed! When I see the many positive reviews here I develop a feeling that people really want to be ripped off, whether by George Strait or other people named George or differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVERY song has been edited to fit on 2 discs!","review":"not recommendedthere is anywhere from 2-45 seconds cut in every songI'd say George wasn't thinking straight when he ok'd this release chopping his songs into little pieces.most TRUE artists have a little more respect for their own songs than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't care","review":"So some of the songs are truncated. I don't care! Country music is not a genre with a definite pattern in the composition like concerti and symphonies. It was difficult to get all those 50 hits on two discs, and I appreciate the effort.When I'm riding down the road and listening to George Strait, I enjoy his own unique style with a hint of the rhythm that Johnny Cash used and a big dose of the melancholy that made us all love George Jones. Then I hear some novelty country Western tune from back in the 1980's, and I'm smiling again.George Strait is the kind of male singer that makes a woman feel good. When we women listen to him, we can think about the men in our lives. His songs convey an appreciation and love for women. I don't know of anyone else who stirs up that much feeling. He's not self-absorbed, and his lyrics that he selects are all about men who loved women. Often things just didn't turn out right. The poignancy of this album and the vulerability of George Strait affect me."},{"rating":"2","title":"*****For George 0 for the Song Cutting Hacks!","review":"This a a great collection. It reminds me why I fell in love with George Strait's voice way back when I was in high school in the 80s and why I still love it 20+ years later. Unfortunately, TPTB have done a few things to mar what could have been a real testament to Mr. Strait's career. They have shamelessly chopped up several of the songs on disc one in order to cram them all in. I was also surprised that \\"The Cowboy Rides Away,\\" \\"The Fireman,\\" and \\"Amarillo By Morning\\" were excluded since they fudged the Number 1 idea with \\"True\\" and \\"Run.\\" Still George Strait could put out a CD with him singing Happy Birthday and it would be awesome.

Unfortunately, you get all of this, except the talk-overs, with this 2-CD set that brags through its label but fails to live up to its own hype and leaves you feeling empty after having listened to it. Murder on Country Music Row anyone?I'm sure MCA got what they wanted with this spoof of an effort. The fans? Unless you are in marketing for those media giants and looking for new angles on how to edit great songs to add more commercials into your daily repertoire, you're not missing much.

So as a fan I was glad to be able to get all his number ones in one set I thoughtwhat could be better. For one thing How about the complete songs. As other reviews have noted a good number of the songs have been cut short. By my math some have had as much as 43 seconds cut. This is an historic cd for him. but it is tanited by this. There is no time listing anywhere on the cd or the linner notes for the track lengths. I would have gladly paid more money for a 3 disk set to get the full songs. I was also hoping for him to reflect on the linner notes about why he picked each song etc. But that is not there either."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Strait","review":"as always great stuff!!!

Maybe a box set would be better next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"And he's not done yet!!!!","review":"George Strait gives his fans an early Christmas gift with this fabulous collection of his best and a glimpse of what's surely yet to come.

Personally, I dont think it's possible, and despite their best intentions, MCA Nashville was not entirely successful with this venture. All of the songs included are indeed signature george Strait; BUT, as others have pointed out, many of the songs have been edited/shortened. I consider it a slap in the face not only to the great George Strait and his songwrtiers, but more importantly, to his fans. With that said, the sound quality and layout of the discs are great; and the recordings are originals (although, often editied for length). If I were a true George Strait Fan, I'd go with the more complete Box Set. However, this is an affordable way to get a significant number of his hits on a 2 CD Set."},{"rating":"1","title":"In protest I left the edited album on the store shelf!!!!","review":"I would rate this 0 stars but the lowest option available is one star. This is a very important historic release 50 # 1 hits.I can't believe that they would edit(shorten the songs from their original version). This is the life work of one of the most important artists in Country Music history. I am sure we would have all paid a couple of bucks more if they had to go to three disks to fit the songs into the collection. I wonder if George knows that they butchered up his songs.I wish I knew how to contact George Strait to find out how he feels about this and how the record company has upset his fans.I think he should make a public statement on this and file a lawsuit. Those of you who were unaware of the edits at the time of purchase should check with your stores return policy. Does anyone know how I can contact the record company to let them know how I feel.A very disappointed fan!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"50 Great Number Ones","review":"This CD is a must purchase for any true George Strait fan or any true fan of country music for that matter. Even if you already own everything George ever recorded like I do, this set is a convenient all-in-one collection, especially for traveling. I know a few tracks were shortened or faded early, but the only one that truly bothers me is the ending to \\"Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind?\\". The original ending is my favorite part of that song. Congratulations George, you are still \\"The King of the Cowboys\\".

A big dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopped-up versions","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer, many of these songs are cut up and mangled in some way. I should've done the math, 25 songs per disc with around 80 minute capacity leaves only a little over 3 minutes per song, not enough time. It's the same story as the Rolling Stones' \\"40 Licks\\". I hate when record companies do this, it makes me want to not buy anything else from them. I'd much rather have 40 complete songs or pay more for a 3-disc set for the album versions. Because of the edits, I don't think I'll ever listen to this. A complete waste of money. They could at least have the courtesy to warn you by giving track running times on the back cover, but that might cut in sales. Greed rules again in the record industry.

True there is power and strength, sometimes spectacularly but with some telluric outbursts reminding of other great brucknerians. But what this recording seems to bring is an unmistakable love of this music, which speaks of nature with the naivety, deepness and rawness of Sibelius or Stravinsky. Bruckner loved life and the beauty of the world. We hear only instruments and the result is intense poetry, like we can hear in Berlioz \\"Fantastique\\". With a kind of hypnotic flow. Not surprisingly, Karajan could also be masterly in Sibelius. Not very far from what Sanderling could do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen as Blomstedt drags you kicking & screaming into mediocrity","review":"It is a hopeful sight to see a new release of any major symphonic cycle. Given Sibelius' cyclical popularity in full swing, this release makes sense. It is unfortunate that Decca chose Blomstedt's this time around. It is as if, at every step, Blomstedt restrains rather than empowers, through almost every movement. Never letting go of the leash, the listener cries out for the players to be enabled to take Sibelius' music where it is fully capable of going. Don't take my word for it, listen for yourself. Compare the measured tact & grace of Davis, the unbridled electricity of Ashkenazy, or (my recommendation) the young swagger & hipness of Maazel & the Vienna Philharmonic. Then try not to fall asleep as a reluctant Blomstedt proceeds to suck the very life out of each & every symphony.

The best thing about this cat tower is it came fully assembled! It is sturdy and heavy (the weight is a good thing, it adds to the stability). It's not so heavy that I can't lift it (I'm a 130 lb woman), but I wouldn't want to carry it far. It's also very nice-looking without taking up lots of space.

I had not purchased it through Amazon. I think I was very fortunate, that it was delivered intact, in that it was delivered in a flimsy box, that was bursting open. The box consisted of two boxes taped together. The tape was breaking apart. There were some bald spots on the carpeting (thank goodness minor spots) where it had been banged. There was no packing, not even plastic. Also, it is advertised as beige, and they sent dark-brown. I had read a previous review, where they also received a different color than what was advertised. I thought perhaps that was a single mistake. Now I am thinking they send you whatever color they have left in the warehouse, no matter what the picture. It is a great product, but when you purchase it on-line, you are taking your chances!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Premium product","review":"We have had this cat tree for almost a month.

Of the magazines and books scattered by the bed, one has the title, \\"Night Horses and Wet Dreams.\\" I'm no prude, but I really don't understand the point of having this page and this illustration in a book that is otherwise perfect for 2 - 4th grade \\"horse crazy\\" girls.

I laughed out loud in public as I was reading it. The antics of the puny people as they deal with rats, the cheese famine and flatulence are quite entertaining.Who Cut the Cheese provides a cynical comment on the modern workplace, especially on managers who compensate for their incompetence by being cruel and manipulative. Sometimes the book hits a bit close to home. The advice it gives is accurate and very applicable in today's corporate world, and if you have no scruples, you could go far by applying it.

Let's see in which company managers have the guts to distribute Brown's parody. The book also will be translated into other languages - which is somewhat of a challenge, as the meaning of \\"Who Cut the Cheese\\" won't be conveyed well to the readers after a word-by-word translation.

Another hilarious moment is a chase scene that includes a horse-drawn hearse careening about a grassy park that includes a brass band playing in a large gazebo. Whenever the speeding hearse comes into view the leader of the brass band feels obligated is stop the playing of a jaunty tune and take up instead a slow dirge. This interruption of the band concert happens again and again! My brother and I really laughed at the ironic juxtaposition of the slow dirge with the wildly careening hearse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring it out on DVD!","review":"An absolute classic!

It comes with the first two flicks plus a blu-ray, so add a really nifty box and I thought it was a bargain. I definitely wouldn't pay anywhere near $45 for it though. It was a birthday present for someone who only likes the first two movies anyway, so that worked out great. I do think it's a little odd that it comes with the first movie, second movie, and then a blu-ray of the first movie. What a strange combination. Why not just the two films? Or why not the two films and a novelty, like a small trinket or figurine? Either way, for less than twenty bucks this is a purchase I definitely don't regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU DO NOT GET THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF FILMS","review":"Not the complete collection, only Hellraiser 1 (1x DVD and 1x bluray) and Hellraiser 2 (1x DVD), so not really a collectors box set of all the films.

It's $15 more than the standard DVD, which isn't a surprise since the movie came out in 1987. Major fans already have the first two Hellraisers, so would they want to pay $59.97 for the boxed set? It comes in a very nifty design that mimics a prop in the movie. But it also contains a complete Hellraiser 1 and 2 on DVD and then Hellraiser again on BluRay. Lots of BuRays also contain a standard DVD, but not often in an entirely new case. Any fan would already have the first two so they're spending an extra $30 just to get the case, assuming they have BluRay. It's a headscratcher.

I could have got the movies seperately for cheaper, but i have always wanted a puzzle box in one form or another and then I seen this.It came well protected in its retail packaging, but the box leaves something to be desired. Made of a cheap lightweight plastic it is noticably lighter than it looks. It gives off the impression that you can rotate the halves of the boxes and in essence \\"play\\" with the box, but that is not the case, as the halves only fit together in one way. When put together, the fingers of the box halves have nothing to be supported against at the tip and will flex inward.The movie quality is as others described it, and makes for an enjoyable experience.In all i'm still happy with the purchase, although I'll probably put the discs into a binder and add some weights to the box and glue it shut, to use as a paperweight of sorts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Cool","review":"This box is way cool and I look forward to watching it. The transaction was great and the item came in perfect condition. Can't wait to see Pinhead in blu-ray. Such a great character. The box is such an icon of the movies and it great to finally have one.

Thanks again and have great new year. It's soul tearing time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"Very super cool dvd set. Although I think this puzzle box should have had all the Hellraiser films within to make it complete, having the first two (and best) films of the series is still great.

I was never taught a fraction of what is in this book concerning the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. The young should be taught true history. The author portrays the evil of this time and it compares with the Nazis actions and the evils of the Russian Revolution. I know we have been allies of France in many wars but to bury the atrocities of history because of this is wrong. It was a time and an evil that gripped a people and has been repeated through out history. Evil is not characteristic to one group or nation. God bless the Catholic martyrs of the French Revolution.

It has a fine cast, great LA locations (brilliantly photographed by John Alton) and an unusual dash of surrealism in the plot mechanics.

I like the fact that it groups the Asperger's kids with the High Functioning Autistic kids, because in my experience, the two groups do have so much in common (and diagnoses can be somewhat subjective). The book is very well-written and has a positive outlook.

The \\"translation\\" is awful, the exposition poor and the browsing back and forth looking for figures cited in the text is rather cumbersome. There is a void (of books) in this genra and in defense skills in specific. Some of them are geared towards the hard-core pro/semi-pro, then there's a huge gap in the middle, and then there are books geared towards the beginners and \\"dummies.\\" Those of us who love to play and watch this sport find ourselves at a loss when it comes to good self-coaching/game improvement literature. This book, as said above, is not one I would recommend to someone fitting that \\"intermediate\\" level."},{"rating":"2","title":"comprehensive","review":"Other reviewers are a little hard on this book. I think it does a good job laying out important defensive principles, and giving small sided games to illustrate these.

I rented the movie because Mischa Barton was in it, and it looked like it was interesting. Well, there's a reason this movie isn't all that widely known. I wish the concept was saved for good actors and a good script who could've made the movie really hit home. It is a movie people can relate to, and it is good in a satirical sense - but if the creators were not trying to make a satire, wow it sucks more than i thought. Teenage girls can relate because it's a movie about finding yourself, but it could've been done in a much better way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably without exaggeration the worst movie I've ever seen","review":"The title of this review says it all. I rented this because I picked up the wrong tape in the store and watched it because I had nothing else to do. What a mistake! The characters are simplistic, the plot twisted and confusing (but not in a cool way, more of a \\"I don't know how to write a screenplay\\" way), and the relationships nonsensical and unrealistic. It was excruciatingly long, pretensious, and melodramatic. The few funny moments are almost camp, and the acting is sub-par at best. Please save yourself the money and avoid this movie like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck...","review":"This movie was a waste of my time and money. Everyone hyped it up to be the next \\"KIDS\\" and it didn't even come close. Bijou Phillips appears in the movie for like a total of 10mins. Good performance from her though. I guess Renfro enjoys playing dopey roles. Mischa Barton was disappointing. She's a great actress but not in this film. Swain needs to get some good roles instead of playing love-sick girls who mope around all the time. The ending of the movie makes no sense and doesn't even fit the storyline.

No such luck. I think the biggest problem in this movie was the script-- the writing was so bad that it was actually painful to listen to the dialogue. Though there are some normally fine actors in this cast, it would have been impossible to triumph over the poor script, and the cast as a whole seemed strangely void of emotion, except for a few moments of melodrama. I found myself hating even the characters we were supposed to sympathize with. Delilah, who is supposed to be the \\"fun, crazy\\" outsider, simply disgusted me with her actions at the movie's central party. Even the art direction in this movie was strange-- many pivotal scenes in the movie were shot from very far away. The strangeness of this movie is not intentional, it's just lack of skill.

Dominique Swain however is mediocre and doesn't display her true acting talents. Melanie Griffith is credited on the movie case, but her total screen time is merely 20secs(I'm not kidding!).Tart is a movie that is targeted for the same audience as movies such as 'Cruel Intentions'.The DVD lacks any extra features (except for a 3min trailer).Rent the movie from a video store before you choose to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good cast that goes nowhear","review":"tart is a poorly writen movie that is a waste of some of the best young actors. the script gives us no reason to like anyone in this film, making it an endurence test to watch it all the way through. swain who was interisting in lolita is just nothing here, phillips, who is entertaining usually, is just a paper cut out of a person. and mischa barton, who has always held my attention when on screen, even in bad, poorly written movies, couldn't even hold my interest in this film"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what I was hoping for, but this wasn't it...","review":"The premise of the movie sounded pretty interesting. Unfortunately, I was wrong. I decided to give it a chance, even when it got boring. It's not that I have a problem with kids on drugs and having sex, it's that I have seen this movie before, and it's called \\"Bully.\\" (Not only because of the repeated actors and actresses, Bijou Phillips and Brad Renfro, but because of the repeated subject matter) Plus, if that was the kind of movie it was going to be, that would have been fine, but it was almost as if it was trying to be deep with the internal monologue of the main character. Yuck. Be what you are. The writing was bad and completely unrealistic....I just felt like the characters weren't developed enough, and if the scene actually started to produce something good, it never went anywhere. Blah. The End"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was warned. I watched it anyway.","review":"The only thing that kept this movie afloat was Miss Swain's beauty. I never get tired of looking at her. But the acting and characters in this movie were atrocious. Robots are seen instead of characters with depth -- it's so hard to develop any feelings for these people. And you know what that leads to...you cheer for their demise. (Like in that other Dominique Swain movie - The Smokers.) In a movie with little substance, you have to flaunt what you got, thus Melanie Griffith's name headlines with the others even though she only makes a 7 second cameo! So, I give this movie one star for existing and one star for Swain's pretty face."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good young cast","review":"This movie is better than it sounds.

I like groovy/trippy/campy flicks from the 60s and 70s, but this one lost my interest pretty quickly. First, I am a Klaus Kinski fan, and if you are as well, be prepared for disappointment since Klaus only appears in about 10-15 minutes of the movie and has some stupid sounding voice dubbed over his own! Aside from that, the film relied on the wooden acting of James Darren and the nakedness of Maria Rohm to keep my attention. Close, but not enough. I think the director was anticipating most of his audience would be puffing the magic dragon, making them more likely to be entertained by flashing lights, bad acid-jazz, random nudity, random dialogue etc.Apparently there is some tricky ending that explains the whole incomprehensible design but I was too bored/sober to really care what all the weird stuff meant after half an hour of one totally unrelated scene after another.

It's starts out so well too.... \\"I tried not to remember why I buried my trumpet.\\" ...but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story that isn't the least bit sexy or interesting.

Shot in a lurid, psychedelic style, Venus in Furs has indy/underground stamped on it with a vengeance. Maverick filmmaker Franco goes to Ken Russell-like excess with an almost documentary approach to a story that will make M. Night Shamalyn fans re-think their opinions about their hero's originality. Made in the days when Franco was at his hottest, this must have torn heads wide open in it's day. As a side note; the sound track( featuring Franco on horn, at times )may never leave your mind.

I haven't totally tried it out yet but I can tell all you kids who think this is like a real cellphone that they are totally wrong. This is a hunky walkie talkie and I mean hunky.

That said K.A. never writes a bad book, so its still worth reading. Be warned YOU MUST READ EACH BOOK CHRONOLOGICALLY FROM NUMBER ONE! A lot of this book is the renmants walking around with the very boring Marauders.But it is Required reading if you want to follow the story of the remnants. I can't wait for the final two books in the series, but i'll be sad to say goodbye to Jobs, Mo'steel, 2Face and the gang. In the words of one of the Marauders \\"J'ou should definitely read this book just so j'ou can be prepared for the final j'ou- i mean two books\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood & yawn","review":"This movie had the potential to be grotesque but unfortunately didn't quite cut it with the special effects. It had some mildly erotic moments but just didn't make it as a horror movie. If the actors had been Muppets in stead it could have been a killer comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic and dull","review":"A Japanese entry into the torture porn genre is more graphic yet at the same time less powerful (not to mention entertaining) than similar Western movies, like Saw, Hostel or a Serbian Film. A psycho who dresses as a doctor (and strongly resembles a young Takeshi Kitano) kidnaps a young couple and subjects them to all sort of degrading tortures. There is at least one powerful erotic scene as the captor fondles the bound captive girl genitals during several minutes. And there is an outrageous ending that resembles the ending of some of Takashi Miike's films. But for most of the time, I found this film pretty dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Stars on the PERVERT-O-METER!","review":"Sick, sicker, GROTESQUE! Nothing needs to be added.

I compare them to sheets I've purchased at closeouts. The stitching was irregular and stood out because white thread was used on the orange sheet. Also, the fitted sheet did not fit our full size bed.

It argues for externalism in the philosophy of mind in a clear and convincing way. Unlike most arguments for externalism that depend heavily on intuitions about language or various thought-experiments, McClamrock does the work of grounding his agruments in real science and actual cases. Anyone tempted by Kim-style a priori arguments about the mind should especially read the book and hopefully see what one can do when one engages w/ real cases. The only thing keeping me from giving the book 5 stars is that I wish some of the cases and arguments were pushed a bit further, but it's still and excellent book, and one that anyone interested in externalism and the philosophy of mind should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time....Freaknik Party Not Even on this DVD","review":"OMG!

It opens with the Rodger the Space Private story and does not include any of the Arisia/Eddore series setup material. No Atlantis, no Rome, no WWI, II, or III.Oddly the back cover suggests that all that material is included.

Be warned that all of the kindle versions of this book that Amazon currently offers are the original magazine version of the story and lack all reference to the Lensman series. Those elements were later added by Doc Smith in the 1940s for republication and seem to only be included in some of the physical book editions. The Kindle version does not have the first section containing the backstory of the Arisians and the Eddorians; does not include the fall of Atlantis nor of Rome, and does not include the world war(s). It begins with the space pirates in what would later be the third section of the book. I bought this for the Kindle expecting the final version of the book and feel I got burned because 1/3rd of the book was missing. A good yarn, but not yet part of the Lensman series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for boys of all ages.","review":"The Lensman series is a wonderful adventure for adolescent boys (and girls of like mind).

Doc Smith for lack of ambition -- imagining a sci-fi adventure spanning practically the whole universe and continuing for millions of years. But that's about the only compliment I can give this book. As much as I wanted to see how the overarching story played out, I couldn't stomach more than 200 pages of Smith's horrendous dialogue and 1-dimensional cartoon-hero characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vs Evil on a Galactic Scale!","review":"The first of the Lensman series, this book introduces us to the struggle between the Arisians and the Eddorians to see who will inherit the galaxy.

It is a book that should be destroyed, as it has no place on the shelves of a library, unless you idolize Adolf Hitler , and the KKK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Grandma gave us this video and my sons just hated it. There is no coherent organization at all to the footage - the narrators just race frantically around a space museum from a space simulator to a saturn 5 rocket to whatever else is nearby. The museum exibits offer no action of their own, so the narrators had to contrive some. And as for the narrators Dave and Becky... they seem to be in competition as to who can ham it up more on camera, which was enough to drive every adult out of the room. Not educational, not entertaining, but plenty annoying. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talk and not enough action","review":"I bought this video hoping that it would be similar to Stage Fright Production's videos, e.g., Choo Choo Trains Up Close and Very Personal. My children love that video. Unfortunately, There Goes A Spaceship lacks everything that makes the Choo Choo train video successful. In Spaceship, the NASA footage was excellent. There was simply too little of it. The hosts of Spaceship spend too much time in front of the camera. I doubt anybody, at any age, would find their skits or jokes funny or interesting. Every time one of them came on, my son turned to me and said \\"See rocket? See shuttle?\\" Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Mammoth is better","review":"I bought this video for my son because I was looking for a child-level introduction to the some of the things I find interesting. My son does enjoy this video but I feel that he doesn't need to be exposed to the pointless, foolish humor used throughout. There are some good scenes in this video. One of Dave running alongside a Saturn 5 rocket really gives a sense of the scale, but why give a visual explanation of how an astronaut uses a toilet? If you're looking for a good video for kids that introduces them to the space shuttle and rockets I would recommend The Big Space Shuttle by Little Mammoth Media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, good stuff","review":"\\"Hi Dave and Becky! Can you fly the space shuttle to our house and play?\\" That's what I heard my three-year-old saying while he walked around our kitchen with my cell phone to his head. This video is largely responsible for Christmas 2007's heavy space theme. Even our 1-year-old is running around the house with random items, like spatulas and dog toys, saying \\"space!\\" and making space sounds. Embrace the wonderful horrible and intentional bad acting for the genius it is. Freeze frame Dave using the toilet on the space shuttle and prepare for lift off. Good, good stuff. We also have \\"There Goes a Train, ... an Airplane, ... a Helicopter...\\" etc. This one is by far the fave in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left hungry","review":"This ecological morality play is standard Star Trek fare taken... nowhere new at all.

Power Hungry uses the old \\"split-em-up\\" stand-by to place Riker on the \\"rebel\\" side while the rest of the crew negociate with the government of a planet that ruined its own eco-system.

I think 'Comedy' is an apt title for this record, but can't really go into detail as to why, but it works. 'Second,' and 'Just like a Parvenu,' present some unforgettable drones and tonal feedback. 'Organ' and its follow up 'Organ Returns (slight difference)' are Drumm's tracks with Jim O'Rourke, and they have the harshest playing-song structure to them. Ambient death metal if you will.

If you are into complex, advanced, multidimensional sound that tickles all of your senses, seek anything on Seamless Records, Incipient records, The ORB, Amon Tobin, Squarepusher, Anything on Interchill records, Plaid, anything on Dragonfly records/Liquid Sound Design.

The usual Maggody misadventures and murders familiar to all ardent Hessians take place.I think this is a series that gets better as it goes on. There is a certain crudity and dependence on cliches and stereotypes in the earlier character drawing. The fat girl Delia is greedy; the preacher is a hypocrite. The later ones have more subtlety.\\"She had her cat, Pussy Toes, her apartment in a quiet neigborhood, her meetings of the genealogical society, her knitting projects for nieces and nephews, and her annual vaction to a family-run hotel in Mexico where she remained drunk out of her mind for ten days straight.\\" You might accuse Hess of making fun of alcoholism in that portrait of Miss Vetchling but it has a certain style and sharpness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maggody Blues","review":"I wanted to like this story, but all the characters, with the exception the the lead character, sound exactly the same.

It's a whole different set of exercises, which keeps it fun, there are ab excercises, and you are working out on an Island.My personal favorite is the 30 minute step aerobics with the Wii balance board. It's just enough time for me to get a workout routine in before I go to work. For this exercise, there are 3 sets of 10 minute workouts. So, you are working and moving, non-stop for 10 minute stretches. If you don't have time for the full 30 minutes, you can adjust it down to 20 or 10 minutes before you begin.To be honest, I have not fully explored all that you can do with the EA Sports Active: More Workouts because I am having too much fun with what I am doing now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EA Sports Active: More Workouts","review":"I have only used this product for four days but it made me sweat...

Big improvement for someone like me who is just getting back into fitness.My biggest complaint with Active was that there wasn't a lot of core workouts. It mostly worked my arms and legs. I felt that I needed something more, and More Workouts delivers. Push-ups, crunches, leg raises, and more.I like the pace, the island theme, and the mini-games. I can't say enough good things.

Despite the progress I'd made with the first version, the new exercises are hard! I'm feeling the results in muscles I never knew I had, and after only a week and a half I can already already see visible changes.My favorite feature is that there's a whole, planned workout each day. I know myself, and if I'm left to make up my own routine, I'll lose motivation and abandon it. I get a lot of benefit from having a set schedule to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"Got this along with EA Active 2. Have never used EA Active 1. Compared to EA Active 2 it is just okay. I could do without this game. It is frustrating because you cannot use the wireless sensors and heart rate monitor that come with the EA Active 2 and the cord gets tangled up when you're working out. After I was done with the 9 week program in EA Active 2 I tried doing the 6 week program in this game, and after the first workout I was so bored with it that I couldn't go on. I will probably give this away. It would be okay for someone who is just used to the original maybe, but this is not comparable to EA Active 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I have the original adn now the more exercises of the EA Active.

I like the variety it provides of switching equipment and activities frequently. I am hopeful that it will provide a good indoor option during the cold winter! I am also enjoying the \\"Workout with a Friend\\" mode, where my son and I work out simultaneously and could be a competitive or supportive environment depending how we want it.

It's also nice to know I can change my workout days. I failed the 30 day challenge because of illness. I know I will complete the six week challenge now.Finally they altered the dominant hand for sport activities. I am a lefty and I dislike having to hold the Wii remote in my right hand. Bravo to EA.I'm not sure if I like the warm up and cool down sections. I am a yoga practitioner and would prefer different stretches. This is a minor quibble..If you are looking for an alternate to a gym membership, this game is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of a workout than Wii Fit Plus","review":"I started with Wii Fit Plus, and although it is very good, its dedication to the balance board can be limiting. EA Active, while it can incorporate the balance board, uses movement and resistance bands and yields a much more satisfying workout. I also like that by using the 30 day challenge, it sets the exercises for you and varies them from day to day. I would have given it 5 stars if it were not for the fact that it occasionally seems to not register controller movement properly. I now use Wii Fit Plus for logging my weight and for its excellent balance games, but EA Active is my exercise program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"I own the first E A sports workout and did it faithfully for several weeks.

I like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it; Cheaper than active 1 or 2 even with buying a seperate Accesory Kit","review":"I've used this 2 weeks now and love it. It has a couple instances when it didn't record a move, but when I moved closer to the sensor it helped. I feel great afterward and like the Journal tracking. I had belonged to Curves for 6 yrs, but moved where there wasnt one, so i bought a Wii. i did not want WiiFit after seeing the cartooning characters and reading how passive it can be The circuit training is great. Love the step aroebics too.Best part is, with buying the accesory pack that is needed and the software, it was less than Active 1 or 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ for Teaching Photography by Rand and Zakia","review":"For anyone who teaches imaging (and that includes me), this book is a must read. The book is informative and entertaining. . . filled with quotes that will make you smile while inspiring you - to become a better teacher. For example: \\"Choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.\\" - Confucius. All I can say is that we are fortunate that Dr. Zakia (whom I have met) chose teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"What to expect from your teacher","review":"The quotes throughout the book give a sense of diversity of resources and are important to the theme of drawing on information from areas other than photographic. The book speaks sympathetically and clearly to anyone who has been involved on the frontline of education. But it also speaks to those (students) who are on the receiving end of art education. It gives insight into why many of us (self-learners) need to learn (how) to find the right teachers. One of the strongest merits of this book is that it addresses issues that are not limited to the photographic community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emphasis on \\"Teaching\\"","review":"I purchased this to help create the curriculum for a high school photo 1 class inaugurated this year at my school. This book is not what I expected. It is much more about teaching pedagogy and not as much photography. That being understood it is still a well designed book.The target audience is most definitely a student of education aiming at a fine arts credential focusing on photography. It reads like a college textbook.Note: I was about to return this book because it had little usable \\"photography\\" content. However, I took a closer look - a deeper reading - and found information that would be useful for improving my teaching of photography as a fine art. I am keeping the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"Finally a book for the photo educator!!! This is long overdue and am thrilled to own it. As a relatively new high school photo teacher, it is a wonderful resource that discusses the technical and artistic considerations a teacher must deal with as well as writings on how to create assignments, test, assess, and work with your employing institution for betterment of the program. There is even more in it than I've listed here. For anyone interested in teaching photography I highly recommend this book. Although I have been trained in educational practices, so many of my colleagues have not, they are photographers who happen to teach... this book helps summarize so many points that I have discussed with them as they learn to teach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Herbert von Karajan/Bruckner 7th","review":"This is one of the better recordings of the Bruckner 7th. The acoustics here are better than the last recording of this piece he made in Vienna.The tempo is very even, instrument balances show the Berlin Philharmonic at its best. The performance of the famous adagio is nicely polished, but Daniel Barenboim in his recording with the Chicago Symphony obtains a more mystical, even religious effect in the string tone. The only problem with that recording is that DG's technical acoustics were not as good as EMI."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE THE MP3 LINK","review":"April, 2009: an emergency disambiguation is called for, since Amazon has linked the (excellent) Sundazed reissue of the 1962 Capitol album \\"You're For Me\\" to some cheesy digital package provided by \\"Chacra Music\\" that contains early works by Buck Owens, but is not the same album.

The answers in the back of the book to the practice problems are wrong tothe point that I am woried when I get an answer that agrees with the the back of the book. On top of this there are numerous typeos on the text. On top of this there is no actual organization in the book as one has to read several chapters to understan Newton's laws which are presented out of order I might add.

Occasionally, one of her many books just falls below the mark. For an author who was able to write 4 to 6 books a year, I am surprised that this doesn't happen more often.

Knoopsta and I must have felt the same vibe at roughly the same time.I heard about The Bees while listening to some digital music from my cable provider, and subsequently bought the album because of it's slick fusion of Jamaican Reggae, Brazilian Pop, Old-School Funk, and even sixties-American folk music, drawn in and perfected from their own influences on the Isle of Wight. These guys may be raw, but they are nonetheless experimentally-successful. After three consecutive listens to the album front to back, I say you could do much worse than to get hip to these new guys from England who definitely know how to groove, rock, scare, and intice you into their world of universal harmony. Combine ecclectic tendencies and a nice choice of instrumentation and vocalization, and you get a mainstay in modern pop culture.

As an evangelical christian I can tell you that you may find other books about the Revelation more interesting, specially dealing with the last days events, the tribulation, the rapture of the Church. None of this you will find in this book. I will highly recommend the Prophecy Study Bible if you are interested in the matter of escathology, or the study of the last events that will happen as prophesized in the Holy Scriptures. This poor Bishop don't even think of the Rapture of the Church. You need a better reading. This is a poor exposition of the Biblical Truth.I hioghly recommend:The Feasts Of The Lord God's Prophetic Calendar From Calvary To The KingdomNew Spirit-Filled Life Bible: Kingdom Equipping Through the Power of the Word (Bible Nkjv)The Theology of the Book of Revelation (New Testament Theology)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Better and more interesting than you would think.

I've grown up as a creationist, but as an adult have thought deeply about the implications of creation and evolution because our responsibilities to a Creator or Evolver may be different. McLaren invites us to consider an alternative that the modern traditional Western church would decry as heresy, and therein lies the value of this book.At no point does Scripture give us permission to say to God, \\"You must,\\" or \\"You may not.\\" It does not specify that it is a scientific textbook, as Western readers might surmise... so \\"The Story\\" gives us a possibility closer to the Eastern mindset, a provoking jolt that God might see his-story differently than we do. That he might have made things in his own way and that we have not yet grasped how that came about. I'm not convinced by the theory of evolution, but I was aware of my own evolving faith as I read.

By using funky American pop culture (knock-knock jokes, \\"Doggie in the Window,\\" etc.) as his jumping-off point, Sluyter manages to present enlightenment in a way that anyone can connect with. He writes with a wonderful openness that embraces Zen, Jesus, rock 'n' roll and Mad magazine in one big hug - yet he never goes New Age sloppy, but lays out the What's What of spiritual development with precision. A must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Mother Dean","review":"Dean Sluyter has an uncanny ability to make the mundane mystical. He takes phrases and songs, slows down time, and holds the words up to the sun turning them over in his hand and inside your mind to extract a much deeper meaning. His deconstruction of Row Row Row Your Boat is worth the price of admission alone. I am as college educated as the next guy and I was giggling like a monkey by the time I had completed the book. Then I gave it to a repairman, a friend of mine, mechanically a genius but completly unread, and he retured it the next morning at 7am because he 'just had to talk to somebody about it, about life, about meaning\\" and we had a conversation like philosophers over a cup of my horrible coffee. So I say again, Thank you Dean Sluyter. If you are ever in Newport Oregon please stop by.

Furthermore, they were quite painful in my ears the first several times I wore them and the mini-jack has a poor connection, often leaving me without sound in one ear.Do yourself a favor and spend the money to get a quality pair of headphones, particularly if you're looking to buy in-ear headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound at a great price","review":"I got an iPod shuffle as a gift, to use at the gym. The original earphones never fit my ears right, so they fell out all the time, and sounded tinny and distant. I read some reviews and got the Griffin EarThumps. The change was amazing. They fit perfectly--there are three rubber tips to chose the right size for your ear. And the sound has deep bass, crisp highs. Great sound for rock, R&B, Soul. They stay put, no more fidgeting around, and are very comfortable. They even come with a nice case that holds the Shuffle and Earphones. Great price, and the sound is terrific--at least thats how they sound at the gym!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Earbuds at Reasonable Price","review":"When faced with replacing my iPod earbuds I browsed the $50 and up options and just couldn't bring myself to shell out that much cash. I'm not an \\"audiophile,\\" so I wasn't too picky about the sound quality, but rather opted for something well designed with good sound. It comes with 3 sizes of silicone earbud covers which allow for the best fit. The earphones stay in place when walking and walking. The silicone creates a good suction to the ear which is ideal for active people. The sound quality is great too. Considering these are earbuds and not noise-canceling headphones, the overall quality is great. The cord is much more thin and soft than the iPod's earbuds and probably shouldn't be twisted or coiled when in storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick. These ruined my music with their awfulness.","review":"These are the worst headphones I have ever owned, and I go through about one set per year. The bass was AWFUL, as was the overall sound quality. They only sounded okay when the volume on my iPod was turned up all the way - something I wouldn't want to do to my hearing. The headphones that came with my iPod were of a far better quality than these ones.I wish I had spent 10 more dollars and bought a pair of Sonys...or basically any other headphones than these. Worst of all is that I can't return these, so I am out $20 AND I have to pay $30-40 more to get a decent pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even last me 2 weeks!","review":"Everything is great about this product, EXCEPT THE DURABILITY! Granted I use my ipod everyday and these headphones are around $10, but they didn't even last me a month. The quality of the wiring is horrible. The wiring that connects to the headphone jack just died out and I don't have sound anymore. They do however block out sound, but I am definitely not going to purchase another pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds fine, but shoddy construction","review":"This was my second pair of Griffin EarThumps. The first lasted about a year, before one of the wires frayed and I no longer got sound out of one side. I wasn't too perturbed since I only use them for jogging, and I figured that they were subject to a good deal of abuse. However, I wasn't thrilled enough to buy a second pair, at least not right away. One day, however, I saw them advertised on Amazon for $12.95 (since reduced to $10.95), so I thought, \\"What the heck? Why not give them one more shot?\\" I'm sorry I did. After only three or four uses, the sound went out on the left side. I know it's the earbuds and not the ipod, since other headphones work fine. The Griffin earbuds just don't seem to be made very well. If you plan to use them for jogging, you'd probably be better off looking somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for your buck","review":"I bought these a few months ago as a replacement set for my iPod. I was looking for something that would block out sound yet was still easily portable. I found both attributes in these. With the volume less than half up it blocked out all of the sound in a moving vehicle including conversation. The only problem I've had with them is that since the silicone has begun to really form to my ears, they tend to either wander out of the canals or get stuck in there. It's no real problem, though, so I'll keep using them until they just completely die. Definitely a great product and the best sound I've ever heard form earbuds."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better!","review":"What was Apple thinking with their standard earphones? I thought I had really small ears or something!These earphones from Griffen are a vast improvement. You do need to adjust your EQ though because the bass is quite heavy.I walk for exercise and these stayed put. I kept checking them and finally had to stop because they won't fall out easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"I was so pleased with these when I bought them! They worked great, good sound quality, and fit so comfortably in my ears. However the durability of these things are horrible, I had them for about 4 or 5 months and the frail wiring broke on one bud and I couldn't get any sound on one of the ear buds. I was so frustrated! I would not reccommend these for long term use. Buy some Apple In Ear Headphones or Bose headphones. I was trying to save money and these headphones failed to live long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fit/stop working quick","review":"I love the fit of these earthumbs, unfortunately, like the other reviewers, one of the earpieces stops working quickly.

Unfortunately, the last pair only lasted about 6 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"MULLETS R 4 KINGS","review":"When I first heard this album has a song called \\"I Want My Mullet Back\\", I laughed so hard I fell down the stairs, and gave myself an achy breaky pelvis.

The first was a fabric case that looked ragged quickly.I like:* Professional look* Magnetic clasp* Memory card holder section holds business cards nicelyI don't like:* Clip sometimes comes open and case slips off belt* Case design is open where stylus is -- stylus can slip outOverall, I'm very happy with this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I bought this case and found it unsatisfactory for use even at the relatively low price. It is made of very stiff bulky leather that adds a lot of weight and bulk to my otherwise sleek Palm TX. The double layer front cover to give simple web pocket storage for memory cards does not protect the cards from dirt and dammage and finially, the belt clip is ineffective. After only a few minutes seated in my vehicle it slid off my belt and luckly landed on the seat. Could just as easily landed on the street resulting in dammage to my PDA. I was offered 12% discount to buy more from the dealer but declined. Good idea - Bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really work with the E62-E61","review":"This thing is sitting in a drawer right now.It is too wide to accomodate the E62 I own which makes getting it out of the case impossible.

First of all, the case is a good fit for my AT&T; 8525 with a hard plastic shell. It's a snug fit, almost perfect. The problem is, if I put a single SD card with case in the web holder, the magnetic latch no longer snaps right in place, and when I do get it in place, it comes open far too easily in my opinion.The search continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time I lost data","review":"After a few years using flash drives this is the first time I lost huge amount of data.

Gives very thorough history on some very prolific serial killers. I recommend it for any fascinated with the subject of criminology or has an interest in psychiatry---zoning in on psychopathology.

His book does not try to be a definitive source on all serial killers, but does try to provide an over view to the world that some of these killers live in. His writing is thought provoking and brings to light many interesting statistics and facts about both serial killers and profilers. Definitely a great read for both the amateur as well as the professionals who may have to be searching for the killers. Also has a nice bonus chapter about surviving serial killer abductions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Overview","review":"Peter Vronksy's \\"Serial Killers\\" is a good overview of serial killers and what makes them tick. The book is filled with case studies of famous serial killers, as well as some thumbnail sketches of less famous killers. To be honest, I would have been more interested in reading about the lesser-known killers, as yet another retelling of Ted Bundy isn't really needed at this point. The first chapter of the book is fairly boring, filled with statistics and conjecture. The book picks up speed toward the middle and doesn't really slow down from then on out. My stomach turned at some of the descriptions of victims in the book, and I realized that perhaps I learned more about some of these killers and their deeds than I had wanted.A warning: there are some very graphic photos in the middle of the book that I now wish I hadn't seen as they are very explicit. You may want to skip the picture section if you are squeamish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"\\"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters\\" is a first rate account of serial killers.

Love the sliding rail system - real space saver. The only adjustment that I had to make was aligning the laser. The only fault that I found is that it is missing the cover on the back of the arm. So was the store display model (Hey, Hitachi, did you run out and decide to continue production anyway?). Not a big deal. I e-mailed Hitachi and am awaiting a response. This saw is comparable to saws costing 50% more - and it doesn't have the clumsy safety trigger (I dislike those things). At first I wasn't very thrilled about the vertical handle, but I'm finding it easier to use with either hand than the horizontal handle of other saws. All in all, a great saw. Would have rated it 5 stars if it had come with the back cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pop album!","review":"I have to admit I'm surprised at how good this album is. I had heard from a number of people who received advance copies that Pop Trash could be one of the year's real 'sleeper' hits, and after a few listens I'm convinced. Songs range from beautiful and somewhat haunting (\\"Someone Else Not Me\\") to almost whimsical (\\"Lava Lamp\\") to edgy and new (\\"Playing with Uranium\\"). There's a lot of breadth here, and a lot to like. The overall sound is unique and polished, the presentation professional. This is a CD that should appeal to almost anyone that really enjoys good, original music. A great pop album and one of the top 5 CDs I've bought in the last three years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as challenging as earlier work.","review":"I found this collection to be very superfacial, lacking a lot of the very challenging yet fun songs of their previous years. Apparently it didn't do very well because I've never heard a song from this album on the radio or seen a video -- maybe I just missed them?

In the meantime, Duran Duran keep putting out new music, and now Pop Trash is the cd of material I knew they could still had in them. I won't break down my favorites, but there are seven excellent tracks on this cd. (1,3,5,6,8,10,and 13) As I wasn't made aware it was being released until two days before (Who does their advertising! ), I also know that it won't find it's way onto the radio stations, because they still have the teeny-bopper label for some reason, and we just can't get enough of Britney, N'Sync, Backstreet, Aguilera, and every other horrid artist that has made me ignore the FM side of the dial for the last ten years.

Trash! I used to be a huge fan of theirs, but they have gone so far downhill (and OVER the hill) that I think they should cut their losses and split up! As for this particular album it only has 2 songs on it that are worth listening to. \\"Someone Else Not Me\\" which is a perfect breakup song, and \\"Playing With Uranium\\". The rest of the album is terrible! So I would say, save your money and don't even buy it because it's not worth it for just 2 songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop trash is not trash but it's no treasure either","review":"First I will say I am a Duran Duran fan from way back (1982). I still get chills when I crank \\"Come Undone\\" and \\"The Chauffer.\\" I bought Pop Trash on the day of it's release as I had waited over a year since seeing them live last summer (they performed Lava Lamp and Hellucinating Elvis). I really don't think their is anything good or original on this album. After taking so long to record it, it just falls flat. I thought it would grow on me but it's just plain boring. They have tons of b-sides better than this. Mendazaland (their previous album) was not that great either. Come on guys, three strikes you're out. Oh, and for a band who was always so into their album artwork, why did they reuse the \\"45 rmp\\" graphics idea again? Disappointed Durannie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Trash is what it is!

I give it 2 stars because they are Duran Duran...what is left of them....now with only (2) original members and John Taylor (who hasn't aged a day) gone Duran Duran should just put up their shoes and call it a day and commit themselves to the Shady Pines Rest Home, or start another band..........GRADE: D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Trash is Garbage","review":"Pop Trash is a very accurate name for this album as my CD is headed straight for the garbage. This release sounds more like a sophmoric effort than a well developed musical montage from an experienced band like Duran Duran.Although if you enjoyed the techno pop of Medazzaland, than you may get some enjoyment from this album. It incorporates this previous sound and peppers it with heavier guitar rifts and some goofy type of talk-singing. This works for some of thier songs, such as Last Day on Earth, but it doesn't cut it for others, like Hallucinating Elvis.All in all this is only for the die hards, and I am not sure how many are still out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"I am a HUGE Duran Duran fan, one who has been around consistently since 1983, but I absolutely cannot stand all but 3 tracks. Besides Hallucinating Elvis, Mars Meets Venus and Playing with Uranium, this album literally makes me cringe when I hear it. I feel terrible turning on them in this way but I have to be honest. It is obvious that Simon's heart wasn't in it, and the fact that John is missing is painfully clear. The sound is sloppy, uncoordinated, the vocals are sad and weak, and the music chaotic. Sorry Duran Duran, but thank goodness for the records that followed this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Trash is Duran Duran's Brilliant Swan Song","review":"Pop Trash is a terrific and diverse collection of pop and anti-pop songs that is a wonderful balance to their previous album, Medazzaland. Medazzaland was a work of genius, and DD were smart not to try and recreate it or compete with it. Instead, they returned to their roots, producing a collection of odd songs with pop potential but with an undercurrent of something deeper for the careful listener, similar to earlier works like Seven and the Ragged Tiger, Notorious, and Liberty. Highlights include: Hallucintatng Elvis, Lava Lamp, Mars Meets Venus, and Last Day on Earth. The Pop Trash Tour was possibly one of the most fun concerts I have ever been to. This was the last album for guitar genius Warren Cuccurullo. His contributions to this amazing band will be sadly missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"DURAN DELIVERS","review":"POP TRASH...WHAT AN INCREDIBLE ALBUM FROM ONE OF THE WORLD'S PREMIER POP GROUPS.

Such a great album, and still one of my favorites. Medazzaland was quite disappointing, but I was hoping Pop Trash would redeem them. It didn't. I was really pulling for them on this one! I think the main reason why they've taken a turn downhill is their loss of John Taylor in the band. This album isn't horrible. It's just not as good as I know they are.

I think this Japanese (Avex) version is the best and most collectable. I bought the Limited Edition version of this CD, with cool pink slipcase, on it's release last year, but this version (without the slipcase) is also worth getting. It has all the original 12 tracks, plus the superb 'Someone Else Not Me' sung in both French & Spanish, and also the superb and very strange 'Prototypes' segments! A collection of tracks produced and mixed by Warren & Nick (AKA, TV Mania). The best tracks on this album for me are; 'Playing Urainium', 'Hallucinating Elvis', 'Starting To Remember', 'Someone Else Not Me', 'Mars Meets Venus' and 'Lady Xanax', although all the tracks are excellent!!! If you like Duran Duran, you've got to get this superb version of 'Pop Trash'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Duran Duran for the 21st Century","review":"The new Duran Duran album should appeal to longtime fans, new fans or to people who don't know they're Duran Duran fans yet. It's innovative, edgy, contains luscious soundscapes, Lennon and Bowie influences abound, the lyrics are funny and also thoughtful; this album crackles with vibrant Rhodes keyboard, experimental guitar from Warren C., and singing from le Bon that covers just about every emotion. Buy it - it's a great album for the summerime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Trash is just the opposite.","review":"The thing I most like about Duran Duran is that they change with the times, but I can still tell that it's Duran Duran. They never sound like someone else, or their earlier selves, but they retain the core of what makes their music so great. The first time I listened to Pop Trash, I found some songs easy to hum along to, such as Tracks 1, 3, and 9. I absolutely love Lava Lamp. It kind of sounds 60s retro and it has an Indian flavor to it, yet it makes me want to dance. I also love Hallucinating Elvis--again, it's different. I have to thank Duran Duran for coming out with such a great album after such a long wait. It was well worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At it again","review":"Duran Duran has another winner.

There are some great efforts on it (Pop trash movie, Mars meets Venus, Somebody else not me) but the rest is not remarkable. It seems that they try to find a new style in a new kind of music, which David Bowie had made years before with Earthling. But unfortunately that was better than this one. I hope that Duran returns to his roots, the new wave and funky line and leaves this futuristic sillinness behind on their next album, cause it's not Duran Duran anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for this album to come out","review":"Well, I have to say that I went to a Duran Duran concert [inAugust 1999] and couldn't wait for their new album to come out. I have been a fan for many years. I was disappointed with the album though. I guess I was hoping the album would be more like the older ones. But I am sure many of their fans may like it just because it's been so long that a new cd came out. I did enjoy their concert though. They sang many of their older songs.

The first features Warren C playing some solid guitar unlike any I have heard on a Duran album. The latter song is quite like a John Lennon song (and in the best way possible).Other nuggets are \\"Hallucinating Elvis\\" and \\"Playing with Uranium\\". The songs are catchy and well produced.

More than once I changed television channels. However, a more greater authority than me urged me to stick with watching her inspite of my unwillingness. When she talked on the subject of spiritual warfare, via Battlefields of the Mind, she struck a homerun & touchdown with me. I needed to hear that message. I was so impressed I purchased the book and the DVD. She has the gift of not only great oratory, but a tremendous amount of common sense derived from hard fought experience which she is able to get across to her Middle Class audiences.

Plus, their outline of dselect is not very good. The book is over-priced and too small. I was better off with a distribution that came with a eight dollar magazine and it's 12 step installation. I even got it to function properly. After using this book and it's software, I ended up with way less than I wanted. Also, after running through the installation using this book, I ended up not being able to use windows because the lilo (Linux Loader, the boot-loader installed with linux) configuration file was extremely messed up with no option to load windows.

One thing I disliked about this books was that it was somethings confusing in story line. Otherwise I love the book. It kept moving and that is what I like to see happen. This is a good book for anyone wanting to get a little more information about how the 7 work together to get things done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, somewhat amusing, except for having no plot.","review":"Well, when I saw this at the bookstore, I jumped to buy it. When I found out Qilue of Daughter of the Drow was in it, I was thrilled. However, the rest was fairly bad. The part of Dove's story when she is disguised as a drow is amusing, and I find her drow persona, Iylinvyx Nrel'tabra, the best character in the book. Qilue's story disappointed me, as she is nothing like she seems in DOTD. The Simbul's story was also fairly amusing, but the sisters' indestructablity grates on my nerves. There were some fairly random scenes in this book that, for all I could figure, had nothing to do with the so-called plot. And as for that, I had to dig very hard to find it. There just wasn't much of a rising action. *Shrugs* But, learning about the sisters I didn't know was fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldnt even \\"start\\" it.","review":"I managed to read about 15 pages of this book.

The story builds up just fine, but doesn't fit at all with the ending. As a matter of fact. You could burn the last 20 pages and not miss the ending at all. What's there is no good. If it was meant to be a big surprise they at least need to put a little foundation in there to support it. And the cover summary isn't even really accurate. It almost feels like someone rewrote the ending and changed up a couple of characters a'la'gatekeeper or something. Wonderful book if you skip the ending, and Ed Greenwood has had some outstanding novels to date. So, for the fan, worth the buy. For someone looking at Greenwood for the first time, go buy Cormyr or even the Elminster stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"I wish I'd read most of the reviews here before picking up this book. I wanted more on the relationships between the sisters, but instead we get one or two at a time. It's not a series of short stories, it's one long novel with different points of view (all strikingly similar.)Frankly, I've only read one other Ed Greenwood novel, where Elminster is in Myth Drannor, because I'm nuts for the history of elves. I disliked his portrayal of elves in that novel, and I dislike his portrayal of people in this novel. Isn't there ONE person in the Realms who can look at the Sisters and not think about sex??This does it. From now on, only Elaine Cunningham stories for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed Greenwood's descent into senility","review":"I'm truly sorry to report this, but this is easily the worst book I have ever read, especially when you consider that I loved all of his other books. Spellfire was his best, dwarfing all his other works, but this book seemed to be written by a child, with seven uninteresting plotlines pasted together with flour and water rather than crazy glue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silverfall Not for the Newcomer","review":"The history of the seven sisters led me to buy this book, and I had high hopes of discovering the mystery, and attraction that surrounds them. The book was a muddled disappointment, and I was just happy to be finished with it. The story immediately grabbed me, but then i am a sucker for the Drow. The thought of Drow infiltrating, and attempting to take over a town through magical guises was original. Sadly the story gets bogged down in too many characters, and an over abundance in the claok-and-dagger. The ending I thought fell flat, and left me very disappointed in the resolution of the story. If you are a Greenwood fan then my review is moot, but if you are a first timer to the words of the Forgotten Realms. Please pick another book, and not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the kids","review":"Childish movie that kids will like.

His daugter and her two boy friends, (not boyfriends) decide to steal a lot of money from a bank that her mother works for.

How in the world could a parent allow their child to rob a bank and not punish that child? Even more - how could a parent watch this movie with their child and then recommend it? The absurdity of that is mind boggling.I'll admit that there are fine acting performances here.

Are we to believe that experienced, professional police officers driving high-powered squad cars cannot apprehend a couple bratty children driving go-carts down a city street? Come on, give the cops a break here. Those kids would have been nailed in about five minutes.

Not only from the \\"large corporate entity\\", but they also lie to one another. They pull dangerous stunts and run from police riding go-carts on city streets at night. In the big wrap-up, they get caught. Here I am waiting for the kids to learn that what they did was wrong. The mom barely shames them and then lies to police to get them out of trouble.

The hood covering is thick and very durable. No signs of wear that I can see from every day commuter use and a few long distance bicycle camping trips on a fully loaded bike. The lever ratio is also perfect for my cantilever brakes. Wonderful product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for an older bike","review":"I got these for my 1987 Cannondale SR400 road bike, which had very old-style, small brake levers and hoods. They were from a day when \\"on the hoods\\" was not a viable riding position for the riders hands.Fast forward to today - all my bike needed was these Origin8 brake levers, along with their wider, longer, and well-padded hoods. The installation was straight-forward with only basic hand-tools.The result is very good. I can comfortably ride on the hoods now, and the levers feel and operate very nicely. These parts have a high-end feel to them that belies the fairly low price.

And EMI is to blame. They filtered the original tapes to get rid of the 1930s-noise, and en passant they ruined the cello sound. The same recordings are available on Pearl, unfiltered, and then you can hear from the warmth and wealth of colors in his playing that Casals really was the greatest of cello players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding (of course), but sound quality a big minus","review":"In the words of Rostropovich himself, Casals is unequalled when it comes to virtuosity. This is felt throughout this recording.I am still having a hard time with the sound quality of this CD though. Not much to expect from a recording done in 1936-1939 I guess. But it still bugs me when listening, and quite frankly this only makes me prefer other versions.What I really recommend: get this edition, \\"the\\" original one. But also get on EMI Classics Mstislav Rostropovich's version. Rostropovich's play is very close to Casals'; but the 1991 recording will give you outstanding sound quality on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Recording of the Bach Cello Suites","review":"This has to be one of the worst recordings of the Bach Cello Suites on the market.

However, the over all style is on this recording is very good, but is overshadowed by the intonation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Celeste Bradley creates unforgettable characters and wonderful plots, and yes, great love scenes, which I'm sure isn't a comfortable process for an author. Marcus is a wonderful hero (spy)in this book (in his secondary role in Dane's story, he was rather meak and almost a fop, in my opinion) but here he is all man, handsome, funny and romantic. Just a great story. Julia was great, although I thought her visit to Clara should have been done differently. There was no reason Julia had to enter Clara's house as she did, but I'll admit, I loved the way Dalton came to his wife's aid - in his usual romantic way.As usual, the addition of the other Royal Four members was wonderful; the author keeps their unique personalities in perspective. As I said, only Marcus Ramsay seemed different in his own story (a good thing) than he did in Dane's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godiva not Hersheys","review":"As a reader, I have always approached this genre as my brain chocolate; wonderful for the soul, not to be considered nutritious. When I want an amazing ride through never-never land, I read Celeste Bradley.

I won't go into the plot line, since you can read it here on the page and every other review gives you more than enough information.

This kind of prose tends to occur after a few chapters (and character introductions) but I am sure it helps sell books with it so early on.I did not love the \\"hero\\" considering in the beginning he was pretty anti-female and then later after a few days of passion he then turns on the \\"heroine\\" for selfish gain.

Some reviewers have complained that the books are becoming too character-driven. I don't mind that, except that the characters themselves are so shallow. The first rule of good writing -- show don't tell -- is violated on almost every page of this tedious book.I enjoyed Left Behind and have read the others as they were published out of curiosity.

These books display the realism, intensity and suspense that make for incredibly exciting and unforgettable stories. The Left Behind Series, on the other hand, peaks the reader's interest, but doesn't seem the slightest bit realistic.

Even my 13-year-old sister has gotten excited about end times and can see how present activities only emphasize the soon return of Christ for his people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part 4, shopworn and formulaic.","review":"My big quibble with Soul Harvest was just how closely it followed the event outline of Nicolae. Buck saves Chloe from harm, then runs off to save someone else. Meanwhile Rayford continues to spy on Nicolae and seek out the newly saved. The intrigue heats up and the nastier bits of the tribulation are yet to come, but did Jenkins have to gloss over plagues in mere paragraphs? And just how long is he going to drag these events out? Questions I would not be asking if he spent more time developing three dimensional and complex characters to inhabit this hellish world. I wasn't exactly bored with the novel, but I was far from impressed. I'll get around to reading part 5 someday, but I'm rapidly loosing interest in this seemingly endless series since it obviously has nothing for its characters to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is a great book. It's inspiring for all. Christians and nonbelievers alike should read this book as well as all the Left Behind books. It helps explain scriptures and gives an insight to what is to come after the rapture of the Church. Read it, study it, and pray for all those who could be left behind and the hardships they may have to encounter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith in What?","review":"This fourth book in the best-selling Left Behind series allows readers to watch the willful fracas between the evil incarnate Nicolae Carpathia and newly founded followers of Christ. Trib Forcers Rayford Steele and Buck Williams get alienated during the world cataclysm. As Rayford chauffeurs Carpathia around his empire, thousands of people begin to hunger for the Truth that continues to defy walls and boundaries. Two prophetic witnesses at the Wailing Wall stir faith for all the new followers. Chaos fervently builds as the world learns about an evil called the Antichrist.This was a book I reviewed for Tyndale House Publishers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add this to list of Sunday School material","review":"This is an o.k. book/series . . . but only if you are looking for material for you elemantary age sunday school class. Why did they bother to release a series of these books specifically for kids when this series fits that age group so well already. The basic story line, the writing style, and the unrealistic human concepts in this book are perfect for children, as they should be the only people who actually believe this garbage. Don't get me wrong, the basic message here is the truth. The Rapture and the Tribulation Period events that may occur at any time in the near future. Beyond that, however, very little in this book is plausible, let alone realistic. I give it an \\"A\\" for concept, and an \\"F-\\" for everything else. Unfortunately, that averages out into a big ol' whomppin \\"F\\" in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The word is good, the story is pathetic","review":"Just because a book such as this one offers teachings and wisdom toward what we find in Revelation, it doesn't automatically make it a good book. The writing is on a grammer school level, and the storyline is so weak, I wouldn't want to rest my coffee on it. It's sad, b/c had this been a well written work, this series could have helped many more people find their way than it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow.","review":"Not as interesting as the others. I find myself wanting the series to hurry up and get over with, and not because I'm interested in spending time with the characters. It's just getting tedious, and I want to be put out of my misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor plot and poor writing plus disappointing ending","review":"It is almost as if the authors were rushing to meet a publishing deadline rather than writing a book that compares with the first three in the series. I kept reading hoping that the quality would improve only to be rewarded with several biblical calamities jamed into a few paragraphs - almost like the authors said \\"oh, and this happened too but it is not that important to the storyline so we'll just throw it in and go on\\". I also agree with several of the other reviewers - if this was a realistic view of what might happen the Tribulation Force members would all be long gone. Very disappointing, however I am holding out hope for the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed Left Behind, ripped through Tribulation Force and loved Nicolae. But, I was greatly disappointed with the shoddy research that went into this book. It is shallow and quickly written with little believabilty. If you want the high points e-mail me. There are only a few. I hope Lahaye and Jenkins take more time and do a better job on their next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just die already.","review":"It's annoying how long this series is dragging out. Over and over I wonder, \\"When is Carpathia just going to shoot them?\\" It's like the villains in James Bond movies who could just shoot Bond, but end up talking on and on about their plans, allowing Bond the opportunity to escape. Well, this series is just rambling on and on, and if there was any semblance of realism in it, one third of the protagonists would be dead by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap.","review":"Plastic characters. No plot development, except for the obligatory cataclysm at the end of the book. Wide margins and huge fonts. Can we say - there's nothing here?I heard that this series was supposed to only be a trilogy, but they decided to stretch it out to seven volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Padded fluff.","review":"In high school or college, if you were writing a term paper and didn't have enough to say to fill a minimum page length, what did you do? Use a bigger font, triple spacing and wider margins. Well, that's exactly what the authors did here. You can tell just by looking on the pages that this book should only have been about 200 pages long, and the publisher just formatted it with as few words as possible on a page in order to make the book big, long and expensive. They know they have a captive audience anyway, so never mind if there isn't enough material here to really fill a book.Too bad the authors have already committed to a seven-book series. So little goes on in this book (and the whole series) that they probably could have done the job in three tightly-edited books of half the length. But then they wouldn't make as much money, would they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give this zero stars, if I could","review":"All of the Left Behind books are poorly written, have plastic, stereotypical characters and fail to address any deep moral or religious questions. The popularity of these books just proves what an underserved market there is for Christian fiction--especially Christian thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are worth it!","review":"I have read each book in the \\"Left Behind\\" series. I am an avid believer in the Bible and that it is the inspired word of God. I have come to believe that the \\"Left Behind\\" series, (though it's characters are fictional, it's foundation is Biblical,) is an \\"INSPIRED\\" writting. I would highly recommend this series to anyone, believer or not, who is in search of the truth about how things are to be in the end times. If, like myself you have ever read the book of Revelations but did not understand it, this series will bring what you have read to light. If you read this series with an open mind and a searching heart, it will inspire you too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many emotions and decisions to be made","review":"To realize what the book of Revelation is telling you about the 7 seals and 7 trumpets I found myself hoping and praying with the characters as they look for their loved ones and felt their emotions throughout the book. Again, this book brings the writings of John the Revelator to life and easier to understand his writings. Another in this series that makes you glad you will not have to go through this period of time if you are truly saved and living as Christ-like as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best books ever","review":"i am 13 years old and i am a christian and these books have all the truth .

This book, unfortunately, lacks both almost entirely. Even though this is a must-read for those that are intent on finishing the series, if this book stood on it's own I would recommend that the reader spend that money on something more worthy of his/her time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribulation perils advance at a snails pace.","review":"I really liked Left Behind, but the subsequent books in the series are definitely lagging. Although there is lots of action in Soul Harvest, I found the plot simple. Worse it moves at a ponderous pace. There was less biblical support for this book than prior efforts. The biggest disappointment is the lack of closure at the ending. You could skip this book and probably not miss anything in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to be a naysayer, but face it - it's slow.","review":"The pace has definitely slowed down, and the enthusiasm is fading. The series started off okay, but the tediousness of the searches went on and on for hundreds of pages, and it could have been shortened a lot. Not that I'm against a longer read, but for God's sake, use the pages wisely! If the authors want to have 400-page novels in a multi-volume series, they ought to spend much more of their material on character development, like Dostoyevski and Tolstoy do, not on mindless dialogue that feels like filler. They're slipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOST BORING IN THE SERIES","review":"Please don't get me wrong, I love this series and it is what got me into reading the Bible after a 25 year lapse! For that, I am extremely grateful and I will continue to read this series, HOWEVER. I am sorry to say, I found this book very boring. Most of it consists of a search conducted by Rayford and Buck for their loved ones lost in the Wrath of the Lamb earthquake. It seemed to me the series had reached a standstill, and I was bored. The ostensibly \\"thrilling\\" parts, like Buck's rescue of Chloe from the hospital left me cold, wanting more interpretation of Scripture, and less \\"thrills\\". I wish the authors would get back on track, and quit wasting my time and money. I feel like this book was just a holding pattern to keep me interested while they write something really worthwhile and instructional. Please, Tim and Jerry, more Bible and less \\"thrills\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Necessary to read for the series, but reading was boring.","review":"This book could have been written in one third the space it actually took up. Plot dragged and repeated far too many scenes from the previous books - seemingly to fill the required number of pages. I highly respect these two authors and hope they develope enough plot to 'fill the pages' of the next in the series. Yes, of course I'll buy it and give them another chance. Can't seem to find my other books in the series though... they are being passed around continuously to non-believers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding, technically impossible; read the Bible instead.","review":"The series is tediously strung out. A short story would adequately entertain and present the plot and character development in Soul Harvest. Left Behind is vastly more engaging with its novel plot's imaginative and believeable interpretation of the End Times. Hopefully, it will reach a wide audience. If you like the series, read them all, but be prepared for exasperatingly overdrawn scenes and boredom as the series drags on. The real turn-off in all the books is the authors' absolute lack of any technical understanding of how things work. The continued functioning of the world after such widespread catastrophic destruction is ludicrous. The impossibility of it all is beyond any grace I could extend while wading through the nonsense to glean what little story there is in Soul Harvest. I gave up. The book's too silly. Invest your time reading the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah","review":"Get it over with already. I don't mind it when authors stretch out a book/series a little but only if the authors stretch it using interesting filler (character backgrounds, cultural quirks, tons of detail) but these guys are wasting too much time with drivel. Really smelly gooey stinky drivel. Oh wait, I just described the book. This series was a great idea, no doubt about it. It has a solid message and started off fairly strong. It could have been not only a classic piece of literature, but also a marvelous tool for converting many people missing Christ. Oh well, at least they're trying. Apparently not too hard though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wasted effort","review":"If you're reading the series, read the first few pages and the last few pages of this book and skip the rest. Move on to book 5. You won't miss a thing.It seems the authors are trying to stretch this series for far more than it's worth. None of the books are terribly well written but this was the worst by far. The story line crawls along though there is almost no character development through this installment.This book should have been a chapter in the preceeding or subsequent books in the series. Usually a paragraph was enough to get me to sleep each night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy and laughable.","review":"The lame plot in this series is just pathetic. Here's an example: The Antichrist develops a worldwide cell phone network run by solar power. It's called Cellular Solar, or Cell-Sol for short. Get it? \\"Sell soul.\\" Ha, ha, very funny.If that's the best attempt at humor LaHaye and Jenkins can come up with, spare us the rest of the series and just wrap it up now. Don't prolong our agony. Just nuke the world already and get it over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's it, I can't take it anymore.","review":"It seems to me that every book following \\"Left Behind\\" is merely a repitition. I found this book so hard to get into, I had to force myself to finish it. Why are all these great reviews coming forward?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Here are my top ten reasons why I would not recommend this book: 1. If the war broke out and there were serious earthquakes, would you report to a minimum wage job? ( the clerk at the car rental) 2. Most of the world population is dead or dying but people manage to hang out online. 3. Chicago experiences nature at its worse yet, these guys still manage to drive to Milwaukee. ( I can't even get around in Chicago when we have a snowstorm or a Bears game ) 4. The women are M.I.A. in most of the novel. 5. The women are either bad, dumb or obedient. 6. The female characters are undeveloped. 7. The first half of the story drags. 8. This book slams Catholics. 9. The anti-christ is scary if you think a corporate CEO is scary. 10. The ending was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but needs more detail","review":"This series has a lot of action in it and suspense centering around the Tribulation. I enjoyed this book due to the suspense level it had in it. Searching for their loved ones...Buck and Rayford start becoming more of a nuisance to the Antichrist. Carpathia is finally losing his patience toward the end of the novel with the prophecies in Revelation becoming fulfilled. However...one disappointing factor to this work was little detail and not much time spent on the beginning of the Trumpet Judgements...especially the second and third ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slower than the previous books, a little confusing","review":"This book is not quite up to par with the other books in the series. It reads slower and is more confusing because of the jumping around.Still conforms to Revelations."},{"rating":"1","title":"The authors sell their souls to harvest some cash.","review":"While I'm not one to rank the Left Behind series among my alltime favorites, it has been an enjoyable read. Until now, that is.Soul Harvest is a disappointing filler that seems more an effort to cash in on the series' overall success than an integral part of the story. Whether or not the authors planned to expand the series to 7 books from the start I don't know, but it would appear that they have decided to take a good thing too far. More time and dialogue goes into deciding whether or not to open the briefcase of a dead man than the anti-climactic judgements of God rained down upon the earth. Where I put down Nicholae eager to devour the next installment, after finishing Soul Harvest I feel empty, a little cheated and only mildly curious about what comes next."},{"rating":"1","title":"When is anything ever going to happen?","review":"The series was based on an intriguing topic, but the author took so disgustingly long to say anything the only thing left in the series was suspense, and the only suspense was: WHEN IS ANYTHING EVER GOING TO HAPPEN??"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Indwelling","review":"This is the 7th book I've read in this series. It is hands-down, the best-imaginable way to happily endure an otherwise unsufferable 40 minutes on an exercise bike. Or a tiresome day in airplanes with bad air. It is well-paced and well-written. The four books I have read concurrent with this series were by Robert McNamara, Edward Said, Jamling Norgay and Thomas Gold, so I frankly object to reviews I've read that suggest these books are written for those with an 8th grade intelligence levels. They are exceptionally entertaining - the ultimate escape from a tedious situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Love the whole left behind series! This book was used and showed it, but the price reflected that, and I just wanted to read it, not display it in public...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scripturally accurate, fast paced and thought provoking","review":"I found Soul Harvest to be engaging and very riveting. The ideas and mysteries presented made you want to move along and see what was to come next. The writing style, as with the entire series, is open and very easy to read. To me, accuracy in Scripture is necessary, and I believe LeHaye and Jenkins have succeeded. I recommend this book and all the books of the series to anyone who is truly interested in the end times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for some more trumpet blasts!","review":"This series of books has been so inspiring to me. How comforting it is to know that my hope is secure in Christ Jesus, and that I don't have to worry about the tribulation. However, it should also spur us on as Christians to witness to others and share the gift that has been so freely given to us. I encourage you all to think about things in terms of eternity. The friendships that you have matter nothing if you are unwilling to share Christ with those around you. Pray for boldness and conviction in spreading the Good News. May God bless you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent set of books","review":"This set of books by Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins is one of the best sets of books that I have read in a long time. My wife and parents also love the series and it seems that none of us can hardly wait for the next one in series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another slow one....","review":"Like all the other Left Behind books, \\"Soul Harvest\\" is 25 pages worth of plot dragged out into a full lenght novel (in order to make it more books so as to make more money, if you ask me). Like the other books, the characters are running around, looking for eachother, trying to find new converts and giving lengthy moral preachings. Towards the end there's a meteor approaching Earth. This could have been spectacular, but it goes nowhere, and then the book is over.If you're looking for a boring book, you can trust LaHaye and Jenkins to churn them out because they know millions of \\"born again\\" Christians will pay them to do so. If you want to read a better book, read anything else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are there all these 5 star ratings?","review":"This series should have been written in 2 or 3 books. The authors repeat the same tales over and over! How many people does Ray have to tell about his \\"almost\\" infidelity? I have begged a friend to tell me what happens. I am interested in the outcome, but I just don't think I can take any more of these books. Seems like the authors are filling up space to make money on more books. If you are smart, you will never read the first one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE FICTION","review":"Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t.

I have the hardest time putting it down because you are so anxious to find out what is going to happen next. I think this book was the most exciting and suspensful so far of the series. I can not wait until the next one comes out for sale which I presume will be any day now. They are being passed along to friends and family to read. Not only for entertainment but for a wake up call as to what will be happening very shortly. Thanks for this great series. I love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the last 3, but still worthwhile","review":"I read this book in one siting. Compared with the previous books, it was \\"lacking\\", but it is also a necessary link. On the whole, the series has been worthwile (and an excellent read.)

The prophesied global wide earthquake has occurred and both Rayford Steele and Buck Williams are searching for their wives and their pastor Bruce. Devastation is everywhere they look yet God is filling their spiritual needs by way of new converts and by Tsion Ben-Judah's teaching.

I've enjoyed all six books in the series and can't wait for the seventh one to come out. If you ever tried to interpret the book of Revelations, this could be it! I highly recommend this book to everyone (along with the first three). They're very exciting (and sometimes very scary!).

Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins are wonderful authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"My thoughts on the Left Behind series","review":"I think that it is a wonderfully intertaining book series. Though most people take this stuff very seriously. I think the characters are wonderful and the story is very well written. The only thing is that at the end of a book it always leaves you on a cliffhanger. Oh well, I guess thats what makes the books so entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one of the awesome books in a series you have to read!","review":"Soul Harvest along with all of the others is written so well that you actually FEEL that you are there. It's SO real. Before I read these books, I really never knew anything about the last days. Everyone of these books helped me understand about the end times and that I really need to be ready. This series tells the unbelieving story of 4 people who are left behind and realize they were missing something. As they go on through the judgements and natural phenomenons prophecied in the Bible they you realize what a God we have. They bring more people to Christ and live only in the faith that God is omnipotent and reigning over everything. It's a series you MUST read! They are awesome!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, transparent melodrama","review":"What a waste of time.

I could not put them down. I looked to see if any new ones had come out yet and read all the reviews. To some of you I say right on and remember that this is how it could be. To others I say, this is a story and though the authors may have taken some liberties it still places biblical teachings in the story. To others I say get saved and you might have a different view. The global point to all this is to boost Christian spirits to have a closer walk with God (PRAYER). It is also a tool that can be used to get non-believers thinking. If just one person excepts Jesus Christ as their savior due to this book in some way is it not worth it all? For by grace are we saved through faith!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The series has turned into kids' books","review":"The series started out very well, but with each new addition it has gotten weaker and weaker. The writing level has recessed to the point of a kid book. I was very dissapointed with Nicolae, yet decided to check Soul Harvest out just to see if I could get a little closure. I'm almost sad to say that Soul Harvest was the first book I never bothered to finish. Poorly written, it jumps from topic to topic, ignores some important issues, and spends way too much time on issues with no bearing. Am I disappointed? Yes, but only b/c I let myself get my hopes up prematurely.

It is of my opinion that this \\"Left Behind\\" book series is extremely informative to the teachings of the Bible book of Revelations & some of the prophecies from Nostradamous. Yes, the characters are NOT real... however, the contents, and the predictions are biblical and VERY REAL. Tim & Jerry just helped clarify the deep meaning for those of us who want to see, to become more watchful, and those of us who are listening, the ability to hear. Jesus uses all the right people, all the right tools, and at just the right moment - to open the eyes of His family. Now, the choice is yours... Do you want to be a part of His Kingdom? Especially after reading in these series of what lies ahead? They've left no room for mis-interpretation. Pick up a Bible and read in Revelations. Tim & Jerry aren't sugar coating it!

I must say that I was very disappointed with the story of Soul Harvest. 400 pages were spent with no major events. (except the sign on the foreheads, that was cool). The search for Chloe and Amanda way to long. What I could not understand is how could the book end the way it did. The authors dribble about not much for 400 pages and then conclude 3 major events in the last chapter (2 major events in just 2 pages). I would rather have been hanging with the book ending just before the first meteor hit. So much was tied in the last few pages that it was completely unbelievable. Then it ends with Rayford and Nichloae talking as though its business as usual. (Come on guys I know you can do better then this. ) I will continue to follow the story but I can not recommend \\"Soul Harvest\\"Roger Saurage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, slow, and WAY too preachy.","review":"I've long been enamored with apocalyptic literature; something about a world slowly dying simply captivates my interest. So I was excited to hear of the Left Behind series.The problem, however, is that the series gradually turns into more of an evangelizing text than a quality novel. Long, boring religious asides take up pages at a time while major apocalyptic events are expressed in merely a few paragraphs. Three trumpet judgements seemed to breeze through in mere pages.While I enjoyed the first three books of the series, Soul Harvest seems to be sending it down a slippery slope, degenerating into a long religious tract. At the moment, I am reading Apollyon (book #5), and find it just as slow paced. However, I continue to read in hopes that it will pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting stories but poorly written","review":"So far I've read the first four books of the series and have found the story lines very enjoyable. My only regret is that the books are very poorly written. The writing in Left Behind was so awful, I almost didn't finish it. As an example of this poor writing, it took four books before we are given a description of what Chloe actually looks like. However, if you are not looking for great written works of fiction you should find that the story lines and chase scenes are quite exciting and I am looking forward to completing the series. As far as those who want to debate prophecy, none of us really know exactly what will happen so it is no need to take the authors interpretations so seriously. I am reading the stories strictly as fiction with the hope that I gain a little insight and understanding to some of the more difficult passages of Bible prophecy."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorely disappointing . . .","review":"The only readers who will come away satisfied with this series (I quit halfway through \\"Soul Harvest\\") are fundamentalist who can't get enough of the same ol' fire and brimstone.

There are vastly more exciting and fearsome novels on the subject of The Last Day--not the least of which is the novel by the same name--\\"The Last Day.\\" If you have the mental wherewithal for a really scary spiritual ride, \\"The Last Day\\" delivers a story of unsurpassed suspense and controversy. If you just like to sit back and veg out, stick with this juvenile \\"Left Behind\\" stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sloooooooooooooooow...","review":"This book just drags on and on. Buck's search for Chloe could have been handled in a fraction of the time.One huge gripe, which represents incredibly poor writing, is the name changes used to refer to one character. Ken Ritz is both referred to as Ken and Ritz, and not just in dialogue either. One rule of good writing is to ALWAYS refer to your character by one name. You wouldn't refer to a mother as Jane, mum, mother and ma in the one book.Still, the book can be quite entertaining if you know what's coming next, which you would because it's been mentioned enough in the books.

Yes, the message is good, however, the book itself is horrible. Sophomoric writing, implausible characters, completely unrealistic story-line (if you can even call it a story-line) and absolute tedium.

Boy was I wrong. This saw is great! Lots of power, easy to use, came almost set up out of the box. I did not have any troubles with broken pieces as others have reported (maybe they have got that fixed). The fence is a little short when flipped open to do bevel cuts but that should be ok since the double bevel will allow you to lay pieces flat while cutting instead of upright. The only other things about the saw is to make sure to get a nice 60 or more tooth blade and probably a stand when buying. The stands will save you space unless you have a huge work area and most have extendable supports which you will need with this saw unless you are cutting something shorter than 2'.

I watched every season of Hunter when it first aired on TV, and am proud to welcome this latest addition into my collection. Of all the seasons of Hunter, this is my favorite. There were some great storylines, and the increased role of the Captain made for some conflict and daring policework on behalf of Rick and DeeDee. There's also a lot of great music on this season, and we see the story unfold of what happened to DeeDee's husband. It is unfortunate this is where the boxed releases of Hunter ends. The only criticism I have is that the discs are two-sided, and sometimes that means they skip or stop playing. This is a must-see season for all devoted Hunter fans. It's also great for people who are fans of good, gritty cop shows. If you are a fan of LA-based cop shows, there is a good new show, Southland, that might give fill your need.

Two things sum up my reaction to this book: a immediate desire upon finishing the book to write the author and tell him how much I enjoyed reading it; and the feeling of kinship I had when I read one of the included quotes - one that I want on my tombstone when the time should come.\\"I have always imagined that Paradise will be a sort of library.\\" -Jorge Luis Borges"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Body in the Library (Miss Marple Mysteries)","review":"As usual, Agatha Christie is great in her telling of the story and the suspense of finding out who-done-it!

My suspicions proved correct.I'm not sure why ITV felt the need to change the original ending. Agatha Christie's is better and far more credible.I know she has her detractors, but I still think her plots are far cleverer than people give her credit for. With its twists and turns, its subplots, mazes and red herrings, The Body in the Library is up there with the best of Mrs Christie.The Night of Harrison Monk's Death: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 1 (Volume 1)Pandora's Box: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 2 (Volume 2)A Game of Cat and Mouse: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 3 (Volume 3)April (Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 4)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Marple At Her Best","review":"Miss Marple was on track in this one, I loved the visiting to the hotel and Miss Marple interaction with the cast of characters.

Her voices for the characters are different enough so that you know who's speaking, but not at all overdone. It's quite amazing that she can believably personify so many characters of varying ages, genders, and classes.As for the story, it is classic Christie. Even though it takes place in a very different world from the present one, you care about the characters and what they're going through. It's always fun to guess at the murderer as the story goes along, but Christie once again manages to come up with a surprising ending.Excellent entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow reading","review":"this book has a slow start and i am bored. there has been nothing exciting happen in the first 75 pages so I quit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining addition to this fun series!","review":"I have been following this series with a lot of excitment.

As the cops are called so is the old detective, Miss Marple. again she catches the murderer i thought was innocent. I enjoy her so much, especially the way she trappes the killers in mental games to make them slip. In this book she does it and the murder doesn't know what is coming. I like her alot better then Mr.Hercule Poriot. that is my opinion. it is great to see a women solve a crime once in a while. This is a great book for just about any age, especially those interested in murder mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOK THAT IMITATES LIFE","review":"Other readers have criticized this book as being boring or lax in the action department. However, I think that Dame Agatha didn't go out to lunch in this one--she just wrote a book that falls in closely to real life.I have been a detective for 11 years and I can tell you that not every homicide has cutting edge action. There are tiresome investigations, questioning, dead-end leads, and many more things that would lull any human to sleep. Christie must have known that sometimes things aren't that interesting and can't always be some cop and robber chase scene. Miss Marple is merely taking things slowly (as she should--she's not young anymore) and gathering the evidence prudently.Perhaps Christie really did have a dry spell and this was the result of it. She may not have been trying to make a realistic book. In any event, the fact is this book is realistic, by chance or purpose it matters not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Page after page of shallow character development would be tolerable if the characters weren't so utterly boring.Not a typical Christie yarn. Very little development of the mystery - except for page after page of people who aren't Miss Marple speculating. No puzzles to unravel. Just endless details about these boring characters until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boaring","review":"This book was the first Agatha Christie book I read, and I thought it was boaring.

I seemed to recall I used to like Agatha Christie, but that was a long time ago, back when I was...younger.

Of course, Agatha Christie does not need any additional praise from humble me to boost her reputation as an unparallelled author of mysteries. In this book, the corpse of a young woman is found in the library of Gossington Hall, the home of a well-to-do colonel and his wife. Miss Marple, in conjunction with the police, sets out to investigate. She comes upon many discoveries, and it can be seen that many parties benefit from the death of the woman in the library and/or have the opportunity to kill her. As the investigations progress, a possibly related incident occurs: a car burned to shrapnel in a neighboring region. Miss Marple, of course, with her impeccable investigative prowess and sharp eye for detail, solves the mystery methodically and impressively. The outcome is dazzling and this book is a great read for all mystery-lovers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Marple is always a good one to read.","review":"I confess to absolutely loving Dame Agatha's Miss Marple books. I suppose I find the coziness of them soothing. I enjoyed this one because of the presence of Col. & Mrs. Bantry but it was not quite up to par with most of her others. Miss Marple's character becomes more rounded as we see her interact with her friends.

Miss Marple is right in the midst of all the action.

Nothing really much to think of, I called it a spaghetti prison flick. The first thing you hear when the movie starts, is a horrible song, where a woman sings that she was \\"born in the sunlight, born in the sun\\". They play this song over and over during the film, and it drives you crazy. I don't know if they were trying to promote this song for distribution? Movie not much to rave about, except when Mercedes McCambridge has the hots for Herbert Lom, when he visits the prison, she treats him like a God, dressing up in her sexy garments (when she steps into the room you will see, she looks ghastly) hoping he will lay her. Of course he doesn't and she is frustrated. I just bought it for my prison film collection.

The inserted footage is merely that inserted. I think the inserted footage came from a fifth generation bootleg VHS. This film is junk. I also am really shocked at amazon carrying porn, and also I think Blue Undergound are actually breaking the law because this film is sold in all 50 states. There are many communities, locales, areas and states where adult material is specifically prohibited by law. Even if this is 35 year old porn - it is still porn.

I know that Luciana has never made any good film with the sole exception of Thunderball and maybe other two or three you may consider average. O.K. Luciana is beautiful and that's all she needs, but beware, this film was directed by Jess Franco. This guy made terrible boring films no matter who is in the cast and 99 women is not the exception. You will never get anything from a Jess Franco's film. There are no thrills, no good stories, no sexy scenes (he always cheats with what he promises in this aspect), the title song is hideous and Luciana is no more than 3 minutes in this movie and the rest of it... stinks¡ Nothing is plausible or at least logic.

I had previous shortcomings with music advice but it was minor, specially considering I do tend to like everything I listen to. On the other hand, spending over an hour watching a painfully slow, randomly acted, wildly scripted piece of film does seem to take its toll. It sure did in my case. I can't speak for everyone, in fact I can't speak for anyone, but I do know for a fact that this was not a movie I enjoyed. If you think, for one second, that because of the casting this may prove me wrong you are the one who is mistaken.

With each viewing I learn more and grow in my appriciation for this film.Hitchcock buffs - this is a must see!Proof that, although under appreciated, quality film is not dead - AND - does not have to insult it's audience with the stock gratuitous sex and violence that many of todays untallented \\"hack\\" directors use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do your homework screenwriter","review":"This movie might have been mildly entertaining if the person who wrote it had done a minimal amount of research on intellectal property, which was the gist of the story.

However, it was continually ruined by poor acting (save Steve Martin's performance) and predictable outcome. With sickeningly sweet dialog like, \\"It's a lovely gesture\\" and \\"That would be lovely.\\" Who says, \\"lovely\\", these days? Rebecca Pidgeon's performance was like watching a piece of cardboard try to act. She cannot take all the blame for a screenplay that forced poorly written scenes and dialog down the actor's throats. I kept asking myself while watch this film, \\"Why is the main character doing something so stupid?\\" After 112 minutes of watching this film, it was obvious that the makers of this film thought they had pulled off a really slick story. On the contrary, I felt slighted to be taken for granted in such a patronizing film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real mystery, exciting and changing every second","review":"This movie was entertaining and fun to watch.

It's very stylishly done, no doubt, and it will keep you on the edge of your sofa all the way through. But it also sports some yawning plot holes.The central premise hinges on an inventor keeping a SOLE copy of his proof-of-concept in his safe behind a picture, with no other copies, and still thinking that it's alright to carry this in his armpits to a public park. As though this were not enough, the FBI then finds exactly the same kind of a notebook to pull off a spoof. Finally, it's perhaps alright to drive a knife into someone without worrying about fingerprints. How's that for a plot hole.Fortunately, the screenplay, the music and the occasionally thrilling dialogue save the day. On balance, an entertaining flick.

But alas, there is more, and for me the movie does not make the B+ mark. That twist also renders the premises of the movie both highly improbable and sufficiently illogical to seriously undermine the verisimilitude on which the thereto carefully constructed suspense rests. The movie could have been nearly as emotionally compelling as -- if understandably less epic narratively than -- \\"The Godfather\\". And in fact it sort of is for 90% of the viewing.

However, the plot is contrived at best, the pacing drags endlessly and the characters are just tepid and souless, excepting the lead that somewhat makes the viewer care a bit. The acting is also far from excellent and the direction does nothing to improve the slowness of the movie. The plot twists are quite irrelevant too, since the story is so uninteresting. \\"The Spanish Prisoner\\" is just another forgettable and useless movie about cons and burglars, and it\`s as bad as \\"Heist\\", another Mamet film that goes nowhere and also fails to engage.A good one to ignore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's To Like?","review":"Not having seen all of Mamet's film's it would be unfair to say he's made only two good ones: \\"House of Games\\" and, especially, \\"The Winslow Boy\\". We just watched an intermittently interesting but ultimately mediocre Mamet effort, \\"Heist\\", so I went to Amazon.com to read some reviewers' opinions. The awarding of stars was more evenly divided than any set of reviews for any film I've checked. More interesting than that, however, was the fact that so many reviewers of \\"Heist\\" mentioned \\"The Spanish Prisoner\\" as an example of Mamet's better work. We have seen \\"The Spanish Prisoner\\" twice, the second time to try to find something that we might have missed the first time. Still don't get it. It is surface only, and an uninteresting surface at that. There's no apparent involvement on the part of the players/characters and little or no reason for the viewer to become involved either. The one extra star above the minimum merely means it wasn't offensive enough to hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"you have to be ready","review":"I wish people would leave Rebecca Pidgeon alone. The Spanish Prisoner was not a vehicle for her talent. Her acting is stylized and somewhat narrow, but she's the best there is at this kind of droll presence...the deadpan delivery, the silent intensity, the understated cleverness. You have to discover what she means... so if you are a viewer who looks at films more than once, who likes to return to characters of a decent plot to study sets, props, costumes (and what they reveal), then see her in Mamet's The Winslow Boy. Lucky lucky man to have her in that film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"This film dealing with industrial espionage (the process involved is a McGuffin, since the movie never tells what is exactly about) starts well. However, as plot twist after plot twist accumulates, our interest wanes, and by the time the movie ends we just don't care anymore about what's going on. There is a final twist that is totally unbelievable since Steve Martin would have to anticipate the way that Campbell Scott would react to every situation. Finally, Campbell Scott and Rebecca Pidgeon might be the least charismatic screen couple ever. Their total lack of chemistry is the final nail on the coffin of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of 1998","review":"A modern day film noir in the tradition of China Town and L.A. Confidential. Spanish Prisoner possesses a unique style that is missing from most movies today. Intriguing sets and locales, a winding plot, sophisticated characters, and a moody, mysterious tone throughout the entire film set this movie apart. True, as some reviewers have complained, the acting is somewhat understated, but the dialogue is intelligent and lends itself perfectly to the mood that Mamet is trying to create. If you're looking for explosions, gratuitous violence, product endorsements or cheaky one-liners, then this movie is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If It Doesn't Hurt You To Think, Then You'll Love It!","review":"The Spanish Prisoner has about as many twists as a coil of rope, and figuring out how all the pieces fall into place is what makes this movie so damn good! So if you like your suspense on the intellectual side and can deal with a movie that's more than just Breasts, Booms, and Blood check this movie out. The only problem was that for this movie to work the schmuck in the lead(Campell Scott) has to walk into every preconceived little snare set for him. But once you get past that one minor detail the movie is pure cerebral entertainment. Steve Martin's performance is a knockout! One of the finest scripted films I have ever seen, they just keep on messin' with Campell Scott!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever","review":"I saw this movie several years ago and it has something unique about it. It is the best study of human behavior I have ever seen. This is my third copy. If you've ever worked for a highly political environment where there was a lot of money at stake, this is the movie that you must see. I've worked for dot coms for years and this became my bible of human behavior and deception. Steve Martin plays a villain and is brilliant. I have played one scene over and over. For veteran dot com'ers and they all get a copy. Watch Steve Martin's explanation of why employers treat their best and brightest so incredibly badly. The truth in the monologue can be applied to relationships and work to give true clarity behind why people do what they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of better recent mysteries","review":"The Spanish Prisoner is in a league of its own. Not only is it one of the better mysteries of the decade, but it also achieves such without violence, sex, or profanity. Not that I'm against those mind you, as long as they are there to benefit the plot, and not just for show. What I mean to say rather, that it is astonishing to watch such an absorbing film, and then by the end of it all realize that it did it without traits mentioned above. Much like the Usual Suspects, this film plays with your mind. You are taken on a rollercoaster. Who can you trust? The acting is dead on perfect. Campell Scott is good as the unexciting man in the middle of it all. And believe it or not Steve Martin is perfect in his role. So if you're looking for a good brainteaser, I reccomend this one. Also, look for a cameo by Ed O'Neil, better known as TV's Al Bundy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"The only surprise in this film was the incredibly far-fetched conclusion. After a masterpiece like \\"Homicide\\", I expected more from Mamet."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull acting, dry writing","review":"The plot was interesting, but it has to have been one of the dullest movies in a long time. The acting was flat with lines that are often cliched. I agree with previous reviewers that the actors seem as though they wish they were somewhere else. Especially irritating was the character of the young secretary. This film was a major disappointment that at first glance (and after reading reviews) seemed promising. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"With a self consciously \\"quirky\\" script and some really bad acting by Campbell Scott, \\"The Spanish Prisoner\\" is a movie that might have worked given more subtle writing, and better lead acting.Still this one created a major buzz on the so called \\"independent\\" film circuit in 1998. Steve Martin gives a very credible performance, but there is really not enough here to warrant a viewing if you have not seen it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as tense as \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\"","review":"If you enjoyed the drama of David Mamet's \\"Glengarry Glen Ross,\\" this one may be a disappointment. It's a mildly interesting \\"everyone's conspiring against me\\" movie, but the hero (Campbell \\"my names are reversed\\" Scott as Joe Ross) is too clever by half for someone who's supposed to be a \\"boy scout,\\" and Rebecca Pidgeon annoyingly overenunciates all her words in her role as Susan Ricci. The part I enjoyed most was chuckling at Ed \\"Al Bundy\\" O'Neill's role as \\"FBI Team Leader.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the year","review":"A brilliant movie by a brilliant man! David Mamet is at the top of his game ( for more brilliance by Mamet, rent Glengarry Glenn Ross.) Bet you can't watch it just once. It will have you guessing from beginning to end. Buy this movie right now. Steve Martin is incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very worth while motion picture experience.","review":"This was one of the best thriller/mystery movies I have seen in an extremely long time. The writing was incredible and the story kept me interested all the way through. Also, some great, and eerily fascinating, performances from the entire cast, especially Steve Martin, who proves that he's not just some guy with an arrow through his head. A must see for people bored of the barrage of unoriginal garbage at their local video store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This movie is really good. The actors and the plot of the story are good. The movie is really long. The idea behind this movie is smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad script, bad acting and lousy story yield a total waste","review":"Make yourself happy and rent or buy something else. This film is easily the worst I have ever seen. From Campbell Scott's irritating stupidity to the aggravatingly sappy writing to the inane story, this film is void of any positives whatsoever.Amazingly enough, House of Games was an excellent movie. This is a flop of the highest order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stayed as a play...","review":"I found this movie predictable, horribly acted, and not worth the time. Most of the actors (especially Steve Martin) have this look that they would rather be somewhere else and were reading the lines straight from the script. The plot itself was easily predictable and it was obvious where it was headed. The scenery was horrible and looked as if it came right from the stage. As a play this would be an excellent way to spend some time. As a movie? Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Mamet","review":"This movie is downright silly. I found myself laughing at every imaginable inappropriate moment. Some of the acting is good but David's wife who plays the lead is awful. It is no wonder why she does not have much of a career. The plot is absoloutely ridiculous. I saw the ending coming a mile away and it wasn't even that interesting. A MUST NOT SEE!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this tooth abscess smelly funny to you?","review":"Although the setup for this movie's plot was interesting, the story gradually unravels in a mess of implausibility and a clunky climax. Campbell Scott is believable, but Rebecca Pidgeon's acting is painful to watch, and her reading of lines is amateurish and sounds too forced. (Perhaps her husband, director David Mamet, should make his next movie about the perils of nepotism.) It is unclear why her character would try to help Scott's character from being captured by the police, while continuing to lead him into their hands. There are countless holes in the plot, and the ending does not tie up several loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will kill you slowly","review":"A rather bizarre piece of film with a sufficiently interesting beginning that falls deep into abyss after the first fifteen minutes. Unsteady acting by everyone, except perhaps for Steve Martin and that does say a lot as to the drama character of this movie. Unpaced scenes, dialogue that must translate better to the stage than to the celluloid and baffling casting. Eventually, you try to make the most of the moment and attempt at finding a point to the whole trama, however and once you are almost to the point of sacrificing intelect for a momentary lapse of stupidity, the ending hits you like a brick mortar in Gaza. Don't bet on the reviews you read here, (as I did), avoid purchasing this movie and look for it on your video store if you think that I am full of it. You won't regret it... I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Imbecile's Opinion","review":"Has anyone else noticed the contempt some positive reviewers have for those who disagree? I found \\"shallow existnce\\", \\"cartoon soaked brain\\", \\"brain dead\\", \\"stick to watching 'Varsity Blues'\\", \\"try not to see it with people who have a short attention span\\", and the not too subtle \\"thinker's film\\" and \\"average veiwer probably won't like\\". Oh well...The protagonist, Joe Ross, comes across as an idiot, who can be counted on, when faced with any decision, to do exactly what it takes to follow the Rube Goldberg plan of the antagonists. For example: Had he not sought out to confront Jimmy Dell, after being ignored in the showroom... Had he simply looked at what he was signing... This scheme actually REQUIRED him to confront Jimmy Dell, REQUIRED him to sign a document without even a glance at it, etc.\\"Odd Job\\" has a point, too.I suppose this makes me an imbecile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money !!!!!!!!","review":"This movie has got to be the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my life. It had no point to it. The lead acter(not Steve Martin) was so stupid in this movie he didn't even think. It will make you want to sell your VCR after watching this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE !","review":"Say what you wanna say: that this is art, the this movie is intelligent, that it is movie for people with brains, etc, etc. Keep on saying Mammet is a master. say what you want! But this movie is garbage, the worst garbage I've ever seen! The actor are disgustingly uninspired, the pace is almost nonexistant, everything is riduculous. The history is a third-class \\"mystery\\" case. Blergh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"Casting against type can be very effective. Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity is a good example. Raymond Burr in Rear Window is another. Steve Martin as a heavy is not. Two things that never below together in any film: Steve Martin, and a gun.And Martin's the best thing about this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad flick","review":"Wow, what an awful movie. The only actor who can act in it is steve martin. Why he took this part I will never know.Poor acting. Poor plot and poor me for buying it and wasting 2 hours of time. If you are thinking of getting this, DON'T. If you do, you will find out what I am talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, intriguing, well crafted","review":"TThe Spanish Prisoner is well made. Like most mysteries, puzzlers, and lovers, the subsequent viewings are not as good as the first. But the interest drops from sufficiently high levels to make this movie worth the price and time. Seen the second time, the hints seem obvious, but Mamet has made the atmosphere so creepy that the feel of the movie, as well as the acting, is even more fascinating. The movie gets a 5, the DVD a 3.5 for lack of features (A Mamet feature-length commentary would have iced the cake.), though the video quality was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spanish Prisoner Review","review":"The Spanish Prisoner is a streamlined movie without a lot of frivolous scenes. It seems that everything from a picture taken to a casual conversation with a stranger holds meaning and will ultimately show up in the conclusion. It is wonderfully thought provoking and detailed with likable, nave and misguided characters that iron out the twisting plot in comprehendible style.The characters play their roles to perfection, from a nervous workaholic, to a rich traveler, to a completely clueless secretary. David Mamet's brilliant character development and story progression is one thing missing in many of today's high budget star studded films. This movie on the other hand stays true to the theme and offers realistic casting.Overall, this film is one of the best I have seen in some time and I strongly suggest it be at least seen, if not purchased immediately. If you like a plot in your movies this is the one to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.","review":"If you liked \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" you might enjoy this film. You won't find violence or strong language, just an interesting plot.Steve Martin pulls off the serious role of Jimmy Dell surprisingly well, considering his comedic background. I admit, I kept expecting him to crack jokes throughout the film. Campell Scott was convincing enough, though I am admittantly not a fan of Rebecca Pidgeon.This film is more suspenseful than anything, and does leave more than a few \\"but how...?\\" questions in the mind of the viewer once the credits roll. A second viewing is helpful in picking up those \\"clues\\" one often misses the first time through.Still, it's worth the rental. I'd advise against buying until you've seen it, however, as it's not the sort of film I could sit and watch often."},{"rating":"2","title":"mamet is one of the greats","review":"i loved this movie. i was sitting in the cinema laughing my head off!it was so funny at the end-\\"do you have a dog called paddy?\\" etc..that has to be a classic line!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sateen!","review":"Even though it says that these are Sateen, they are not.

It sends the message that all that's required to get what you want is to repeat the same thing over and over again until your long-suffering caretaker just gives in. It could be a lovely series. It's cute and there are some good sentiments but Max has never been developed and his character could easily help make your life with your own toddler a lot tougher than it needs to be.

Known for his irreverance and biting lyrics, yet following original pagode style, he was a pioneer. This album is an anthology of his works from 1985 to 1993. Since I do not understand Portuguese, I miss the effect of lyrics; however, it is clear that he is a not a singer but more a narrator, and there is the flavor of hip-hop, even rap. It is strange listening: a hard vocal edge with the strong samba beat. I feel like Dylan's Mr. Jones, knowing that something is happening but not quite certain what it is.

It takes atmospheric, ambient music with electronic effects and varied instrumentation and imaginatively combines this with Blake's Songs of Innocence & Experience, Marriage of Heaven & Hell, and Auguries of Innocence in a creative and compelling fusion. The feel of Blake's imaginative, prophetic vision is evoked with great insight, sometimes in utterly unexpected musical idioms that I would've thought implausible (\\"Tyger Tyger\\" as Reggae!) and to a degree that succeeded in giving me chills (\\"Holy Thursday\\" especially) as few things do in these jaded days. Jah Wobble's narration of Blake's poetry, while coming just a wee bit close to over-dramatic in a few spots, captures its rhythms and emotions incredibly well, and he weaves this into the music wonderfully. The blend seems so organically appropriate, one suspects that Blake did indeed have a hand in inspiring it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This book is not objective.

Almost every single trek that I know of, from Humla, Mustang to Dolpo, Manaslu, Dhaulagiri Circuit and Kachenjunga is mentioned. Even the trekking peaks are covered. Of course, the usual areas like Everest, Annapurna and Langtang are also covered.Every trek that is being described comes with a box telling you the duration, access, highest point, trek style (whether camping is required), restrictions/permits and sidetrips. In between the treks, there are also information on Nepalese culture and traditions.However, if you think that all this is too much for a small, glossy book like this, then you're right. I find the info on some treks quite sketchy. You'll probably need additional references if you're going into a restricted area.

I saw it in the theatre, and loved it. Joseph Gordon Levitt, and the other cast members were great! But it's not a movie for everyone. If you even got to the point where you are reading this review, you would probably like it. It's fraught with hidden innuendos and undertones. Loved it enough to buy it. It's dark, it's funny, it's sad, it's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect indie flick - loud, angry, sweet","review":"Joseph Gorden Levitt rocks our socks off. This is the mash pit of rom-coms. Ridiculous anarchy disguised as soul searching melodrama drifts into a sweet film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this entertainment now?","review":"I don't know why I rented this. I thought it was perverted & cruel. Maybe you liked it, I did not and thus cant recommend it. Sorry white trash fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Ending but tough time to get through it","review":"The ending of the movie had an interesting twist and tied up some lose ends making this movie not completely a waste of time. However, between the first hour leaving everything to be desired and the middle being an utterly ridiculous series of events without any real meaning, this movie leaves a lot to be desired. Actors all did a good job portraying what the movie had to offer, the script just offered little.

Pretty depressing, not realistic and I hated the Hesher character. Save your money and rent something more uplifting like the new Xman movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This film was far from \\"refreshing\\". What ever happened to the decent things in life? Hesher had a very BIG filthy mouth and so did the boy, therefore taking away any lesson there was to learn in this film...except how to have a filthy mouth and be violent. How sad. This film just gives people bad ideas of how to act! Nothing they did was exceptable. There are better ways to let of steam. Just walking into someone's home and making YOURSELF at home...give me a break! Hesher was filthy and discusting. This was a very depressing movie. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"load up on Prozac first.","review":"This movie was ugly. Not only was the vocabulary ugly and disgusting, but the characters were empty,losers.

It had potential. Interesting ingredients...kinda cool character in Hesher, but in the end it just self-destructed into meaningless pointless drivel.Other people have reviewed the story so I'll just point one thing out that struck me as particularly stupid. The whole point is that the kid and family is going through tough times because the mother died. So at the funeral of the grandmother (who also dies), a drunk Hesher lectures the father and son about how they need to appreciate what they have left. He does this by comparing the fact that he lost a testicle in an accident and was feeling sorry for himself until he realized he had one good one left. And this didn't come across as humor..it just came across as really bad taste.It's been a long time since I've seen this level of stupid in a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"WELL-ACTED, PRETENTIOUS CRAPOLA","review":"This well-acted pile of pretentious crap stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a viscerally repellant, psychotic misfit who literally invades -- and stays -- in the home of a grieving, newly-widowed father (Rainn Wilson), his young son (superbly played by Devin Brochu) and the sweet grandmother (Piper Laurie) who lives with them. Natalie Portman is a checkout clerk who is reluctantly attached to Hesher and the young boy. The performances are all fine, but the story goes nowhere, is profoundly depressing and devoid of insight - or art. If this passes as entertainment in your world, it's time to get professional help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hesher","review":"I cannot imagine what anyone found entertaining about this movie. It has a idiotic story line with innumerable implausible situations, and at best, depressing. Even in fast forward mode the movie was slow paced.

It had no point and no message that I see. Enough said! If you are thinking of renting/buying this movie, consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indie Cliche Overload","review":"A casino bet that puts all it's chips on this angry stoner randomly squatting in this numb grieving family's house. The problem is he's miscast, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, unlikeable, and uninteresting. Somebody's rich influential daddy must have come up with the 7 million bucks to pressure good actors to do this rehash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible in every way","review":"You kinda get what the director was going for here -- trying to do a reverse role model story with a badass rocker dude as the role model who ultimately redeems himself despite his anti-everything behavior. Did not work at all. I rented this because of the interesting cast and some reviewer called it \\"hilarious.\\" That reviewer was clearly under the influence of serious narcotics, because there was exactly one laugh in the entire film. And the cast is utterly wasted. Rainn Wilson spends most of the movie in a catatonic state, Natalie Portman is mousey (if you can believe that) and Joseph Gordon Leavitt is doing his best Jesus Christ impersonation, but without the winning charm. Avoid this one too. Nothing redeeming about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"Hard to have any feelings for the titled name character.

Well, he was right on target. This book is an anthropological delight! I prided myself in my knowledge of the animal kingdom...till I read this book.Tim Flannery has a humble way about him and it reflects in this book for sure. The journeys and adventures that he undertook are not for the faint of heart.

I am on airplanes all the time and could not put it down even for dinner. I really did not have any particular interest in tree kangaroos or bats or penis gourds but thought this book was well written and presented a variety of information very well. I particulary enjoyed the last part of the book with the very explicit commentary on Indonesia. The information shed brighter light on why the US is so \\"gentle\\" to quote Clinton with the oppressive Indonesian military. No more items made in Indonesia for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just horribly disturbing","review":"I'm sorry but I couldn't get past the first 30 pages.

This type of behavior might be normal for these people but you know what it is not what I consider enjoyable reading, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable, incomparable discovery","review":"I'd like to add my vote to those that reviewed this favorably. This is one of those books you read that cause other family members to comment \\"can you put that book down for a second and look at this\\". And you will respond by \\"Wait a second, listen to this!\\".Flannery as mentioned in above reviews is no James Mitchner but his travels and discoveries are more novel and less attainable to those that would not put up with malaria, scrub typhus, parasites, hunger, miserable weather and a hundred other obstacles that exist in exotic Papau New Guinea and Irian Jaya.If you get this book arrange for some blocks of free time as you won't want to be interrupted.

Beware of this seller - I got ripped off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting item for long-time fans","review":"What a blessing, to have this artifact from Newton-John's days as a live concert artist. As I watched this video recently, I wonder what Olivia might think to see this- Surely she'd smile at the long-ago image of herself as a live performer on stage, only slightly past her prime as a top songbird of the 1970s. Casual fans might howl at some of the constumes and non-hit LP filler tracks being churned here. But for those rare few who absorb Olivia's each sigh as a penny from heaven, you'll find something delightful with this long forgotten concert. I for one am glad to see it preserved before the original sources decomposed from age...imagine if this had been lost forever, rotting away in a storehouse with other forgotten efforts of the 1980s- Perish the thought!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOt Happy","review":"This is NOT the animal that is sent....

We have a springer spaniel and wanted a plush dog that looked like him to see his reaction and just to have because it is so cute. The German shorthaired pointer looks so much like our springer and when we opened the box he thought it was real and wanted to play, lick and bark at it. We had to put it up high because he wouldn't leave it alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books of this type I've read...","review":"Self-serving and, above all else, boring. Moose provides precious little insight into crimes that terrorized a city and the nation. It is hard to imagine someone not being able to tell a compelling story about the shootings, but somehow he does. Moose is as adept an author as he was a public spokesperson during the crisis. Save your time reading \\"Three Weeks in October\\" and simply pat the former police chief on the back, though you'll have to wait for him to stop doing it himself - which is all Moose's 335 pages add up to."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarassing Report","review":"This book explains why it took so long to catch the sniper from the last paragraph on page 221 through page 223. Incompetence. The rest is a lot of whining by Moose. On page 226 he complains about how \\"inconvenient\\" it is to change out of uniform before going home although that is not required. Later he admits he was stopped for speeding and that his wife has been stopped multiple times! Great behavior for a chief of police. He is \\"victimized\\" by racial profiling. Hey so is every black person in this country. On page 288 he says Bush made a congratulatory phone call on the capture of the snipers. Moose whines that Bush should have made a personal visit. He left his job so he could write this book. Maybe that's a good thing. I must get the Horwitz book now to read the real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Endeavor","review":"Mr. Moose provides a sad reflection on this terrible reign of terror. Possibly if he invested more time in the writing of the book, some meaningful passages and information may have been included within the book's covers. If only to question his blind response to those first witnesses who reported the dark sedan and it's passengers leaving the scene of the first shooting, or of the near universal disrespect of his fellow officers.The book is poorly developed and written as shown by its ranking of appr. 7500 on the Amazon list today. Mr. Moose might do well to examinehis inner self, rather than write of his imagined leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Having lived in the area during the shootings...this book was terrible.This \\"Chief\\" did not \\"solve\\" anything. The suspects were stopped numerous times, but he was too busy focusing on suspects that perhaps looked different, or more what he wanted them to look like.He is extrememly self-serving, and honestly wasn't very articulate (as people often say) or organized while dealing with the media...he was hostile and not very likeable actually. Not sure what the big deal with this guy is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable book","review":"This is a racist book written by a black officer who writes about himself and travails. I expected a well written book with insight into the investigation and the events. Instead, I bought one of those \\"we are all victims\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"Oh please! Moose is so full of himself! He didn't run the investigation, the FBI did. In fact, the FBI had to take it over because he was botching the case. He is trying to make money off of the hardships that we the citizens of the metro underwent last year. I am shocked they even published this book. For shame, Moose."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given it 0 Stars if that rating were available","review":"Charles Moo$e disgusted me when he came out against Montgomery County for their repremand over his profiting from the office. This supposed \\"civil servant\\" used the office to attempt to make himself famous and rich, this book has proven that he fails in both endeavors. The quality of writing shows that Charles Moo$e not only rushed to churn out a book before the one year anniversary, neglecting his duties as Police Chief during that time, but he also seems to have the grammatical skills of a Montgomery County Middle Schooler. Perhaps this is the \\"homework\\" that they were sending that poor 13 year-old shot outside Benjamin Tasker while he was hospitalized for a month. I can only be glad that this book will tank in sales, preventing Mr Moo$e from profiting in his new position. As for me, I made sure to check it out of the Fairfax County Public Library, you aren't getting my dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it if you get your idea of police work from TV","review":"If you get your entire perception of police work from tv or the movies then this book is for you. If you believe that a police chief actually runs a criminal investigation then this is for you. If you think that the \\"real police\\"...the ones who work the street, talk to nuts on the phone, work 18 hour days watching suspects, hide in bushes on stakeouts, actually are the ones that solve cases then this is one is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be an autobiography","review":"For all the information about Mr. Moose instead of the sniper killers. Mr. Moose is too hung up on his own accomplishments and racism and only gives out tidbits of information concerning the sniper killers. Again, if this were supposed to be an autobiography, this approach would be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOOSE POOP!!","review":"Thankfully, this horrible, opportunistic, self serving, greed driven gathering of semicoherent thoughts and ego driven, never ending chapters can be put to rest. The previous review seems to say much about this self serving man who tried to take credit for all of the hard working, talented, public service minded Law Enforcement Officers who worked long hours and in dangerous situations to track down and capture the sick individuals who perpetrated these horrendous crimes. This book doesn't even deserve to be at the ranking of 11,950 which it is at this time.Precious Thanks are given to those who really solved this crime in their quiet professional ways. As for the book and it's author, enough said in the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing book I have ever read!","review":"I would have never have purchased this book for myself after watching Moose's interview on 60 minutes. However, my wife purchased it for me without my knowledge and I must say that every penny spent was truly wasted. This book has very little to do with the sniper killings. It is much more focused on Moose's life and the trials and triumphs of being a black man in America.Moose gives examples in every other paragraph of how he has been mistreated, harassed, victimized and disrespected because he was an african american.If you would like to learn of details, investigative methods and other inside information on the sniper investigation you'd be better off of doing a simple query on the internet than purchasing this book.I must admit I had somewhat respect for Moose during the investigation, but am now truly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Weeks in the Life of Charles Moose","review":"The title is disengenuous. I worked under Moose in Portland. The book is all about his travails. You might call it a personal saga of one man's tearful life. That was about all he did well - cry on que. Oh - he could get angry on que also. Blister you up one side and down the other for any conceivable slight that he figured you might be guilty of.He seemed to always carry a chip on his shoulder, and figured that most white guys were prima facie racist.Guy is a walking, simmering stewpot. Can't write either. Only reason he made the big time was due to an ultra liberal, white-guilt ridden mayor by the name of Vera Katz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more to know about from this book","review":"I was really looking foward to reading this book. Yet having been glued to the media like everyone else during these three weeks, there was never more I learned about the investigation, profile etc of the snipers. This was more like an autobiography of Chief Moose. At times how he became Chief was interesting but mostly very dry and hard to keep focus jumping back and forth between topics about himself then back to the investigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moose the buffoon","review":"Time will the show the Charles Moose was completely out of his element as a police chief and would have been more useful handing out parking tickets. He botched the investigation and now he tries to profit from it, this should make anyone nauseous. Charles Moose, as a ploice chief was completely incompetent and a complete buffoon. Do not waste your money and make this con artist richer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?! Or bait and switch, BEWARE!","review":"If you are looking for a well written account of these serial killers and their crimes, do not purchase this book. The vast majority of it is a disorganized and frequently tedious and redundant biography of the author and his forum on racism in U.S. law enforcement. Although both of these topics could make interesting reading, they are not well executed in this book. My interest in Three Weeks in October faded completely about three fourths of the way through the book. It did not deliver the goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"three weeks in october","review":"If you want to know about what happened, do not read this book. The better book to get would be SNIPER by Horwitz. It is put together well and is not about Mooses life. Ever an officer here in Montgomery County said that SNIPER is better now what does that tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an utter racist moron","review":"About the only two things one can conclude from this book are Moose is a racist, and Moose is a moron. It is a tale, told by an idiot, and not much of one at that.It is clear from the book that Moose is not a particularly adept policeman. He displays a penchant for suing people, possesses the aura of an \\"angry black man,\\" and on top of everything else can't write a coherent narrative, even with a co-author's help.I wonder if Mr. Moose is going to sue Charles Fleming when the critics pan this abysmal book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanting to be a hero","review":"I live literally 5 minutes away from the scence of the second shooting, and my grandmother's apartment was about 5 yards from the scence of another shooting. This is my home. So I figured that this book could prove interesting. Bah, humbug. Moose makes everytihng out to seem as if he was hero, ignoring the fact that there was no white box van, and the witnesses who described the actual car were ignored. What's worse is that publication of the book could screw up the sniper trials (at least in Maryland), and he violated every ethics law on the books. He wasn't that great of a police chief before the shootings, and he was even worse during and afer them. Buy the book if you want to hear about a man who wasn't even liked by his own officers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This book dragged so much it was like reading Chief Moose's daily planner in the early stages of the investigation. I hope a more readable book is published on this investigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assault on the Victims, the Real Investigators, and Justice","review":"Mr. Moose has presented a sad and upsetting essay. That he presents himself, in this poorly written and developed book, as the leader of the investigation invites one to ask why he ignored the eyewitness accounts of the first attacks. I don't believe the book is worth the investment of time to read or money. It is a grim commentary on his character and literary abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Off the Subject","review":"As a resident of the target area, I had hoped to learn what was going on \\"behind the scenes\\" as we watched the news reports. Instead the chief's book seemed to center on his personal life, his disappointments, and his problems with his perceptions of racial bias in this country. I'm sorry he resigned his job as Chief of Police. He was well liked in the police department. I think he was a much better policeman than an author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down By Chief Moose","review":"I could not wait until this book was released. I got it the day it was realesed, I Really don't Understand Chief Moose's Comment's in the book on alot of thing's.. I do think the man does have alot of anger in him. I was really Susprised about the part in the book about Were the Road's were marked as Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard. That was a very unfair statement.Travel to Florida Chief Moose I will Asure you that You will be in the best of Area's here on that street Because most of the street's run together with his name. Very nice town's too.I feel as though this book was more on Race Issues then the Sniper Shooting's. I am Shocked that you have yet to this day never faced the monsters that did the shotting's on your watch.I'm Afraid Of PoliceMen too. So I don't think I would want to be stopped By This One."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternatives to greed","review":"The D.C. sniper case was solved in SPITE of Moose's incompetence, whose bungling and inaction cost lives. I was one block from one of the shooting locations during this time period, when we were all watching for Moose's nonexistant \\"white van.\\" It was a terrible time of fear, and Moose's inability to handle the case and arrogance on camera were painfully obvious, as were the consequences. This book, unfortunately, doesn't tell the real story of how dedicated and unsung law enforcement professionals solved this case.Take the money and donate it to your local fire and police instead of giving it to this moneyseeking man. Or buy a book from Amazon.com about 9/11 and read about real heroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profiting from Tragedy ... Disgraceful","review":"Moose's incompetence prolonged the investigation and ultimately cost lives. Although the sniper's were identified early in the ordeal by a witness, Moose (brought to Montgomery County to combat racial profiling) insisted on using the racial profile of the snipers as white men in a white truck. Out of the hundreds of law enforcement officers involved Moose is the only one that chose to profit personally for this tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Class or Trash?","review":"Greed is what led Chief Moose to write this book. He quit his job as chief of police to write it, because ethics/rules prohibited his writing a book about those terrifying days in October. So, he quit his job. He goes on and on in this book about all his problems and racism, but this man quit his job as chief of police to write this book. Am I missing something here? A black man who is chief of police in an area near Washington DC, and I'm supposed to feel sorry for him?It wouldn't matter the race of this police chief. If they showed such a willingness to throw ethics to the wind, and showed they really didn't care about their job, wrote a book, half about the tragic days in October, half personal whine, that is a huge turn-off. Its no wonder this book is on the bargain tables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Moose","review":"Mr. Moose has written a pontifical,egocentric tome on a very serious subject. That he could wrap this book around his ego, instead of respecting the victims and their families and the thousands of law enforcement officers that were out there doing the work and finding the perpetrators is a travesty. I would much rather read a book by Bullwinkle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Blame Me!","review":"Beyond the pathetic writings, it sickens me to think that Moo$e is being paid for a book that not only HURTS the investigation of the DC Snipers (tough to find an impartial jury now), but also allows him to gain credit for catching the bad guys. See, there was a reason the FBI was called in; Moo$e had no idea on how to run a major investigation. White guys in a white box van, huh? Funny the DC Snipers couldn't be further from that description. If anything, Moo$e needs to apologize to all the hard working people that were taken out of those white box vans at gun point, handcuffed and searched without more than an apology. But then again, Moo$e likes ignoring good information... like putting out a look out for a blue Chevy Caprice with two black guys in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For unpolitically correct laughs....","review":"The humor may not be for everyone, but we thought it was absolutely hilarious!

Actually, I was enjoying the movie more before you meet 'Wilbur' and 'Eliza' - the Chinese are funny in this movie, and it was interesting to see a movie from 30 years ago reflect today's political climate.Once you get into the laborious details about the twins and their 'eccentric-looking-but-not-funny' carers, the movie is rather dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slapstick of Another Kind","review":"I saw part of this film on TV years ago.

The allegedly German words and titles clearly never say a German speaking editor, and:Mr. Hunter, where, oh where did you get the hare-brained idea of a Sturmgewehr 44 shooting pure lead bullets? And how did the non-existing tribe of Nibelungs like to live underwater, as dwarves at that??Oh my!

This one is the worst of all of them. I am glad I read it decades after he wrote it or I would never have read any of his others. In this book he tries to be too \\"literary\\" with formal phrasing, cute names, stereotypical characters (I think Susan should have been named Muffy or Bunny). I would rate this as one of the two worst books I have ever read (right up there with Neal Stephenson...hmmm, similar name, you don't think it's the same guy do you?).

For one thing it left you hanging as far as some of the characters went. Even though it was a WW2 story. It really did not seem like one to me. It lacked the feel of one.The plot was very unique as far as who the final target was.

But this was kinda a let down"},{"rating":"2","title":"ss sniper","review":"This was the first of Hunter's books that I read and it is probably my favourite, despite the implausible plot, because of the character Repp. I know that we are supposed to despise this killer but he is one of the most absorbing characters I have met in fiction. Men with such single-minded commitment to an ideal are very rare today, but in the 1930s and 1940s and during the Crusades or perhaps as Janissaries for the Ottomans they were more common. Hunter was still learning his trade at this stage but he manages to create some riveting battle scenes, especially the description of Repp's sniping battle in Demyansk in Russia. He has also obviously done some research on weapons from the period which gives a realistic feel to the story. It's an entertaining read for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...Point of Impact was better","review":"Although this was a good read, I would have to say that Point of Impact was better.

It really helps if you have read Witch Hunter first.The book has more characters and is shorter than Witch Hunter, resulting is some of the characters getting a somewhat sparse accounting and a less focused feel. Still most of the new characters are worthwhile additions.The action is fast paced and the combat at the climax of the book is excellent.

That was undoubtedly to discourage photocopying, but defrauding the innocent customers who legally purchased the book should not have been an option. Also, it is almost impossible to find anything in the horrible index; it was a though they didn't want you to locate their recipes.

St. John not only expounds upon the orthodox beliefs and doctrine concerning the Theotokos, he also argues against the doctrines that have developed about her that are not orthodox, namely, the Immaculate Conception. This book is a joy to read, largely because it is so spritually refreshing -- in my opinion, one cannot find a better book to begin an understanding of our Mother. After finishing this great book, one cannot help but feel the embrace of our loving and gracious Mother who will be with us always."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short but valuable work","review":"St John was a modern saint whose body was discovered incorruptable. With this in mind one knows that this book is infused witht he holiness of God's presence and that his words are the fruit of a life lived for Christ. The important aspect of this particular book is that it sets out a solid understanding of why Orthodox Christians must seek the intercessions of the Theotokos. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped, but it sort of answered my question.","review":"I bought this book, thinking from the description it could give some sort of Biblical foundation for offering Prayers to Mary. The author, who is supposedly a master Theologian, doesn't do that. Instead, he merely reiterates Orthodox Church teaching on the subject. For instance, he says the 12 Apostles were transported from various parts of the world to be present at Mary's death...simply because the Orthodox Churches teaches this, and therefore you have to believe it. There's really no argument for the worship of Mary, other than the Orthodox church says to do it. I was unconvinced.But in a way, it did answer my question: Is there a Biblical foundation for praying to Mary. The answer is no. So for that, I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayall & Mick Taylor Sizzle","review":"Great musicians went through John Mayall's band like a revolving door.

Overall, I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"More \\"Rock\\" Than Geode","review":"We bought these (despite other negative reviews) for our children's science share project on different types of rocks. The idea for the geodes was to crack one for the spectators (kids and their parents) every 15 minutes. When it was time for the first one, we just couldn't crack it, so my husband went outside in order to bang it harder. He went through at least 6 in order to get a couple to crack, but they were all solid (some little crystals but not much). We weren't able to have the \\"wow\\" factor of cracking open a geode and seeing the cool hollow inside with any of the geodes in this kit. It was very disappointing for my kids, and also for the kids coming around to hopefully see a geode opening in person. Thankfully we had lots of other specimens available from our own collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"FYI: geodes are supposed to be hollow & full of crystals","review":"Don't buy!

Geodes can be easily identified from solid nodules (also called thundereggs) by weight, which leads me to conclude seller is quite aware that these aren't geodes.

I gave her two of the geodes to examine while I put the rest in an old, heavy sock to break apart per the instructions. As is typical with most 7 year olds, she couldn't wait and broke her two geodes open on the sidewalk. We both had a laugh picking up the pieces scattered on the sidewalk. After we broke the remaining geodes apart, my daughter was delighted with the results and we spent a good time examining the open geodes. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE were satisfied!","review":"I see a lot of complaints on this product, but my 6 year old son LOVED it. I felt that it was a good enough deal for the price we paid (around ten dollars) and I am a cheapskate! At least 5 of our rocks were \\"big\\" ones - bigger than a huge walnut... a couple were about the size of a shooter marble. All of our rocks had crystals inside, and my son saved all the fragments for his collection. I only let him do a couple at a time, and when we'd get home each evening, he'd be begging to break another one. I ordered 2 additional sets after we finished up our first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"These are interesting...

Just 10 small rocks in a bag. When I cut the bag, dust got into my eyes. The same day later,I cracked my first geode and got something wierd. I then learned this thing is not educational. All you do is to get a hammer, smash the geodes, and get something that is certainly not like a geode.

She collects rocks and was looking forward to both the breaking/discovery aspect and having more rocks for her collection. We wrapped the very small (walnut sized is an apt discription) geode in a sock and smacked it with a hammer and then dumped out the pieces. The rock had pretty much shattered into very small fragments, none of which were particulary crystalline or interesting. We went through a few more (destroying the sock in the process) before my daughter completely lost interest. All rock fragments were tossed- none deemed good enough for the collection. Possibly the geodes would have been more interesting if they'd been cut by a rock saw (like the ones we got at the state fair)."},{"rating":"1","title":"mmm, not quite what we thought it would be...","review":"We were pretty disappointed with the 'geodes'.

Now I am not a Geologist so I can't use proper termanology for what we found, although there were small crystals in some most were very insignifacnt. All I can say is she was let down.Not worth the money, shop around or go somewhere that they actually cut geodes open for you.

It is a guide to gaining and keeping control of one's goals and self-respect. The topics covered include a right to privacy, a good education and a modest income sufficient to allow for independence and nurture creativity. The author's voice is that of a friend or mentor, never heavy-handed or pompous, but wise and straightforward. Woolf never talks down to you, the reader; her writing is elegant and she assumes you care to be a woman of substance, not a drone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Heartwarming & Inspiring","review":"This is not just an essay on feminism, this is a window to Virginia Woolf's thought pattern and logic. A Room of One's Own is beautifully written, it almost reads like a novel yet is packed with insightful thoughts on the idea of being an independent woman. The roles of women have changed since Virginia wrote this book but that in no way renders this book obsolete, for there are many struggles yet to be overcome and Virginia foresaw that in this book.Her hopes and dreams for women are beautifully expressed and heartwarming. This book is like a gem, the more you look at it the brighter it shines. I have reread A Room of One's Own many times and gotten so much from it. Its a book you will not regret owning. Simply inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important read that also entertains","review":"Oh, this was VERY good. And totally still applies today, sometimes shockingly so. A few times this felt dated, but mostly it was a very sharp, entertaining, poignant, and important essay. I enjoyed the format of both lectures quite a lot. The first was brilliant, following the day of one woman thinking about the issues of women and literature, and seeing that woman encounter all types of barriers in her everyday living. The second provided more of the \\"meat and potatoes\\" (the heart and facts) of the problems faced by women who wish to participate in literature. The fictionalized story of Shakespeare's sister was very powerful.I'll definitely be thinking about this for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Room of One's Own","review":"I found it tedious to read in spite of the high literary reputation and ability of Virginia Woolf.

I do not like A Room of Ones Own. I understand the concept of stylized writing, but the content of the book does nothing to draw in the reader. Certainly, Woolf's mastery in writing should be applauded on its merit; however, I am not progressed far enough in my education to fully appreciate Woolf's subtleties. There is nothing in A Room of One's Own that remains once the book is closed, although the pages are full of wonderful ideas. The presentation of these ideas; however, are uninteresting and handled in a very preachy manner. It is my opinion that such revolutionary ideas should have been shot forth from a canon rather than whispered in a library"},{"rating":"1","title":"she was a modernist, but an essayist?","review":"This essay, which was originally a speech and was somewhat elongated, speaks about feminist issues of the time in a rather circuitous manner. She spends chapters discussing topics that could be addressed in a matter of sentences. As Woolf acknowledges in the beginning of her essay, she does not always tell the truth, and sometimes contradicts herself (not to mention the insults she throws at the male sex). In support of this novel, it was revolutionary for the time and offers some interesting anecdotes of her time. However, the stream of consciousness style she employs clouds and confuses her theses. It is also interesting to note that she summarizes most of her speech in the last 5 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book bit","review":"Virginia Woolf is in no way an encouragement to young women writers.

Woolf is an ardent feminist, and will go to whateer length necessary to tell her audience of the supposed atrocities committed upon society by men. According to her, men are pigs who simply suppress women to elevate themselves. Her constant self-contradiction (is she not doing here the same thing that she accuses men of?) makes her thesis difficult to believe.

This movie still gives me huge youth sentiment as I watch it.I think the first part of the movie was the best, were they are attacked by the monster and attack it back. The middle part was also good, but not as good as the first part. A lot of this actors who play the children are just amazingly convincing. The adults also play good, but not superb. The clown then again was just amazing, I don't think anyone could have played it more scarring.

He played Pennywise in a campy fashion, but when Pennywise needed to be evil and ghastly....oh, brother, was Curry right on the money. Puts shivers down your spine.

It was some of the clunkiest I've ever seen. And that ending? Oh goodness! Here's how you defeat \\"The Eater of Worlds\\", you stomp a mudhole in its deadlights. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

No, that's not true, it's an innocuous movie that will leave you as you were - nothing added, nothing taken away. I only hate it (more like hate myself) because I bought a copy of the movie rather than rent it or borrow from a friend. Now, it's in my collection.As I can remember, it's about a group of kids who once drove away Pennywise, a small-town clown who kills other kids. All of them, except for one black guy, has since left the small town. When the killing resumes, the black guy tracks down all the other members of the group, so that they can play heroes once again.I must have passed out and when I came to, the movie is over.

I mean, yeah killer clowns are typically scary as hell, but not this one, Puppet Master scared me more than this did. I actually fell asleep a few times through this. I could only watch maybe an hour before turning off it was so boring.

I did not expect the film to capture all the plotlines, minor characters, and intricate themes of the 1100-page book, but I thought at least the acting, staging, and writing would be competent. They weren't. Tim Curry did a good job as Pennywise the clown, but here's the thing--\\"It\\" is not supposed to just be a clown; that is only one of Its guises. It represents what people are most afraid of, and embodies the evil in the town of Derry. All this is much easier to understand in the novel.

First of all, I hated the characters,they were nothing like the book and second of all they MADE A MOCKERY OF EDDIE'S DEATH. Movies have to leave out a lot of things, especially when the book is so full of information, but the movie left out the ritual of chud, which is how they really killed the monster and the house on neibolt street, which i think is just awful.

I read the book, loved it, and got pumped up for seeing the film. Unfortunately, it was painful to watch. It is nowhere near as good as I would have hoped. They rushed over everything, way to faast, and missed a lot of the point. There was stuff in there that simply did not make sense if you haven't read the book.On top of that, they missed a lot of the point. A large portion of the book was about battling your mind. In the book, the silver bullet works, because they are using it on what their mind made look like a werewolf, and because they believed it would hurt him, it did! The same thing with Eddies aspirator, but the film did not bother to lay these things out.Summed up, Grrrrrrrrrrrrr. Read the book a second time, or even a third. The film is poor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Reader Outraged","review":"I saw this movie as an eight year old many years ago and I was terrified for too long too remember. Now, years later, I just finishing reading the book, (The book was amazing, I highly recommend it!) and decided to see the movie afterwards. I was horrified-but not in the way I was expecting!The movie was boring with bad special effects and no regard for what actually happened in the book. I could list obvious errors for each scene, not just things which a Made-for-TV-movie couldn't include, but cases where things go against what is stated in the novel. The characters (mainly Richie, who was always my favorite) do not act the correct way. Henry and his gang are greatly pacified as well as Bev's father and even It. It, the creature, suddenly has new rules for what it can do and what can hurt it. The movie was a horrible disappointment with no knowledge of the novel Stephan King wonderfully wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total joke compared to the book","review":"first off one of my pet peeves is characters that don't look like they are supposed to (brunette dudley and petunia on the harry potter movies for instance). and this movie was all about no one even resembling the description in the book. it drives me nuts! then a scene where eddie is telling the others as an adult that he's never been with a woman. which just never happened in the book. the line was totally added and had no connection to the book. and ben kissing the clown? come on. if scenes have to be left out it doesn't mean cheesy scenes have to be added as replacements. all in all it was a terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this movie really sucks!","review":"This movie just plain blows. How can it have a 4 star average rating?? The book is great- I love Steven King, and a lot of movies based on his books are good, but this one is a joke. The acting is the worst part of the movie, it's so bad that's it's almost good. One very annoying thing they try to do is use as many tiny little details from the book, or use the exact same phrases that the characters in the book used. Sometimes that's cool, like in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but it really doesn't work here. Don't waste your time watching it and definantly don't waste your money buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone pick on the ending?","review":"Look obviously most of you have not read the book. The ending in the movie is the same as the ending in the book. They face a giant spider who is capable of shape shifting. And for those of you who think this movie is good, GET REAL! If you want intense characterization, READ THE BOOK! This TV-movie DOES NOT do this movie justice. You get better insights to all the characters in the book. There are things in the book that are not even mentioned in the movie that will scare the socks of you. For scare quality, the book scares you more than this movie. The movie is comical. Tim Curry was the only thing worthwhile in it. It did have a good cast, but you do not get the deep insights to the characters that the book gives you. So people, please read the book. You'll see why this movie is AWFUL! A note to Stephen King: Please stop allowing your books to be made into movies, unless they do it page by page and are at least 10 hours long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they even bother","review":"I loved It, the book that is. It kept me going. The plot, story, characters, everything was great. When i finished the book, I searched for the movie. When I found it, I eagerly sat down and watched it. By the end of part one, I was ready to cus at the TV screen. What the heck! It destroyed the book! The characters, the plot, the ending! They all sucked. I really feel that great novels shouldn't be wasted with cheap TV movies. I feel that most of King's works that are made into movies just don't give you the feel like the book. If you want to enjoy It to its full potential, read the novel. Don't watch the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful adaptation of the book","review":"At first when I started watching this *movie*, I thought it was some sort of joke. Surely I had stumbled onto a satire of the real movie or something odd like that? Was I on comedy central by mistake. No, it was actually the movie version of IT and it was really really bad. I haven't seen this kind of overacting outside of soap operas before. What more could I expect from a movie starring the one and only John Ritter. Don't waste your time with this movie. The acting is over-the-top, the story is rushed, the only saving grace is Tim Curry, who is a crazy sicko that does wonderful portrayals of odd vilanous characters (e.g. see the lord of darkness in Legend). I shudder to think what goes through that man's brain in real life. Aside from his performance, this movie is C-rate garbage (that's right, it's not even worthy of being called a B-movie).

I watched this by accident when I was very young and it terrified me. The only thing worth saying about this movie is that it is TRASH! I think a garbage can is where it belongs.

Well excuse me but many of the great literary works are extensive. This novel in particular is extensive due to the perfect description of places, chacarters, thoughts, etc.Taking into account the enormous amount of detail and description put into this book, I think it would be more than clear to anyone that MAKING A GOOD MOVIE OUT OF THIS NOVEL IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!-Please save yourself some money.-Watch \\"The Shining\\", that's good acting-Read the book when you are 11, 12 or 13-Read it again 10 years later-Read it at night"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!

I did not read the book It is based on, so I can't compare the movie with the book. But this movie has everything: wooden acting, absurd dialogue, clumsy direction, cheesy special effects, idiotic plot, silly ending, bad cinematography. The only question is whether it is so bad as to be campy. This may be the only movie ever made that is just bad, bad, bad.

I also find Tim Curry's acting enjoyable. Besdies that,it also has too many plotholes,flashbacks,stereotypes & cliches done to death by Stephen King. Tim's overacting is so unbearable. Even Angus Macfadyen acting as Komodo in Warriors of Virtue wasn't that over-the-top. The stop-motion is poorly done. Some of the cast are cruel to each other for no good reason. The balloons are NOT scary. I seen scarier things on MAD the animated series. Overall,this movie stinks. I give IT a 2 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Although the book was the best I've ever read, and Stephen King did a stupendous job in both his character descriptions and plot, the movie was terrible. Not only has the movie eliminated important parts of the overall story, the acting outside of that done by Tim Curry is extremely poor. For example, the scene where Bill rushes off to get Eddie's inhaler as he fears that he might die, yet when he returns he is breathing comfortably. After this movie, Stephen King should no longer let his books be turned into movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually negative 10 stars","review":"Did we all see the same movie?!?!?! Well maybe because I am 25 years old that I can see the difference in real horror and a rushed film. This junk was rushed.

Sometimes if you read a book and then see the movie you can appreciate the movie a little for it's differences- not here. I read the book and the next night after I finished it I rented the video- couldn't even get through the entire thing. It Sucked so bad I wanted to cry. PLEASE, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE- PLEASE READ THE BOOK- I BEG OF YOU. Poor Billy and his friends. Well at lease the movie gave Stuttering Bill hair even though his stuttering was ridiculous.

This is by far the worse movie that I have EVER seen and I wasted 3 hours of my life on it. It cuts out most of the book just to make it PG and what there is is horrid. The movie is SO BORING and the clown isn't scary at all. Whenever the clown would appear, I would fall over in laughter. The book actually gave me chills and was a freaky and scary book. This movie is anything but scary. I laughed nonstop because it was so terrible. The movie is about a group of people that regroup to kill a crazy clown that they thought that they had already killed.

Seriously! The only good parts were Tim Curry as Pennywise (I LOVE TIM!) and the dog in the jail cell who \\"killed\\" the guard.

Yes, Tim Blurry looks exactly like a chinese bum they found off the streets, unleashed maggots on his face and hair, fed on his flesh. Tim Curry is a schizophrenic, and Blurry is the outcome. That is why the movie sucked. DON'T LET BLURRY FOOL YOU! BURN HIM IF HE COMES NEAR! Remember that hairspray makes him stronger, bu nail polish remover takes away his strength. I know cuz my friend is a pyromaniac and we had a little burning ceromoney, where we burned Tim Blurry. TIM CURRY RULES! DON'T FORGET TO SEE CHARLIE'S ANGELS!

Steven King is a dang good author and is a great writer for scaring you out of your wits, but he shouldn't let anyone make movie's out of his books.

The special effects are terrible and cheesy. like sumthing from 1942. The first half of this movie is ok but many things the kids do makes no sense, because the explanation of their actions was left out of the movie. The second half when they are adults drags on, and is plagued by badly puppeteered spiders. HOWEVER, Tim Curry is great as Pennywise the clown, or it.

I know this I mean growing up in this era you'd have to be pretty nonexistent if you don't know about \\"It\\" anyways...

This is by far one of the worst movies ever, and it never ends. Literally it is 3 hours and 13 minutes long. It might be scary if you are younger than 9 years old, otherwise its not scary at all. Also the clown can not for some reason kill an adult. There are so many instances throughout the movie where the clown doesn't even hurt anyone. It truly is a piece of crap. If you are bold enough to watch this movie, then may god have mercy on your soul.ps: they float like a giant terd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AHHHH!","review":"This is the most freakiest Stephen King film iv ever seen in my intire life.Its about a creature who makes every child's fear come true and no one can see this terror except for children.And 7 adults who fought this creature when they were 10-12 years old.My favorite actor is in it:Seth Green who plays young Richie.If you like Stephen King movies that will scare you id also recomend \\"Carrie\\" and \\"The Shinning\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"OKAY","review":"The movie was okay ,but it is just another piece of evidence of how Hollywood has messed up kings books. \\"IT\\" is ashame"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stephen king horror movie","review":"It is a great horror movie.

I admit that i did like this one when i was in middle school. However, when I went to watch it again it seemed hokey and kind of dull. People have told me that this movie made them afraid of clowns for the rest of their lives, but i cant really see it. I was never scared because of this movie even as a kid.

Unfortunately when the airbrush kit arrived today, it had the wrong airbrush in it. As you can see from the picture, it has the Vega Nailaire airbrush instead of the 200 Detail. This is obviously incorrect as some of the parts included in the kit won't work with this airbrush.

Naming no other names (and there are plenty) as this a review of P.J.Tracy I read this book with a deepening sadness that they had used up all their ideas and no amount of giggling round the farmhouse kitchen table is going to produce much more from this mum/daughter team.

Okay, it's readable and moderately exciting, but the plot is crazy, and the characters are so lifeless they might as well be made out of cardboard. It's a shame, because Monkeewrench (which was called Want to Play? in the UK) was fantastic, even if the solution was completely unbelievable. The sequel was okay but nothing special. If people give this five stars, how do they rank the latest Michael Connelly, or John Sandford, or Jodi Compton? They're all so infinitely superior to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read","review":"This book would have to be the biggest load of feminist talkfeast I have had to endure in a long, long time. Destined for the round rubbish bin under the desk. Only woman can save the world - yeah right!! Truly unbelievable rubbish masquerading as a story line. Yet this is the sort of garbage which publishers are foisting on us mere readers these days. Perhaps we need more Ian Fleming's so we at least get some puerile sexist balance back. Fleming's single advantage over this tiresome novel is at least his books were short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishingly Captivating","review":"I have fallen in love with P.J.Tracy's books. Not only because I am from Milwuakee and some ofthe settings are in the beautiful state of Wisconsin and neighbor Minnesota, but because I amfascinated that TWO people (mother and daughter) can write together and make it sound like oneauthor. The fiction is captivating and each book that I read holds my attention and allows meto fully enter the world of the characters in my imagination. The development of the characters isdelightful and I don't want to put the book down until I am finished...then when I am finishedI wish that it hadn't ended.

The plots are unbelievable and the characterizations are stale. The cop who eats too much, the computer geeks, the strong yet vulnerable women, the grizzled local sherrifs, etc. ad nauseum. One aditional gripe...no woman who is 100 pounds overweight is sexy even if she \\"showed a lot of cleavage and a lot of plump, delicious leg\\". This is amateur hour at its best and shows how easy it is to publish bad books today."},{"rating":"2","title":"another winner!","review":"I bought Monkeewrench and loved it so much that I bought the rest of PJ Tracy's books too.

Is it 2009?","review":"This book is completely outdated and speaks to selling insurance only. More germane, it talks about specific life insurance products that no longer even exist.

All the songs are still there, however. As a bonus, my CD came with a duplicate insert autographed by William Stromberg and John Morgan! Well, I'm guessing it's authentic, I have no idea. Pretty cool, at any rate!About the music:This outstanding soundtrack is one that you can listen to over and over without getting tired of it. I have a hard time describing music in a technical sense, so I'll just say that it sounds like classical music that came from the 1950's and 60's, but in a VERY GOOD WAY. It draws a strong emotional response from me which is the best experience I could get from any music. You really feel like you stepped back in time (for us young folks, anyway). Sorry for generic/non-technical review; I just have to say it's a great soundtrack and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your eye on this author!","review":"Tainted Blood has all the elements of a first-rate thiller and then some.

What Pete does not know is that for the past eighteen years, Buckthorn has been troubled by the brutal slaying of young men. With his over zealous in-laws, a nephew who is diagnosed as the \\"stuff made of monsters,\\" and a lover that looks remarkably like his wife, Pete has to leave town before becoming the killer's next victim.Tainted Blood is one heart pounding, in-your-face of a thriller.

The print quality is very poor and combined with the matt paper makes the colours dull and muddy. Compared to the original Russian editions this book looks like it has been printed on newsprint with a very low quality photocopier.So bad I threw the book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Worth the Price","review":"Yes, the illustrations are reduced to a smaller size than one might like and, yes, the colors are flatter than they presumably are in the originals. But for about $10 you get a very attractive, 180+ page, hard cover book with a sample of more than 50 of Ivan's Bilibin's gorgeous fairy tale illustrations, all but one or two in color and many full, or even double page.For the price, I don't think you can go wrong if you're at all interested in Russian fairy tale stories and illustrations. By way of comparison. I recently ran across some Russian editions of illustrated Russian fairy tale books, including at least one illustrated by Biliban, at a Russian gift Shop in Oakland, CA. They were larger format and the reproduction of the illustrations was somewhat better, but the were paperback, only about 32 pages, and cost $29.95 each if I remember correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luxorious! Excellent selection of tales!","review":"The selection of tales in this book is excellent, the cover and the illustrations are luxorious, and more than worth what you pay. I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and saw this book, because I needed it for a friend, and it is, indeed, a wonderful present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reproductions!","review":"Luxurious? I don't think so! This book is far too small to do justice to Ivan Bilibin's wonderful illustrations, which I could have accepted if their reproduction quality wasn't so poor! Most have white flecks through them, and some are even fuzzy and off-register. Ivan Bilibin's beautiful colors have also died on this paper stock, with a considerable loss of detail - don't be fooled by the picture sample here! This is a very disappointing and unworthy production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent edition.","review":"I was really impressed with this book. I have been an admirer of Bilibin's illustrations for years, and it is good to finally have access to the stories that go with the paintings.

I am returning it even though I'll lose money because it's completely useless. I'd give it negative stars if I could! It does not grind the pepper evenly. It's more like cracked pepper and the chunks of pepper when you grind it range anywhere from whole peppercorns, half peppercorns, some coarse and some fine pepper flakes. The adjustment knob on the bottom does nothing as far as I can tell except maybe give you a few more or less whole or half cracked peppercorns with the grind. I wanted some coarse ground pepper for a salad and ended up having to put what came out of this mill in a plastic bag and smash it with a mallet to get a coarse grind suitable for a salad so I wouldn't have to bite down on huge chunks of pepper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Pepper Mill!!!!!","review":"Great Product!!!!

This is like going to an elementary school Christmas show - except I paid for it. The singing makes you cringe and the songs just have 2 stanzas repeated about 3 times. This is particularly annoying on The Little Drummer boy since it's actually a story and we're missing the end. There is at least one song with all of the stanzas included, but who wants to listen to it anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear and practical introduction to purification practice.","review":"The author presents in a traditional Tibetan Buddhist manner the Mahayana practice of confession to the 35 Confession Buddhas. He clear sets out the importance of purification and the steps that need to be taken for the individual to overcome delusions and to progress on the spiritual path to enlightenment.The text then explains the ritual of confession and contains detailed descriptions of the Buddhas and instructions on how you or I should engage in this practice. The text is very clear and avoids the tendency of some writers to obscure the meaning by using technical jargon - Kelsang Gyatso has avoided this and should be thanked for his efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blessings","review":"I love this book. It is very uplifting and gives me hope. Julia Cameron has such a way of putting words together. She paints pictures with words. Beautiful.The picture on the cover is awsome. Someday I would like to see the painting. It is himmel and erde (heaven and earth)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful reflections for all faiths","review":"I don't know what the author's religion is, but I suspect she is not Jewish. Nonetheless, this book was given to me by a Rabbi because the sentiments are universal. I have been through a couple of very emotional experiences recently and through these experiences, I have sought to become closer to God. The journey is often difficult and the relections and experiences of others make this journey a little less uncharted. I find the sentiments in this book to be moving and I recommend that you seek out those reflections which are most meaningful to you and to spend time truly concentrating on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks important features","review":"This is overall a good vcr but it lacks some really obvious features. The lighted display on the front tells the time, etc., but it does not tell you when the unit is playing, rewinding, fast forwarding, etc. It does have a record indication, but it is so small you can't read it from 5 feet away. This may seem trivial, but when I am on the couch, I like the visual feedback of what mode the vcr is in when I'm going back or forward through a movie, or when I'm recording. Seems like pretty simple features that it ought to have, and I have always seen on other vcrs."},{"rating":"1","title":"VR661HF overrated [...]","review":"I bought this VCR based on the review of 5 stars.This VCR did not perform as stated and I returned it.The other reviews must have been written by RCA employees.The VCR recorded a blurred picture.

Once I had a home appropriate for a dog, I searched for Mamalute breeders, and when I found one in the area I selected a malamute puppy for my family. :) The breeder turned out to be the daughter of Barbara Brooks (Author of this book). She followed this book's principles closely in her Breeding program. The results are amazing. My girl Mal from this breeder is wonderful. She is smart, strong, heathy, and of great temperment. She gave us this book with the puppy, and it has been of great value in caring for our new familly member. Its advice on everything from training, to care to breed tendencies and deep understanding of the breed are so helpful. We will be taking our malamute up Mt. Washington as a pack dog using this book as our guide to perpare for the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Malamute Owner's Manual!","review":"I wish a bought this book before I got my first Malamute.

It's not even close to OEM. The rubber is very thin and there is no ridge on the end flanges to keep the band from coming off.And, although they provide this inner band (shown) there is no outer band, spring clip or anything to secure the outer end of the part.Lastly, the OEM parts left and right bellows are different (at least for my vehicle), the right side part being longer by about 2 pleats (the rack moves out further on the right side). This \\"right side\\" K9367 part is exactly the same as the left side part, K9306.The OEM boots are also used in some Honda Odyssey vans, but I found my local Acura dealer had the better pricing.. $22 for the right side (53534-SB4-305) and $25 for the smaller left side (53534-SB4-000).

While this DVD Is very good, It doesn't capture the energy he's capable of playing with. Check out the Blasters live reunion cd. His guitar playing rips on that one.

I hated it, and it went on for several years, until I decided to maybe upgrade my value to society. Music like The Blasters was a way I could make a bad day better, and pretty much every day was a bad day. Not too many people can really play like that, but Dave Alvin is one of them. A song like Marie, Marie could really make you forget how much life sucked. Other than Marie, Marie, the songs on this DVD are of the sort that reminded me of how much life sucked, and thus I hated them then and I hate them now. What a waste of talent! I skipped over every song and filed it away in my DVD case and will probably never put it in a DVD player again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Alvin DVD","review":"The lyrics are hard to hear because of poor mixing.

As the fraternities and sororities work to recruit the best talent around, dance fever sweeps the campus. The plot of this movie was not that bad but it was very low budget. It does have it's funny moments with guest appearances from Anthony Anderson, Faizon Love, Monique and many others that you may have seen from previous movies. But the movie did leave you wondering at the end. There were some things left out and the timeline was a little off. The quality of the picture was definetly the worst part. Not even worth the rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie!","review":"Overall, I rate this movie a 2 because the plot was very weak.

From the 1st chapter, I realized it is really a book all about bashing our dominant culture, here in the U.S. The only reason that I give the book 2 stars rather than 1 is because it is so badly and erroneously written (so much is taken out of historical context to bash the US) that it is forcing me to really look at our history and find out what really happened, because the book is definitely not an accurate depiction of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Paper and Time","review":"I had to read this book for a class (actually, I'm currently reading it for the class) and all I can say is that it is the most prejudicial, hateful and demeaning thing I have ever had to read. All the book does is tout how evil White people are and how badly Blacks and Hispanics are discriminated against. According to the book, only White people discriminate and the Blacks and Hispanics have no control over their lives. Now I am not naive and I do know that there is racism and discrimination in the world, but White people are not the only perpetrators of it as the book seems to insinuate. If you have to read this book for a class, I feel your pain. If you are looking to read something for your own information, then save your money and buy something else.

I emailed the authors to ask them for some proof of their ridiculous statements and received no response. I had to spend $80 on this book for a GRADUATE level education course.

I was excited about the book until I realized how one sided it is. It mainly talks about problems african americans have. Doesn't talk about native americans, asian americans, or hispanic americans much. It also isn't politically correct. They call different culture groups native americans, asian americans, hispanic americans, african americans and white. Although sometimes it states european americans instead but the authors should have stated european americans from the begining since they did for the rest of the ethnic groups. It was also one sided on the role of women. It made it seem like growing up to be a \\"girl\\" was a bad thing and a stay at home mom should feel bad because she's not in school.

It's not predictable and I did not guess her true role in this new world until the author exposed it for me. It is a sexy book, but it's not all about sex - there is an intersting plot. And although our heroine spends most of the story naked she doesn't get a lot of action herself.I'll be looking for another title from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marf Droppings........","review":"That's what this book is. in case you are wondering, marfs are crocodile like beasts in this book. Anywhoo the plot is actually a good one in this book, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The HEA ending fell flat, but I will say the heroine in the book is a good solid, strong female character. But, Erotica this is not. The euphemisms in this book for womens parts are not good: 'tender thorn'/WTH??? One reviewer says this is 'prose'- I don't think so.All these good reviews MUST be the authors friends, but GOOD friends should be honest..................."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never received the poster I ordered","review":"The vendor never sent me this poster that i ordered. I am very unhappy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative","review":"The highlight of this book is chapter 9 as he discusses ontology, i.e., the nature of what truly exists. He talks about the present as always changing into the past and the future. In other words, the present isn't really present. To illustrate how change occurs he mentions a piece of meat as it is cooking. If left unattended, when will the meat cease to be meat?In places he gets bogged down in jargon and complexity. He starts by discussing education in general, noting that in addition to English, a student should study French and Latin, that certain things can only be known though the original tongue of the author. Overall this is an insightful collection of essays."},{"rating":"1","title":"With shipping, price doubles","review":"I was going to purchase this wax. But when I went to check out, the $15 purchase price nearly doubled because shipping and handling was nearly $12. Not my idea of truth-in-pricing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backpacking for the Obsessive/Compulsive","review":"While this book has a few good tips it can't make up for the irritating tone of the author. This book takes a very simple activity and turns it into an obsessive pursuit. Get a copy of Collin Fletcher's \\"Complete Walker III\\" and learn to create your own style instead of having it force fed to you. While lightening the pack is always a good idea for enjoying the outdoors there are safer ways to do it than are outlined in this book. Plain and simple, I just didn't like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"hippy dippy blowhard","review":"Ray approaches \\"the ultralight philosophy\\" like a recovering alcoholic preaching about the evils of \\"demon rum\\". The one thing all these ultralight writers have in common is they once carried ridiculous loads like sherpas, and finally saw the light. Who was ever that idiotic? Most of us figured out long ago that lighter is better, and I've never seen anyone outside of a paratrooper carry 60 plus lb. loads. He reminds me of a kid I knew in 5th grade that maintained he invented the word (insert common racial epithet).Jardine brings nothing new to backpacking, except for the digusting habit of hiking in biking shorts. For the most part his book consists common sense tips on lessening the load, interspersed with egomaniacal psuedo-spiritual diatribes. Other highlights include some incredibly stupid thoughts on giardia, mosquitos and food.Save your money, buy Colin Fletcher's book. He's a good writer first, backpacking guru second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Efficient minded backpacking","review":"I'm not sure why anyone wants to apply efficient based principles to something as simple as backpacking. Sure, if you wanna race against mother nature to get from mexico to canada in 4 months, but I don't think anyone has ever fully enjoyed the experience cruising along the PCT 20+ miles a day continuously. However, I do like the idea of making my own gear, but his extreme behavior and belief system really puzzles me. While reading I asked myself; Does he want people to believe he's some revolutionary founder of lightweight backpacking? I guess that would explain his gloating of his small following called \\"Jardinites\\" (he proudly exclaims in the book), that believe his practices and beliefs are on par with Charles Darwin and other great influencial minds of our past. I say, \\"wake up you simpletons\\" it's all common sense! Nevertheless, if you're in need to become a follower or just looking for some paper to burn in the fireplace, look no further!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I wasted my money on this","review":"After hearing of Ray Jardine's hiking exploits (AT, PCT, CDT), I decided spring for his book. This book is full of Ray Jardine's personal opinions that are packaged as \\"facts\\". In particular, his outright slander against all commerical food borders on the absurd, and he provides no evidence for most of it, other than referencing some obscure books by guys who probably wear tinfoil hats. And, the Ray Way is apparently the only way to hike (so says Ray).Don't waste your time or money. There are far better guides out there that cover lightweight backpacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond conventional wisdom","review":"This bible of long distance hiking goes beyond conventional wisdom by explaining the hows and whys of discarding unnecessary pack weight. It is organized in nuts and bolts fashion around hardware topics, but also discusses vital skills such as nutrition, health and stealth camping. I wish I had read it before my thru-CDT hike last summer. Ray's earlier PCT Guide was also enormously helpful for my thru-PCT hike '94, but Beyond Backpacking is wider and deeper. There is even a chapter on sewing your own gear such as a skull cap or a quilt, to be independent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme, Radical, Backpacking Theory","review":"If you ever want to read a book on how to backpack this is the book to read. It is probably the most extreme and radical thinking ever written by a fellow backpacker, but probably the most practical. The idea is to learn how to optimize your hiking enjoyment, whether reducing weight, cost, making your own gear and designs. Jardine takes a new look at the approach of backpacking that is fresh and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do it your way!","review":"Condescendance and a zealous behavior are not the way to present something different. Though Mr.Jardine displays a few practical ideas, his tone and manner are quite disturbing in this book.... Sure, I can see in a few instances where his practices would benefit a long distance hiker, but recent general concensus from Backpacker magazine has concluded that the vast majority of backpackers are uninterested in Jardine's obsessive approach. Nevertheless, there are a few that revel in his ways and it's safe to say many of these people take greater pleasure in obsessing over pack weight than actually being out in the wilderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of trees","review":"Soon after starting I found myself paging ahead in hopes of finding something worthwhile for my backpacking quite soon i was at the end: i got up and threw the book in the trash; I NEVER throw books in the trash..........A pointless waste of innocent trees, living things died to make the paper for this, sad, very sad.Vacuous opinion, little to no useful advice. Buy Fletcher or another, but anyway choose an author that actually wants to help rather than merely pontificate emptily."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most comprehensive backpacking book","review":"This is the most complete book on backpacking. I would recommend it for both beginners and experienced backpackers. Before reading this book a few years ago, my wife and I were novices who thought that backpacking would be too difficult for us. This book has made backpacking much easier, safer, and more enjoyable for us. BB has a lot of information that is missing in the other backpacking books such as: stretching excercises, campsite selection ideas that will keep you warmer and safer and drier, knot tying, blister prevention, hiking enjoyment, sewing your own equipment. Ray Jardine pays a lot of attention to safety, as well.This book shows that you don't need expensive equipment to begin summer backpacking. This book has led us towards a simplified hiking style, saved us thousands of dollars in equipment, helped us shed many pounds from our backpacks, and increased our safety in the wilderness. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backpacking - A Step Forward","review":"I feel this is an excellent text obviously written from experience. It systematically and completly addresses all parts of a backpacking trip and is very useful at dispelling concerns novice campers or hikers may have. The tone of the book is very positive as well, as Jardine refrains from casting different methods in a negative light.The book also has an appealing \\"outside the box\\" thinking process with innumerable bits of tips and wisdom and that can lead to more enjoyment of anyone's wilderness experience. Personally this book has guided me to a much easier way of camping, as well as travelling in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idealism gone afar","review":"Though I did find some useful practices in Mr.Jardines book, I find this man to have a personality like a religious cult leader. He presents his ideas and beliefs as though they are scripture and that we are the flock of sheep(mindless followers) he seeks control of. Remember: backpacking is a very simple activity, not a race to finish the fastest or most efficiently, we have enough of that in society. After all, anyone with common sense knows a lighter pack is easier on the back. I do agree with Jardine's point of people falling into the marketing traps of gear makers. So in that regard I feel the book is worth reading if your looking to shed a few pounds by making your own gear. Aside from that, Collin Fletcher's \\"Complete Walker III\\" is a nonzealous, practical and the most informative book to backpacking I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"must study","review":"i am an experianced outdoors man and new to the world of backpacking. this book has all the info on how to pack how to organize a extended trek and invaluable concepts for any beginer or seasoned hiker. there is chapters on potential dangers of wilderness packing, ticks poisonous plants, animal danger, hygiene, and how to cope w/ each of the elemants. if you're experianced in backpacking it may change you're point of view or hiking style all together. i highly recomend this book to any one new to this style outdoor adventure. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful but Irritating","review":"The whole time I read this book, I couldn't stop thinking about Mesquito Coast. Namely, that Ray Jardin and the main character from that book are quite similar and while I would hate to spend time with either of them, they have some very inventive and practical ideas. In other words, I recommend reading the book even if you won't necessarily enjoy it the whole time. As someone who perenially carries a house with him when hiking, there are a number of useful suggestions in this book and it offers a fresh approach to hiking. Overall, I recommend reading this book, though I suggest taking everything with more than a few grains of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's kind of corny","review":"I was reading it to find out some tips, yet it was a corny book.

The track listing on amazon is wrong. This is actually a 5 track single with 4 mixes of Personal Heaven and 1 mix of a track called fireworks by x-perience WITHOUT Midge Ure.Of the 4 mixes of Personal Heaven, in which Midge and the female lead vocalist duet to beautiful effect, the trancy \\"promise remix\\" is the most gorgeous, with swirling synths that add depth and harmony to the vocals. The original radio edit is more of a down tempo track, and the desert dream edit and desert dream long version are both midtempo, with a sort of an early new order/joy division guitar sound. All 4 mixes are unique and must haves if you are a Midge Ure fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE dissapointment","review":"I wanted a reasonably priced CZ princess stud earring that wouldn't turn my ear green.

The Tchaikovsky can sound mannered because it sounds so diferent, so improvised in manner. But it works.The Korngold? Some can say that it is Hollywood music. In fact, it is. But time has shown that there was nothing wrong with the quality of Korngold or Steiner, Newman or Tiomkin. To the contrary. Their music will surely live much longer than that of those wacko elitists who, I happen to think, have made 'classical' music truly boring.The Korngold is just superb. Mutter/Previn play the slow movement so, so lovingly, that, if you don't melt or get a chill up your spine, I recommend you stick to Carter, Cage, Stockhausen and the like.The recorded sound is outstanding. A winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasty","review":"i'm going to ignore the Korngold here, as i don't particularly care for him, but mostly just a short note on the Tchaikovsky VC..why does it have to be so hasty? i know it's a bit of a crude statement, but i've always appreciated the slower, more luxurious feel of her earlier recording of this and was hoping to hear something similar, as i lost that cd a while ago, but this is just.. rushed.. as everything these days seems to be.. from beethoven symphonies to working..Everything must be done quickly, and this recording seems to follow suit.Is this because the age of the 'romantic' conductors has come to a close, and the new generation has to do something else to be \\"original\\"?No, i can't say this recording did it for me at all..oh well, there's always her von Karajan recording"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected","review":"I heard that this movie was in production a while ago, checked back in on it a few times, then forgot.

Usually I love Steve Buscemi, but I wasn't really that into him in this flick.

You learn about his childhood of asthma and the belief that his parents feared he would never reach adulthood. This President was a strong motivator and worked hard until he was able to overcome his weak body. He loved this country and was intent upon making the lives of the average man better. He was also an avid hunter and his home at Sagamore Hill is filled with the heads of wild animals he had killed. An odd thing that struck me was the head of a wild animal in his wife's white and pink pristine parlor. It just did not seem to belong, there and I wondered why she didn't protest such a sight among her feminine things.

Also other ingredient is ethyl alcohol and I am surely not in favor of using that internally. Maybe if you want to seal off an external wound and don't mind the staining it might be good for that use. But for taking internally, do yourself a great favor and just order the UniFlora Propolis Extract (alcohol free). It doesn't taste good either, but at least you can rinse and swallow the rest of it down quickly. I was trying to save a little money. I have used 2 bottles of the UniFlora brand and it is excellent.

(Mark 8:34-38) Christ has called us to take up our cross and follow Him.To grow in God's image we must become a new creation in Him. In this book you will learn how to do this. Through the author's own personal trials and tribulations and his experiences ministering to others you will gain his insight into what God has revealed to him and wants all of us to know. God loves us and longs for us to have a deep personal intimate relationship with Him. All it takes is for you to put your complete faith and trust in God, surrender your self-will to His will. You will soon find the person God had originally intended you to be; others will see the image of God in you as you become a servant of God serving others in His name.I highly recommend Clarence Walker's other books: God Help Me; Starting Over God's Way; and Moving Forward God's Way.\\"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Horror Continues!","review":"Aargh,I made the mistake of ordering this along with Trace of a Stranger without listening to em' first. This one is slightly more listenable due to the afformentioned a.f.i. element being less noticable. More songs about lame 80's horror films. Candyman?!?!? These guy's score some more annoy points by not knowing whether they want to be a metal band or a pop-punk band. I'm open to alot of different music but this closes the door on blitzkid for me.

The writing is British style book which, considering the subject matter, seems contradictory. Finally, you read a chapter purporting to be biographical and finish realizing that you don't really have a sense of the person at all.If you've never read anything about historical American organized crime figures, and plan never to read anything about them again, this might be just the book for you.

Seeing as this was shot about 4 years ago, it's interesting to see how far the Project Runway empire has come!! I do have to say that there are spoiler alerts and I'm pretty sure if you know anything ab Project Runway you know who won this season, but it still makes it exciting!

I loved the drama and angst that came to those who worked on the graveyard shift at the hospital. I thought the storyline of Cody and Lainey the most enjoyable, and Jason Morgan and Spinelli added comedic relief throughout the series. Also as a fan of Robin and Patrick, I really enjoyed watching Jason Thompson and Kimberly McCullough do some of their best work in the acting department. The cameo appearances by some of the other GH cast, like Carolyn Hennesy, Lindze Letherman among others certainly added to the cast integration of this series. To watch and enjoy Billie Dee Williams is icing on the cake.If you like hospital drama each and every episode, then I would suggest you watch GH:Night Shift."},{"rating":"2","title":"i enjoyed watching NS but hate what they did to my faves","review":"I have given GH's Night Shift Five stars because i love the characters,Patrick and Robin . I dislike how poorly they were written and how their characters acted. But I Love GH and I did enjoy watching NS just to see what the heck was going to happen next and i really want to see a season 2 ( hopefully) they will learn from season 1 and finally give my couple a good storyline. I also enjoyed the storylines of Lainey/Cody and Kelly and the hunky anetheisologist. i couldn't stand the three student nurses (especially the Leyla character) but I hope for better character development and better storys for the future. But I truthfully have to say even though i disliked what they did to Patrick/Robin I liked the fact that there was a spin off to GH with them in it and that it was their own show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say No to the Night Shift","review":"I went in so excited for this show, that was supposed to revolve around my favorite daytime couple, Patrick Drake and Robin Scropio, but was instantly dissappointed. It depicted them as totally different character and the story change half way through was a disasterious idea. The forced pairing of \\"nurse\\" Leyla and Patrick was nausiating and lacking in any chemistry. It was so horrible i stopped watching after acouple episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guza's folly","review":"After being billed as a show case for the Patrick and Robin characters, this series completely trashed the character of Patrick, gave us the chemistry black hole that is Patrick and Leyla (an abomination that bled over to GH, unfortunately) and was generally a kick in the teeth to fans. NO WAY would I buy this. Its only due to the overall awesomeness of Jason Thompson and Kimberly McCullough that this couple was not ruined beyond the point of repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of money","review":"Please save your money! This series was horribly written, and the production quality is that of an amateur. The writers could have taken some pointers from online fanfiction authors.

I wish I didn't have the Night Shift stories clouding my brain. Some of the stories were acknowledged on GH (the Killer Nurse and her sister, Nadine). Others were not acknowledged and were actually impossible on GH at the time (Maxie needs heart procedure, Jason performing community service while he was in prison on GH...). See other reviews for the Jason/Robin issues. The only thing worth seeing the series for is the CG skyline. Who knew Port Charles was SO big (skyscrapers, etc.), considering how quickly people walk from place to place?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Night Shift was a very good show and I am sorry that they took it off, and I do miss seeing Jason on GH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I was very excited to find this.

Now why in the blue blazes, would you put someone like Billy Dee as a clean up man ? The person that was the Charge Dr, should be Billy Dee's role and the one that was a jerk should be cleaning! The one you chose for charge nurse needs to be in Security. She has got a loud enough mouth! I didn't want to see Robin in the shower! She played back up in General hospital, she should of stayed that way, Too many new faces! The only good thing that happened was the bomb! VERY DISAPPOINTED!My Son could do better and he is 16!

The title interested me. At first, I had an idea that it would be about racism but I wasn't sure.

This is a very good book seeing that it is a personal experience by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in everyone...","review":"It's sad that we are not requiring this as a summer read to be discussed when high school evaporates the pools and even sadder that it exists as only a blip in some required psychology class.

This book in one word I will describe as EXCELLENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Black Like Me\\" is a disturbing book","review":"I read this book for my junior year research project. It disturbed me very deeply and I was astonished that a place in the United States could be so filled with injustice in the last few decades. It makes me ashamed of this country. This book made me question my faith in democracy and made me ask myself if I am subconsciously too tolerant of racism."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Far Have We Come?","review":"Many years ago, as owner of a bookstore, I added this title to my inventory and of course read it. Growing up in Wyoming we saw no Negroes so the book was an eye-opener. I was aware of the discrimination and had strong feelings about it but no experience. As I look around at our society now, I wonder that we have come from that mindset to the election of President Obama. I applaud the courageous beings who have pushed for the betterment of all mankind. Black Like Me will certainly bring up emotions and maybe give some insight to how it was and how it really is improving even though it doesn't seem like it sometimes. My husband is now reading the book and I can hardly wait to hear what he thinks about it! I would certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Like Me","review":"\\"Black Like Me\\" by John Howard Griffin is truly a magnificent book. All his life, he has seen the ridicule and hate towards African - Americans, but no he decides to journey into the life of a black man. With his skin tempoaririly darkened due to medical treatements, he says goodbye to his family and journeys into the life of an African American in the deep South. This book truly touched me. Me, being a young black woman, have exerienced minor events such as recorded in this book, but nothing ever this major. This is a book that all people need to read, wether you be white, black, chinese, asian.... ANYTHING!!! This book may only seem to focus on the love / hate relationship between whites and blacks, but really it reaches out to all types of racism.... girl / boy, chinese / japenese.... evendog / cat! This is definitely as must - read, page - turnin, \\"gimme just five more minutes, mom\\" type of book.

Going into it, I did not believe that I would find it very interesting, but I soon found that I could not put it down. I flew through the book and was very pleased by the way it had captured me. I told my friends about it and they were quick to learn how exciting the book really was. It really opened my eyes and I am very glad that I took the time to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can anyone not give this 5 stars?","review":"Yeah this book blew me away from walking down New Orleans streets to riding in the back of the Greyhounds with blacks as he was temporarily black. This book had me feeling like it was me going through these acts of racism. I was not thought of during the time he pulled this off so when he was telling the story from a mans point of view who had not been through this before he was telling it through me as well. I was reading the story thinking dang, why are these people treating me this way? This is some B.S., but anyhow this very true book is sad that thats how it was (even worse years before that, however) and an interesting concept and good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me is a great book to read. It described life in 1959,when blacks had no happiness and little freedom. Life was like prison, but a prison for life that blacks couldn't leave. This is shown by John Howard Griffin who went through a medical transformation that turned his skin color black. The outcome shocked him and me. I felt the pain of his mistreatment, and the shame he went through. The people that he knew gave him no respect as a black man. For example when Griffin went back to his hometown New Orleans, he went to a restaurant that he ate there all the time as a white man, but now that his black they won't even lit him use the restrooms.This book is one of the best books I ever read; it will show you that one man wanted to see what it is like to be a black man in the Deep South. Griffin had to live the life of a black man, and be what whites thought he should be. This book is GREAT, you should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Like Me","review":"I'd been meaning to read this book for a long period of time but somehow never got around to doing it. Because of the extended time since the book's publication, my philosophy, hopefully, matured quite a bit. For this reason I found the book mildly disappointing but still generally interesting.From the standpoint of a Black man I found the author's assessments of race condescending while attempting to place myself in his shoes in 1959's racially charged southern culture. No Black man or even woman could have had the author's dual perspective but I found his descent into self-hatred compelling. His evaluations seem elitist because of the ease in which he navigated the culture as a Caucasian - the differences stark and extreme. Blacks knew only one experience - so his experience can only be described as an anomaly."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Could I Have Missed Reading this?","review":"I have read Gentleman's Agreement which I found to be an outstanding novel, but one day I was wondering about Black Like Me. I did a little research and found out that many people had read this in high school. I am a bit older now, so I ordered it and I am glad that I did. I can't imagine how revolutionary this book must have been when it came out. What a horrifying history we have had in this country! If this book is no longer assigned in school, everyone should read it anyway. We don't want to repeat the past ever and this book goes a long way to promote stepping into the other guy's shoes. I loved this book. Please read it before you leave the planet. I got the book from Amazon and I got it fast too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book","review":"This was a good buy and will recommend to friends, appreicate the service. Thanks again!

Griffin darkened his skin and changed his life to be able to see what it was really like being a black man in the segregated South. The things he heard, felt, and saw are things that will forever be impressed upon my mind as a reader. The way he told his story was very simple and straightforward, which almost seems to bring the messages home even harder. You can easily see him struggling with concepts that were everyday for the people he encountered: segregated restrooms, segregated water fountains, sneering, baiting, hatred, and disdain. If this book doesn't make you want to cry, then you don't have a pulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"A previous reviewer suggested that this book should be required reading in high school. When I was in high school in the '60's, it was required reading for my class. I don't recall much about that year high school any more, but I remember this book. I couldn't put it down then, and although I haven't re-read it in all these years, I still think about it to this day. That is the mark of an incredible book. Read this book and allow it to seep into your pores. It will change you forever. And I WILL be re-reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Answers are extra","review":"The book is good, but certainly not up to the other reviews I read. Surprisingly, it's purportedly used as a school text. That's surprising because there's absolutely NO theory inside this tome. It's strictly network by rote.Especially frustrating were the Exercises and Case Studies *without answers*. Want answers?

One need only have a passing familiarity with the works of Strauss to know that Robbins's understanding of the man and his ideas is as misconceived and misdirected as Mr. Robbins's artistic abilities -- which is nil.My only consolation after experiencing this unbelievably vapid and inane product is that this play, as well as the ideas (such as they are) behind it, will soon be as dated and irrelevant as Mr. Robbins's acting career itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic, Rythmic, emotional ala David Bowie, The Beatles, and The Police","review":"Quite a surprise!

The plaintive \\"No More Sorrow\\" is my favorite, but there is all good music here, original songs sung in the heartfelt way that makes 1950s Gospel music so compelling.

This 8-CD box set includes reissues of all his albums from 1961-71 as well as several pre-LP singles and EPs, rarities and the like. Each disc includes two reissued records, along with bonus tracks -- there are also two full discs worth of rarities and other bonus material. This is a must-have for Simonal fans: many of these records have been out of print to decades and were only released as part of this box set.

I really like the double sided fabric, it's very soft and conforms well to her body. It supports her body well. The only thing I wish I could change about it is the depth of the actual headrest. It doesn't seem very deep and sometimes my daughter's head will come out of it and slump over when she's sleeping. Other than that, I have no complaints.

Didn't really see the need for this-a much better buy that my mother insisted on was the harness pillow for support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good in car seat","review":"There is a reason not to use this and it is simple, if the unthinkable happens and you are in an accident and your child is injured or god forbid killed you have no recourse whatsoever because you have voided your car seats warranty. All car seat manuals specifically state that the use of ANY after market product, which this is, voids the warranty of the seat. Just something to think about, it doesn't matter if there isn't any padding or anything else, simply by using this product in the car seat you have given up any legal recourse you might have if for some reason the seat fails in an accident even if the snuzzler had nothing to do with it because you voided your warranty and went against the specific instructions in the manual which clearly states not to use any after market products in the seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but too warm sometimes!","review":"My father gave this to us for our little man because we were complaining the head support in car seats is terrible.

When there is a day suitable, he loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm & Cozy","review":"You definitely don't want to use this during the summer months, because your baby will be sweating. I used it during the winter and it worked great for my preemie. The only downfall is that the velco part that attaches the head rest to the body rest is so big and rubs against baby's neck. I had to put a small towel to cover it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Preemies!","review":"My son was 5lbs when we brought him home from the hospital and the Snuzzler enabled him to ride comfortably in his car seat - even though he was so tiny.

It made for a nice comforable position for her head and body in the carseat. We have a Graco Safeseat and a Britax Marathon. It fits well in both carseats.The one thing I would caution about the Snuzzler is that it can make your baby very hot because there is no ventillation for their heat to escape. My daughter has complained about this a couple of times because it really does get hot here.Actually, make it 2 words of caution. Adjust your restraints for your baby after you have already put the Snuzzler in because it definitely makes it tighter with the Snuzzler and that might be uncomfortable for the baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"We have 2 boys and needed a double stroller but did NOT want to pay the $80 - $100 for a carseat adapter.

After evaluating the history of AI's minuscule progress, Dreyfus provides a compelling analysis of human intelligence, drawing on the philosophies of Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Merleau-Ponty in order to demonstrate that higher level cognitive faculties are not reducible to computational representations. This book is an important reversal of commonly accepted assumptions within the cognitive sciences, from linguistics to psychology. It is also an important example of why the cognitive sciences would benefit from paying greater attention to the achievements of contemporary European philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial Intelligences Exist Today","review":"Scientists have formulated at least 100 definitions of what intelligence is. (for a partial listing see www.vetta.org/definitions-of-intelligence/)Several computer programs exist which qualify as intelligent according to at least the vast majority of these definitions. (for instance my Asa, Trans. of the Kansas Acad. of Sci., vol. 109, # 3/4, pg 159, 2006,www.bioone.org/archive/0022-8443/109/3/pdf/i0022-8443-109-3-159.pdf) Not all creatures are equally intelligent so there is no need for an AI to be as intelligent as the average human. In point of fact, however, AIs exist which outperform humans at a number of important tasks."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best cdg that I have come across on.","review":"I came across this cdg, and it was more than I expected. the music is clear and the rythem is right on cue.

Silver John felt like a reflection of himself, or a re-creation.Those interested in Wellman's best work would do better to read \\"Who Fears the Devil?\\" especially its wonderful inter-chapters.Nonetheless, I will continue to follow Silver John's trail of wonders in Wellman's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"I'm not happy with what I received.

I own the first edition which was published by Harlequin which explains why this novel is more discreet in sensuality writing compared to her other novels (Touch of Sin, Silver Flame..). I very muched enjoyed this novel, it was very heartfelt if one enjoys deepfelt love and romance without the interruptions of the hero pursuing \\"other sexual affairs\\". I highly reccommend this book it is rich in Russian and Turkish history (without being heavy) with the witty and beautiful love story of Stefan and Lisaveta that in some parts made me weep and smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of Susan Johnson's","review":"Susan Johnson tries way too hard with this book. In her effortto make Prince Stefan look like a terrific catch that everywoman wants, she gets way too carried away with her descriptivephrases and exaggerations and makes the Prince sound like aperson I wouldn't even want to meet. Her descriptions of thePrince are downright laughable. There isn't a man on earth thatcould act the way he does and still have the women like him.But it was interesting reading, though I consider the book adud. I own over a dozen of this authors books and this one ison the bottom of my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I really disliked Susan Johnson's Russian series. Love Storm is vile, while the others are readable - just. Golden Paradise is slightly better than her last book, Taboo, but not that good.Mainly because there is hardly any storyline, and like Taboo, the descriptions of war read like a history litany than a story. The love scenes are, dare I say it, tepid, and I find myself skipping pages. What happened to the lovely sensuality of Susan Johnson as evident in Sinful, Brazen, etc?If you want to read a good Susan Johnson, try Sinful, Brazen, Silver Flame... everything except her newer ones. Miss Susan Johnson has lost her touch, sadly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As an avid inkwell collector I was very excited about a new book coming out on the subject. The last books I got on inkwells were the Badders' books from 1995, so I was ready for an update. Wow, was I disappointed! First, the book is not organized in any way. It seems they may have tried to organize by subject matter (lion, girl, etc.)but this system is erratic. Secondly, they have obviously not taken into account the market fluctuations due to online auctions. I have seen mint inkwells sell for $250 where this book estimates values at $300-$500. On the other hand, I have seen an estimate of a $200 inkwell selling for $400. These examples are not a \\"one time\\" situation, they are consistant. I realize that this is probably a difficult factor to add into estimating, but if you are going to call yourself an expert and publish a book about it, you should consider all factors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good--but incomplete","review":"Finally, this warrior woman's story is being told! This well researched biography reads like a novel. Peter Aleshire presents her as a hero to her people. He researches every battle and skirmish and reveals Lozen's known or most probable role in them. He shows that her warrior exploits took up the bulk of her life.He attempts to write from an Apache viewpoint. I'm not sure if he succeeds, but he does choose Apache sources of information over others, and admits his limitations as an outsider, even as he felt compelled to write this book.This book desperately needs maps and photographs. There are none. Lozen's life criss-crossed much of the Southwest and Mexico. Mr. Aleshire mentions a famous photograph of Lozen without including it in this volume. I had to go to outside sources to track her movements and see her face. So, I call this book incomplete.But, I am immensely glad this book has finally been written.

Snippets of personalties of such real life figures as Jesse James, Quantrill and General Ewing are a few the colorful characters brought back to life in these pages -- as well as fictionalized accounts of two of the more infamous events in the western theater of the Civil War: the Lawrence massacre and the makeshift Federal prison collapse which killed Missouri women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bushwhackers 01","review":"Should be a good series.Follows the Longarm format.Defintly an adult western.This had a lot of historical truth in it.Written by the same folks that brought you Longarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knockin on Heaven's Door","review":"One of the greatest recordings in the cannon - even better due to the spectacular mix on this remastered issue.

There are a few songs I never heard before, that I found a bit slow and boring (\\"Save it for Me,\\" \\"Opus 17\\"), but what CD doesn't have a few songs you simply skip over?

That is why there were vinyl snobs who thought LP's were a much better technology (in spite of the hiss, and pops).

The final cabaletta shows Callas at home in one of the most challenging arias in bel canto operas. Her trills and scales are beyond criticism.

The insole isn't super thick, but it offers some protection from the rocks and whatnot.The durability, unfortunately, doesn't seem to be working out for me. One of the shoes, the tighter of the two when I tried them on, has stretched out at least half a size in under a month. It went from rubbing my big toe a bit to my heel suddenly slipping out of the cup. I tried new insoles, that didn't work. I tried the heel lock lacing, and that didn't work.

One thing after another after another kept on happening to her, resulting in one of the most depressing works I have ever opened and read from cover to cover.

I understand that the author wanted to be discriptive and let us know what was going on, but i feel that in parts it was too descriptive.

It has a lot of sexual scenes in it, and some swearing, which might be offending to some people but to most is really no big deal. The author has an incredible writing style, awesome way of describing things, and is just over all brilliant. I actually thought that the last page and the afterword were the best parts of the entire book, because it made me appreciate the book more and made me realize that it actually was a really cool novel.

I almost took it back to the library before I was half-way through but decided to stay with it until the bitter end. When I finally finished it, I returned it to the library and then went among the stacks to locate some more of Morrison's books, thinking perhaps I could find another that would strike my fancy. I stayed at the library for a time and tried to interest myself in some of her other writings. It's no use. When she isn't being obtuse, she is being plodding. There are altogether too many other outstanding novels out there for me to read; no more Toni Morrison, thank you, even if she is a professor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bluest Eye","review":"The Bluest Eye is the story of an 11 year old victim of circumstance--the circumstance being her ugliness. Heart-wrenching in parts, Morrison writes of the importance of beauty and to what lengths a person would go to achieve the stereotypical \\"beauty.\\" This book is the first that I've read that deals more with this social issue of what is beautiful than with the issue of race relations. Not to say that race isn't talked about, but it isn't the primary focus of the novel. This was a fantastic book, an interesting and thought-provoking read, and a reason to read more of Morrison's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonder..","review":"Although many of her novels can be complicated, Toni Morrison's Bluest Novel is very simply put. However, your thought may be complicated relating to the story. Explaining the struggle a little black girl faces when she decides she wants her eyes to be blue, Toni depicts a struggle that everyone faces at some point in their lives, striving for the impossible against all odds, and then having to come to an compromise. We can be our own worst enemy and our most encouraging supporter all at the same time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"This book was required reading for a student. I read the book in order to help her with her class/discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bluest Eye Book Review","review":"Pecola and her family were poor and black and lived in a life of misery where there was much racism. Pecola wanted blue eyes so bad that she would do anything for them. She was the the one that suffered the most out of her entire family. I encourage teenage girls especially from the age of fifteen to eighteen to read this because I believe most girls can relate to the story. Girls are never satisfied with themselves and this book is a great example of this situation.People would really love this book. If you are the type of person that likes shocking dramatic stories this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly Seen as a Good Piece of Fiction","review":"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"still good after all these times","review":"I originally read this book in 1995. I have read it about ten times since and it's still good. It tells the story of a little girl's struggle for acceptance from her mother and society as a whole, which everyone can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"can be difficult, but has a rewarding lesson to teach","review":"Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye definitely deserves the awards that it has won. Morrison, though sometimes difficult to understand has a beautiful way of writing. Her storyline deals with one of the most prominent issues of American life, racism. She tells the story of a poor black girl, whose only wish is to have blue eyes. Morrison shows racism from the point of the victim, not of the one using the racist comments. It's a completely different perspective from what I have grown up seeing. Morrison definitely did well on her first piece of work. I would recommend the book to anyone, it will definitely teach you a very important lesson... to know a person you must look inside their heart, not at their face."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Else Can Be Said","review":"This book has received more reviews than I can count. Therefore,all I will say about the book is READ IT! It is a very good read that shows the pain involved in racism and hatred."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bluest Eye","review":"I am somewhat familiar with the writing style of Toni Morrison. After reading Beloved, I saw the similarities in the novel also by Toni Morrison, The Bluest Eye. This novel was a very strong and influential one. Morrison portrayed the harsh racial differences that occurred in 1941 by describing the life of two young poor black girls, Claudia and Pecola.I can relate to this story. Pecola focuses on her imperfections throughout the whole book at the age of eleven. She believes that her ugliness is the reason why her parents don't love her. She wishes for blue eyes because she thinks things would be different if she had them. In this society, many people try changing themselves to be someone there not. It's a huge problem today, and we all have to learn how to accept who we really are. I recommend this book because it shows how while life these days is so different than back then, in some ways it's exactly the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring and moving story","review":"The Bluest Eye is truly an inspiring and a moving story. Through a child eyes, Ms. Morrison takes us on a journey to the most innocent and perverse thoughts every human being has, including violence and despair. This book will make you think and feel. I applaud the author for writing about our misinformed society. This book is a must read for every person that has an interest in our social conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"I read The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison in one sitting. I was hooked from the first page by the author's beautiful prose, a sing-song melody of the written word that I have never before or since experienced from another author's work. Then came the story, a heartbreaking tale of a young black girl who wants to be someone she is not, blonde haired and blue eyed because of how she sees herself, how others talk about her ugliness and worst of all, how she is violated by her own flesh and blood. I was so moved by this book; the words stayed with me long after I put it down. I highly recommend The Bluest Eye to anyone with a taste for beautifully written prose, something unlike anything you've ever read before and a tragic, all too realistic tale. This one goes at the top of my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but....","review":"Toni Morrison is a wonderfully gifted writer. Her use of language in The Bluest Eye is exquisite. Through the use of different points of view, she captures the different motivations of each character and offers us a platform from which to understand their actions. My question is this...if this book is about the perception of beauty, did Pecola have to be raped to convey the theme? I believe the story supported Ms. Morrison's point without the brutalization of the child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the redemption?","review":"I've just read MANY of the reader reviews for this novel. Why does no one mention the terrible beating poor Pecola got from her mother because her father raped her? I think that beating had as much to do with Pecola's \\"losing her mind\\" as everything else she suffered combined. In essence, she was raped by both her parents. I don't disagree that Ms. Morrison writes with a marvelous style about compelling life themes. But I find no redemption or healing in this novel (nor in her others I've read). Evil is not overcome. The conclusion is dark, lacking in hope. I'm an idealist, and thankfully, I see life filled with redemption and healing, even for horrendous circumstances. I only read Morrison when I have to (and I read this novel for a book club). I regret her view of life in so many of her novels is so overwhelmingly negative, especially since she's such a powerful and influential writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written Child Porn","review":"It has been a while since I read this book, but I recently was involved in a discussion about this Toni Morrison novel, so I've decided to write a review:The book has some brilliant moments, no doubt. But all and all this novel reads like a fifth-grader wrote it, and contains an extremely graphic rape scene between a man and a little girl. This novel, just like The Catcher In The Rye, is nothing but an attempt to write a story for people who love to see negativity and pessimism glorified. A play for that \\"woe-is-me\\" crowd of \\"LEFTIST\\" morons. An easy target to shoot for. If you want to become a famous novelist, just use the Lord's name in vain, over and over again, or describe how you hate the world because it has let you down.Like I said, there are a few parts of this novel I think are great. But there is so much more of it that is just disgusting, whining, and needless complaining. Toni Morrison is the most overrated writer in America today...www.therunnninggirl.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, Oprah...","review":"This book was a waste of my time. Oprah had me believing this book was about a black girl named Pecola and how she thought that if she only had blue eyes, then everyone would love her. Instead, I read about incest, domestic violence, prostitutes, alcoholics, nasty-behaving white racists, and home after pathetic home with not a trace of love anywhere. This book is depressing and confusing. Maybe someone should tell Oprah to lighten things up a bit...and no more Toni Morrison!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Endured rather than read","review":"Granted I am a guy, a white guy at that, but a relatively evolved and enlightened one (or so my wife says when not pummeling me with a rolling pin). However, when assigned to read this for a woman's literature class in art school, I began visualizing forms of torture I would rather endure than finish this book. Call me a simpleton, but bare minimum, a book has to have a PLOT! If there is a guy out there who can choke down this book without bleeding from the eyes, the first round of medicinal post-read bourbon is on me. Sorry...for what it's worth, though, I loved Fried Green Tomatoes and Joy Luck Club"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"The Bluest Eye was the worst book I have ever read. It was nasty and almost pointless. Evreythig revolved over sex and a lot of other horrible things that people do not care for to read. I was disgusted and shocked that this book got a award and good reviews. It was a nasty horrible book and I hated it. I do not think it deserved all the credit it got. Do not read this book. It does not deserve any stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually 1/2 star for Bluest Eye","review":"I'm sorry, but I rate this book 1/2 star, and I am being overly generous at that. It is about the most jumbled up mess of a book I have ever read. Half the time I didn't even know what character they were writing about until I was well into the chapter. Phooey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bluest Eye","review":"I thought The Bluest Eye was very boring & hard to follow. I tried reading it in large print because that was all the library had when I checked it out. It took me 2 weeks to read half way through it and I don't remember anything about this child wishing for blue eyes. Half way through I gave up on it. I have never read any other Toni Morrison novel, and if this is her best book, I am not interested in reading them any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"what people see vs. what was written","review":"While people like to make themselves seem intelligent by over-analyzing the book and reading things into it that Morrison never intended. What is actually between the covers of the book is 150 pages of the gross aspects of sex and femine hygene. That is not what makes brillant writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder it took 25 years to get published....","review":"The book is gross, shocking and at times perverse. The book is not really centered around or identifies for the reader what the color of someones skins has to do with anything. I highly doubt that had Ms. Morrison had not been friends with Oprah...this book would have gone nowhere. My daughter had it as required reading in a college course. As highly educated as we both are, this book was down right repulsive. I am against banning books and sometimes read them on that principal alone. But please, if you want me to learn about being a black woman...hand me a book by Maya Angelou who celebrates, not degrades her culture. She is indeed what it means to be a national treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sick Novel","review":"Any review you read about The Bluest Eye will tell you that it is a book about a little 11 year old girl who wishes to have blue eyes and blonde hair. However, the entire plot of the novel revolves around the human desire for sex. The book disgusted me with its extensive descriptions of child molesting and prostitutes. I would have thrown the book away if I didn't have to read it for my honors English class. It blows my mind how this book is in many book clubs and how the author won a Nobel award. The entire book is sick, and if I didn't know better, I would say that its main audience purchases it at adult book stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty","review":"The description Toni Morrison uses throughout this novel makes it an enjoyable read. I found some minor difficulty in identifying the order of events, particularly because it skipped around a lot. As the book went along, it became easier to piece the puzzle. The lengths one goes to for beauty can destroy you. This was true for Pecolia. She strove to be beautiful and have blue eyes but when she finally achieved this, she went insane. This problem of desiring to be beautiful still exists in today's society. Anorexia and Bulimia are major forms of destruction that affect young teenagers. After completing this novel, I feel that I have gained a better understanding as to what beauty truly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I was anxious to read this book, I know Oprah loved it and I heard alot of great reviews. So I started it and was disappointed right away. This book, like most books, didn't get my interest right away. It also didn't hold my interest like other books. I found my mind wandering so I would have to go back and reread certain passages. Then when I finished the book I was disappointed. What was the point of this book? I read this whole book and didn't get anything from it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and will make sure I never read this book for a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real heart breaker","review":"This book was so sad. The final chapter left me feeling a little hopeless and heart broken for Pecola. The ending was unexpected and I felt it made it worth reading. I felt some of the book was a little disjointed. I got confused about the point of a few characters. I loved Ms. Morrison's use of descriptive terms. Many phrases are like poetry. Overall, a very enjoyable but sad read. I would recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read with similar style to other Morrison texts","review":"I read this book on vacation. It's a very quick read and the symbolism of the bluest eye is quite easy to understand. The text is very similarly written to other Morrison's books. It is another story about the frustrating and tragic events of African American life. This text focuses on a group of girls growing up and their parents. This is a great text for freshmen and sophomores to read in their English class as a study of culture, racial divides and the symbolic structures that exist in American culture and in many other parts of the world that have been taught to believe (mostly by history) that the world is easier, more beautiful through blue eyes than brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read!","review":"I don't know if its just me, but this was simply the worst book I have ever read. I normally enjoy the \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" selections, however I found this selection disjointed, uninteresting and hard to follow. Knowing that this was the #1 paperback at the time that I purchased the book, I continually forced myself to keep reading the book because I thought that it would get better. It never did! I was so frustrated by the end that I had to tell someone about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"I first read this book a few years ago and was surprised by the power and beauty in Morrison's words. After reading the book again, I am again struck by how much she can say in this little book. Pecola is a pathetic figure that makes one truly question their place in the world. The idea that to be beautiful one must look a certain way is an idea Pecola struggles with every day in her search for \\"the bluest eyes\\" as many of us in today's world also struggle to be happy with our identities. I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very powerful","review":"what i have always repected about mrs.morrison is her frankness.she isn't afraid to tell it like it is.be it race,sex,class,self-esteem&the world at large.this book deals with subjects head on and isn't afraid to tell this story.it's a real eye opener for folks that don't realize how important it is to tell children that no matter what color or shade&size that they are loved and wanted.very powerful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most haunting portrayal of madness since \\"The Bell Jar\\"","review":"I couldn't put this book down from the moment I opened it. I doubt any reader could not want to reach into this book and remove Pecold Breedlove from her family's abuse and insanity before it ultimately engulfs her. Doomed from the start, Pecola becomes the innocent victim of everyone around her. Toni Morrison has captured the evils of racism, incest, and abuse, and shown their very tragic results through Pecola in a very haunting, yet unfortunately all too real, manner. Without a doubt, one of the most emotional stories I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful - absolutely beautiful","review":"Great writing comes from all forms of life, and Morrison proves that African American woman, and their stories, are great examples of the wonderful talent that can be spawned from any writing communityI loved this book because it gave a terrific account of what life was like, from the perspective of a lil' African American girlWhat I love is how Morrisson was able to capture serious and traumatic moments of life, but from the thinking of a little girl, whose personality has not yet been writtenfor anyone looking for great first person writing, from an unusual perspective, then look no furtherHAPPY READING!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerfully depressing","review":"I have seldom felt as depressed as I did the day I finished reading \\"The Bluest Eye\\"; not because I was sad it was finished, but because it is simply an overwhelmingly depressing book. So, if you are fond of books that make you feel this way, you will love it. Personally I hated it for this reason, but I give it an extra star because at least it made me feel at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"She won for this book?","review":"A novella or a collection of vignettes? No plot, just a theme, incestuous sexual abuse among unfortunate African-Americans in the mid 20th century, and childhood anecdotal reminisces, didn\`t satisfy me. Though filled with wonderfully creative metaphors and similes that were worth applauding, poetic writing simply does not suffice for story. Maybe one day Pecola, Claudia, or Pauline might be fleshed out and made the heroine of a novel with beginning, middle, and climax, which will intrigue with its complexities, but 'Blue' was more like reading a writer's notebook containing sketches of potential characters for future novels. I've read other books by T. Morrison that were hung on a plot... like The Song of Solomon and Paradise, which I would recommend to readers who want more."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best deal","review":"Book was in good condition as the seller stated, but the pages are yellowing from age which makes me think I payed way too much for it. It also took forever to be delivered. I ordered several things off Aamazon that day and every seller managed to get me my orders within a week in a halfor sooner, this order took over 3 weeks. I needed this book for a class, and barely got it in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Morrison, I was moved!","review":"After reading other reviews about this text, I had to add a few comments. What this book is not: It's not an 'easy' read. It's not a 'simple' message. What it is: It is enlightening. It IS thought-provoking. And, it is moving.In Ms. Morrison's afterward (1993), she suggests that the book may not move everyone--but touch many. I agree. It will not move everyone. But for anyone who has experienced any part of what Pecola experiences (especially as a child), you will be moved. And, if you are fortunate enough to have some turnaround in life, you will be moved to help others (again, especially children), so that they have abundant self-worth and self-appreciation.Ms. Morrison, I was moved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"I first read this book a few years ago and was surprised by thepower and beauty in Morrison's words. After reading the book again, Iam again struck by how much she can say in this little book. Pecola is a pathetic figure that makes one truly question their place in the world. The idea that to be beautiful one must look a certain way is an idea Pecola struggles with every day in her search for \\"the bluest eyes\\" as many of us in today's world also struggle to be happy with our identities. I enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very tear jerking story SH pd.1","review":"I read this novel and it was excellent. It had a wonderful plot. Although the story was very detailed, it captured what was going on so anyone could understand. Some parts were very tear jerking. At moments it made me realize what a good life I have had. Hearing all the abuse that went on makes me thankful. I could not imagine being abandoned and then abused. For the two small children in the book that were abused by Cholly and watched him abuse their mother I am sure that they could never get those memories out of their heads. Pecola, that poor young girl, she seemed so helpless. I felt like jumping in the book and taking her away from the awful place. Overall this was an excellent piece. I could read it over and over again. I can see how this book got the Nobel Piece Prize, it was great. I enjoyed reading \\"The Bluest Eye\\" by Toni Morrison."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Ever Read!","review":"In 1984 I happened upon The Bluest Eye in my high school library. It literally changed the way I saw the world, beauty and my 16 year old self. How pleased I was to learn that Oprah had picked this forceful book! It is not an easy read, it is not a happy, sunshine, everything-is-going-to-be-okay read, but it is realistic read about race relations and the power of sex and the power of hatred. I've read the negative reviews and wonder why people are so defensive about the racism - look at the setting's time and when the book was written. And since this was Toni Morrison's FIRST novel it was impossible for her to \\"Sell Out\\" in its creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like I was there","review":"I am so grateful to Toni Morrison for taking me into a world and perspective so vaguely perceived by me before reading her book. The Bluest Eye let me understand a new realm, from the inside out, with wonderful resonance and clarity. Thank you, Toni!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I found this book to be a masterpiece of Pecola's struggle.","review":"The Bluest Eye is a brilliant allegory. Morrison depicts Pecola's life as both a simple yet complex life. Pecola is an average child, but the tribulations in her life have made her an exception. Morrison has once again made us think and really appreciate good literature. YOU GO GIRL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the finest book i've ever read in my life","review":"this book is a perfect thing. toni gets there so completely. the thing itself seems to be guiding her; coming through her to reveal the tiny haunted majesty that is the Bluest Eye. the book is flawless. tears began to flow from page 1 and didn't stop coming. thank you , toni. bless you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbound","review":"I was spellbound listening to this book on tape a few years ago. The author narrated the story herself, and her voice and obvious love of her characters held me in a spell that couldn't be broken. I can't tell you how pleased this story is rediscovered. It has stayed with me over the years. I think of Pecola often, she seems so real, she could be any of us. How many of us have looked out at the world and thought 'if only'. I felt so honored to have a glimpse into this world, thank you Toni Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed","review":"I was so sure I'd love this book. I'd heard so much about it on [T.V.]. However, although the story line held my interest (it was in no way spellbinding), and the prose was sufficient, I was very disappointed that Toni Morrison went to such lengths to include bad language and disgusting imagery. I was sickened, not by the subject matter, but by the gutter-dredging manner in which she presents it. Toni went out of her way to get it in there, necessary or not (and it was not).The story could have been told without all the sensationalism of filth. I finished the book (this book with no end) and dropped it in the return slot of my local library. Maybe someone will enjoy it. Personally, I will never waste my money on Toni Morrison again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing book","review":"Let me begin by saying that I am an educated caucasian woman with a masters degree. I live in a town that has many African Americans, many of whom are close friends of mine. I was forced to read this book in an undergraduate literature class, and since then I have never been able to get this disturbing book out of my head. Bravo to Toni Morrison for being such an excellent writer, for a bad writer couldn't have stirred up such horror in me. I do not criticize her writing talent as much as I do her subject matter. It was horribly graphic and left me with a very disturbing feeling every time I read it. In fact, we were instructed to write a paper on this book and I refused. I spoke with the professor and was given permission to write about another book. Again, Toni Morrison is a brilliant writer. However this book left me with nothing but hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"It was my first time reading something by Toni Morrison, and was sad to say that this book was very depressing, it jumped around alot, and she was overly descriptive. I wasn't sure if I was reading about snow capped mountains or the wicks of candles, when she used to convey different things about the way a person appeared, it was very distracting. The moral of the story was true to life and sad. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and not well put together","review":"I had high expectations of reading this book I had heard rave reviews about and was looking forward to a wonderful experience that I had heard accompanied all of Toni Morrisons books. I was deeply disappointed. The story lines were hard to follow and there was very little closure in any of the story lines. After reading the last page I was disenchanted and will never pick up another one of Ms. Morrison's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"too depressing to finish","review":"i always finish reading a book, even if it's rubbish. but i quit a third of the way thru. i didn't need to hear any more sexual abuse descriptions. otherwise i felt it was a well written book.not anti-white. it highlights important issues.thanks for listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"Product arrived as described.

It is abridged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Expected","review":"I guess it's the hype of being an Oprah book that caused me to make the purchase, though I first read the online reviews to determine whether it was a worthy read. I am not black, but I do have blue eyes. I understood the story as it was written, but I was disappointed with Oprah's choice - that this novel was another black history and oppression story we have to read about again. Let's move forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeased","review":"Have read many of Oprah's choices for book of the month and thoroughly enjoyed almost all of them. This was not one of them. The book was redundant, repeating the same story, through different people's lives, yet providing very little insight into those lives. With the constant changing of viewpoints, the characters remained undeveloped and vague. I wanted to know more and yet less also. The book was a disappointment with lots of potential, just too much garbage. Much preferred \\"What looks like Crazy, on an Ordinary Day.\\" The content was also sad, but the characters found inner strength and persevered, unlike Morrison's character that goes insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"This book was a complete letdown! I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all of the other books by Toni Morrison but this one din't do it for me! I had a very hard time getting through to the end. Do not reccomend it to anyone!

Read this well-written but hopeless downer about racism, rape, vomit, and suffering, with no redemption for anyone and no possibility of change. Ye gods."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Do Make A Difference","review":"I read the book in one sitting. I love how it's written - the beginning draws you in and you continue reading with hopes of understanding Pecola's story. The story shows the impact of unkind words and actions. The book takes you through the life of each character - all I really wanted to know about was Pecola - but in the end I realized in order to know Pecola, I had to know the people who affected her life. The story shows how words and actions compound and how people can be made to feel inadequate. In searching for adequacy they may hurt the very people they love. It's a survival thing - survival of the mind - which in the end, Pecola was unable to do. The story is sad and it doesn't shed a lot of hope. It proves you can distroy someone with words - maybe not with your words alone, but your words on top of other's. Maybe you were the first person to say hurtful things - maybe the last - it doesn't matter what order - the accumulation equals affirmation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The idea of beauty","review":"I really enjoyed this novel. Morrison creates many interlocking stories that join together to create a masterpiece. Pecola's idea of beauty and her desire to be beautiful through having blue eyes creates a powerful message about the treatment and class of blacks during this time. She is considered ugly by everyone above her, and she feels the only way to change her ugliness is to have something all of the others have: Blue Eyes. This compelling story brings tears to your eyes from the treatment these young girls endured. I really liked this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lofty message, but the delivery falls short","review":"This first novel is a brave attempt to describe the longing for happiness through beauty, as perceived by a black child in miserable circumstances. Miss Morrison links this longing to the disadvantage of race, but I think it is a desire that is universal. Ugliness, misery, poverty, and incest are not limited to a specific race. The fragmented thread of the story unfortunately took away the power of the author's message.However, Miss Morrison more than compensated readers with subsequent works like 'Beloved' and 'The Song of Solomon'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cruelest emotion: Self-hatred","review":"Although the writing was not as strong as some of Morrison's other works; i.e, Song of Solomon and Beloved, The Bluest Eye is thematically very strong. The main character deeply suffers from extreme self-loathing and Morrison carries out the effects of racial discrimination to the ultimate degree. The book resonated in this reader's mind for days afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"upsetting homophobia","review":"This book was ruined for me by it's intense homophobia. If you are gay, you will resent the hateful way you are portrayed in The Bluest Eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Life from The Bluest Eye?","review":"Although Morrison has a sad story to tell of Piccola, her descriptions of food and sex are revolting. She describes graphic sex and violence to keep in line with America's obsession with this sex and violence. The book would have been wonderfully refreshing without it. Instead, it is typical and predictable. I wish her book would have given more of a window for acceptance in a world of racism. The Bluest Eye gives a very sterotypical view of white people as black haters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was more than awful","review":"I read this book and was so upset. It had a very hard and painful theme and should not have been touted so highly. I really was sad and depressed after reading this so called novel.

The only reason it received its accolades is because our society mistakes \\"shocking\\" for \\"profound\\". The two are not the same. Graphic descriptions of children being incestuously raped does not make a book profound or deep or meaningful. It can make it perverted, however -- especially when the relativistic message is that we should all come to understand and empathize with those poor rapists, hookers, and sexually perverted preachers, etc. It's all stereotype and cliche, not at all well written. Sorry, I'm interested in real literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist","review":"I think it's terrible that Oprah Winfrey would recommend a book as anti-white as this. It's not as bad as some \\"black\\" literature that blames everything on white people, but it's close. It's very reactionary and unfairly critical.

Interesting and Educational","review":"I finished this book in about a week. It was very deep and took me to a place and time I've never been. Yes, I've been through Loraine, Ohio BUT not in the 1940's nor as a Black. Wake up, readers! For many of you, yes this is a culture shock. BUT it did happen and is still happening today in the 21st century. Racial Prejudice--not only ugly children and people.This book's main character, Pecola, was a fighter that gave up the fight. She was violated. A child violated. This angers me but in today's society, like it or not, IT HAPPENS! Doesn't matter your color, children are being hurt yet this is a wonderful book to warn you of what our children are still going through in the school yards, in the class rooms, at the lockers in school.Ms. Morrison, wonderful job and my hat is tipped to you! Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"This book is well written, in that it gives an uncompromising portrait of a sad life of poverty, racism, and rape. But that's all. There is no hope here. None. Not a scrap. We might as well all give up. What good can this book do for anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"This is more of a comment than a review. I read The Bluest Eye a few years ago. It's a quick read and depressing. My comment is in response to some other reviews on this page. Whether a reviewer enjoys a book or not, s/he should comment on the content as well as the feelings invoked. If I read a review from someone who didn't seem to have read the book, it isn't very useful to me. The idea that Toni Morrison targets white people in this book is wrong. Anyone who reads this book will notice the scarcity of white characters. Pecola suffers at the hands of relatives and other children, most of whom happen to be black (with one exception). Mainly she suffers from the idea that she isn't beautiful because she doesn't fit a certain image. I'm sorry to say that the concept of beauty Morrison portrays is all too real. Disbelief in that concept of beauty doesn't lessen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bluest Disappointment","review":"There is no doubt that Toni Morrison is a wonderfully gifted writer with a brilliant mind. She possesses very strong opinions which give light to here broad insight and amzazing intellect. However, some thoughts are better conveyed through an essay (or several essays), as opposed to a disorganized and unfocused novel. \\"The Bluest Eye\\" was a series of interesting philosophies helter-skelterly mingled with a depressing story of a girl's incestuous relationship with her father. Disappointing to say the least, I give this novel two thumbs waaaay down."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST REPULSIVE BOOK EVER","review":"I had to read this book for 9th grade english. It was so terrible. Half the time someone is having sex or being rapped. I never saw any of the good things about this book, and when I told my english teacher about the book(she has never read it) she told me to write a letter to the school board to have them remove it from the list. So thats what I am doing. I cant believe how much sex was in this book. Dont give this book to people under 16! Its sooooooo dirty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the Afterword","review":"Personally, I don't understand why certain people feel the need to turn a less that mediocre book into what they would like to pass off to the rest of us as a great work of literature.

I kept at it, hoping it would get more interesting but, alas, it was boring to the end. There was only one other of Oprah's choices that I really didn't care for (can't recall now which one...guess it really WAS forgetable). A difinate 'thumbs down' from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather clean my bathroom........","review":"I have read other books written by Toni Morrison, and they have all been really good stories (Sula was awesome), but this one.....not so good. I felt that the book was a jumbled mess. To me, the story seemed not to be about Pecola Breedlove, but more about the other characters. I understand that each character, in relation to Pecola, had a story to tell, but I never got to KNOW her. Soaphead Church did not deserve to have a whole chapter written about him, when he ONLY had a few lines of dialog with her. I must admit, though, that Ms. Morrison's use of description is superb and it allows a reader to form the story within their head. Oh, wait, one more thing, I found the book to be a wee bit boring. The first chapter grabs you, but after a while, it's a chore to read the rest. I hate to say, she is such a good writer, but this book I would pass on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ...","review":"After reading \\"Beloved\\", I tried really hard to like this book, but just couldn't. I was so relieved when it ended. As other reviewers suggest, it is disjointed, boring in parts, and simply not a very good read. I'd encourage readers to try other Morrison books though, she has come a long way since this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Earth-Moving","review":"I must admit, I truely wanted to believe Morrison's book would be a good book. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. Other than Morrison's poetic nature, I didn't see anything that unique or profound. It was simply OK. This was the second chance I gave Morrison in winning me over. The first attempt at reading Jazz was a horrific undertaking. (Even Oprah doesn't try to defend it.) But still, I wanted to enjoy her work and tried The Bluest Eye. The only difference was that at least it was coherent and I could follow the plot. Personally, I find her interviews much more rich and fascinating. She should try writing a non-muddled autobiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never have I read a book this full","review":"This book caused more tears than I had ever known. Sadness and pain that words cannot capture. Revealing the lie that beauty can be. Peeling back not only the layers of racism, but of society's obession with outer beauty, as some insane standard of what makes some one beautiful. And others worthless. Each page was read in silence with absolute care, absorbed in this girls search for blue eyes, so that her struggle became my own; Some were so painful that it took all energy to read on, but I did. I finished it over a year ago but it's words still haunt me. My world will never be the same. I could go on for hours, and never reach words to describe this book. I can only think of one. Perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ BOOK!!","review":"\\"The Bluest Eye\\" is a candid tale about the reality of prejudice in our society.

It was choppy, with little substance. It was sick and twisted. The lesson(s) were hard to come by. I had a difficult time finishing it, and probably wouldn't have, had I not felt obligated by my class. I don't recommend it to anyone who is searching for a nice read, with a distinct plot line. This isn't really a story; the connections are weak. It's not my favorite...by a long shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many pages, so little sense","review":"I found this book to be to be a poorly organized, almost incomprehensible collection of random stories drawn together only by their inclusion in the same book. Once again, Toni Morrison puts an assortment of diatribes and racial angst into book form and masquerades it as literature with a moral message. A profound disappointment awaits anyone who reads this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious pornography","review":"Yeah, I really wasnted to read a pretentious, unrealistic book that culminated in a drunk guy raping his little daughter and the girl getting pregnant and going insane. Toni Morrison has no mastery over ther stream-of-consciousness technique, therfore, everything she writes sound fake and contrived. I'm not saying all books should be clean, or that they should all have clear plots and a classic narrative structure, I'm only asking that ifa writer deviates fromthe norn, they od it for a reason other than making themsleves look smart. Morrison has, to usea cliched but accurate phraser, the subtlety of a sledgehammer, whcih makes a less-than-bright reader feel smart and sophisticated when the can figure out the symbolism of an insane balck girl walking around flapping her arms. Hmmm, does she wish she could fly? Gee, I wonder.This is a stupid, rpetentious book, which may be why it has done so well on the bookclubs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This was my first venture with Toni Morrison.

Some of the people in the book were written about very well.I read this book after seeing it on Oprahs lest and would recommend it to anyone.The only reason it got 4 stars was because there were a few times that I had to go back and reread a few sections to fully understand what was going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I was assigned this book nine years ago during a women's literature class. The story moved me in ways that I can't explain. I grew up in a solidly middle class (primarily white) community, and Toni Morrison introduced me to a little girl who was simply foreign. I was haunted by The Bluest Eye. Bits and pieces of the story would come to mind at odd times over the next year or so, until finally I decided to visit the small town in Ohio where The Bluest Eye is based. So, about 7 years ago, I made that trip. Now each time that I re-read the book (probably twenty times over the past nine years) I have a very solid picture in my mind of where this story unfolds. I remember when Oprah first chose a Toni Morrison book for her club -- I believe it was Song of Solomon. I said at that time (and actually noted it in my Amazon.com review) that she should introduce America to the Bluest Eye.

I felt that the heroine Rosemunde was a shallow character. She supposedly had this heart stopping love for Patrick Leslie and as soon as an osbstacle comes between the two, like loss of memory, she splits. Whatever, happened to that love that was going to last forever for Rosemunde, obviously she wasn't in love with Patrick Leslie that much. The guy she winds up finally marrying is a narcotic stalker. Definitely,not one of her better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable","review":"Unfotunately, reading about Rosamund was like reading about Skye O'Malley all over again. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the O'Malley saga, I'm experiencing a certain ennui in having it repeated all over again. The descriptions of clothing and food in the \\"Friarsgate\\" series are practically verbatim those of the previous novels. I was looking forward to a refreshing new story line, but I've been disappointed by the obvious predictability. Perhaps Ms.Small will surprise me and excite with future sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a critic \\"until now\\"","review":"I have never considered myself a critic of novels.

However when the male love interest in the book turned out to be the oversexed Patrick Leslie, I threw the damn thing against the wall. Is it too much to hope for a fresh male character in a new book? Must characters like the Earls of Glenkirk be recycled ad nauseam? If you haven't read other books by Small, this might be fresh and fun.

This album is far different from any of Satyricon's previous releases. The conceptual themes of past albums \\"Shadowthrone\\", and \\"Dark Medeval Times\\" are no longer present. Rebel is much more stripped down sound while maintaining a dynamic sound that sets Saytricon apart from it's Black Metal predecessors. My favorite songs would have to be \\"Havok Vultures\\"( w/ a cameo from Ferniz or DarkThrone), \\"Prime Evil Renaissance\\", and the blast beat rythms of \\"Supersonic Journey\\". Rebel also includes a couple of subtle interludes in between songs, allowing you to rest before your senses get pummeled again with Satyricon's brand of Dark Metal. Most fans either hate or love this album. This albums an aquired taste.I myself listen to it with a sense of awe, as one may listen to symphony or orchestra music. Does it rock? Hell yeah!

His mother had one, and raved about it. Well, compared to nothing, there is definitely an appriciable difference. I can't argue there. It does wonders for removing the smallest of particles from the air. So, very good for allergies.That said, there are some problems. Any lint in the air tends to start it zapping. It will sound like an electric fence cooking a weed... for days if you don't get around to cleaning it more thoroughly than the guide suggests you'd ever need to. It doesn't remove heavy dust or lint from the air effectively either. So you won't even notice the difference when it's time to clean your house or appartment.If you're suffering from indoor allergies, don't mind cleaning every two weeks (not every 3 months), and can stand the zapping noise on a regular basis, it's worth it.

That is Ionic Pros warranty. Have written letters, and tried to speak with a supervisor to no avail.

I bought this product over a year ago and used it when I first started acting up... due to sneezing. It eventually went away and I haven't used it till now again. I just bought a dog and started getting itchy. After using this I finally got rid of the itchiness and am back to my normal life.This product can only be used in one primary room, it does cover a lot of space though. Easy to clean and not that hard to figure out.only problem is that it releases this weird smell sometimes like some sort of mist, but I guess you get used to it.HEPA filter thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product!","review":"Same as another reviewer, this only worked about 1 and 1/2 months for me...supposedly too late to return!

I also experienced the cleaning light coming on a day after being exhaustively cleaned-according to the directions.I've contacted customer service, and have yet to get a reply; given others' experiences with the customer service at the company, I'm fairly skeptical.I expected more from the amount paid for this piece. Don't bother with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with negative reviews","review":"It is really frustrating to spend good money on something to have it flake out after the warranty runs out. I have had similar problems like those described. The unit worked very well for about a year and a half and then the buzzing started in earnest. Previously this meant that a quick cleaning was indicated, but now nothing will eradicate the buzzing. We had to move it to the spare bedroom (where it doesn't do much good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have both. Ionic Breeze is my choice.","review":"I thought I would save money buying this product. I also have an IONIC BREEZE that is 3 years older. The ionic breeze collects \\"considerably\\" more debris and has worked trouble free for over 3 years. Both produce a sound if they need cleaning. I clean them routinely, usually before any sound is produced. After three months the Ionic Pro Turbo started to produce the high whining sound it is supposed to when needing cleaning, but it will not go away.The IONIC BREEZE is a more robust and reliable product, and if the collector blades are any indication, the IONIC BREEZE removed \\"considerably more\\" particles from the air in the room.I wanted to save $150.00 and went with the Ionic Pro Turbo and it was a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"I ordered 3 units. They arrived on time. But I had to return 2 of the units. The cleaning light came on and stayed on. The third unit seems to be working fine. Although I would have thought the light to notify me to clean the blades would have turned on by now it still hasn't. I'm just keeping a eye on the dust collection and cleaning the unit as needed. I can tell you this unit does do a great job of cleaning the air. I use it in my husbands office where not only he spends his day but our pet dragon lizard and large gerbil are housed. Since using you can enter that room and not know as soon as you walk in that some sort of pets live in there. Also extremely quiet to operate. One other bonus it does take out the pollen that has been in the air the last 4 weeks. You can actually feel the difference breathing in that room compared to breathing in the other rooms.

Unfortunately, it started turning itself off after a few seconds even after repeated cleanings. The only suggestion the company had was to purchase some new blades. They refused to replace or repair the unit. The concept is great but the product is only as good as the company producing it. We will certainly never purchase another of their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tough ending, but recommended read","review":"A well written novel. It is engaging. It is not fast paced, but it also does not plod. As a previous reviewer stated, if you are looking for someone to cheer for, this is not the book. Initially, the ending of the novel was frustrating too me. However, as I have thought since about the book, I have been fascinated by the open-endedness and the ambiguity. Sometimes life doesn't have heroes. Sometimes individuals feel like they are forced to choose one side or another, with both sides being unsatisfying. This book captures this dilemma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education and Community","review":"Dr Dianne Gereluk has written one of the clearest and most scholarly books on the topic ofEducation and Community.

Recently I read A Healing Family and found that I really liked it a lot. Yukari's illustrations were beautiful. This book made me feel closer to Oe's family. It is very heart-warming.At the time I read it, I was in the process of deciding whether to get my wisdom teeth extracted by a dentist or an oral surgeon. I heard that my face would be bruised and swollen, my jaws unhinged, etc. after the surgery. It was quite unnerving just to think about it. Then I read that Hikari has to make weekly visits to the dentist, and that his epileptic pills make his gum terribly swollen. I felt that I am in a much much better situation than some people. It was a consolation to read this book.One thing I don't quite like about most of Kenzaburo's books is that he refers to a lot of other European writers and their works, which I find hard to understand.

I guess it says something about these guys, or else I'm just bored. I don't know any of the other music these guys are responsible for, but this is a great cd, if nothing else then for the sheer originality of it. There's something edgy about the music that keeps it from ever getting even close to \\"wilco-melodic,\\" but there are some great melodies here, all subtle and disjointed, and the vocals, like the guitars and assorted noises, just make perfect sense after a few listens(listen to track number two on repeat about 14 times and you'll see what I mean). The precussion creates a very hollow atmospheric effect that feels like tom waits at times. This cd feels like it has a sense of purpose.

This movie however, when it was near to becoming a real riveting thriller just took all the wrong moves. The characters can be likable but they're not giving a lot of development that its very easy to stop caring for them. Worst of all, the film takes a turn for the melodrama that doesn't fit in and isn't at all very successful.The cast is fine and the premise is more than interesting, but when it comes to the parts that are suppose to be shocking, scary, and disturbing it just comes off weak and, dare I say it, almost boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Insights","review":"I was a little disappointed in that the cover says 58 Kids Sermons from the Gospel of Matthew.

The descriptions of the travel are very well written. The experiences aboard will be appreciated by addicted boaters and non-boaters alike. This is an adventure story.

No complaints in that dept.My only problem is with the design.It doesn't fit my hand very well and tends to shift around. The thumb pad is totally extraneous, and its hot, and tends to make my hand sweat. I would definitely buy a product that had the same brushing surface but on a stick instead.

Everything I've read by him thus far has been very impressive, and this novel was no exception. I really think he belongs on the top shelf of crime fiction authors. John Becker, the FBI agent who features in this tale (and others in the series), is a fascinating, memorable character, and Wiltse weaves a mesmerizing, addictive plot into the mix. This one has plenty of political intrique, an international angle, and some horribly grisly crimes. Skillful plotting ensures that you will read this novel very quickly, caught up in both the crime angle and the endearing elements of Becker's character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lila rules","review":"I guess the true power of this novel lies in its ability to be interesting on every single page.

Here's to Lila getting the attention she deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving...","review":"This novel had me intrigued at page one. The entire concept of moving a house, moving a memory, moving a life resonated throughout the novel. It is a journey, one that the reader feels a part of, one that the reader cares about. Mira, Kat, Ray, Wesley, all visable characters. And the house, it has a life of its own, filled with happy and sorrowful memories.

A shame it is out of print--but I've seen copies used & in remainder bins at bookstores so do yourself a favor & keep looking! This book will make you shudder, weep, cringe, but ultimately leaves you w/a feeling of hope. All the pieces are good, but standouts include Terri Windling's, Charles De Lint's, Ellen Steiber's, & Munro Sickafoose's. Another wonderful aspect is that Windling ignores genre boundaries & hence you see authors such as Sharon Olds & Anne Sexton represented as well.

Polysynthesis is covered in great detail, as is almost every rare grammatical structure. The sheer scope of this book is tremendous. Mithun claims to include every attested North American language, and I believe her. Also, the extensive references (almost 150 pages) make it easy to locate information on specific languages (like full grammars, phonologies, et cetera). Highly recommended to anyone interested in linguistics, and a must-read for any conlanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shop vac HEPA dry cartridge filter 903-34-00","review":"I received this filter very soon after I ordered.The filter was the exact part I neededI was very pleased with the service I received.Thank youDavid"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

Her characters are normal people who make imperfect choices and have to deal with the good and bad consequences.In this book, I think that she jumped a little too much and didn't focus on character development as much as she could have. She established the main characters quite well, then had them change their behaviour too quickly, without enough of an explanation.I did enjoy that she set a good portion of the book in Spain and did try to capture a different atmosphere besides the usual English background that she uses for her other books.This is a great book to read on your first days of vacation or after a stressful week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nick Nack price guide for parlor collectors.","review":"The book looks very promising at first glance.

My daughter enjoys this book because it is a humorous Wolf's versions of the \\"Three Little Pigs\\" her favorite children's classic. I like it because it presented a great sarcastic though honest parady of contemparary Media and American culture. You see according to the wolf, He really didn't mean to blow down the little pig's houses it was all an honest mistake, and the part about him being a big bad wolf? Just a media creation to jazz up his trial and sell more newspapers. Its rare to find a childrens book now a days that are even a little bit creative but this one is pure genius both in it's simplicity but also in the way it portrays the world around us. An outstanding childrens book for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lostprophets - Burn Burn","review":"I've been a Lostprophets fan since the beginning, before Fake Sound of Progress was released. The Fake Sound of Progress was an awesome album, with quality songs like 'For Sure' and 'Ode to Summer.' But, 'Burn Burn' is by far the Lostprophets' best song yet. 'Last Train Home' is also quite good, but 'Burn Burn' blows everything they've ever done out of the water. Also, another good Lostprophets song you should download is 'Lately,' a song they played on their 2001 world tour. But, 'Burn Burn' is an exeptional song, definitely one NOT to be missed. If you fell in love with The Fake Sound of Progress, buy this single. Their new album, Start Something, comes out on January 12, 2004 in the US and January 8, 2004 in the UK.

I want to buy FULL seasons. I don't want to waste 30$ buying half of a season and have to wait another year to buy the other half.Getting out these seasons are taking FOREVER.I'm still going to buy them because I love TBAA but they need to put more features on the dvd and get them out quicker.I just don't understand why shows that are currently in their SECOND season (like Laguna Beach) have the dvd out for their first season and TBAA, whose show aired for 9 years, is lagging behind.Anyway, this show will continue being one of the greatest on my list...right next to The X-Files. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched by an Angel","review":"Always enjoy watching Touched by an Angel...good, uncomplicated stories that don't take a whole lot of concentration when you're doing other things.

But Paramount Home Video is showing its contempt for the fans by releasing the third season of TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL in two volumes, thereby \\"maximizing profits\\" and squeezing more money out of its fans. If this outrage works, Season #4 will be in three volumes and ultimately one episode at a time. You can be certain if this shameless gimmick works other video companies will follow suit. This is the same company that releases never-ending \\"new\\" editions of the STAR TREK movies and series at the top end of the price scale. Few other studios would have the nerve to release a TV series at a list price of $139.98. They're also releasing the GUNSMOKE series in two volumes.

As well I noticed that some of the socket holes were not centered on the bar leaving the socket side wall thinner on one side.

Grandma's pony has far fewer things that could go wrong with it, and probably could be repaired by anyone with an upholsterer's needle and a thimble.

It's pretty life like but it's pretty hard to get it to fake gallop. It's only done it a couple of times. It also has trouble recognizing the direction it's being called. Overall it's very cute. I'll admit that it hasn't gotten much play time, though. It's just one of those things that's purchased for the shock value on Christmas and played with a few times after and that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fur real is for real","review":"The fur real pony is an awesome toy for any age child. The interaction between toy and child is a joy to watch. The price may be alittle high but the childs face when opening it as a gift is priceless. It could stand to have more features about it because we all know a childs attention span and this deosnt keep them entertained for as long as I would have liked. THe head and neck on the pony is kinda fragile everyone Ive seen displayed in stores doesnt work, I guess because of so many hands on it. But it tells me that I may not have it more than a year or so. Other than that I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasbro didn't give me my money back for defective toy","review":"When we went to put this pony together on christmas eve, the neck made a horrible noise and lilted to the left. It was horrible. We had to give it to our kids like that because there was no time to fix it and I thought we would be able to replace it. Hasbro said that they were discontinued so they couldn't replace it and they didn't send me the price I had paid for the pony, but the price it was on clearance after christmas. It was a horrible experience, and though a hasbro rep said she would refund the other 100 dollars, she never did, and they made us send them the head of the pony and dispose of the body ourselves. My kids were sad and it was a really bad experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Tribute Album","review":"If you are a La Bouche and Melanie Thornton fan, this album is for you.

The authors had a good topic to write about but none of the characters were fully developed. At certain points throughout the book you thought a great story was about to develop then the subject was just dropped. Too much detail was put into miniscuule things such as carpet or armchairs a bigger story could have been deve3loped in these situations but unfortunately all you had the pleasure of reading about was a \\"lip-shaped chair\\" I actually got this book for a \\"bargain\\" price but I truly regret it now.

In this case playing this cd a zillion times has finally worn me down. I must confess, this is a good cd. Did you hear what I said, a good cd, but not great. There is a difference make no mistake about it.I have been a Ray fan just about all my life(not quite all of my years which are 56 but most of them). R.A. is a very talented trumpet player, make no mistake about that. As is the case of so many musicians, it's hard to always please everyone with every record. Sometimes you will try new things on your records and some of these things will work and be accepted and others will bomb. The key word here is to try with a capital \\"T\\". I am more than convinced that Ray is a people pleaser.For this cd Ray choose an excellent repitore to performn. He had a lot of fine sidemen to play in his band. He hired is old stand by in the name of Don Simpson to pin the arrangements and I think most of them worked fairly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT THE CD FOR YOU, SORRY","review":"When I looked at the songs tracks of this cd I thought, awesome. When I bought this cd and started playing the tracks, I thought how sorry can it get. I seems like Don Simpson, the arranger did a poor job arranging.

The authors should have stuck to saddle seat and there might be no issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent starter book!","review":"This is a nice, short readable book that could be quite helpful for Evangelicals and others who wish to understand the Catholic teaching regarding the Eucharist. Mark Shea demonstrates the holes in may of the objections to that teaching that he discovered when examining it as an evangelical himself. Far from being a scary polemic as many apologetic works can be, this is good-natured discussion of the subject.It's a short book, but a good introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent defense of Apostolic Tradition.","review":"The author does an excellent job of explaining the scriptural and logical reasons why the Bible alone does not contain the fullness of the faith.

Our lord who is present in the Eucharist. This is what Catholics believe Real Presence,This means Jesus is there. Body, Blood ,Soul and Divinity. There is no longer one crumb that is bread,there is not one drop that is wine. If you are Catholic read this, if you are not read this , it just might open your eyes. This thing we call the Real Presence is penetrating, uplifting And will challenge your faith and mind. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AN UNEVEN EFFORT............","review":"This CD is by far not the worst Reba has ever done. Take almost any one of her 90s projects and that will be the case. This one is uneven containing some traditional country and some of the pop filler she's been recording for years now. Cathy's Clown is excellent for her. \\"Til Love Comes Again\\" is a traditional tune with steel and fiddles but she's done better. \\"It Always Rains on Saturday\\" is merely o.k. \\"Walk On\\" is outstanding. I love that. \\"Little Girl\\" is lacklaster. The rest...I won't comment on because I'm not impressed by Reba at Sixteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET RID OF THAT SAXOPHONE!!!!","review":"The saxophone on most of these songs ruins what could have been great country songs if they had been produced in the traditional vein. I especially like the last cut \\"A New Love\\" and wish it had been released as a single. This is strange because I don't usually like Reba's fast songs but there was something really neat and catchy about this one. \\"Walk On\\" is good too except for that Saxophone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ONE HAD POSSIBILITIES","review":"This one has some good stuff on it but not enough for me to give it more than 2 stars. \\"Cathy's Clown\\" is a good cover, something Reba usually don't do well. I also like \\"A New Love\\", \\"Walk On\\", and \\"It Always Rains on Saturday\\". The standout is \\"Till Love Comes Again\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MERRY-GO-ROUND THAT MAKES YOU DIZZY!!","review":"Reba vascillates a lot with this one. If she is analagous to a sixteen year old with this effort then she hit the nail on the head because most sixteen year olds I know are very wishy-washy in all aspects of their lives. This CD is representative of that. We start off strong, then things quickly take a turn for the worse. I don't know from one minute to the next when I will be able to disembark from the merry-go-round of mixed up material here. I hear a saxophone sometimes, a steel guitar sometimes, a fiddle another time. SOme of it is good. Most of it is not!! I've heard better from McEntire!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE ARE SOME GOOD SONGS ON HERE BUT SHE'S DONE BETTER!","review":"Reba has done way better.....(For My Broken Heart...the prime example). This is an album that contains some good songs....\\"A New Love\\" (one of the few uptempo songs I like even though this one could hardly be classified as country, \\"Walk On\\" which would be dandy if it would have had a bluegrass arrangement and \\"Cathy's Clown\\" which features Reba in one of her most endearing performances. I also enjoyed thoroughly \\"Til Love Comes Again\\" and \\"It Always Rains on Saturday\\". I did not like \\"Somebody up There LIkes Me\\", \\"Little Girl\\" \\"Say the Word\\" or \\"Am I the Only One Who Cares\\". Two stars is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very yellow, didn't last long..","review":"They worked good, while they worked. One of them burned out in just over a month.

I would suggest a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Put a set of 85 watt yellowstars in Hella 500 drivers and love them. You get some yellow in the center but whiter light to the sides. Perfect for reducing glare in foul conditions but still putting out good light. These are wired to only come on with my highbeams. These are on the misses car and she has a hard time in rain and snow with visability. So she has 500 fogs with 55 watt opilux yellows and they are good. Maybe I should have went with the 55 watt yellowstars for her fogs. Used to run piaa bulbs and loved the super whites. So last year we tried their plasma ion and they didn't last long enough to justify that price tag. If you want just a touch of yellow go with these. If you want more go with the optilux. I am running the H7 optilux in my Hella fogs on my car. You will notice a difference when the ground is wet.

It does fit earlier generations (at least 2nd gen). So, I gave the device away to a niece who has a 2nd generation iPod.

TERRIBLE PRODUCT."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album grips your soul and never lets go...........","review":".... This is one of the rare works that you could play over and over, and never get tired of listening to the fresh, varied tracks. I thought that 'Diesel and Dust' was outstanding when it first came out, only to be eclipsed by Blue Sky Mining and then this career-defining album. Midnight Oil's eco-consciousness and empathy toward the plight of the Aborigines is less apparent in this work when compared with some of their earlier works, but the earthiness and musical-maturity of these tunes has few peers in the history of rock-and roll. This is one of the few albums ever produced without a weak song on it. My personal favorite is the earthy, richly-textured 'Outbreak of Love'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't miss with Midnight Oil","review":"Another excellent album from an incredible band. You'll be hard pressed to find a track you don't like. If this is your first time listening, be prepared for a wonderful library of spectacular songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong release by Midnight Oil","review":"This CD is somewhat slower in pace from other Midnight Oil releases, but this does not detract from the quality of 'Earth and Sun and Moon'. This CD was released in the period when Midnight Oil was enjoying its success and limelight.Four songs on this release are standouts, they are 1. Renaissance Man 2. Truganini 3. In The Valley and 4. Tell me the Truth. What really appealed to me was the style and depth that all songs had with thought-provoking lyrics. Again, a strong release from Midnight Oil that will keep being listened to frequently by myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Studio Session Effort From Distracted Band","review":"This is obviously just a studio album so the band members could fulfill a contractual obligation with the record company, or something along those lines. By this time in the band's career, some of the band members had other things going on, so they really didn't put out a lot of effort and practice and labor for this album. The songs are not fully fleshed out. The only time the band even remotely sounds like their old selves is the chorus of the song \\"My country right or wrong.\\" Otherwise, there is not much here. They clearly had spent themselves in their first five amazing albums. They were awesome when they worked hard to be awesome.I bought this used for very cheap, and I still think I overpaid. I played it twice. I can't envision ever playing it again. I might play frisbee with it, that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but...","review":"It's a great phone. I think all DECT 6.0 phones are great but this one take sthe cake. Uses regular AAA rechargables. I will not buy a phone that uses a proprietary battery. Crystal clear voice and the range of reception is outstanding.Two minor problems. If you answer in this phone and someone picks up an extension, this one disconnects. I have the base and one extension. The other problem is very minor. If the time a call is received is between 10PM and 10:59 PM, the time is shown in hexadecimal notation as 0a:00 thru 0a:59.They have told me they are working on a fix for the disconnect problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent audio quality, some small issues","review":"The phone has excellent audio quality, specially the speakerphone, but be aware of the 'mute button' elevator music, make sure to turn this off it the opposite what you expect from 'mute'.If there is a drawback its the 'Call Waiting' part.

However, the call waiting does not work at all. You have to hang up on the first call to take the second call.

The directions, which normally he can do without trouble, are confusing, even for me. We have yet to put it together as we've been too busy. legos are normally something he can do without help and without frustration and that has not been the case with these. If they are at full price, I wouldn't have purchased but would recommend buying lego sets for the same price.

Coldplay is a great band and so I expected this to at least be a decent compilation. However, the artists on this CD offer absolutely nothing. They do nothing but sing the songs as they hear them, rather than offer their own style. Therefore you really have no choice but to directly compare it to how Chris Martin sings, and it just makes it sound mediocre. Also it's too early for a Coldplay tribute album; they're still growing as a band and really don't have that many songs to remake. Maybe if in the future the artists can choose from songs that actually suit them, the album would be a better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm embarassed","review":"This compilation is an embarassment to the artists who compiled it with such banal unoriginality."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your looking for some unique artist interpretations...","review":"Im a hugeee coldplay fan since the begining, and i've been watching for anything coldplay related, esp a dvd or trubute, when i listened to this cd, i was unimpressed.

I have the String Quartet Tribute to Coldplay where they take Coldplay melodies and sort of rework them in a new interesting way. That stuff is good to listen to for studying or something where you don't want words. But this: the songs are pretty much just covers. They sound like Coldplay songs, almost the same, but simply not as good and not real. Its a bunch of crap, really. Do yourself a favor: buy Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head, but stay away from this crappy tribute."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comparrision","review":"These are horrible covers.

During the 80's these were omitted in a re-release so that the opera would fit on 2 vinyl discs. There is plenty of space on these CD's for the missing material to be restored. As far as I know the missing arias have never been released on CD. Shame on you EMI for leaving out material from the original release. This one more instance of CD releases of older recordings with edits and missing bonus material. It's one of the reasons I'm forced to hang onto my original vinyl pressings. It just shows that the Music Industry has precious little regard for the recorded heritage they hold in stewardship for future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I borough a copy of the Abbado's recording from my library and I found this opera quite boring.

The author successfully argues that kustoms are an art form and then proceeds to analyze various styles of custom cars in relationship to various styles of high art. Good stuff! As for the photos, the most refreshing thing about them is that they are not the same dozen famous kustoms that you've already seen in every other book about custom cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't even try it","review":"well, to any of those who already have read any good max book, can realize of the poor kind of information that is in this one.

The mustachioed Carlos Llanos leads about 15 people through the same routine from the warmup about 1000 times.The warmup acts as a primer/foundation where the steps for the workout are taught and mastered. The music is great. It lulls you into false hope.Once the cardio begins you wonder if your DVD is broken. It's the exact same thing as the warmup. It is agonizing getting through it because everything is re-taught as if the warmup didn't exist at all. In addition, in between each repetition of the same routine there is an absurd amount of pointless marching. Due to this marching, it was impossible to keep up a good heart rate.The moves had great promise and the music was great. But even the dancers seemed bored, and I lost interest completely.

I really was so excited to give this to my four year old for Christmas! Ok so where do I start??,1) Well the Ink is really crappy! I would definantly get different ink! It is washable and that is nice, but you can barely see the stamps when you stamp them. I have tried it on several diffrent types of paper and it still does not make a difference! I can see if a child younger than 4 was going to use it then it would make sense to have washable paint. But it does not make sense for an older child. 2) Some of the letters on the alphabet are backwards! So i have to draw on the front of the stamp which way it really goes, so my boy does not get confused! 3) I did read in one of the reviews that it does not come in a very user friendly container I did not think much of that, but when I got it i realized that it was annoying!

Lexmark tech support said the problem was related to the wireless drivers not working well with Leopard. After about two months wireless printing stopped working altogether.

The floss comes in two bundles and there is a guide for each bundle so don't take the bundles apart (like I did) and then have to figure out what is green and what is dark yellow green. Since I mess up a bit on these projects try to scan or photocopy the pattern so that if you need to start from scratch you have a brand new guide. The color mix for this product is rich and vibrant, I love it. It doesn't get five stars because of the lack of a floss card and there are two direction papers one for the guide and the other for the floss colors. I prefer all the directions on one paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty!","review":"I have not yet started this cross stitch but can't wait to!

Young aka Petey Weetstraw ever since I caught him at an L.A. club doing an open mic night that soon turned into his concert because no one wanted him to leave the stage. There is a song for every one on this CD. It is truly some of the best writng and production I've heard in R&B for years. My personal favorite is Come N Get It this week, but every song on this album is so infectious that it'll change next week. No, I'm not L's publicist or personal friend...just a geeky white boy who is a fan of good music. This is a definite stocking stuffer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful book!","review":"This is a powerful book. It is indeed a complete guide to overcoming many sexual problems. In my opinion we call them problems, but once you educate yourself with books like this, you realize that the problems are not the problems, the real problem with us women is ignorance and lack of education in sexual matters. As soon as you put in practice the principles of this book you start overcoming your problems.One thing that is very interesting is the fact that by overcoming the sexual problems you empower yourself in all the other areas of your life. Because all the areas of our lives are connected, we make a disconnection, but the sexual life is intimately connected with our whole being, and as soon as you own your sexual life you will automatically improve your whole life.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY WELL WRITTEN","review":"AS A THERAPIST THIS IS A GREAT BOOK.

After reading the full book as is recommended by the author, it was then that I discovered the book is really meant to be used with a partner. Well, if your problem stems from getting a partner in the first place, then this book is really only somewhat useful. It can achieve relaxation techniques and proper breathing exercises but that really doesn't go far in treating the problem for which I originally purchased the book. I am now considering enrolling in a Yoga class for even better relaxation and try to leave my love/sex life in the past where it was before I read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"AIO is great!","review":"I love the AIO series and this one didn't disappoint.

But they'll never come close to being \\"classic\\" country songs like \\"How Blue\\" and \\"Somebody Should Leave\\". I did like \\"I'm a New Fool at an Old Game\\" and \\"Silly Me\\" but for the most part, I wouldn't have bought this if I had known what was on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA RUINED EVERYTHING!!","review":"Reba ruined her down home image with this release. She got a little too over confident and wanted to expand her horizons. It was a bad mistake because things have never been the same since. As for this release, I lost all \\"RESPECT\\" for Reba when she tried to cover Aretha Franklin's tune. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"TURNING POINT FOR REBA ..SHE LEFT TRADITIONAL COUNTRY.","review":"In her own words, \\"I want to what sells\\". Obviously, traditional country wasn't selling enough for Miss McEntire so she compromised what made her so appealing and released this CD of POP songs. She began the turn back to the traditional movement, got tired and and turned to POP which is the same venue she has continued in since she released this CD in 1988. I remember when I bought it, I thought, \\"where are the fiddles? Where are is the steel?\\" Look for none...you won't find any here. Some of the songs are o.k. but not as good as the traditional work which is what Reba does best. Nothing she has done since (with the possible exception of \\"For My Broken Heart\\" can top her traditional era. Sadly, I don't think we'll ever see that from her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I KNEW WE WERE IN TROUBLE","review":"WHEN she started off with So, So Long...a terrible song with nary a fiddle or steel on it. Then she went into \\"Sunday Kind of Love\\" which is a torch song which Reba simply cannot do!! Crystal Gayle could have done wonders with this one! Reba failed miserably. I did like \\"I Know How He Feels\\" and \\"New Fool at an Old Game\\" but the rest of it is just pop fluff...like stale cotton candy. The worst of the lot is RESPECT!! Awful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EVEN REBA'S FACE ON THE COVER SPEAKS DEFIANCE!","review":"Reba said she was tired of \\"traditional\\" country and defied anyone to stop her. Well they couldn't stop her but they also couldn't stop me from hating this CD with a passion!!! So, So Long and RESPECT are the worst of the lot. \\"Sunday Kind of Love\\" suffers horribly because of Reba's vocal which is not suited to torch. The other songs are only the beginning of her bubblegum pop phase which we would have had to endure to the present day."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ONE BROKE THE REBA MOLD","review":"You've heard the saying, if it aint broke don't fix it?? Then you'll understand why I'm giving this album only 2 stars because all of the songs here broke away from Reba's traditional country music stance, a stance she pioneered and led people back to when they were straying away from country. Then she turned around and did exactly what those people who were straying were doing. In doing so, she broke the mold that made her who she is. Nothing here on this album can justify that. There are a couple of good tunes on this but for the most part, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT SOME FLUFF PLEASE!!","review":"That's what Reba seemed to be proclaiming with her one name self-titled 1988 release that changed her perspective of country music (she left it) and my perspective of her. What in the world does she think she's doing trying to sing \\"RESPECT\\"??? This isn't motown or soul train....its country for pete's sake!! Then she totally butchers \\"Sunday Kind of Love\\" which is not a good song to begin with. There are better torch songs out there if she wants to do torch..why pick this one??? And Reba is NO torch singer!!! She just doesn't have the voice for it!! \\"Do Right By Me\\" sounds like 1960s bubblegum stuff. \\"So, So Long\\" is just downright awful. \\"I'm a New Fool at an Old Game\\" is o.k. but not enough to give this CD more than one star. \\"I Know How He Feels\\" could also have benefited from some good fiddles and steel...it would have made it haunting. \\"Silly Me\\" is just silly fluff like most of this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Solid Pop-Country Fun","review":"This album is a dividing point for a lot of Reba fans. Prior to this one, Reba had been in the middle of a very traditional country sound. During her more traditional era, she recorded songs such as \\"How Blue,\\" \\"Somebody Should Leave,\\" \\"Whoever's in New England,\\" \\"The Last One to Know,\\" \\"What Am I Going to Do About You,\\" and \\"One Promise Too Late.\\"This album is definitely a departure from those sounds, and marked the beginning of a more pop-country era for Reba's music. If you like the singles - \\"Sunday Kind of Love,\\" \\"I Know How He Feels,\\" and \\"New Fool at an Old Game,\\" you'll like the album, because they represent the type of music found on the album well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TRAGEDY...","review":"That Reba abandoned singing \\"real country music\\" to do stuff like this. \\"Sunday Kind of Love\\" is not the right song for Reba to sing. Crystal Gayle could have done wonders with this kind of torch song. The rest of the CD is terrible with \\"RESPECT\\" the worst cut of a bunch of bad songs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REBAS ENTRY INTO POP FORUM MISSES ALL THE WAY!","review":"This CD marked the end of Reba's traditional phase which was a sad day for country music. Everything she has done since then has missed the mark in my book. \\"So, So Long\\", the first cut has a terrible melody. \\"Do RIght by Me\\" sounds like it came out of the 1960s girl group. \\"I'm A New Fool\\" is o.k. \\"Sunday Kind of Love\\" just downright leaves me quesy. \\"And Still\\" is borring!! The rest ...I won't even mention here. Sadly, this CD was just the beginning of more lackluster CDs to come from this talented lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Name Says It All","review":"Reba branched out on this album to lend her voice to a new sound. Less country, and more cross-over, this album is almost mellow and flows gracefully from one song to the next. It definetely creates a mood and contains excellent songwriting. Reba vocals are highlighted most on the torch-song and first single, \\"Sunday Kind Of Love.\\" The beautiful \\"I Know How He Feels,\\" was the second single and found its way to the top of the charts. The absolute best song on the album though is the very simple guitar/vocal of \\"Everytime You Touch Her.\\" Other highlights include \\"Wish I Were Only Lonely,\\" \\"Do Right By Me,\\" and \\"Silly Me.\\" Reba's version of Aretha Franklin's \\"Respect,\\" which has become a stage favorite, is here but the studio version lacks the energy Reba brings to it on stage and is really the only low point on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MOVE","review":"When Reba ventured into the pop field with this release she said in her autobiography that this album did not lend itself to steel and fiddles. It would have been far better if it had. I can picture and hear \\"New Fool at an Old Game\\" or \\"Silly Me\\" or the other ballads with new production in a traditional vein that would have made these songs stand out!! \\"Respect\\" is a disaster.......a true insult to the Aretha Franklin classic. Reba needs to stop trying to cover other people's tunes. This album marked the end of \\"Reba\\" as true country fans knew her and loved her. It was never the same after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"In one word.....amazing","review":"If you are in a depressed, feel sorry for me now kind of mood then this one is for you.

They were one of the best bands out there to hit the emotion keys by changing tempos and belting out a healthy screaming or two. Now they seem so happy and mainstream. I heard most of these songs at their show, and they sounded MUCH better, because they put feeling into them, and made them reminiscent of The Get Up Kids three years ago. The album just doesn't grab me like \\"3 Minute Mile\\" or \\"Woodson\\" did. All in all, I'm not gonna dog these guys, because I love and respect their previous offerings.

And this album was pretty much what I expected to be, nothing phenomenal, but an overall good album.You can pretty much anticipate that this album will be straight foward emo punk rock. The guitar work is not stale or bland, but it most likely won't standout in your mind after a listen. And though the vocals and lyrics are above average, once again, it won't be anything that will wow you into submission (i.e. The Ataris).So what I'm pretty much trying to say is, if you like emo \\"Something...\\" will be worth your money. If your looking to get into emo, I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point, but it's fine if you want to.A good album that won't leave you with that empty feeling afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD!","review":"Oh my gosh I love this cd!

Its definately a 5 star album.Also, I just saw their show in SF, and it was amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big let down","review":"I've been a fan of the get up kids for years, so every time i buy one of their full-lenghts i hate the fact that i'm so disappointed. Their eps are great, but their albums are really bad. Four Minute Mile was barely average, but the new one was a major let down. Even the songs that i loved on the ep were watered-down on the record. My advice, stick to the EPs and steer clear of the full-lengths!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit your whining, Get Up Kids.","review":"Man they should write happy music then they'd be cool but no, they have to be all depressing. The song Holiday makes me cry so much because it's sad and I don't like to cry cause you know I play football on my high school's team and we RULE! Someone told me to buy this cause they said they were punk rock like my favorite band, MxPx, but MxPx has lyrics I understand like \\"Party, My House, Be There\\" and the Get Up Kids say stuff that confuses me like \\"Pens paint people that I've proven wrong.\\" Too many P's! I wish the Get Up Kids were more like Guster cause then they'd be emo or maybe like Taproot. Guster RuLeZ! So does Dave Matthews Band! College, here I come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely something to write home about","review":"this actually deserves 5 stars, just 1 star was given so it'll stand out from the rest of the 5's... if you really like Weezer, RiverFenix, J.E.W., and the Ataris combined, then this is the result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ownership","review":"Album. Good. GUK are reigning gods of the indie scene. This is a perfect album. Please check it out if you're reading this, and check out their label Heroes and Villians for more ass-kicking from the Anniversary, and the all time heroes of 80's rock and roll, Reggie and the Full Effect. \\"Something\\" rocks. All those punk/\\"emo\\" peeeples should check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 4 stars?","review":"This album is so good! I bought it over 5 months ago, and it still rocks. The best way to describe it is emotional power pop with a keyboard. Also, this one is produced better, and the songs are better, than four minute mile. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"the bands best work to date","review":"\\"something to write home about\\" indeed... after playing a punked out version of rock for a few years, the get up kids have finally proven their true song writing abilities. sure, there is the occasional song that reminds one of punk (such as \\"holiday\\" or \\"10 minutes\\") but this is good ol' power pop in the weezer/cheap trick'fastbacks vein. the only real complaint about this cd is the mix. it isn't as clear and concise as it could or should be. and i don't mean celine dion over-produced. anyway, i expected the sound quality to be a touch better. i recomend this disk if you like \\"clarity\\" by jimmy eat world\\", anything by texas is the reason, or \\"understand this is a dream\\" by the juliana theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its The Get Up KIds ....... Do I need to Say more","review":"The Get up kids rule! Each CD of theirs is worth every penny if you like emo like the Promise Ring or any type of music you would love this CD .

Although i really had to listen to it a good number of times to recognize some songs from others. Other than that, this cd rocks. \\" I'm A Loner, Dottie....a Rebel\\" is the best song. Also, this band rocks in concert. And if you like the Get Up Kids, you NEED to check out Ultimate Fakebook, the Get Up Kids love them too. You can buy their album on amazon.com too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to classify, easy to listen to.","review":"The Get Up Kids have put out another album that will satisfy long time fans, as well as attract new fans of any rock genre there is. Is their music difficult to put an exact classification on? Yes. But doese that make it hard to listen to in any way? No. The Kids' overall sound bounces around and covers all different kinds of rock throughout, as the CD carries no repetitiveness. They will play some driving Pop-Punk w/some keyboards, heartfelt Emo, and some mellow soft/acoustic songs as well. I must warn you though, if you buy this CD thinking it is going to be a complete Emo or complete Pop-Punk CD, you could be dissapointed. But if you go into it just expecting some quality rock music, fans of both Emo and Pop-Punk will enjoy the album. Stand out tracks are, Action+Action Valentine, Holidays, Red Letter Day, 10 Minutes, and Long Goodnight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four-Minute Mile is MUCH better","review":"Four-Minute Mile is one of my favorite albums of all time. I bought this one without having heard a single one of it's songs believing that it would be great, but it's not, not at all. It's way to watered down and mainstream sounding. The rough production of FMM was much nicer to listen to than this commercialized stuff on STWHA. I just can't get over how much better the Get Up Kids used to be. Another good one to check out is the Woodsen EP.It's sad that the Get Up Kids went from being such an awesome band with so much heart to being just another sell out. Four-Minute Mile was a masterpiece ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk-Emo, A converge of genres","review":"I recently got into Emo music, being an avid pop-punk listener I cant believe what I was missing. I would have to say GUK converge on a punk-emo listening of sorts, although it is great. I would rather hear guitar over acoustic with the lead singers voice. The first song I heard was \\"Valentine\\", I was hooked ever since. I want to see more bands with an electronic keyboard player in them! Although the album is great, once I listened to Eudora I realized I was listening to the worse of two albums. I love the music, the voice, but the lyrics can get stupid at times. I see no point in \\"Out of reach\\". \\"I've smuggled myself into new nationalities...think you'd be proud of me.\\" What was the point of saying something about different countries? Also, I can get done listening to the album through one listening. If you like emo, I'd say pick the album up. But if you are mostly one for punk, dont pick this album up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, it was a big let down...","review":"I used to love the get up kids. I am pretty disappointed when I heard this cd. The quality of the recording is sub-standard. The songs are just OK. Some are good, but NONE are great. Their frist Ep, first CD and the 2nd EP are much better. They have become the emo goo goo dolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"getting there....","review":"The Get Up Kids continue to write \\"gut-wrenching\\" songs about becoming famous, being fresh faced kids on the road away from their loving girlfriends, and whatever else it is that is their limited point of reference. It's undeniably hooky and has some good rock moments, but once you get past it, you realize that they're not saying a damn thing. Add in the STALE keyboards and what you've got isn't the freshest or best tasting thing on the shelf. They should be paying Jimmy Eat World royalties, except Jimmy Eat World does it right and writes songs with maturity. If mushy love songs with no spine written from a 12 year old perspective sounds good, go for this. If you want maturity, purchase something by Jimmy Eat World."},{"rating":"1","title":"BBBBBBBBBoring","review":"This album is a real waste of money. There is about Two or three good songs, but all the rest are bland and samey.

For the first album, that wouldn't really work; it's too full of other people's ideas that the band admired. On HEAD INJURIES, Midnight Oil began the quantum leap into their own sound; the one track which doesn't seem so Oilish is still interesting, while the majority formed the backbone of their sound until D&D took over. \\"Cold Cold Change\\", \\"Bus to Bondi\\" & \\"Stand In Line\\" also appear on FLAT CHAT, and \\"Back on the Borderline\\" is on 20,000 Watts, but \\"Koala Sprint\\" & \\"No Reaction\\" are just as essential. I bought this CD just to see if it could stand up to their later-era recordings, and it did just fine -- more punky, but still recognizably Midnight Oil.

Still experimenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dose Info","review":"I've taken Quercetin from various brands for about two years. My problem was occasional outbreaks of hives, rather than seasonal allergies, but I do think it has helped. I've noticed that mosquito bites now disappear in the same night or next morning, rather than lasting two or three days. Anyway, I thought others might want to know the nutritional info on the bottle.In my 200 Tablet bottle, 1 serving is 1 gram Quercetin per 3 tablets, so 333 mg per 1 tablet.3 tablets also contain:vitamin C 646 mgmagnesium 50 mgbromelain 300 mgquercetin 1 gramSome other reviews have indicated that you can't take too much of this supplement.

Overall, however, things are a lot better while I am taking quercetin."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment: -5","review":"Probably not a good choice for me: this was my first vibe purchase. The vibrations were too weak even turned on to max. The vibration speed control wouldn't stay moblie and kept shifting on/off. This product hurts if you insert deeply and try to thrust. I actually got it stuck. I don't think a woman designed this product because the little bottom \\"wave\\" doesn't fit. I definitely will not order on-line again.

At least I can still use it externally for some stimulation.Pros:1. Silicone: phalate free toy for under $4 (at least when I placed my order)Cons:1. Cheaply made: you generally get what you pay for when it comes to toys. Mold lines, asymetrical shape (one side is bigger then the other) and a very very cheapy vibrator motor and battery compartment.2. Size: unless you really like a very thick diameter toy your not going to have much luck with this one plus the odd extra \\"wave\\" which apparently was designed for extra g-spot stimulation make penetration pretty difficult.

It is like trying to start a fire with a wet match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to perfect.","review":"This collection of short stories presents a strong and unique voice, wonderful composition, and a genuine sweetness missing in other \\"modern\\" works. There is a painful beauty expressed in the empty places explored here. The reader is reminded of his own humanity in an absence of emotion, a dose of existential angst, and the cold, barbaric nature of the world into which Saunder's characters are placed. This book is sad, funny and powerful, all at once. I read it regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"short story saga","review":"The hype for his most recent Tenth of December release prompted me to visit CivilWarLand. While some stories are poignant and revealing others just sit there. This volume is far less developed and mature and far less satisfying than Tenth of December.

You'd hope corporate moguls would read it; but then -- they just wouldn't get it, would they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Magazine Fiction","review":"Saunders is a writer that is working on a single theme, with singular energy. This is not a problem for a writer if he brings something fresh to the theme each time he tackles it. Saunders will sometimes do this, but more often than not, he fails. That is why some of the stories in this collection are brilliant, while others seem like derivatives of those moments of brilliance. Rather than bring us a fresh insight on the problems of fiction, Saunders seems content to simply reiterate. Saunders is the archetypical writer of magazine fiction: in between the slick covers of The New Yorker his work is a bold standout, but when you set his stories alongside each other in a volume, the record skips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theme parks of the damned","review":"Saunders takes the misfits of society and places them in nightmare worlds of corporate double-speak, psychobabble and unthinkable tragedy. All the ills of our society become magnified in his visions, particularly in his novella, set in a United States where disease, pollution, prejudice and greed have done the work we thought the H-bomb would do. In most of these stories, the heros find some kind of redemption, even if it's the redemption to be found in death and the afterlife. A strangely Calvinistic look a the world. I couldn't put it down"},{"rating":"2","title":"laughter you feel guilty verbalizing,","review":"Ok I have never written a review on amazon in the 5 years of ordering books. But I feel I must for the sake of the american short story reader. Not since Thom Jones, no not the singer spelled differently, has there been such a compellingly dark short story writer. These stories define the cliche of the composed short story, begging to know more of these latent people. but in this case I feel like a desperate strung out junky needing a fix of opiated character knowledge. Luckily there is more stories to fix my addiction and now a new collection. Read these stories! They will transform the way you laugh and the way you cry, yes another cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun to read, fasinating perspective","review":"It is perhaps the best short story book I have ever read.

Saunders isn't a complex writer, but he has a wonderfully ironic, almost deadpan, style. These aren't exactly uplifitng stories, and clearly go against the grain of our current American optimism.If I have a criticism, it's that a few of the stories seem redundant. I would like to see more by Saunders, but only if he has something more to say. It's hard to imagine he could express his world-view any better than he's done already."},{"rating":"1","title":"What drugs was this guy on?","review":"The stories were boring and terse.

Saunders' characters are all low-level functionaries with brilliant descriptive powers. Nearly a century ago, there was a low-level German official named Franz Kafka and if he were to read this book, he would say ~~~~~If I had had a sense of humor, I coulda been George Saunders~~~~~ CivilWarLand is a hilarious and lush tapestry of absurdist misery. The 21st century, where no one is enslaved by chains but all are wired together by the internet is in good hands with the likes of George Saunders. If you can't get this book tomorrow then buy it today!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi for people who hate Sci-Fi","review":"That's a little reductive, I know, but that's what I kept thinking while reading this great collection. Sometimes it's something akin to sci-fi, sometimes it's more like magic realism, but the stuff that goes on in these stories is always a refreshing departure from the norm of contemporary fiction. Lovers of Pynchon and David Foster Wallace should eat this up, but in some ways I felt, especially in this collection, that Saunders has more in common with Samuel Beckett. But here Sauders comments on the endurance of the human condition with civil war-era ghosts, morbidly obese office drones, post-apocalyptic mutants. I used to think this kind of subject matter would always be relegated to \\"guilty pleasures\\" status, but Saunders treats it with an intelligence absent in pulpier fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great creative imagination","review":"He is a grade A original full of surprises and with a piquant sense of humor.

This book is more chatty and less organized, it seems to me. But there a lot of hidden jewels in the chattiness. If you're serious about The subject, best read both books. Tibetan buddhism has its share of the dry, the dead intellectual, the superstitious. But unlike some other religions that just ask that you believe fairy-tales, it also has a rich kernel of profound truth and practice that makes books like this absolutely priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shortcut to Bliss","review":"This book is thought-provoking; yet, it's very aim is to move beyond thought.I'm trying the techniques gently with mixed success. It appears they work best for me after yoga when the body and mind are naturally more in tune.It is not well-written - but it is very well intended. The translation is not perfect - but the book is quite understandable in terms of the suggested practices.If you prefer chakra energy exercises, this might provide useful insight for you. Don't expect miracles, it takes practice!The fruits of the practice arrive when you least expect them. I think it opens you up to awareness of bliss and you more readily accept it into your life.

Once you have one, you will wonder how you got along all of these years with out one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy for small spaces","review":"I bought this unit to get into a small space in the rear of my engine compartment and it fit the bill. I was drilling out some broken bolts in an exhaust manifold. Using the diamond point tool and the tungsten carbide bit I was able to dimple the bolt enough to use a right angle Ryobi cordless to do the real drilling. Be careful using real drills as the speed is excessive to drill in steel. Cutting using drills in steel requires much slower speeds, and while the Dremel can go slower, it does not develop enough torque at those settings. Be sure to use the collar lock in the attachment and not the spindle lock in the Dremel tool itself or it will break the internal shaft.I also used it for cutting off the stub of the bolt, and found the right angle attachment allowed me into spaces that the tool would not go otherwise.All-in-all a good Dremel attachment but with the same limitations of the basic tool. Use for smaller jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This product is excellent for extending your dremel and cutting at right angles.

Definately recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dremel right angle attachment easier on the wrist.","review":"I bought this to covert my Dremel into a mini angle grinder for sanding small areas on the carousel ponies we are making. Dremel doesn't sell small hook and loop sanding discs, so I made my own out of thick leather and velcro. Sanding in this manner with the Dremel alone was awkward, and this attachment made all the difference. It creates a bit of gear noise though, making me wonder how much added stress it is putting on the machine, and how long the mechanism is going to last. That's why I gave it only 4 stars. It seems to be solidly built of metal gears and bearings and is easy to attach and remove.

We see Miffy waking up, eating breakfast, going for a walk, returning home and going to bed-activities children participate in themselves. The drawings are engaging and full of bright colors that keep a child's attention. The book itself is durable and has stood up to some regular chewing.

First, it has a smaller asian brush head than the typical american toothbrush. (For some reason, I found this to be the case when purchasing toothbrushes in China or Japan.) I prefer smaller brushes so I can get in the back of the wisdom teeth, which is difficult with a larger chunk of plastic. Anyhow, kudos to this brush on size alone. The ionic aspect it quite effective. It definitely seems to reduce plaque, based on feedback from my hygienist. Combined with regular flossing, I think this is the cleanest you can get your teeth at home. Also, note on usage... putting too much toothpaste on the brush will render the ionic action useless. If you look at the hole in the handle of the brush, this is where the ions gather. If this gets blocked up with toothpaste slobber, then it won't work. So really, try it without paste first. I add just a tiny smidgen, more for the taste than anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this! Oh, I guess the stars already suggest that fact....","review":"This is a puzzling product: You use it like a regular toothbrush, but you have to remember to keep your wet finger or thumb on the metal strip on the handle. It has a fancy long term cell battery in the handle, but there is no real sense that it does anything.Yet, my teeth felt different the first time I used it. I didn't even use toothpaste (and I use pricey paste for sensitive teeth). Pros: the brush head size is small, and it fits everywhere in my small mouth. The brush is soft, yet I don't have to push hard on the brush to feel produce results. My teeth feel clean. It's easy on the gums, too. It's much lighter and more pack-able than my electric toothbrush.Cons: I sometimes forget to keep my wet digit on the metal strip. The documentation that comes with this toothbrush is a little confusing. But it seems to do the job very nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best choice","review":"I am a practicing dental hygienist ( for the past 9 years ). One of my patients asked my oppinion on ionic toothbrush, so i decided to try it. I red all reviews, it sounded good enough, so i purchased it. It sucks. What a waist of $25. It doesn't do anything. Even a manual toothbrush does a better job. If you want great results, use Oral-B or Sonicare. Yes it is more money, but so worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy a Sonicare Flex","review":"I did try to believe that by just placing my wet finger over the little metal plate on the brush handle magic ions would clean my teeth and make them all better.

I tried this product seriously not expecting it to be much of anything, but I am completely amazed and impressed. A sonicare gives you that 'just cleaned' feeling right after you use it. This brush gives you that same feeling for the next day or so. It's 6 am as I write this, I haven't brushed since last night, and my teeth and gums still feel slickery like they've just been thoroughly brushed. My breath has no odor even 13 hours after brushing. My previously beloved sonicare is currently resting in my box of donations to take to Salvation Army. Call me cold and heartless, but I found a much better brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for people with sensitive teeth!","review":"I'd like to warn those with sensitive teeth that this toothbrush, despite having extra soft bristles, exacerbates the problem of sensitive teeth. After using it twice a day for several days, my teeth, which are usually not too sensitive thanks to Sensodyne toothpaste, suddenly became extremely sensitive to hot and cold. Brushing also became unbearably painful, all of which subsided as soon as I went back to using my regular toothbrush. The company unfortunately would not issue a refund. If there had been a warning on the packaging regarding this issue, I would not have purchased the product. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product!!","review":"I had no idea what I had been missing all these years. I bought this toothbrush for both my boyfriend and myself. We both love it.

Keepers for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable read. NEW series for those who are confused","review":"There are so many bad reveiws. I think people are confused. Folks, this is the Dream Hunters. Not the DARK Hunters. This series is based in the 1990s. There will be references to Ash and the others, but again this is a DREAM Hunter novel. I really enjoyed the snappy repartee. Why must every little line and saying be nit picked over people. Arik-Hero was sexy and vulnerable. Geary-Heroinne is real, intelligent and sexy. The book is interesting, exciting and with a bunch of new wonderful characters. Truly enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dream-Hunter","review":"WOW!!! WOW!!! WOW!!!Another great book for Sherrilyn Kenyon. I really enjoyed a paranormal romance novel that has a great plot and characters that grow and change and not just spend 250 of 300 pages having sex.The Dream-Hunter gives us the readers just the right amount of the hot and steamy not to over do the book and make you want to wash out your eyes after reading it.Action packed, fast paced and characters that you are wanting to have a happy ending and characters that grow and become better by the end of the book. The only thing in life that is constant is change and there are lots of changes going on in the world that Sherrilyn Kenyon creates.Loves Ash and all the rest can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"Like others have said, I use to love, love the dark hunters series but Kenyon is getting this story line way to complicated. This book doesn't have meat to it. The story begins when the hero is in love already but he's selfish, weak and pretty dumb. Kenyon then starts to tell you about how they got to where they are, so you have to back track through all of the past before you get anywhere.Also what is it about all of these characters and everyone having so much freaking power???I really hope for a good DH book again, please, let's just get back to what made us love you Kenyon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed.","review":"Once again disappointed but I sorta knew that I would be. While reading this, I felt that Sherrilyn was too hung up on getting herself and the fans ready for Ash's book that she took a potential good story away from this story as well as the last one. She spent too much time on other characters as well as adding scenes that really has nothing to do with this particular story. It wasn't well written and if you actually remember the storyline of the other books, there's alot of stuff that does not add up. The transition was not smooth at all. Thank goodness this wasn't released in hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, the boat blew up. Let's go to dinner.","review":"Ms. Kenyon owes me the time it took me to read this. The only minor positive things were the references to Greek Mythology - but I'm not sure they are correct. The sex encounters were fairly well done and one wonders where she gathered the material for those. The plot development was poor at best.I'm happy to have this behind me. It was a struggle to slog through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did the readers do to deserve this?","review":"I had to skim this book after reading the prologue, which just sucked all the pleasure I had with my life out of my soul. The heroine is a typical nerd/hot girl with daddy issues who meets the unbelievably sexy but SUPER \\"bad\\" hero who isn't so bad after all. They go through exchanges of we can't be together but let's shag anyway, insane bouts of misunderstandings, and endless amounts of self torture and self pity.That's the whole book, I swear. I got this from just looking at a couple of pages and now I wonder where that hour went. And the only thing you have to do since the book doesn't let you think for yourself is to figure out which girl our homeboy Acheron, leader of the Dark-Hunters from Ms. Kenyon's other series, is going to end up with. Will it be the nerdy yet innocent Tory, or the beautiful yet childish Thia?Seriously, borrow this one from the library. The money you save can buy a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed again","review":"After putting \\"Sins of the Night\\" into my recycle bin after reading the first two pages, I swore off Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter books as being terribly written and horribly convoluted in plot. I did okay, really, until I fell for a pretty face- that wonderful guy with the magic eyes on the cover of The Dream Hunter-- and I thought, 'a new character, a new plot line... maybe Ms. Kenyon will have a rennaissance.\\" So, fool that I am, I bought the book. 10 days later, I am still slogging through it- could it be that I have to read back constantly to figure out the numerous gods and demi-gods-from different pantheons, mind you- running around the story? Or could it be the card-board main characters- I keep lifting them up to see if there is anything more than two dimensions! Sorry, this one cured me for sure. I won't be back unless Ms. Kenyon has a guardian goddess who can 'plunk her magic twanger' and make Ms. Kenyon's writing improve a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Hunter","review":"Great Book kept me interested thru the whole book!I love this series, I get nothing done at home causeall I want to do is read and find out what happens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it wasn't hardcover this time!","review":"Wow, what a disappointment. I was not really thrilled with the last Dark Hunter book, and was hoping this one would get back in the swing of things. So far I've had the book a week, and still have not been able to get through the whole thing. I'm almost done though, so maybe the last few pages will get better.I think SK has fallen into the pattern that a lot of series seem to fall into. After a few books, a major, tragic hero emerges from the secondary characters, and everyone wants to read his story. But once that book is done, the series is over, so the author stretches things out to keep us buying, dropping little hints of his story to tantalize the readers. Unfortunately, in the quest for Acheron's story, SK seems to have run out of good material in the meantime."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dream Hunter","review":"I hated this book. I did read it and it took me a Whole month to get through it. Dumb. I usually read one of the Dark Hunter books in two days. This one not so. Hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will put you to sleep","review":"Being a fan of the Dark Hunter series, I was really hoping the Dream Hunter series would be good. So, despite the negative reviews, I thought I would try it. Everyone who gave this book 1 star was totally correct. I found myself skimming pages and looking to see when the end of the book was coming. Don't waste your time or money on this series. It is NOTHING like the DH series. The only thing this book is good for is if you are having a hard time falling asleep. If that is the case, crack it open and I assure you, you will be fast asleep before you even finish the first chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Sherrilyn Kenyon winner","review":"Like most of the reviewers here I was less than impressed with this book. I had the book an entire month before I could bring myself to finish it. Not typical of me and a Sherrilyn Kenyon book! I normally finish them in one marathon sitting. If you have never read Kenyon, DON'T start with this book. Read any of the Dark-Hunter series and you will not be disappointed. Read this one and you will never read another Kenyon book, thus depriving yourself of some of the greatest reading experiences ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU HAVE GOT TO READ THIS","review":"GREAT BOOK EASY READING BUT THE BOOK IS TOO SHORT ! IT KEEPS YOU WANTING MORE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy It Used","review":"I can't give a complete review of the book because I didn't finish it. I normally love all her books, but they have been getting weaker. I got half way through this book and didn't have the desire to finish it. I skimmed until the end, only reading the parts with Ash. I'm hoping the stories improve, if not I may have to pass on the rest of the series until Ash's story finally comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual.","review":"I'm a big fan of the Dark Hunter series and I looked forward to this book. Unfortunately this book doesn't live up to her previous standards. It was boring and hard to get through which has never happened to me with this author before. I seems like the dream hunter idea hasn't been completely fleshed out yet and isn't quite ready for publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenyon Rocks dreams, too!","review":"The Dark Hunters is a fab world, but now you get to see where M'Adoc and the rest of the Dream \\"police\\" reside and where they are coming from!

Brings back fond memories of the Hunters!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"First book of Kenyon's that I've tried to read, and it will be the last. Forced myself to finish this book, hoping that there would be some salvageable romantic storyline to make up for the boring plot and poor writing. No such luck. Please read the majority of the 1-2 star reviews and don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"omg. I luv the dark hunter series but this one was truly a bore.i give all her other books five stars but this one I actually skimmed thru the pages to hurry up and get thru the book. i only finished it because i dont like missing too much on characters and new things that might happen in future books. but it was really boring. sorry to say and it takes alot for me to say a book is boring. Im an easy to please but this one was soooo not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really really bad","review":"This book was so bad it was cringeworthy. I've brought all of her books even though the last few have been just bad. No more, this book was just too bad. A thick female and a hero I couldn't bring myself to care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Waiting for Acheron's Story...","review":"...and that will be it. I do not know what happened with this series. I think back to characters like Julian of Macedon and Vane Kattalakis and their stories - stories that made me go out and purchase just about every word the author had published. Unfortunately, the stories and the characters (especially the recent spate of heroines) have been leaving me absolutely flat, so I will wait for Ash's story to end the saga for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm ending this abusive relationship right now","review":"I'm officially breaking up with Sherrilyn Kenyon after this book and I will not be taking her back. Like an abusive relationship, she keeps disappointing me, but I can't help but remember the good times and so I think that maybe, just maybe, this might be the time that things change. This might be the book that proves that she really does know how to right great romance and that it doesn't all have to be lost in subplots and mythology. Well, the Dream Hunter proves that she doesn't care about me and she probably never did. If she had, she might not take all my money for these lukewarm spinoff series featuring heroes with no gumption and heroines who whine like it's their job. Sherrilyn Kenyon has lost her edge with her recent novels, and I for one am done with this abusive relationship. From now on, I'm moving on to writers who at least make an effort not to continually disappoint me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream Hunter","review":"I have read MANY of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter books. The first few really captured my attention. Not so much with the Were Hunters and especially not this first Dream Hunter for me. I just cannot get into it at all. Boring boring, and definately not what I expect out of SK. Same story, different names. I say she should leave well enough alone and quit trying to just make money off of the series. I'll stick with the Black Dagger Brotherhood instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, THUNK!!","review":"If I could give it a 1/2 star, I would--only because Ash puts in an appearance.I never thought I would not finish a Sherrilyn Kenyon novel; well, the time has come to admit defeat. I got through almost half of it, and that took forever. I was beginning to think they used chloroform for ink. Only one character was mildly interesting, (the teenage girl, Tori??). The hero and heroine were totally forgettable, the plot was phoned in and oh yeah, it all takes place a few years ago. Can you say SUSPENSE KILLER?IMHO, ever since Sins of the Night, there hasn't been much of anything fresh in the DH world. Even when she killed off a beloved character, he turned into such a jerk, I could care less what happens to him, and kind of wish he would have stayed dead. SK just keeps rehashing the same old stuff. I wanted to stick with this series until Ash's books come out. I don't think that's going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Megaera is looking for Atlantis and has wild dreams about a guy named Arik, who turns out to be a dream god. Arik makes a deal with Hades to be human, but in exchange he has to kill Megaera.Nearly everything about this book is typical and cliche, although I did like the premise. The writing is subpar, but easily readable. The plot is neatly tied up at the end for the sake of the romance and a very predictable happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream-Inducing (not a compliment)","review":"This book didn't do it for me. I love Kenyon's Dark Hunter series as a whole, but this, the first book in the Dream Hunter series was boring. I didn't care for the hero and the heroine was annoying. The premise was truly intersting, but the execution just didn't work for me. Pity, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I wait anxiously for each new book but, alas, this book was VERY disappointing and fell way short of her usual mark. I hope her next Dark Hunter book is back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I've read this year...","review":"This is one of the worst or the worst I've read this year. I read an average of 7 books a week and this one I couldn't even finish. Read about a third then went to the end. I wasn't even interested enough to look of the parts that had Ash in them. This was put immediately in the \\"Get it to the used book store quick before they get so many they won't take it\\" pile. It was RUBBISH. I'm so disappointed in the last few SK books that I won't be buying anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"$1.00 used was too much for this book","review":"This book was so dumb it made my brain hurt. Frumpy archaeologist meets walking contradiction god-thing and the search for Atlantis kicks into high gear. . . .Blarg!I'm also forced to wonder if this author does any cultural research in her writing besides keeping a copy of Edith Hamilton's Mythology around. As someone who has a degree in Classics, I was trying not to scream while eeking my way through this story.There were so many characters on that boat, it made me wonder if I was supposed to be reading about some kind of demented singles cruise.This is yet another author I've heard was hot bananas who turned out to be hot air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring to finish","review":"I can probably count on one hand the books that I've been too bored by to finish. Dream-Hunter now joins the list. I've read all of the Dark Hunter books to date and, like other reviewers, have found the quality going downhill. Based on this book, I won't be reading the Dream Hunter series at all.If you feel like you really want to read it, check it out from the library. And be sure to turn it in on time--it's not even worth an overdue book fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave the Closet Closed","review":"I like Ms. Kenyon's work usually but you can tell this is one of her earlier novels that they pulled out of the closet and published. It may be its first time in print but that is because the sex is bad, the characters flat and the plot uninteresting. I liked a couple of the secondary charcters much more than the main ones. I think she like the secondary charcters more as well because she went on to publish some really good books. I wish this one had been one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of the Dark Hunter series and looked forward to this release. However, it was very dry, no spark. I only finished it because I enjoy the series. There are a few minor references to Acheron and the DH's (he says something - again - that sets Nick Gautier's death in motion). Hopefully this is an aberration, I enjoy Sherrilyn Kenyon's other work, it is innovative and compelling.FYI, this book is set in the 1990's, that's why there were references to Zarek, etc. that were resolved in previously published books. If you're going to do that in an established series it really should shed some light on the current mysteries. The only interesting thing about this book was the allusion to Kat's parentage (Ash's presumed love interest)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass...","review":"I never thought I'd give a bad review on one of Ms. Kenyons books but OML what a sleeper this one was. I can't even classify this one as a good beach book, unless of course you want to nod off in your chair! I read the other Dream Hunter book and was mildly entertained but this one was terrible! It took me over a week and a half to read this as opposed to a day or two with the other books. Reading these Dream Hunter series books on their own is confusing to the Dark Hunter series because if you've read the books in order, some of the characters are actually dead by the time I got around to reading these books. The only reason I started it was that Xypher was in Devil May Cry and I wanted to know what happened to him, I'm so sorry I picked this one up though. Think I'll stick with the Dark Hunters instead. Don't bother with this one, not matter how much of a chance you give it, it'll still die a painful death..."},{"rating":"1","title":"As good as JR Ward.... Please","review":"This is my first Sherrilyn Kenyon book after previous postings equated her with JR Ward. I was excited to find a new author since it will be forever before the next BDB will be out. This will be my last Kenyon book. While I enjoyed the Greek elements, it was too confusing trying to separate the gods from the demi-god from the half-breeds from the Dark Hunters. It seemed like she was trying to fit too many story lines into one book, esp since I had no previous context. And the storyline overall was weak - characters, love story, etc. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful \\"Mary Sue\\"....with ancient gods....gag.","review":"Very little history, lots of sex....vanity novel, the author is \\"Mary Sue\\" with the main male character.

I must admit I never thought an author of SK's caliber would produce such a badly put together novel, in which there were numerous glaringly obvious editorial mishaps, and a very shaky plot. There seemed to be too many characters that have no reason of being in the plot, they added nothing, and eventually after introducing them they faded away. Some reviewers have commented about this book being another build up to the Acheron book, and I must admit, I agree. Yet, it doesn't build any suspense nor does it feed curiosity about Acheron, all it does is make every other book in the series seem like an after thought. I really enjoyed the other Dark Hunter books, and I hope this is not an indicator of what's to come.I recommend trying \\"Moon Called\\" by Patricia Briggs instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very dreamy...","review":"I'm disappointed. Sherrilyn Kenyon's books used to be great. I love the historical romance ones as well as the Lords of Avalon, but the Dark-Hunter novels have progressively deteriorated and now this Dream-Hunter novel, one that I was looking forward to, was not so great. It took me a LONG time to read it, when it usually takes me little time to read a book. I had to put it down when I grew frustrated that the story line was stagnant. Other parts I had to skip over just to get through it. What's going on with the novels? For the first book in the Dream-Hunter series, it wasn't very good. Didn't feel any love between the characters- one minute they were strangers and the next they were in love. Where was the progression?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream Yawn","review":"I have really enjoyed Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series, but Mother of Pearl, what's with these boring spin-offs? I had to yawn my way through pages of repetitive text making me feel as though I was on a circular read to nowhere. I laid it down, I picked it up, and finally finished it two weeks after purchase (I usually finish one of her books in an afternoon). I found the characters unappealing (Arik, the \\"Dream-Hunter,\\" was nothing more than a voyeur) and I fail to understand why SK's mythological deities always use American slang and colloquialisms. It's not as bothersome when her novels are set in the States, but in Greece and Atlantis? The Dream Hunter series was aptly named since it is guaranteed to put you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad!","review":"I was hesitant to buy this book after all the negative reviews, but after leaving it unopened for a few months, I started it and really liked it! Sure, it doesn't have the novelty of her earliest dark-hunter books, but it's still a good story that brings the mythology I learned about in school to life. I really liked that she has managed to answer some of the questions raised in previous books. I think this book is worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"As an avid reader, I was interested in this book on the back cover synopsis. Reading 50 or so pages into this book, I hoped it would get better, but it crashed and burned. The plot was weak, the editing was horendous and the characters predictable. Don't spend your money, this book is a true waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Miss!!","review":"With Sherrilyn, you usually get a hit or a miss. This was a TOTAL miss. I won't go into the plot, but will note that it's flat and the pacing of the story is extremely slow. In other words, this was one of the most \\"boring\\" books that I've read in a while. The timeline was \\"funky,\\" and quite frankly, you didn't learn a whole lot more in this story than you've learned in previous stories.I honestly think that Sherrilyn has way too many series going on. I mean she must have 5 or 6 going on simultaneously. It's just too much. The writing is bound to suffer at some point. This book is a prime example of that.I read on her website that it can take Sherrilyn as little as 2 weeks to write an entire book. After reading Dream Hunter, I can honestly believe it. You may want to get this one from your library. I can only thank the Good Lord that it wasn't sold in hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"I liked dream-hunter. I laughed at Geary's sarcasm and the insults passed between Arikos and Solin. It didn't get five stars because it wasn't as great a read for me as some of Kenyon's other novels, but it was good.

I didn't believe she loved the dream god. Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to say it, but I was disappointed...","review":"If this is the first book branching off in a new direction, I would say that I will not be reading that series.

This isn't \\"Great Literature,\\" but I have come to expect a good story and likable characters. The characters in \\"The Dream Hunter\\" are not likable, or even admirable on any level.

I would give Miss Kenyon another chance, but only once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good representation","review":"I am so glad I am not the only one that thought this book was well below the usual standard for a Sherilyn Kenyon book. I almost put it down. My reading time is valuable and I hate to waste it. When I realized that was how I felt I was almost sick with it because I love the Dark Hunter series.To read the dark hunter series you really have to believe in the characters to buy into the plot and imagine their world...the two main characters in this book are never, not in one scene together, believable.The only thing that brings this book up to two stars is the banter between Arik and Solin as well as the scene between Hades and Persophene. I continued to the end believing the whole time that there would be some payoff that would make it worth struggling through. There wasn't.

Now, I'm waiting impatiently for SK to return to her senses, what thehell happen to her, DID ARIK ATTACK HER IN HER SLEPP AND TOOK ALL HER GOOD WRITING AND IDEAS TO ATLANTIS? probably, because I just could not see her writing in this book.

I liked the view into the dream-hunter world and it helped me to better understand what goes on there since there have been so many references to it in the dark-hunter series. I liked the story plot in this one. It's very creative. I found that this is an important book to read even if you are reading the dark-hunter series. You get to learn more about Kat and whats going on with her and her lineage. We are also introduced to Tory in the book. She is only 15 here as the stage is set several years before the dark-hunter series starts. Tory will be Acheron's love interest in his book and it was good to get a preview of her. I can't wait to read that one for myself as I think it will be interesting to see how kenyon develops her character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon is a new author to me, and, as with all new authors, i took a risk in purchasing this book. This book was not a winner. everything seemed so, so, predictable, even the romance. The whole story is based on Arikos, a demi-god cursed by Zeus to feel no emotions, who makes a selfish decision to trade one women's life for two brief weeks of pleasure. early on in his alloted time, he, predictably, falls for the woman whose soul is promised in the bargain, and realizes his mistake. the book seems amateur in that none of the characters seem real. The humans are constantly shifting on their deepest held beliefs/quests/morals, and the gods seem shallow and cant settle on a distinct speech pattern (ancient and powerful god, Whiny 21st century teen) .I couldn't decide if the characters were supposed to be comical, or were just poorly written. The plot seemed as if it was there to provide a background for the unrealistic sex. This book was a waste of a good ten bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Good Stuff","review":"I stumbled into this band from an indie website.

It's not often that I get the opportunity to be totally blown away by a chance listen, but this is it.Do yourself a HUGE favor: Buy this album and turn all your friends on to it.

To say this album is a disappointment is an understatement. This album goes absolutely nowhere from start to finish. It is just flat out boring & the same riff/bass line/melody are used on three of the same songs. They attempt to ape The Flaming Lips & Interpol but it all ends up sounding forced and just plain amateurish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Standard Bearer for the Rock Trio","review":"Is there no more resilient concept than the rock trio? Think of such disparate groups as The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Police, Rush, Peter, Paul and Mary, Beastie Boys. With their debut Now Here Is Nowhere, Brooklyn-by-way-of-Dallas' Secret Machines has the makings to become a new standard bearer. They alternate between long spacey cuts like the opener \\"First Wave Intact\\", where they stretch out with muscular guitar solos, to shorter Zeppelin-infused bits like \\"The Road Leads Where It's Led\\" and the mighty \\"Sad and Lonely\\". Vocalist Brandon Curtis isn't so much reminiscent of Robert Plant, but works a similar timbre (when necessary). And the band is decidedly familiar with the works of Sonic Youth, especially on the quieter numbers that need a bit of rough."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, this album is amazing.","review":"On a surface level you might shrug and go, do we really need another band that draws heavily on the past or a generic overproduced new band that isn't pushing things forward? But look again, this certainly is no throw away, they totally take their inspirations (none of which I can say they individually rip off) but they make an excellent melting pot of heavy, ambient, simple songwriting that just flat out rocks. I have said to friends before that this band leaves the build up out of what you would find in most rock songs and just sticks to the straight up rocking out. And before I fail to mention- do yourself a favor and see them live. This album is an excellent one to have cranking in the house, but this is a show that should not be missed either. As for their new one.... we'll see what happens, this one gets all my thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best releases of 2004 & 2005","review":"This reminds me of Flaming Lips \\"Hit to Death in the Future Head\\".

So once again, do not waste your time with this snooze fest of an album. Their attempt to ape Interpol & The Flaming Lips is downright comical. Of the nine or so \\"songs\\" on this album, three of them have the exact bassline/beat/melody...did these guys just run out of ideas? Utterly disappointing, especially since their EP had some promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large & roomy","review":"Big spacy grooves. Strong, almost familiar melodies.

I like it a lot.Probably too good to ever be heard on the radio. You should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Solid debut album---a surprisingly effective fusion of post-prog psychedelia and fuzz-box garage. But comparisons to Floyd, Love&Rockets, Zeppelin, etc. refer more to the seeming influence of such bands on Secret Machines' sound, rather than to this CD's overall relevance to modern rock. I thought the intro vocals on \\"Sad Lonely\\" were particularly affectatious. Still, there is quite a bit of talent here, and Secret Machines could mature into something big."},{"rating":"2","title":"After their LETTERMAN performance","review":"After their \\"Letterman\\" performance, I had to hear more of Secret Machines. Their Television -type, straight-forward performance, into -the-music was very impressive. Overall, their music is not like Verlaine, et al, but their enthusiasm is.

This book is not so entertaining, rather it's more like scholastic text book, however the book was very knowledgeable and helpful to understand and accept the reality of multiculturalism in the United States. There's no doubt that Kymlicka's argument and examples to support his thesis were impressively logical and reasonable.

I presume that it is a problem with the sharp nose of our van. I rigged up a bracket to angle the transmitter at about a 45 degree angle from the wall at a height of about five feet from the floor in hopes of reflecting the ultrasound better off the angled hood of our van, but this only marginally improved things.

When I finally got it in the mail, I opened the box to find missing pieces, and no instructions. Amazon was great about sending a new one to replace it within days of my complaint. When I took out the new one, everything was there. I did a quick \\"test run\\", turned it on, and everything seemed fine. Then, as I was getting ready to start juicing, the thing died. I tried the reset button, different outlets, nothing. If you want a juicer, go elsewhere. This thing is not worth the hassle, especially for a few cups of juice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible piece of garbage","review":"I was given this juicer for christmas, what a piece of junk! I was so excited to start juicing and gaining health, but you cannot CANNOT juice anything but cucumbers and green apples in this piece of crud. You put anything that is a leafy green in there and you don't get juice. The pulp from the things you can juice is still FULL of liquid. If you try and juice anything that is remotely fleshy like an orange it goes crazy and gets off balance and tries to fling itself off the counter. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OMEGA. They also have dismal customer service. When I called to ask about this product the gentleman I spoke to was more interested in speaking over me and explaining that many people enjoy the product even though it doesnt juice anything but firm fruits and veggies. They offered zero help. I would suggest not buying anything from Omega company.

But you can only juice 1 apple and 1 carrot and terrible vibration start,then you have to shut off , and wait around 3 minutes before motor stop spinning.There is not even safety switch to prevent from opening when motor still spinning, there is not any breaks to stop spinning and prevent \\"DANCING\\".Terrible, Terrible, Terrible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is not just unsafe; it's dangerous and should be banned from being sold to the general public.","review":"The Juicer leaked badly on the first use, and then went crazy and started spinning in a rough way on the kitchen countertop causing breaking several glassware and causing terror to my wife and kids. I rushed to unplug the wire but it kept spinning and shaking in strange way for 5 more minutes. Product is not just unsafe; it's dangerous and should be banned from being sold to the general public.I will contact my congresswomen to raise the issue of unsafe house appliances and equipment sold in the market with no federal supervision.

I have used 2 other juices, but the Omega 9000 extracts the most juice from fruits and vegetables. The stainless steel parts are also a plus.The bad - The mesh basket design makes pulp removal difficult. The unit gets off balance very easily. I can barely keep it on the counter it wobbles so hard. I have tried sequencing of high moisture and low moisture ingredience, tried timing the input of the ingredients, but I cannot figure out how to prevent the balancing problem. I searched the brand web site and the web in general but have not found any solution. I have not called the manufacturer yet. The motor quick working 8 months after I bought it. I returned it and received a refund. I will not buy another Omega product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major problems with this machine","review":"I bought this juicer for a cleanse, was told it was top of the line and was excited to use but like other reviewers said it \\"did a dance\\" which is a nice way to put it, we called it possessed. At first it did not work at all, but after being adjusted did but after a minute or so of juicing it would start to become incredibly loud, shake a lot and spin around. 3 adjustments later and it still was making this horrible noise. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a few days","review":"I bought this juicer and the first few times I made juice it worked ok, but after a few days it stopped working. There's a reset button on the bottom and to get it back to working again you have to press the reset button every few seconds. So it juices for 3-5 seconds and then stops, then you have to press the reset button and then you can juice again for another 3-5 seconds. And halfway through my glass it stopped working completely. This has been very frustrating to use. And it takes a very long time to clean out all the pulp, too. I wouldn't recommend this juicer. I am calling Omega directly tomorrow to find out if they can either replace it or tell me what's wrong with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst juicer ever","review":"I am really disappointed with this juicer! My juicer was horribly loud as if I was trying to juice metal or something horrid. Then the juice doesn't just come out of the spout...it leaks all the way around...a nice feature if you have a dog who likes to lick up juice while you are juicing. Now, attempting another juicing adventure, the lid simply won't come off...period...its like forever stuck on the juicer...can't pry it off...put olive oil in the juicer to try and loosen it up, but no...again...just a large mess all over the counter.

In fact, the examples were the biggest aspect of the book from which I was able to learn principles that Brinckerhoff was trying to teach.

Each story written at different periods of his career reflect human emotions and the human urge to explore. Definitely not meant to be read as a novel though. It is one of the best eerie works of fiction I've read. Especially good stories were \\"-and the moon be still as bright\\" and \\"the martian.\\" Bradbury has similar stories like the Illustrated Man and Dandelion Wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bradbury's best book","review":"I really do feel that this is Ray's best science fiction work ever. These are all different stories about man living on Mars but it has smooth continunity in all the stories. From the doomed first expedition to Mars to the last chapter where a human family prepares to start their new life in one of the Martian cities, each story keeps the reader interested in what happens next. I also like the fact that Ray maintains the large mystery surrounding the Martians. They who survived the onslaught of earthly diseases, remain in the background but never far from the minds of the colonists. Will they befriend the human colonists to their planet? I'm not sure, but from the few appearances they make with the colonists in the stories, I think the answer is Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"reviews as school project","review":"The Martian Chronicles remains one of the great classics of imaginative fiction.

I find it unfortunate that reviews from some schoolchildren in Ohio have reduced this excellent work's overall rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Martian Book!","review":"The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury is a great book. It is about Earthmen exploring Mars and making settlements to live there before the Great War. The book is full of little mysteries that edge you on to read the next page. I loved it! The part I liked best was when one person made all the fantasy books in the world come true in one house. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to relax and read a good science fiction book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi With a Human Touch","review":"Regardless of Bradbury's genre, the essence of his prose is very human. In The Martian Chronicles he manages to deliver that ever bitter/sweet feeling of nostalgia. From Springfield, Illinois in his coming of age novel, Dandelion Wine, to a front porch on Mars, Bradbury always touches the human heart. This is why this novel is great; whether on a distant planet or not, you will be moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Re-Reading","review":"I first read THE MARTIAN CHRONICALS when i was in 7th grade, and have re-read it at least 5 times since. I agree with others that this is a Sci-Fi masterpiece. The book is separate, loosely connected stories written in the hitchcock tradition of misdirection.The movie made based on this book was a huge disappointment for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy disguised as science fiction.","review":"This collection of short stories certainly deserves the classic status it has recieved. Each story in this book is an entertaining read. The settings pull you into a bizzare world were anything is possible.However, to describe The Martian Chronicles as Science fiction is a bit of a stretch. Bradbury's vision of the future, the late nineteen nineties through the beginning of the twenty-first century, is unremarkable. He describes a Mayberry colinization of the planet Mars, complete with cozy little cottages and hotdog stands. This is completely forgiveable if you go into the book realizing it is really fantasy not science fiction. Bradbury makes up for his lack of futuristic vision with his ability to create intriguing scenarios."},{"rating":"2","title":"The humans are coming","review":"Chronicles is less a novel and more a collection of short stories, some just a single paragraph, tied together by an overall narrative. There are Martians and the planet is portrayed with flowing water and an Earth-like atmosphere. This isn't realistic but it doesn't matter since the planet is a backdrop for the colonization and abandonment of the planet by humans. In fact, the book is mostly a character study of the humans who come to Mars and the impact they have on the planet. Some are adventurers, some idealists, some are just running away from something.The stories also have a distinctive flair to them and reflect the 1940s in which they where written, several deal with 'atomic war'."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Martian Chronicles","review":"I was disappointed - it was a 'cheap' version of the book - small and on inferior paper. i was disappointed but didn't have any time to research another one - it was a gift.

It has all of things I like in a book space, a good story,a kinda hidden messege,and I did not get bored reading this book. I liked the way it progressed. It seems so realistic like this could happen.Each chapter brings new emotions. One chapter you are laughing and the next you are sad. Aftar reading this book and finding out about Ray it makes me want to read more of his books. He is a really good author my favorite so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"friendly and intense","review":"At first, I though that Bradbury's discription of Martian life was kind of simplistic... just Earth things in a different color. However, as different entrees of the martian chronicles indicated, martian life was more advanced than I had realized.The overall plot of the book does not seem to make sense until the reader realizes that each segment is a mini-story. BUT in the end, all of the stories are connected, but just in minor ways.Each of Bradbury's little stories has a different \\"flavor\\" to them. Some of them are even creepy. Reading this book at night gave a me a rush on a few occasions. Its not too bad though.I really thought it was interesting to see what the view of technology of the new millenium in 1950. Just a nice thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a big fan of sci fi!","review":"I for one am not a big fan of sci fi books,novels or movies. I do however think this book was done very well.Its hard to write a book w/lots of bridges and different stories.It takes a good writer to make it make sense.Bradbury does a very nice job of putting the stories together and making sense. This book is very good for someone w/a good creative immagination.It had very creative inventions in it, such as the metal books and the flamming birds.Not one particular story stuck out at me.Maybe if I had a bigger interest in sci fi I might have enjoyed it more,and or thought about the book deeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was not good","review":"There was only one chapter I liked in this book and that was The Martian because I like action and this book was not even close to what I had in mind,of good entertainment.

I felt like I was reading through a child's imagination. It was very adventurous. But, to me it was too easy. There wasn't much depth, it was just \\"plain and simple.\\" We are now reading Cold Mountain, and by no means does this book compare in any way, any way at all. My least favorite section in the book was Ylla, and my most favorite was -And the Moon Be Still as Bright. Really I liked the last chapter the most, for the simple fact that it was THE LAST, and I knew that Ild be finished soon. I read the first 3-4 sections hopoing that it would get better, and then when it didn't, I had to force myself to finish it, so that I wouldn't fail the exam over it. The only reason I finished this book, most deffinatly, was because it was for class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative , Yet Unsatisfying","review":"I really didn't care for this book at all. I don't like science-fiction. If you like science-fiction it is definitely the book for you & it's really well written. I'd have to say my favorite chapter is \\"The Million-Year Picnic\\". I thought it was really awesome how,the parents, revealed to the children that they were the real martians. My least favorite chapter was \\"Way Up In The Middle of The Air\\". I mean come on ,hello, are we on Earth or Mars? A little repetition of the 50's. This book was on a thin line of bad & ok. Don't get me wrong, Bradbury is talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Martian Chronicles, a bizarre scientific voyage.","review":"I really did not like this book.

Despite this fact we all liked the first couple of chapters a whole lot since the idea of settling a foreign planet was shown in an exciting way.

The day of the author's death I could have bought it for $5.00. As much as I like this subject, I refuse to aid In the commercialization of the author's death, so soon. These are the same books available on the day before his death, not specially edited to aid in the understanding of his personality, writings or life, so I will wait until the fever for \\"Martians\\" is gone or I will accept my fate and never read these wonderful stories. Not until they sell at the previous price. Sometimes I hate the human condition. I have read Asimov in my teens and on my 20's and 30's . Probably many of Bradbury.

No more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classical work in progress","review":"I bought this recent edition of Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" as a gift, having enjoyed my copy long ago. But I looked through it and found, comparing this to my older book, one story eliminated and two new ones added. So it was an education and extra bit of entertainment for me as well as the recipient. The \\"dates\\" of the various chronicles have been updated, too, since the older edition had us landing on Mars and setting up colonies in the 1990s. It's still a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despair and Hope on the Red Planet","review":"This was one of the books that introduced me to science fiction, and it has stayed in my mind ever since. The writing is pure poetry, the tone is haunting, the work itself unforgettable. The tech may seem dated today, and the Martian setting a trifle naive, but it works anyway, largely because Bradbury doesn't attempt to measure the human heart with a slide rule. If you've never read SF, this is certainly one of the places to start. If you've grown up on the stuff, it's worth your while to reacquaint yourself with this small red gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for science fiction lovers","review":"This book is one of the world's greatest satires. yes, i said one of the world's greatest.

They are all about a group of people going to Mars, someone going nuts, and killing everyone. My favorite short story in this book is was \\"Usher II\\" It was exciting and interesting, but on the other hand, the one i hated the most was \\"The Earth Man\\". The reason i disliked \\"The Earth Man\\" was because by the fourth short story, I knew that every story is about the same thing. I think that the book could have been better if the stories weren't so similar. Overall, i would have not read this book if it was not required for me to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Martian Chronicles is great reading!","review":"This is really one of my favorite books.

Not only was the plot poorly developed, but the words used were used poorly. Certainly one of the worst examples of writing that I have seen. Ray Bradbury has never been my favorite author but this book was simply horid. It was not only graphic but also inappropriate for people under the age of 18. It was also offensive to people between the ages of 22 and 93. If I could I would give this book 0 stars. This book was definitely a turn off to reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was the worst book i have ever read.","review":"I bought this book about a week ago and i was looking forward to reading it.

It was so loooooong and booooring. It had no point to it besides how peole live on mars. I recommend you don't read this book it was boring and a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naive, sentimental, lyrical, wonderful.","review":"I was introduced to short stories by Bradbury (as have many) in grade school, starting with \\"R is for Rocket\\", but I never read this book until last weekend. It moved me like few things I have recently read. That is art. In this age of the Novel, many readers will balk the the crazy-quit pattern of chapter-stories, and its lack of linear plot-line. But this structure of Chronicles weaves a wonderful thread for readers mature enough to follow it.If you haven't read it since childhood, read it again! And if you've never read it before, please correct this error soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE THIS BOOK IS EDITED!!","review":"The William Morrow Hardcover Edition (February 1, 1997) appears to be missing a story: \\" Way in the Middle of the Air \\"Mr. Bradbury wrote a story where all of the black people get fed up with the south, and the way they are treated, load up the rocket and leave all of the bigots behind. Incredibly some paper pushing editor must have thought this story would offend our sensitivities, and took it upon him or herself to remove it from the chronicles.Strange that the work of Mr. Bradbury, a champion of free speech, is being edited.Do not get this version! (I got hosed, but vowed to save my fellow readers from the same fate)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Destructive Humanity","review":"I've had this book laying around for years, kind of wish I would have read it sooner. The book spans around 27 years of man/martian history. It is striking in alegory and observation. Anyone with and eye and an ear should enjoy the many short stories that deal with issues like racism, greed, paranoia, hate, loss, and jealousy; just to name a few. The book is at times humorous, and sad, but always profound. I realy enjoyed watching the story progress through the wonder in frontier, into the darkness of self destruction, and into the silver lining of hope.I should also warn that the book is a compilation of short stories that follows a timeline, or chronicle of martian/man history, and not one straight novel with long developing plot and characters, though some do have multiple appearances. It is a book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and backgrounds. Don't miss it. I know it made me a fan of Ray Bradbury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"*One of the reviews posted here says that this version of the book has had a story taken out (\\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\"), but actually that story is in the book. Maybe that person had a faulty copy or something, but this version has not been edited.About the book itself: Although I had to read it for school, I found that I actually ended up liking it. The stories themselves are often somewhat bland, serving as conduits for a larger idea or theme, but I thought that the ideas the book presented were thoughtful and intriguing and some of the stories were interesting as well. As far as storyline, there are very few strong characters and the plots can be confused, isolated, and conflicting, but as it is a series of short stories and not a novel, this can be forgiven to some extent. All in all The Martian Chronicles held my interest and introduced me to some interesting ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a very good book. It was so crazy and out of wack.","review":"It was so crazy and wierd that I just liked it. It was out of control. I liked the book all except that each chapter was a different story. I wish that it was just all one book. A continuance. Besides that a great book. It was one of my favorites. My favorite would have to be The Westing Game. I liked the Westing Game because I really like mysteries. The book I most disliked would have to be Roll of Thunder Here my Cry. I just thought it was so boring. I could never get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, however...","review":"Well, first of all, I must say, this book is one of the first books I ordered from Amazon.com. I finished it in one day. Ray Bradbury is one of the best writers of the century! I really loved the different points of view in the book (the native-martian, the first settlers, etc) and I thought the descriptions of views and the author's imagination are simply amazing. However, the thing I liked the most was also the one that bothered me,it was hard for me to get used to a different point of view every few pages... The problem is that there's no main character that exists through all the stories. Each time a new story begins I have to \\"re-adjust\\" myself for a new main character with new background and new everything... It was hard but after a while I got used to it and had a blast reading this awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, I have read The Martian Chronicles (finally)","review":"There was a time when people still believed in Martians - real Martians. This was a time when a dying race roamed around a dying, dry world, oblivious to the activities of humans on Earth. It is this romantic notion of the early twentieth century that The Martian Chronicles begins with and continues onto what we would now consider an impossible future.Each chapter is it's own self-contained story and some of them have clever, entertaining twists that remind me of old Star Trek episodes. If you read science fiction you must make sure that Martian Chronicles is one on your list.P.S. When someone asks me have I read 'Martian Chronciles' I now say yes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aside from this being a scifi classic....","review":"....it remains quite a commentary on what people do when finding themselves in the unknown.

All options are open in these gripping tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"This book started out a bit confusing, but had enough plot twists (i.e. the asylum) and enough subplots to keep it going strong throughout the entire novel. It also totes some decent quotes, and overall is a worthy read. I however enjoyed it alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very heady, engaging","review":"Bradbury has a very interesting approach to sci-fi. He seems to to place all his stories within the reachable, not completely detatched from real life or the future. (like, ironically, most futuristic sci-fi works are)I'd definately recommend this book even to those who are normally uninteresting in sci-fi. It is short and if you end up not liking it you won't have wasted much time."},{"rating":"2","title":"short stories foecast and deliver the apocolypse","review":"bradbury is a morbid person but the realism (in that kooky-sci-fi kind of way) is pleasing, none-the-less. my favorite of the collection of stories is the verbial \\"Green Morning\\", about the forestation of the barren Mars landscape. on the other hand, \\"Usher II\\" made me ill. Feel free to form you own opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the weirdest book!","review":"Ray bradbury's book, The Martian Chronicles, was a complicated book. It was hard to read because nothing tied together, and every story was left with out an end. I understood it but never really liked it that much. Each individual chapter was terrific that is why I gave it any stars at all! The chapters made since but I just hoped that somehow they would eventually tie it all up together. This is my Review of the book The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury that was published in another world in 1948. This was reviewed by Stephanie :o"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupendous","review":"This book displays Ray Bradbury's incredible imagination and talent to make Mars, and life on Mars (something that could become very real) come to life. This book is a must - read for all sci-fi lovers and for people who like a good twist in their stories. Bradbury always comes up with some shock to end you with; leaving you wanting more and more. But since he has written 6 thousand other things we are very fortunate to have more. Don't let this be the one you don't read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"This is probably one of the best and most worthwhile books I've ever read. As a fun, exciting space story the book reads very well, but the true beauty of this work lies deeper-- in its examination of the philosophy of the human race. Although this book was written about fifty years ago, the message of it rings as true today as it did when it was first published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little creaky, but still worth reading","review":"It's been many years since I last read this collection, and I was surprised on several levels. I'd forgotten the lyrical language, laying the visual scenes and emotions down so clear you can see and feel them. Some of the ideas and concepts he was dealing with (exploitation of a new world; how a race might react to being invaded, how will religions adjust to meeting other races) are current topics still. Indeed, Stanley Kim Robinson focused on some of them in his Mars trilogy. But I was reminded that this book is a product of its time, especially when dealing with the roles of women and nuclear family, which stayed firmly in the 1950s. But some of the stories, notably Night Meeting, The Fire Balloons and The Martian are still gems. And it's always good read the old classics -- it helps one to appreciate where the new ones came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-fi","review":"Great book for enjoyable read. Written in the 1940's it looks into the future (1990's and 2000's). Great ideas to talk to high school and college kids. Unfortunate use of the \\"n\\" word makes it questionable for use. Although the look at the prediction of the treatment of Southern Blacks is interesting and can be a topic of discussion for advanced classes. Gomez's Martian meeting and their discussion of time is fascinating and a great discussion maker. How about writers taking type writers to Mars? So much for the computer. I have had much success with the topics presented with kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its glory has faded with time...","review":"The first time I read this book, a few years ago, I loved it and I worshipped Ray Bradbury. I found it profound and funny and sad and everything a good book should be and then some.The second time I read it...not so much. Maybe I'm getting older and more cynical. His bright-eyed enthusiasm and innocence is still refreshing, but the bemoaning of All We've Ruined gets a little old. And I find it a little disturbing that he repeatedly kills off the boring close-minded characters... like they don't deserve to live. And we haven't lost our imaginations and this planet isn't done for -- yet. Amazing how such an enthusiastic optimist can have so little hope.There are still gems and beauty here. The best thing about it is that it's not at all what you expect from the title(an effect clearly lost the second time through) and the absurdity of man is wonderfully funny at times. I guess I mostly just wish it didn't harp on the same things story after story. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"To be read again and again","review":"I read this book shortly after graduating High School and still read it from time to time. This collection of short stories is perfect for readers of all genres, be it sci-fi, mystery, romance, suspence & thriller or anything else.Bradbury wrote this collection in the 1940's, framing the storyline in the distant future (1999). Each story is centered around mans arrival and subsequent \\"conquest\\" of the planet Mars, but that the extra-terrestrial location is the only constant in this collection.This is not a hard sci-fi book filled with technical terms, theoretical physics and lengthy explanations of how pieces of technology work. The subject matter is very poetic and philosophical. You could breeze through this book in a single day, but if you do, read it again, because you're certain to have missed something special in this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was too unrealistic","review":"The book said that we would be on Mars in about 30 years and i thought that was way untrue it seems to close for us to be leaving a planet that desn't have to much wrong with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bradbnury Falters, Sci-Fi Nerd Stumbles, Calamity Ensues","review":"This book is HIGHLY overvalued. Most of the stories meander and are ultimately unsatisfying. Only a handful are meritorious, but they do not serve as justifiable rationale to purchase the book. Read Classic Stories I and The Illustrated Man instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool sci-fi book","review":"the martian chronicles is a book about humans colonizing Mars on the verge of the 'Great Atomic War.' they meet and 'invade' the martians, and both races see the planet differently. i would recommend this book to anybody at least ten years old"},{"rating":"1","title":"Martian exploration Bradbury style.","review":"I have read quite a number of Mars related novels, and seen many Mars related textbooks, as well as novels. The Martian Chronicles does not stand out as one of the better ones of the group.If you like the way that Bradbury writes, then go ahead and get this book. Just don't compare it to the mini-series, they are rather dissimilar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I first read Martian Chronicles at age 12, and find them just as compelling at age 59. It's important to remember that Bradbury wrote these stories in the late 40s, LONG before we had any idea what Mars was actually like (atmosphere, etc.) and long before we entered the space age. Considering that, his vision is extraordinary, particulary regarding how humans might view Mars and if we'd respect what might be there or take it over and ruin it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect....","review":"CRT has really done the impossible....they have brought the complete table of contents of the book to life, and maintained faithfulness to the stories (it's not really a novel) and to Bradbury's poetic prose, and that is no mean feat. It's spread over 6 discs and runs nearly six hours. Jerry Robbins and the CRT have numerous productions under their belt and are the most prolific of production companies in the genre of \\"theater of the ear\\". Give them a try, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bradbury","review":"I read the Martian Chronicles growing up in the early 70's. Bradbury was on of my favorite authors. The book does not disappoint if you love Sci Fi. I purchased this book for my 18 yr old son. He couldnt put the book down and read it through in 3 days. Very unsual for him to stick with a book like that. He raved about the book and is asking for Bradbury's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A provocative and thoughtful book","review":"Robert Merry analyzes brilliantly the historic wrong turns of American foreign policy that have taken us to the dangerous and unprecedented place we are today. It is a book that the policymakers of the Bush administration would do well to heed. For all Americans, his analysis is a wake-up call if we really want to be respected in the world as it is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty when it's paused!","review":"The visual style of this film is very striking and interesting, but the animation is unnatural at best and the story plods along like a 100-year-old donkey. It feels like a 19th-century fairy tale translated to the screen, word by antiquated word, with no regard for the very different medium that film is. I shall add this to my stack of films to watch on mute."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"CRAP, that just about sums up this impossibly s-l-o-w and preachy film.If you want to expose yourself to different cultures, may I recommend instead: Sita Sings the Blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely agree with above post","review":"don't usually post on these boards, but totally agree with the above poster. the movie is just amazing. will buy as soon as it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly beautiful film","review":"This is one of the most beautiful children's movies that I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot over the years). The graphics and especially the colors in this movie take your breath away, the music and singing are very moving, and the story is a new fairy tale, full of wonder and enchantment, but with some nice modern twists to it. I don't understand the objections of some other reviewers. There is nothing unsuitable to very young children (it's fine for 3-year-olds, although it may be better for 4-year-olds & up)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Schubert Piano Sonata","review":"hauting, ethereal, sparse, strand is, for me, the king of metaphor, and in some ways suspense. a wonderful selection, a desert island choice ... for the deserted."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated?","review":"I know a lot of people who love Mark Strand, & I know he has done a lot of work for poetry, but he really doesn't seem to me like he's a special poet, hype aside. I read a lot of poems in this book waiting for them to go somewhere, for Strand to find inspiration, but it never happened. The poems have a foot nailed to the ground & like it that way, so they can just sit there while other things do stuff. There are a few good poems, but anyone who writes a lot of poems writes a few that are good. If this is the kind of writing you want, maybe you would appreciate this guy, but there are so many poets of comparable aesthetic who do it so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"When Christie was on top of her game, no one was better, and this is a prime example of her amazing skills. A real fine twist ending will reverse every notion you may have had for the characters. Poirot is at his amusing, determined best here; his one flaw being he cares too much. It almost costs him the case. Hastings as usual narrates the story in his own daft and befuddled way. Hercule enjoys toying with him. Sort of like the way Christie must have enjoyed toying with her readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peril at End House","review":"really well thought out thriller with a good twist at the end. I always like Poirot. All the Poirot books stand the test of time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peril at End House","review":"As always it was a really good Agatha Christie read. Great fun for all of you die hard Hercule Poirot fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great twist makes it memorable","review":"It's fun to try to figure out who the killer is in Christie's mysteries. She generally plays fair and there is a satisfaction in following the clues to an end. This one tricked me and that made it fun. Poirot also heads in the wrong direction so at least I was not alone. A number of attempts are made on a young woman's life, leading Poirot to investigate and do his best to save her. A number of twists and turns and a few suspicious characters made this a very satisfying addition to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"give 'em a break!","review":"Ok,I read all the other reviews of this album, and I'm glad to see that I am not the only person on this planet who likes this album. Its really a good album. It was just made at a different time. They weren't really friends anymore (like they were in the 1960's) John and michelle were divorced (michelle married Dennis Hopper in 1970,whether they still were in '71 I dont know)Michelle had to sing a song about Johns new lady friend (Lady Genevieve was about Genevieve Waite) John and Dennie both released solo albums which both (were quite good..but)flopped. And it was the 1970's so they probably decided to \\"modernize\\" their sound a little. Still creative, Still harmonic, still the Mamas and the Papas."},{"rating":"1","title":"None of the chaos shows...but there's no joy, either","review":"Contractually required to come up with a record, John Phillips closes the chapter on his Mamas & Papas tale with a lovely but inconsequential record. It opens with a blissful title cut, but loses inspiration from there. Yes, it is enjoyable in spots, but there's very little personality in evidence, no heart and no soul. C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Bad Album","review":"There is no bigger fan of The Mama's And The Papa's (anyone else notice that their name is a grammatical error?) than I am. I re-listened to their five studio albums recently, and this album is every bit as bad as I remembered.Hearing \\"European Blueboy\\" was the inspiration for this review. I wrote in the liner notes (for when I listen again, in ten years), \\"This is the single worst song the M's & P's ever wrote\\". I dare you to name another.This album is for completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is Mama?","review":"Snow queen from texas is a cool song. Mama Cass musta took the month off as she is nowhere to be found on this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I haven't tried any others to compare, but I am having trouble consuming this product so I can't review if it good for the health or not. The taste is very strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I have had","review":"I have purchased other bee pollen from one of my favorite brands but this one tastes WAY better. I also feel a peace of mind knowing it is organic. Love it and shipment time was wonderful.If you have read about the health benefits of bee products and are considering bee pollen, the flavor of this one is worth the price, hands down. It is a smidge sweeter and the texture is better, too. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"gross","review":"This stuff tastes nasty. It youre going to get this product, be prepared to gag when trying to swallow. Not entirely sure how bee pollen should taste, but from descriptions of other bee pollen types, im sure it's supposed to taste better than this. lol!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one issue","review":"I got this product as I ran out and needed a new supply. This was made by the same company I had originally so I thought ok cool. However, the color and flavor are not the same as what I've been using. It was a bit of a surprise since I have used this company's product for some time now... anyway, not entirely certain why the change and it threw me off a bit.... I'll have to see if there is a difference somewhere that I did not identify prior to purchase. Don't get me wrong... its a fine product but there is just something \\"different\\" about it that I can't place my finger on. Hope this helps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but overpriced and unnecessary","review":"I would purchase this again if it were $20.dollars less. It is not really necessary as a substantial 'regular' hanger would work fine.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, but you get what you pay for","review":"I bought this at a local Sporting Goods store for $150 because of the price and brought it to the range. I could range the 50, 100 and 150 signs. I was able to range the 181 yard flag...once only. And the bright yellow 200 yard sign....forget it. I tried until the battery was dying, balanced it against a board and still couldn't hit it. Forget all the other pins. I was able to return it and am waiting for a Nikon with it's First Priority program to go on sale. Maybe good for other uses, but not golf."},{"rating":"2","title":"range finder bushnell","review":"great range finder easy to use an is very fast giving u the yardage that u laser. can't beat this range finder for the price"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot for golf","review":"This unit works effectively only under 200 yds. and will not find a pin on the green.In order to get a reading, you must focus on a golf cart, a tree, or a person on the green. The rangefinder can work well in hunting when a large stationary target is available, but for golf, although very accurate, has limited application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bushnell Sport 450","review":"This product does not lock on to flags over 130 yards with any consistency. I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a golf distance finder","review":"This item was returned for credit. It simply does not work outside of about 100 yards. Beyond 100 yards or so, when the flag was in front of any other target (i.e. trees, etc.) it would only register the farther away target. When only the flag was visible, it would not register the distance at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"ng for golf","review":"I got this item as a gift in the winter I could not use it until late summer. Bushnel says it was not made for golf but for hunting. It does not give true readings to the flag at all. It is advertised as using for that shot of a life time ,What a line of bull.They will do nothing for me because I did not contact them within 30 days. An impossibility since I could not try it for a few months.

I love Avril's music (her \\"Let Go\\" CD is one of my favorite CDs), but this CD does not do her justice. The woman singing on the tribute sings every song horribly. Anyone who ever thought Avril had a bad voice must listen to the tribute, and they'll think again - she's a thousand times better than this woman. If you like Avril at all, DO NOT waste your money on this tribute album. Just listen to \\"Let Go\\", or purchase it if you haven't already. Someday, if Avril is around long enough, there will probably be another tribute to her, only this time it will involve some real talent. Skip this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH LORD","review":"MY GOD THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP. WHO EVER PRODUCED THIS ALBUM MUST BE DEAF. THIS IS NOT A GOOD TRIBUTE.

Sure each song is a near spot-on remake of each tune from Avril's debut disc (which begs the question why make this in the first place?!), and yes they're a lot weaker in vocal power than the Canadian songstress, but overall they are pleasureable to listen to!

The girl isn't talented and is the worst breed of poser punk and i was unfortunate enough to recieve this item as a gift. Upon listening to it I discovered two things: One, no artist of her character deserves a tribute CD, Two, The only thing worse than listening to Avril Lavigne is listening to people trying to be like her.

Its just Avril's songs done exactly the same way/style that Avril has already done and the quality of this album is terrible. I do not like the voice of the singer and this whole bit reeks of rip-off. I am returning my copy to the place I bought and I suggest you do not make the same mistake I did.

This book was part of that effort.IMHO, the book had some useful tips, but what I disliked most was the feeling that I was being talked down to.

I'm not going to Paris.Perhaps Ms. Platt's tips on behavior are probably applicable all over France, but perhaps not. I mean, do you go about things in the same way in Seattle as you do in New York?

They are precision devices and allow us to park our extended mini-van in the garage perfectly every time w/o having to get outside to make sure the garage can shut. The battery problem that a couple people are talking about is probably because of improper placement or clutter in the garage. We noticed that the device was staying on all the time because we were refinishing a piece of furniture in the garage that was just close enough to the sensor's range that it was activating it (it always thought a car was being parked) and it never shut off.

I should have done more research before buying it.A few folks have commented about the off-balance spin cycle effect of this juicer. I thought that would just be a minor issue. I've since discovered that it's anything but minor. When off balance, the whole juicer literally jumps around the counter, vibrating out of control. It's more than just a big racket. When it happens, I can't even get to the on/off switch, so I have to unplug it to get it to stop. By then I have a real mess on my hands. It's downright scary when this happens.

It never travels too far from my CD player. That being said, I sprung for the \\"import\\" version that has two extra tracks: \\"Yer Son\\" (a good, but not great, Dino Jr. song) and \\"Tiny Town\\" (40 seconds of punk riffing that could've been done by anybody). In my opinion, not worth twice (or more) the price of what the regular release is going for. Unless you're a die-hard Dinosaur Jr. completist or can find the \\"extra tracks\\" version at a great price, just buy the regular version and use the money saved to buy a copy of 'You're Living All Over Me', 'Green Mind' or some other early Dinosaur Jr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where You Been?","review":"Well, it really doesn't matter does it? I'm just glad Barlow and Mascis got back together. Really, I think Beyond is better than what J had been putting out with The Fog and is a high water mark that will increase Dinosaur's reputation and legend. I heard the first two songs and was instantly amazed. Indeed, \\"Almost Ready\\" and \\"Grumble\\" are as good as anything the band's ever put out. I've enjoyed the entire CD and expect to like it even more than I do now in the weeks to come. Complexity and richness are the unique attributes of these impeccable musicians. There is tantalizing texture to the music that makes the rest of what is out there today look like the shallow dreck it is.

It forces you to think about all issues involved in running a company, not just the product development side. The appendixed example of a business plan in the book is one of the best I've seen for a small enterprise. Most other books on Software development I have are too academic to be workable but this one is not. This book doesn't deal a great deal with actual software engineering practices so don't buy it if that is your main objective.

She found it in her school's library and kept it checked out for most of the school year, reading it over and over again.I adored it, too, for its sly humor and the beauty of its drawings. It really deserves to have a broader audience than it has found. So glad to find it here on Amazon so that I can buy her a copy of her own.This is the perfect book to read slowly with your child before bed at night in order to savor, discuss and explain all the details.

I keep this on my shelf along with The Orthodox Church by Bishop Kallistos Ware, and The Mystical Theology of the Orthodox Church by Vladimir Lossky. This is a fine translation by Father Seraphim Rose, a gifted and intelligent man who became an atheist as a young man but after his college years, walked into a Russian Orthodox Church and became a Priest, Monk, and Scholar. Don't let the controversy surrounding his views concerning aspects of the intermediate state keep you away from this book.

I was surprised not to like this one. First, there are really sweaty people in here. Not that you're not supposed to sweat in the video, but it was just kind of gross - especially one of the men in there with hairy pits. Then, there are two dancers in there who are obviously paid dancer talent. I'd rather not see those in Richards videos. I quit using this because even the music didn't move me and that usually gets me every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I couldn't wait for this tape to arrive - thought it would be a fun work out to disco - I was very disappointed.

I bought one to replace the pair I installed initially, which had been in the car for under a year when one of them burned out. The yellow tint is subtle, but light output is good and they do a nice job of cutting through Seattle's rain and fog. I docked them a star because one of them burned out before a year was up, but the other one is still holding up fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as yellow as I thought it would be","review":"The lights work great; they are bright and have held up well on a motorcycle. They just don't appear to be very yellow, in fact no one who has seen them though that they were yellow.

Go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in color","review":"Other reviews pale to describe just how yellow these lights aren't. They literally look like a 1980s sealed beam, or a normal lamp with weak power. If they were not already installed, I would send them back on principle alone. It's a lot of $ to spend on something that doesn't do what you wanted it to do.I realize that the fogs of today are a brighter yellow than the medium yellows of yesteryear.

My intentions are so that my lights would stand out against all the other cars on the road with lights on.I was disappointed to find that the yellow seemed more like a \\"dulled out\\" white light. Much like the light intensity of a dying headlight in a old car; quite dim looking. This definitely wouldn't stand out against any other common car white lights on the road.Not only was it not very yellow, one of the 2 bulbs died withing 3months of use. I bought this in November. Installed and used all of December, January, and February. In March, one of the bulbs burned out.At the time, I purchased these for $5.50 each bulb.

Useful are the included tables for various film development times and chemicals. It is ironic however, that the litho plate print examples of the different zones are not executed carefully enough.

The book is needed for a class that I am planning on taking in the Winter quarter. This was cheaper then buying it from the bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to understand summary of Zone System","review":"This book is a clear and well organized review of the Zone System. It includes the Zone System for both traditional film and for digital. The system means properly exposing for certain levels of gray that may appear in your frame. For film, a person may want to properly capture the dark tones in a photograph, and then shorten or lengthen the development time (time the unexposed film spends in chemical developing) in order to achieve the level of brighter tones in the photo. For digital, it's the oppposite. Properly expose the frame for the brighter tones (so they are not blown out), then adjust the dark shades in Photoshop. I liked the book. Just after I read it, I saw Annie Leibovitz's exhibition \\"A Photographer's Life\\", and the book gave me a much greater appreciation for her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great binoculars","review":"I have purchased over ten of these in the past ten years, they get heavy duty use and they have all been great.

I loan them out to friends and they love them. I give them as gifts to friends and customers. The best. About to buy another set for a friend for birthday. Great quality for price."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like PermaOutOfFocus","review":"I guess I should have read the fine print more carefully. These binoculars have no focusing ability whatsoever. To be fair, they are (somewhat) in focus at considerable distance to infinity, but I can't adjust them to my particular vision (so they're never exactly in focus for me at any distance), and they're of no use at closer distances. I should have bought the Nikon version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Binos!","review":"Excellent, solidly built binos with limitations. Light gathering ability is great with the 50mm aperature! Simply put, the binos will not improve your eyesight. If you have 20/20 eyesight, the binos work perfectly whether you are looking at objects near or far. If you wear glasses for distance viewing, you will need to wear glasses when using the binos and looking at distant objects - same rules apply for objects that are closer. In my case, I remove my eyeglasses to see close-in objects and when I want to view distant objects, I use my glasses with the binos. I use these for watching events as well as birding and recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wednesday Witch","review":"I read this book 5 times and each time I enjoyed it even more.

Maybe seller should have pictured the right book. It was a childhood favorite when I was ten, now 40. Just wanted to pass the memories onto my child.

Flags are frequently in front of houses and or trees. It is difficult to obtain the correct yardage for these holes.

It is a convenient size that fits in my pocket or can be slipped into an open pocket of your golf bag. It is extremely light in weight.Some observations:1. It is difficult to hold the laser on a flag over 100 yards away. I try to aim it at someone standing on the green (if available), or a sand trap that is close to the green. The scan mode is also useful, it provides continuous readouts so you can confirm your distance.2. Serveral of my friends have invested in Sky Caddies that are similarly priced but work off of the satellites. They are much easier to use and the satellite is free. You can map out the course yourself or pay a few bucks and download the info."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"This rangefinder seems to work flawlessly. I have no complaints about it. However I will never buy another bushnell product again. They have the worst customer service I have ever seen. I bought a brand new scope off of them to find out that it's defective. It's got a \\"lifetime warranty\\" so I sent it back to them and they said that there was a problem with the image erector and they said that they wouldn't cover the warranty on it because it was my fault. I only used the thing one time and I'm always careful with my scopes. So that was 150 bucks down the drain. So buy a bushnell if you want but don't expect them to help you out if it breaks. I would recommend nikon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can be easily broken.","review":"You should make sure to hold tight this yardage during the game.

It takes that concept further than most doctors would, not only preventing the big killers (Heart attack, heart disease, diabetes, etc.) but also the common flu, allergies, and other childhood illnesses. He has a no-holds barred attitude about society's norms and morales, and it's a refreshing but not overly paranoid view of the food world we live in.I'm already a vegan but it gave me some great ideas on some things I should be adding to my children's diet as well as my own. What's good for the goose is good for the gander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book if your child has food allergies","review":"I was very excited about this book after reading all of the wonderful reviews. A large number of the healthy recipes that are recommended have nuts. The author continues to recomend nuts and nut oils and nut butters over and over again to the point where I just want to stop reading because I CAN'T use that. I really wish he would provide at least a section of the book giving sugggestions on how to modify the diet he recommends for those who can't use nuts. At this point my purchase was a waste of $."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't read this book.....But read Joel Fuhrman's other books.","review":"This was a gift for an employee with a new baby. I didn't read it. But I believe in Dr. Fuhrman's candidapproach showing how most US citizens are eating themselves into disease & early death with the current government approved diet. I think the sooner people get on a healthy diet, the better. Our own First Lady is pushing a proper diet......even if the US Health Department isn't . Wish she would march over there and crack the whip at them.....revamp their department. I guess it's a little hard to advise US citizens to give up meat, eggs, milk & cheese given the huge number of US citizens who make a living bringing those things to market."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"The information is good but the authors writing style is terrible. He repeats the same thing over and over in what seems to be in an attempt to make the book longer. This book could have been half the size it is if he didn't repeat himself.

Being written from an evangelical standpoint doesn't help matters. Though some of it is true (Mormons don't believe in the Trinity, etc), much else is misleading (such as the charge that in Joseph Smith's Inspired Version of the Bible, he wrote in a prophesy that mentioned him by name-- when in fact it mentioned only his first name, not his whole name).

Installation was harder than I expected, because the harness routing was done at the factory at a point that required more disassembly than I wanted to do.

It's difficult to assemble (think 3d jigsaw puzzle), awkward to clean (too many flimsy, finicky parts), and if you don't do everything just perfectly, it self-destructs without warning - a feature not listed in the manual.Sadly, and most worryingly, Omega customer support did not even respond to my email for a replacement part, so I returned to Amazon for a refund.To Omega -- an occasional lemon product is entirely forgivable. And perhaps that's what I got. But shoddy customer service is not. I'll take my money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid!","review":"This is a high quality and solid machine with a lifetime warranty. It does a great job juicing vegetables, and even though it isn't supposed to handle citrus, we have had no trouble putting lemons and limes through it to add some zing to vegetable juices. Also easy to clean. We use it every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product!","review":"I'm glad I purchased this. It's smaller than my old juicer, which is nice, mostly.

So far I'm enjoying it, and I've used it several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Juicer","review":"After making the decision to purchase a juicer I started by searching on line to see what was important to others making their purchases. Warranty, ease to clean and quietness when running appeared frequently and when I saw that the Omega 4000 met these specs I finally made the decision to purchase it. While waiting for the juicer to arrive I saw an info-mercial on the Nutri-Bullet and was then concerned that I made the wrong choice. However after talking to a homoepath practitioner she said that I had made the far superior choice. I really like the juice that I can make and because we have a large garden and many apple trees I hope to make large quantities and freeze the juice. The juicer is quiet and not hard to clean. Just like preparing any meal there is always cleanup :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to take apart for cleaning","review":"Very difficult to take apart. I have a refrigerator full of fruits and vegetables that will go bad because I cannot take the Omega 4000 juicer apart to clean. I have a friend that has also had this problem.

After a week of use, a simple plastic wing nut broke. Unfortunately, it's the one piece that secures everything together. It's a plastic piece and should be metal or of stronger material. We can't get it out of the juicer without pliers. My husband replaced it with a regular wing nut, but it isn't quite the right size. Today, I tried to use it in the hopes that with pliers I could get it to work. I tried to loosen the original piece that broke off, but the plastic piece is totally disintegrating. With the price of this juicer and the amount I paid for it, it means each drink I had came to approximately $40. That's horrible. A truly awful design flaw that is not easily replaced. I'd like to return this as defective, but they're probably all like this. So deeply disappointed.You shouldn't have to use pliers and replace pieces on your own with only a few uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"more food less weight","review":"Super great cook book everyone losing wiegt should try this book.If there is a better cook book for wieght loss I havent found it.Easy and simple to use with great tasting food.So great i bought 3.One for me an 2 for friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER [CHEAT]","review":"I was actually a client of Dr. Shapiro's and he is only interested in one thing-MONEY! He has made a nice living for himself with his books, but the nutritional education he offers is minimal and his books don't really offer anything but a fad diet.

I followed his diet religiously everyday with zero result. I never reached my goal weight. I have since been successful after joining Weight Watchers and a local gym.

HAD to have her since there seems to be a big hype about what a wonderful doll she is. Though my daughter does play with her, she doesn't seem to prefer her to the much cheaper dolls purchased at Target.

I bought all the outfits made by Manhattan Toy, but to be honest, all of them, especially the diapers in the diaper bag set, are made quite cheaply. So, out of curiosity, I went to the Etsy website and searched for \\"baby Stella doll\\".

I gave it as a gift to my 1 year old grandaughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stella is Great!","review":"This doll was purchased for my niece for her first birthday. The construction is amazing. She is soft to the touch, but do not mistake that for \\"fluffy\\" - she actually has beans of some sort in her bottom which allows her to sit. She's not the squishy kind of stuffed animal doll, and she's kind of heavy for a young toddler, but she is absolutely adorable!We love that the pacifier is magnetic! This completely prevents any frustration that may occur from tiny hands trying to fit a paci into a doll's mouth.Her little toes are precious. :DGreat gift for any toddler/preschooler! I would definitely recommend her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great doll, but not well made","review":"My daughter got this doll right after her first birthday. It is a cute doll, easy for her to play with, and she likes it a lot. After 5 months, I noticed her finger stitches were coming out on one hand. I know how to sew so I fixed it. Today (we've had Stella for 6 months), I noticed her head was coming unattached! There was an inch gap between her neck and her head. Again, I know how to sew so I fixed it, but I can't believe she's coming apart so easily. My daughter is NOT rough with her so it is a factory problem. This doll would be 1000 times better if it was made to last. I'm pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"beige?","review":"I LOVE baby Stella dolls.

It just arrived in the mail about 10 minutes ago. Even though I am Caucasian, I do not like to buy blond haired blue eyed dolls. This doll's skin color is perfect and just what I wanted! She has a nice deep tan - same as mine, dark brown hair (not black) and brown eyes. If I had to racially classify this doll she would probably be considered Hispanic or Bi-racial. The quality is fantastic and she is very soft. My daughter's birthday is 2 weeks away and when she saw the doll she flipped out and wanted her immediately. I tried taking the doll to the other room (so I could give it to her on her actual birthday) and my daughter clearly became upset.

Inquisitive little fingers didn't help the situation. Had to take it away from her till I had time to mend it. The shoddy workmanship is real disapointment. I guess it's lucky I'm pretty good with a needle and thread, but for the money this doll cost, I shouldn't have to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE Baby Stella!","review":"My daughter received Baby Stella as a gift when she was 15 months old. It has been her favorite doll ever since that time and she is now 22 months old. I am sure Baby Stella's pacifier is the reason my daughter loves her so much. She can related to this doll in a way she can't with other dolls. I only wish the pacifier was attached to Baby Stella. Originally I did not cut off the plastic tie connecting the pacifier to Baby Stella. But, it finally gave way. Luckily I had an extra pacifier clasp and string (the ones intended for real children) lying around. It is now keeping Baby Stella's pacifier firmly attached to her. The issue with the pacifier is the only reason I am taking a star off of my rating. However, it is easily fixed with a real pacifier string, if you are willing to spend the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely doll, my 21 month old loves it.","review":"This was only one of the Babay Stella sets my mother gave my 21 month old daughter for Christmas.

It is so soft and cuddly, with a little tummy button, baby belly and bottom. My daughter loves it and this is the first doll she has taken to as before she would just throw them on the floor after looking at them. Baby Stella sleeps with her every night.

With use, it becomes more and more difficult to get a good seal between the guage and your valve stem because: (1) the outer rubber sleeve on the tip of the guage tends to slide when you press the guage against the valve stem of your tires; and (2) the actual piece of the guage that makes contact with the center of your valve stem is made of plastic, not metal, and it wears out rather quickly. The result is that my guage does not even work due to worn parts after only one year of moderate use. Although now useless, the guage looks so nice I still have not thrown it away.

Hard to believe it only lasted that long ... I could just change the battery, but why? The gauge itself is incredibly hard to get on the stem without hearing the hiss of air escaping your tires. Every now and then, I could get a perfect lock the first time, but it's rare and hard to do. I don't know about the accuracy ... I have a pen style gauge that always show 2 pounds more pressure per tire than this digital model.I have an Evo VIII, and tire pressures greatly influence the handling of the car, so I wanted a top quality gauge. Unfortunately I got one that looks really nice, but is too hard to use and wore out too fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead at just over a year old","review":"In addition to the previously discussed problem of getting a good seal, I tried to use it the other day, and found it is totally dead. Replacing the button cells did not correct the problem. Seems the lithium battery failed prematurely. Considering the seal problem, I doubt I will bother to pay shipping & insurance to return it to the manufacturer for repair even if it is within the 5 year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple is better","review":"Being a mechanic I should have known better. This tire gage is not only the worst tire gage I have ever bought but it is the worst tool I had ever bought. After the third use it leaked to the point where I had to reinflate my tires and recheck them with a simple yet always reliable analog gage. Not only that but I compared the accuracy with a calibrated gage from my shop and found the accutire gage was up to 5 psi off. Take some advice from a mechanic/sucker the simpler the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't seal","review":"I bought this item and then returned it.

Now it is impossible to get an accurate reading because rubber gasket fell right out!

Then throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tire gauge!!!","review":"Easy to read-great storage case-however, must hold on tire stem a little longer than standard pressure gauges to get reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk","review":"I've had this gauge for a few years, but stopped using it with any regularity pretty quickly. Worked great the first few months, then the plastic tip wore out and no longer stayed centered in the hole, and it now takes several tries to get a good seal and thus a good reading. The rubber shroud over the tip slips forward and gets in the way as you push ever harder, trying to get a good seal and bleeding off pressure with every try.Don't waste your money.

And because this is such a recipe-particular rather than general taste-and-technique cookbook, it is difficult to be flexible with the recipes in terms of substitution. This is a cookbook for the purist and not for the practical cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but not a great one","review":"I have made many of the recipes from this book and have enjoyed the results of my efforts. Ms. Wolfert is a recognized expert on the cooking of the region, and as such could have used her status to impart her experiences with the culture as well as the food. One book which does this beyond compare is the book by Sonia Uvezian: A culinary journey through Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan which is now unfortunately unavailable. Kudos to Ms. Wolfert for including sources for hard-to-find ingredients at the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many kibbeh and Kurdish recipes","review":"I agree with the Russian reviewer that the ingredientlist sometimes gets too esotoric. I felt the same wayeven though I am very familiar with the region'scooking. The problem had to do with Wolfert'sexclusive attention to the Kurdish cooking, a fireyand spicy way of cooking compared to the regularTurkish or Greek Mediterranean cooking. And what was the reasonfor including a million different kibbeh recipes,all essentially the same spicy meat ball. That wasa waste of time. May I also add that Georgian, andNorth Balkan(Bulgaria, Romania etc) dishes have NO business in a Mediterranean cookbook. True Eastern Mediterranean is Turkish,and Greek cooking, anything else is a wannabe. Yes, you can throw in a few syrian, and north egyptian dishes but can you find calamari in Syria, Kurdish Diyarbakir, Bulgaria, or Romania? I don't think so. Wolfert incorrectly identifies these regions as mediterrenaen when they are anything but."},{"rating":"2","title":"An indispensable reference","review":"In an environment where technology has made change commonplace, one can still look to the rule of law to engender a stable foundation upon which business can be conducted.

These early live sets show a group of virtuosos who know how to play and entertain as well. Beware of the urge to break into spontaneous dancing. Energetic, melodic and funky with late 50s swing - I've always liked Peterson, but these shows are particularly infectuous. Concerts take place in Paris at the Olympia and Theatre des Champs-Elysees. Sound is pretty decent, probably in mono but the theartre acoustics are good. This is a great deal for a double disc set and some otherwise rare Peterson trio performances. Dates range '57 to '63.

Rather than hear about the wunderkund who still sells-out halls and makes great music at his leisure, I felt more curious about the rest of the band, who were basically discarded.The book has great anecdotes about the early days, touring, working hard, and coping with the sudden end of the band. There is no bitterness, which was good. There are also great photos (with not so great captions), and some stuff about Paul that I don't believe even Paolo Hewitt knows. I highly recommend this read for any fan of the Jam, and anyone who thinks they know what it's like to be in a successful band...Think again!

This record will grab you by your neck and beat you with your own spinal cord (if you listen to this recording, the impossible is possible). I like how DEP tries to cram all of the guitar riffs into one thing. It's amazing. Dillinger Escape Plan has music much in the same vein of other technical metal bands (Crytopsy, Meshuggah, etc., etc.). Insane drumwork, Breakneck speed, amazing guitar riffs, funky bass. The good thing is that sometimes, DEA is not entirely heavy. For awhile they'd be killing your dog with their music, next they will be going through a jazzy, melodious run.

There are no bands, underground or (LAUGHS) mainstream that can compare to the madness of Dillinger Escape Plan. Each song contains an average of perhaps twelve tempo changes, from grinding slow to upbeat jazz to ludicrously fast. Over each tempo is played a dizzying array of shredded, tapped, and squeeled harmonies which are both nails-on-chalkboard painful and annoyingly head-bangable simultaneously. Give it a few listens since it may take a while to adapt to such a massively unique sound. The wait is well worth it.Perhaps the two most accurate desciptions I've ever heard of DEP:1. \\"Mr. Bungle after a sheet-lightning enima and a generous dose of industrial-stength steroids. and 2.

In addition, the bags are very had to find (online only) and you can't get the special micro-lined bags for this model. It looks good but everything is cheep thin plastic.

I decided on the Boulud cookware after looking at Le Creuset for months. It's heavy and multi purpose: you can brown, stew, oven braise all in the same pan. Plus it's big enough to cook a whole chicken (I got the 5 quart for this reason). And clean up was surprisingly easy.You will want to slightly reduce your cooking temperatures and times, however, because the pan holds heat much better (and longer) than a conventional roasting pan. And get a potholder before reaching for the lid, even for stovetop cooking. I think the hot grips would be my only criticism -- I only did it once before learning to leave a potholder nearby!The price beats Le Creuset by a mile, and you get the same features."},{"rating":"1","title":"packing error","review":"While the cookware I purchased appears to be quite nice, I did not receive the item I ordered.

I rented this movie for Jessica Alba in a bikini. What I got, in addition to Ms. Alba's fine form, was a pretty entertaining story. It was nothing earth-shaking, mind you, it's kind of an updated version of The Deep which had Jacklyn(sic) Bisset in a very memorable scene involving a wet tee shirt.The film was beautifully shot, making me want to strap on a pair of fins and a face mask and jump into the water. I doubt very much that the East River would provide anything close to gorgeous dive scenes in the movie.There's not a lot of heavy lifting in the acting department, but the cast does a fine job. Scott Caan in particular plays his yuppie, scumbag, bottom-feeding lawyer role to the hilt.Overall, this is a good popcorn movie I would not hesitate to reccomend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prophet","review":"If you read the book \\"The Prophet\\" one could undertand himself better and find out where the joy is originated from...and that Life is like salt on the top of a cupcake....Enjoy Kahlil's books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I had to read this for a school assignment and wasn't particularly looking forward to it, but I am so glad I did. This book is amazing. It chronicles the famous Scottsboro trial, from the initial incident all the way through to many years after the trial. The book is written very convincingly in that it tries to present the different perspectives of relevant parties/persons. This made me feel like Goodman wasn't trying to push his own agenda but was instead simply presenting as best he could an accurate historical account of the facts surrounding Scottsboro. The book itself is written like a story, but you can tell from its presentation that the \\"story\\" was very historically driven and all facts mentioned were well-documented. A fascinating account of Scottsboro. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about it. I'm not sure a better resource exists on this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Glimpse at the Making of an Iconic Work of Art","review":"The author occasionally lapses into overly academic prose - the sort of thing you have to read 3 times before you can glean any meaning from it. Having said that, the book is very informative and insightful and leaves the reader with much to think about. I appreciate that he didn't assign any specific meanings to the work; he provides the mythical and historical context which allows the reader to begin to think intelligently about the layers of meaning in the choice of characters and their placement in the canoe. I say \\"begin to think intelligently\\" because you can't absorb the full symbolic meaning, importance, and relevance of the applicable Haida myths, stories and history from one book. This book is a great place to begin the journey to a greater understanding though, and I know I'll have a much deeper appreciation of this amazing sculpture next time I visit its counterpart, the Jade Canoe, at YVR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"i Expected alot more for the price. but was dissapointed with the quality if the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any techno fan","review":"When I first saw this CD, it was \\"Oh no, another House retrospective with the same old songs.\\" But this is the best damn retro compilation I've ever heard. Hard to think that most of this music was recorded when the average \\"raver\\" was still in diapers. There's lots of stuff here that I'd never heard before, some truly classic stuff showing the whole range of dark -> happy acid tracks, stuff that most of us either no longer have on vinyl and would never manage to find again. Given the technological limitations of the time, a lot of these artists had to rely a lot more on raw groove and melody as opposed to studio trickery - some of this stuff might have been done only with an 808 and a 303, but you find yourself listening to it again... and again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"duuuude!","review":"All your favorite techno liberators on one CD?

The bed does not hold its shape, it's like a rag laying on the floor that needs constant adjusting to put it back into postion. The pillow is about 2\\" smaller then the center where it sits for the pet to lay on. It is flat with very little padding and no support for an older dog. I am ready to throw it out!!!

My puppy grew out of his small Fido bed, but because he loved it and it washed so well, I went out of my way to get what I thought would be the same bed in a larger size. All the stuffing in the cushion shifted to one spot when it was washed. Also, the cushion is smaller that the bed and leaves a gap between cushion and sides of bed. That didn't happen in the smaller version. I'm just disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dog's heaven","review":"My dog and cat love the new bed!

Why they group this band with a bunch of hard rock bands is completely beyond me. There's not even a hint of distortion in the guitars, and it seems to me like the singer is a whiny eleven year old. I'm not mad i bought it and it wasn't hard rock, cause I'm into softer stuff as well, Lifehouse, Stir, Forty Foot Echo, you name it as long as it isn't garbage. BUT THIS, this is horrible, there's no words to actually describe the horrid music contained on this disc. File 13. If I was president I would have every copy of this everywhere burned.

This is the ONLY reason I read this book. I mistook it for a short story initially. I've never read the author before, but this book is amateurish at best. Simplistic, short, disappointing.

Way too many long-term, complex problems solved in a day to even be considered minutely believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belva Plain One of the Very Best","review":"I have read all of Belva Plain's novels and she never dissappoints.

I got halfway through this book and can't even stand to finish it. The characters were difficult to keep straight and the writing jumped from present to past, first person to third person. It was weird. Whatever you do, don't buy this book. It's not worth borrowing from the library. Hard to believe she got paid for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Belva Plain I'm Used To!","review":"There is something this story is missing. Everyone in 85 year old Annette Byrne's family is at war with each other. She wants to gather her family together at home and have them all make peace even knowing the strong bitterness between them. Annette does just that, and they all have a big fight with one another until an incident happens to bring them together while meeting at Annette's home.I don't know-this story lacked something though. I think it was that she didn't develop the characters enough for the plot which was shallow somehow. I see where more could have been developed and elaborated on before the run-in with each other at the meeting took place.Belva Plain usually writes with more depth than this with each one of her characters in the past books I read of hers.

After reading the Evergreen saga from Evergreen to Harvest, this book was very disappointing.. It lacked the depth of plot and characters I was expecting after reading the others.

I used to enjoy her novels - this one is TERRIBLE. First of all, no one would put up with Annette, the bumbling old fool of a woman who interferes with everyone's lives but then is portrayed as a sweet, tolerable, darling. UGH! Secondly, the syrup drips heavily when an extremely unlikely accident claims the lives of a pair of twins, and when another little girl falls in a frozen lake, you can not only see the ending clearly, everything from that point on is predictable and ridiculous. I can't figure out what the point of the whole story is. I began to feel bored when Annette's young friend condones her wishes to plan a surprise get - together of enemies, and I nearly fell asleep trying to keep this motley crew of characters straight. Don't waste your money on this one, in fact, don't even take it out of the library and waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty, cliche-ridden froth","review":"This is a story that has already been written many times, mostly by people like Barbara Taylor Bradford. Not only is it totally predictable, right down to the almost-drowning in the icy pond, but the characters are all flimsy, one-dimensional people and, mercifully, completely forgettable. To add insult to injury, the paperback is priced at around six dollars, even though the print is DOUBLE SPACED! What a rip-off.

They just don't understand! Yea, so there are stories of girls who expierment with sex and drugs, who hurt themselves and are depressed, but there is at least one story in here that you will be able to relate to. For all the adults who gave this book low rating I am digusted, you cannot judge this book because you're not a teenage girl growing up right now. I'm not saying all girls are despressed, suicidal, etc etc, but you cannot find one girl on the face of the earth who has not at least considered some of things in this book. It was a relief for me to find girls writing the very same things I have thought, but never expressed to a living soul. I read lots of these type of books and this is one of the best.

Still, I did wonder, when the first chapter is about body image, why the cover displays girls who are clearly the pretty girls at school. Doesn't this lessen the author's and contributors' hope that girls should not be judged by their looks? Also, I would suggest that the topics are slightly skewed from the average teen experience if only because we tend to write more about difficulties than less challenging topics. Still, these difficult topics are important to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 2 Cups of Chicken Soup","review":"I feel that teenage girls can relate more to this book than anyChicken Soup for the Teenage Soul.

Yes, there were some valid essays that enlightened me, but some of them would have been better left in thier private journals where they can fantasize about all the pain and suffering they are enduring.

Strongly reminiscent of the cartoon version, this makes for one very enjoyable film. Glenn Close is simply stunning as Cruella. Whoever cast her is nothing less than a genius. However, the movie does tend to be more slapstick than real genuine humour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Compliment to the Original Classic","review":"Turning the animated classic into a live action movie was a big gamble, and it worked! The actors take on the personalities of the original animated characters, including Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, who is wickedly over the top. The quality of the DVD is excellent , with sharp picture and very good sound. The only weakness in the movie was the lack of extras. Only a trailer, no outtakes or commentary. Disney should be able to bring better value to it's DVD's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CORNY!","review":"One of the WORST films by Disney is this \\"101 Dalmations\\", which is a live-action version of the original cartoon movie & is nowhere near as good. All it was is just a retelling of the story obviously, but very little excitement and fun, bad acting and cheesy, cheesy, cheesy special effects. (not to mention the jokes sucked!) It is also TOO short! They could've added in more and it would've been better but it all ended too soon. Disney is really going downhill with these sequels and remakes and I suggest that they STOP now!! How anybody could like this film is beyond me! This is the stupidest, crappiest movie remake ever! Save your money and buy the original cartoon version instead cause it's 100% better than this smelly pile of dog crap! Your kids will also like it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Play on TV","review":"I was so happy to receive this on DVD. It is one of my favorite movies.

Read the entire ad, especially the fine print. Some sellers knowingly sell DVD's formatted for foreign regions (intended for use Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt) to buyers in the U.S. When you ask to return them, they send you a two page e-mail telling you (in so many words) that you should have read the fine print and you need to ship it back as your cost, meaning you pay for shipping coming and going."},{"rating":"2","title":"101 Dalmations - Live Action","review":"Glenn Close is really a good sport in the role of Carella De Ville.

There are romantic elements in it, but it does not have the required happy ending of a romance. The story is also not finished in any sense of the meaning. It feels like half a book, so it is very very frustrating at the end. On page two the evil intelligence inside of the heroine is talking to her, on the last page that evil intelligence is still there inside her, and she is still pretty oblivious to it and nobody has done anything about it. I also found Brehan's actions to be really obnoxious, to the degree that I would have to classify her as Too Stupid To Live. Erth was an interesting character but I found it pretty hard to believe that he would love Brehan since she always behaved so badly to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"one dim bulb\\"","review":"Mickee Madden, \\"One Bright Star\\", Pinnacle, 1997. Should be titled one dim bulb. The story idea is great. The execution is dismal. Mickee only fully develops a single character, her heroine, the dual entity Brehan Tucker, who has a fiery spirit, a horrific past and impressive powers when under the influence of her co-being. She doesn't supply enough information for the reader to care about any of the other characters, except possibly Brehan's alien love god. The story jumps from one unconnected scene to another making it incredibly difficult for the reader to get involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it in the [garbage]","review":"I read this and found it so totally boring that I threw the book in the [garbage]..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an EXCELLENT book but I hate books with sequels!","review":"I read this book quite awhile ago not realizing that there was a sequel to it.

I'm really getting tired of waiting and it just reinforces my distaste of books with sequels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arming yourself against the work bullies","review":"Finding out the characteristics of a workplace bully is the first step in recognizing this particular form of abuse. Susan Futterman has written a well balanced book that incorporates the best of all you need - symptoms, guidelines and most of all - validity for what you may be suffering at the hands of the bully at work. Very well written and I highly recommend it for a person who is or has experienced bullying or is involved with a person who is going through bullying. If you are involved with a person who is being bullied - please support them. Its really hard to emphasize because of the toxic nature of the workplace bully. But the one being bullied needs support from friends and family. My recommendation for anyone being bullied - GET OUT as soon as you can!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"work is NOT life","review":"Many, maybe most people identify themselves by their profession or the company that they work for. Many times it is a happy, fulfilling part of their life, but if is isn't, there is a good chance someone at your workplace is making you miserable.If that person is your boss, who constantly undermines your work to the point you question your very self, and when works becomes a source of stress, causing physical ailments, this book will help you decide the path you need to take.Bullying is unfortunately very real in the workplace and, at least in the US, a legal (though unethical) way to manage employees. I strongly suggest this book to anyone who is physically ill at the thought of going to their place of employment every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great instructional book","review":"This book provides great technics on how to not only deal with bullies at the job but also how to have peace of mind everyday at the job site.

Hard to believe it lasted that long but I take good care of my things. It's been used constantly to blow dry my hair straight and brushes thru all knots and does not leave my hair static. My teenage daughter started using it and because of double the use, the bristle part detached from the base which was glued in very securely. I just ordered this new one and have to say I love it just as much as my original one. I was afraid it would've been made cheaper or that the bristles weren't going to be the same. But, I was wrong. It is still quality-made and I am so happy I didn't have to search endlessly and settle for something close to it. This brand makes quality brushes as I have several different sizes.

They were by far the most enjoyable classes I have ever taken. His book reads much like his Reformation lectures, his humor and enthusiasm for the subject enhances the experience and makes it easy for one to understand the material. Professor Sunshine gives one an insight into the lives of such influential people like Luther and Calvin and how they shaped the Reformation.I highly reccomend this book for anyone with an interest in history or for one who is intersted in understanding the Christian Church and the problems that continue to plague it to this day.If you ever take his class, ask about the \\"Lasagna\\" story, its awesome ;p"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the Apple among the Oranges.","review":"This book is one of, if not the most, disappointing books in the Armchair series. Many reviewers have looked past a very basic problem with this book and is actually glaring and misleads readers, namely, it is not a theological text, but a historical one. One cannot doubt Sunshine's wonderful and easily-read presentation of Reformation history, but the series is about theology and because Sunshine has focused so much on the history, we get no information on Arminus, the synod of Dort, or the Arminian confessions of 1621. This is disturbing, as Arminus has influenced too much of the historical and theological landscape to leave his thought out of a book on the Reformation.In the end, I cannot recommend this book because it does not fulfill the requirement of the series, namely to introduce readers PRIMARILY to Reformation theology. HOWEVER, if Westminster John Knox starts a series entitled: Armchair Historians, I will give the book more stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all compatible with sony product.","review":"Never ever buy this.

Never buy a telescope based solely on claims like \\"420x!\\". The highest magnification this telescope can realistically provide under the best of viewing conditions is about 50-60x per inch of aperture, or 120-140 power in this case. Light-gathering ability is by far the most important consideration when purchasing a telescope. A much better choice for a first scope would be a 4-inch dobsonian mounted reflecting telescope, available for just a few more dollars; you DO get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that good","review":"This scope is not really very good for viewing planets but is ok for the moon if you stick with the 20MM eyepiece, the 5MM, giving about 140X, is just to much for this mount as it vibrates very easily and is hard to hold anything in the FOV for very long! I think it would be better for a person to buy a 4.5 inch reflector with a Dobsian mount for just a few bucks more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This was what I chose for my 15 year prize from work.

I appreciate the compact, easy to handle size, and the clean design, yet wish for larger reproductions.(Which explains the 4-star rating.) I was delighted to see many watercolors for the first time. If you are disapointed by the lack of text, get Virginia Mecklenburgs' book on Hopper watercolors...it's as \\"easy\\" and wonderful to read as this book is to look at. I look forward to owning the companion, The Complete Paintings of Edward Hopper."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's nothing like seeing them all together","review":"This would be a 5 star book if the reproductions were just a bit larger, but it's a small complaint. If you like Hopper you will enjoy discovering works you've never seen before. If you're a painter too, you'll like the format: 1 page of introductory text and nothing but reproductions after that! Lots of people are familiar with Hopper's quote \\"All I ever wanted to paint was sunlight on the side of a house.\\" This is the book that makes you understand what he meant: his mostly on-sight watercolors have a sun drenched quality that his oils didn't catch as often, good as they are.

I cried as Owen's crib came down and laughed at the lessons of humility Casey teaches Marc over the corpse of a dead squirrel.

What an insight into what makes the French so... well, French.

I would strongly encourage anyone traveling to France or returning from a trip to read The Food of France. As a food writer from a day when writers told stories Mr. Root takes you into each of the regions of France provides you with tidbits of unknown and known history and the food that was shaped by it.

So soon we stopped making espresso, thus getting around the fact that a coffee mug won't fit under the espresso head. The coffee maker was mediochre.

To make matters worse, it's a heavy unit, and shipping it out for repairs won't be cheap, and on top of that, the manufacturer wants to be paid $12.00 to return it to me! I think I should get a bit more reliability for 250 bucks. I'm very disappointed in the lack of quality ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working after 1 Month","review":"I was initially pleased with this maker. However, it stopped making steam a month into its use. Of course, when you are over the magic 30 days after purchase, no such thing as a full refund.Major UNHAPPY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality -- Buy Anything Else","review":"We have had this machine for less than one year. The only use it gets is every morning we brew one pot of regular coffee and make one cappucino. Unfortunately, the machine is very flimsy. The regular coffee half falls apart at least once a week. Also, the coffee continues to rapidly drip out even when the carafe is removed. Plus, it doesn't make a full pot of coffee because much of the water goes into the air as a huge cloud of steam. The espresso half has stopped producing steam to froth milk. All-in-all, this machine is poorly made. We would not buy this machine again."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 months at home - 4 months in shop","review":"I agree with all the reviews to date. Machine makes excellent espresso and a decent cup of drip coffee.Quality is suspect. Instructions are poorly done - good indication of Briel's quality control process.Had the machine about 2 months when it stopped pumping. Sent to repair facility in NJ at a cost of ($$$) (in addition to ($$$) return fee). Numerous calls to service dept fell on deaf ears. No one could tell me what was wrong or when the machine would be returned. Finally after 4 months, machine arrived at my door. Machine worked well for about 2 weeks, then died. Frustrated - I demanded a refund for the maching including shipping. I would not recommend Briel to anyone ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well-- for a minute","review":"I bought one. It is sitting in my attic because I have a lame hope of resurrecting it. The plastic lid/coffee basket failed within months. It stopped making espresso shortly thereafter. I now have an expensive bulky coffeemaker that is difficult and cumbersome to use. I am telling you, this is CRAP. You will be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I spent some time looking at reviews for combo coffee/espresso machines, and this one got the best reviews. But the negative comments I read were 'spot-on'. There are some basic design flaws that just don't make any sense:- Adding water to the coffee maker is tough because the top only opens to a certain point. You can't use the coffee pot to measure and add water as you would with most coffee makers because you can't pour all of the water out of the pot. Its hard to explain, but a major design flaw.- The area below the express maker is too high for an express cup and too low for a standard express pot. Still haven't found something that fits properly.- The steaming element is very short and it is impossible to remove your espresso without hitting this very hot element.- The espresso is never very hot.This is not my first machine and I'm disappointed. Still looking for a great coffee/espresso combo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Coffee/Espresso, but HORRIBLE service!","review":"The machine makes good coffee and espresso, but you had better hope that it never needs servicing. Currently, my machine has been at the repair facility in Newark, NJ for eight weeks. Every time, I call (almost daily) either the computer is \\"down\\" or the person I need to talk with is not in that day. I have yet to talk with anyone who knows anything about the where my machine is and when it will be finished. I have never received such poor service. EVEN THOUGH THE MACHINE MAKES GOOD EXPRESSO AND COFFEE, I WOULD STRONLY SUGGEST BUYING A DIFFERENT BRAND MACHINE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this machine...","review":"After reading multiple bad reviews, I thought, well... I love the slick look, and those terrible things won't happen to me.Oh it will and did. One year and 3 days later. I have a $400 dollar average coffee maker.The pump mechanism is exceptionally, scares the cat, noisy. The espresso and foaming features of this machine are no longer working. I'd say I got about 20 cups of decent espresso from it this year. At $20 a cup, I think I'll go to a coffee house. (I could be a hero and treat my friends everytime at that cost). Additionally, the foaming feature is really poor, I could probably make better bubbles with a plastic straw and microwaved milk.Unfortunately, while company is a big name in Europe, I live in the States. So parts and repair shops are very few and far between. The near impossible to find support line is 1-800-763-6699.

The author introduces methods that combine Excel's interactive elements with graphical functions. Particularly one example about dynamically creating charts was an enormous help. In addition it is shown how to create 3D and even 4D Matrizes by bringing together advanced layout possibilities and Excels mathematical power.Another topic that this book covers is the use of Excel as a planning tool. Patrick Blattner shows how Excel can be used to create GANTT charts that usually can only be created with Software like MS Project.Needless to say that every example mentioned in the book is on CD-Rom as well. 5 Stars for a book that is definitely worth it's money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing yogurt bar.","review":"It is so good for you.

The book starts and ends grimly, but there is no other hope for Saffie, as we learn of her past. I was entranced by the beauty of the middle part of the book, and it made a mark on me. There is a fresh perspective on the holocaust, as seen through a child's innocent eye, and there is an epic love affair that is forbidden. I thought the writing was excellent at times, but was taken aback somewhat when the author had personal \\"asides\\" to the reader. The Mark of the Angel was riveting and I would be interested in following this author in her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a slow and depressing read","review":"Ughhh.

I kept waiting for the main chararcter, Saffie, to find happiness or atleast some contentment with her life. When she finally did find it I felt she was so dishonest and living such a lie that I could not be happy. Then to top it all of she teaches her son to live a dishonest life and that does not even touch on the ending, how tragic! It ended abruptly and with such heartbreak that I still feel down and I finished early today.

If you are a not a pure mathematician but would like to learn more about linear algebra because of its potential applications, then this would not be the right book for you.
