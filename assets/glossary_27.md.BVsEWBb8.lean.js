I guess that's what the title promises. Anyway, its very interesting to those who are curious in astrology, fortune telling, and so on.

An earlier review is apparently written by a reader who assumes that anyone who has a differing background is inferior -- this is exactly the mindset that is counter-productive when working among diverse cultures.

At 59 years old I prefer a walking workout over the dance type. I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone and got this for a change of pace. It is not as intense as some of her tapes, but it keeps you moving and targets the lower body more than most of hers do. Like many of Leslie's videos the background is dark and many of the exercisers are in dark clothing so it can be hard to see the moves. However the moves are easy enough you can manage to keep going despite this.I enjoy this and am glad I purchased it. I would recommend it if you are older or a beginning to intermediate exerciser. Not enough challenge if you are already fairly fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've heard great things about this video, so I got it wanting to like it. I was quite disappointed. Fitness instructor Petra Kolber teaches and leads alongside George Foreman, who makes the odd comment while they and a class of participants do the workout. The music is loud (too jarring for me) and Petra isn't my favourite instructor, she's very rah rah and hyper. Maybe because I found all that annoying, I couldn't bring myself to finish the workout, but I was also bored. I've done other simple marching/walking type workouts with basic easy to follow moves which I much preferred, for example \\"Kathie Lee's Feel Fit & Fabulous\\" - you don't have to be a Kathie Lee fan for that one (I'm not) but the instructor C.B. Yelverton is wonderful and I love the routine. Sorry George, I love your grill but this workout is going to be donated to Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheery and do-able","review":"Nice!!!George is cheery, warm and motivating; Petra explains the moves well; the camera work is good and actually focused on the body parts you need to see in order to imitate the moves.You don't need extra equipment. You don't need a lot of space, or even a mat.They show two levels: basic and intermediate. You can really work your leg muscles in this one if you want to. But you don't HAVE to - you can keep it at a lower level if you prefer.The music is more rappy (rappish?) than I prefer, but not intolerable even to this classical music lover.I'm no health nut yet somehow, George Foreman manages to make this fun!

Buy this one for the sheer historical significance. A must have for any collector of Cuban music. The tracks collected here are classic and feature some of Celia's best compositions. Celia Cruz, one of the queens of Cuban music is featured here as a young singer. Also the world renowned Sonora Mantancera, and its male singers, is the back up band for an extra bonus adding to the historical significance and authenticity of these early recordings. Judging by the picture of Celia and the boys in the band I would guess these recordings are from the 50's, maybe 60's at the latest. A forever youthful Celia is featured on the cover and her voice is more youthful as well, not as deep but just great nonetheless.The only let down is that there are no liner notes so you just have to enjoy the music for what it is, timeless and forever young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond description","review":"This is the crash course in understanding the fundamentals of the necessity of change as seen through the eyes of the author, Christopher Locke. Everything you previously thought was lore is turned on its head in riotous fashion in The Bombast Transcripts. Each chapter takes apart some standard you thought was a given, an immutable and constant attribute of practically every aspect of life in the western world.The best part is that Chris does it in so many different ways in one book. There's flat out ranting and there's cutting ridicule including interviews with himself, Rupert Murdoch and the famous one with Mr Ed. (Yes, the horse.)Using those cliched critic's terms of rollercoaster ride or rollicking good yarn don't do this volume any justice whatsoever. In fact, this book defies any label you might care to ascribe.In fact, I defy anyone to come up with a label for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for general crafts perhaps OK for papermakers.","review":"This title was included in a Carol Duval show recently and sounded like a good purchase for general craft use. It wasn't. First, it's over a decade old and hasn't been updated. So many things have changed since this was written that much of what they say is now irrelevant particularly in the technology area. Second, it's written by an English couple which means those of us in the States have to convert many examples as we go. There are a large number of black and white sample designs at the back of the book which could be useful to some. Also for those involved in papermaking and decorating paper it has some useful information.

Yep, it's that bad.This is what happens when you hand $35 million to some loser with no talent or training.

Its a classic example of how not to do a movie - no focus on the story and play up the special effects. The special effects were good, but seemed to soak up so much of the budget that the sets and costumes looked like they were straight off of Zena. The movie tried to do too many things - be sort of a fun, medieval knight movie like First Knight, a little bit of Star Wars, a little bit of Willow, and a little bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I swore scenes were taken from all of these movies and thrown together to create Dungeons and Dragons. There were also too many characters which didn't add to the story - they simply detracted from the main focus of the battle. Lines are also misdelivered where lines that should make you cry or cheer end up making you laugh because they sound so pitiful. I love movies and its not often I find one that I dislike so much...this movie was my dungeon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as everyone says it is","review":"Of course fans of the game will hate it just because they left so many things out but non-fans(like myself)will like it.I rented this DVD expecting the movie to be horrible but to my suprise it wasn't.However Thornda Birch and Jeremy Irons didn't act well(which is wierd seeing as how Birch is in American Beauty and Irons in Die Hard with a Vengence).Its really a good movie which reminds me of a fantasy-like Star Wars.But hey what do I know I thought Blair Witch 2 and Battlefield Earth were great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competition for Battlefield Earth","review":"This movie is competing with Battlefield Earth for being the worst movie ever made. First of all, did the concept designers ever even play D&D, or had they only heard about it? I personally found this to be more the plot you'd expect in a cheap fantasy novel than a well laid out D&D game.Aside from the general plot, I swear the dialog was written by a 2 year old. Rather than spend a few $ on a decent screenwriter they chose to have an annoyingly large number of badly-animated fly arounds of the stupid castle. This movie makes for some great MST3K roleplaying on your part, however.Finally, the acting. I recall Jeremy Irons no actually being that bad of an actor. After a long painful experience of watching this I finally concluded that the director, Courtney Solomon, is probably just clueless or had a BAD BAD 6 months. Either way, this movie was an experiment in the heat capacity of american dollars, and should probably be avoided, and rented for MST3K purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Dragons","review":"This film had alot of dragons, but was seriously lacking in dungeons.

It is obvious that the effects have been cut to make the film cheaper. You can see at most 3 or 4 spells casted. And the effects are very typical. The dragons are just fire ball throwing big birds. And the wizards (even eith higher levels than 7) can only cast fire ball like catapults. The story is weakly represented and the scenes are very inrelevant to each other, just like the movie Charlie's Angels. The jokes and conversations are very very typical and you know what they will say before you hear it. In conclusion, even I (I am a real fantasy fan) got bored watching this film. So STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awwww, this could of been a lot better!!!","review":"I'm a big fan of medival movies and monster flicks, but this one fell short. Why? Because the graphics weren't that good, the acting was very lousey and the characters weren't believable. The good things about this movie were that they had some good ideas that looked good and it was sort of fun watching what was going on. I really could bash this movie and say how this sucked or how they could of done this better , but I'm not.

Really this is a disgrace to anyone that plays D&D. I only say that because the one movie based on D&D is so incredibly retarded that it only furthers peoples beliefs on how retarded and nerdy people must be to play D&D. I could have wrote a better storyline at age 4 even if I could not direct it as well at that age. I don't think I've seen movies with worse acting except on the spanish channels and at least theirs are funny bad and not annoying bad.

I can say that the movie by itself is really not that bad and I'd easily say that its not the worst B-Grade fantasy film ever made. However as a DnD movie it blows. I'll never understand the need of filmakers to make a film based on something with a strong fan base and then change everything that the fans love about the subject. I can fully understand the need to change some things. This is a movie and unlike some purists I understand it is a different medium and sometimes things just have to be different. However this film bore almost NO resemblance to DnD. Fortunately when the sequel (Wrath of the Dragon God) was made this was fixed.Basically a good movie just not a good dnd movie. If you can get over that fact go ahead and watch it for the somewhat ok B fantasy movie that it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dung-eons & Drag-ons","review":"I wish there were 0 stars for this movie.Let me think if there's anything positive to say about this movie:- Plot .......

I was aware of the 80's D and D game, and was eager to see what had been done to it on the big screen.Boy howdy, I sure am glad that it was rented, because paying for movie tickets would have been a huge rip-off! it started out okay, and I could tell it wasn't going to be a great movie. But not everything can be great, and lots of stuff that's so-so or okay can still be very enjoyable.Not this. The writing and story were awful. Some of the lines were terrible, and the villain and his accomplice... ugh! The ending was really bad and cliched as well. I can't think of a single character I remotely liked.

Boring, boring, boring... I wanted to like it, but it wasn't really gelling with my concept of what a D&D; film would be like. Heck, the old D&D; cartoon was better than this, and not as goofy.I've always felt that it was some sort of rush job, because the LOTR films were being made at that time and someone wanted to beat Peter Jackson to the goal line by releasing a mainstream fantasy film.

Look, people, I wasn't expecting much when I settled into my seat to see a movie based on a role-playing game popular among pre-teens, but this sort of thing can, and often does, have a certain air-headed charm. But this flick is just painful--lame dialogue, undistinguished acting, and one of those connect-the-dots storylines that just plod on and on. Kids deserve better than movies like this. Come to think of it, so do I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the nerds will hate it","review":"This is close to the worst movie ever.

Jeremy Irons as the villian seems embarassed as he should be. They decided to let him keep his regular hair so he looks like a business man from Wall Street. The main character doesn't seem to have a \\"class\\" as is normal in D&D. He is sort of of a warrior, rogue, or something else. It's an embarassment. Actually if the title was \\"Evil Red Dragons\\" or something I could have taken it better but for the actual D&D name to be attached to a bomb like this is quite irritating. With the name brand they had they could have launched a film franchise instead of slapping it on a throw away piece of trash like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don''t waste your time","review":"There are just so many ways this movie stinks. Bought it for my kids who had not seen it in the theater. They hated it and so did I. If you feel you have to see it, rent it!

This is the main problem with filmmakers that love so much other movies and grew up believing heavily on those movies that then in their movies they make the same thing, ok they like the movie, maybe one or two scenes with some diferences, but nope. Dungeons and Dragons takes whole action sequences from other movies, mostly the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies. A terrible script, cheap effects, bad directing, the acting. The only good parts where these two, Thora Birch looking a bit like Queen-Amidala and Jeremy Irons providing comedy in the way he gave his lines. The rest shouldn't even go to acting school because that will be a waste of time. Well this movie is terrible but the thing that makes me feel the worse is that this movie that resulted a Box Office failure is getting a royal DVD treatment, a treatment which many of our favorite movies aren't receiving, you know which they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic and Heroes","review":"Ok, I'll be the first to admit that this wasn't the most brilliant or well done movie, but it was *fun*. The humour was good, the action scenes were decent (especially the dragons fighting at the end), and the story really didn't drag on. If some parts came off as cheesy, well...who cares? I grew up on the 80's fantasy movies, and let me tell you, with the rare exceptions of \\"The NeverEnding Story\\" and \\"Willow\\", all of those movies were pretty cheesy themselves. For example, I don't watch \\"Krull\\" because of the special effects, or for the brilliant storyline and acting (sarcasm), I watch it because its a fantasy movie, pure and simple.

As a big fan of the D&D game (I grew up playing it for years) I had high hopes for the movie. A budget of 35 Million dollars at the time was quite a lot of money, and Jeremy Irons is one of my favorite actors (for Irons at his best, try the original Brideshead Revisited miniseries). It gives me no pleasure to pan the film, or Irons' performance in it, but there is just no other way... they just were both *terrible*. With cheezy special effects, ridiculous dialogue and acting that is scary bad, you wind up with one big mess. My favorite line from Irons as Profion was \\"I'm looking for my stone... I want my stone!\\" You can imagine with dialogue like *that,* the actors did not have a chance. Avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBELIAVABLE AMMOUNT OF DAMAGE !!!!","review":"This movie is nothing more than an almost unbeliavable ammount of damage made to the reputation of Role Playing Game. But it not comes as as surpise to me all, since I found out that Marlon Wayans would be \\"starring\\" it...Hou, in the name of Earth, could Jeremey Irons accept to work in this turkey? This is not only one of the worst epic movies ever, it is one of the worst movies, period !! Made without care, the costumes are a joke, well, I'm out of word. Since I'm an AD&D player, I really felt outraged after watching this piece of sh...!

The acting was really terrible, especially coming from people who won oscars. The script doesn't make any sense. I also have never seen such terrible special effects!

They totally kick this movie's arse and THAT is a fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can we possibly still make movies so bad?????","review":"This movie did not live up to even my lowest expectations. The characters were lifeless, the plot lost my interest immediately, the computer graphics were so terrible and obviously fake that it ruined any scene where they were used, and the acting was HORRIBLE (Oh my God, I mean horrible doesn't even begin to describe it). Even Jeremy Irons overdid it with the soap opera drama that teetered on the comedic. The movie centerpiece \\"rod\\" looked like a toy picked up at at a local K-Mart complete with a flashing light (and probably even pulsating sound too). I am so mortified that I came so close to buying it without renting it first. The only redeeming qualities were the costumes, the score, and the reason behind why it was made.... to capture the fantastic worlds created by the game Dungeons and Dragons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned","review":"This was without a doubt the worst attempt at making a film I have ever in my life witnessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a critic for the movie, not the DVD","review":"Ok, let me begin (by the way, sorry for my english, Im latin guy): the movie is BAD. I don't care about special effects or rule violations, I don't mind if the evil guy is pathetic (incredible, how you can make of a good actor a pathetic character), but, for the sake of god, the very basics of ANY Dungeons & Dragons story is TEAM WORK!!!. And here you have a group of people that just follow Ridley (the hero) and don't do NOTHING. I mean NOTHING!!! The principal idea of the movie was not bad, but the sequence doesn't have any sense... The Izmar Queen is a bad copy of the Neverending History movie, Profion laght like a maniac ALL THE MOVIE... And, the final sword battle between Damodar and Ridley is so false... and is a copy of Starwars. I think that must exist more or less 25.356 D&D DM worlwide with a better story to tell. I give 2 stars and not 1 because some scenes were fun...Sorry guys, another deception for the D&D fans..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could someone make a movie so terribly retched?","review":"I was highly mortified by the extremely horrifying display on my television set.

While I was watching it I was thinking this movie's extremely bad, at least that funny black guys in it though. Then half way threw the movie funny black guy died, as did my thoughts of the movie being just extremely bad, it was more like terribly retched."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?!!","review":"I used to play D&D when I was younger. I loved it. I dreamed of the day that they would make a D&D film. Imagine my disappointment when this load of garbage came out. I was stunned. Why would they make such an obviously rotten, stupid film like this? Why? They had so much material with which to work.Just look back at all the incredible scenarios that the makers of D&D put out over the years. Utterly brilliant stuff. So why didn't they just adapt one or more of these scenarios? Why? They totally blew a great opportunity. This film could have been as good if not better than \\"Lord of the Rings\\" if they had the right storyline.I weep for D&D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrrrible","review":"Having played Dungeons and Dragons for 20 years, I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

What's really missing in this party of retards, which brings shame to the entire D&D franchise, is a high-level cleric that could have ended this unbelievably bad \\"work of art\\" with a \\"Slay living\\" spell 5 minutes into the movie.$$ 35 million for this piece of crap? What a waste. If it's true that sequels are planned, I hope the producers take a look at the reviews on this page and don't go [throwing] away more \\"hard-earned\\" money.But you guys in the US were lucky: The german-dubbed version was even more pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible bad","review":"Not good.

They know they're bad, so they just busy themselves with making an interesting plot or maybe just some campy acting.D&D thinks it's good. It's overacted, poorly plotted, looks terrible and just doesn't have a single redeeming scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally, the worst movie Ive ever seen..","review":"I am a long time D&D fan, and I would have to say that this is quite possibly, the worst movie ever made. Total garbage acting and a cast that doesnt even come close to fitting in. A good title would of been \\"Boyz in the Dungeon\\", with Marlan Wayans flapping his stupid mouth the whole time. The only emotion I felt during the whole movie was Happiness, and that happened in 2 places, when Marlan Wayans dies and when the movie ended.. its just a shame they both didnt happen ALOT sooner!."},{"rating":"1","title":"D&D didn't deserve this","review":"The movie is disappointing in all aspects. For those out there who follow the D&D universe this movie is a total let-down. I would even say that the only thing in common between AD&D and this movie is its title. The way I see it it's not worth renting, let alone purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential, however lacked A LOT in many areas.","review":"Before I saw it in theatres I was very excited, however when the movie ended, I was miffed at how cheesy the whole movie was.It started out good: Good guys doing the ultimate theft in the Magic School, being caught by the chick. Then it went downhill from there. If Jeremey Irons was the badguy, how come we didn't see very much of him? What was the deal with the heroes sword? And the ending was the worst of all. The heroes main sidekick (I forget his name because this movie was soo aweful) did he die? Was he resurected? Or like Tupac, abducted? You tell me, I never figured it out.This movie had potential to be an excellent movie that could have outdone Lord of the Rings however like Star Wars, the director focused mainly on the special effects which was the only good thing about the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, well.......","review":"There is nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said.Yes it was a disgrace, yet I've seen worse.It had promise yet left me wanting.I could guess what was going happen most of the time. Also most of the acting was alittle to much, as if they were trying to cover up something,yet that only made it all the more abovious.I have never played or read D&D, but this movie did have good parts(sorta).Just not many.Also Am I the only one that noticed we don't see what happens in the scroll.It's driving me nuts.And ofcourse when they come back out the look at eachother as if they'd made out or something.You can see it if you want, for it isn't to bad, but also not the greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAYBE IT WILL BE CULT SOMEDAY....","review":"I'm not a RPG player. I'm judging this movie only because I'm a fan of epic, medieval and adventure movies, like LADYHAWE and BRAVEHEART, for example. So, I went to see this movie with the highest expectations, since I knew it was going to be based on the most famous RPG of them all. Guys, what a dissapointment, what a shock!! Third-rate acting, lousy costumes, cheap special effects. Sometimes, you even succumb to the temptation that this is a fun movie, so bad it is. One that will probably go \\"cult\\" with the passing of time. On the other hand, you simply think that this is another throwaway product made by Hollywood, aiming coldly at the innocent viewers who will pay for tickets to see an adptation from their beloved game. This is not fair game, gentlemen. As for Marlon Wayans, forget about him..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good, but bits are worth seeing","review":"While abysmal scripting, and bland direction make this a low grade \\"Evil Overlord\\" flick that lamely tries to copy better examples of the genre (like Star Wars and Flash Gordon,) the film has enough good points to merit a view. Those include some really nifty fantasy costume & production designs, pretty animated effects, good fight choreography, a decent musical score, and a wonderful comedy/drama turn by Bruce Payne (in blue lipstick?) as the Evil Overlord's chief minion, Damodar. The DVD version has LOTS of amusing extras, and it's clearer, letterboxed image helps to make the film's chief attraction, its visuals, shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a movie?","review":"I could've sworn I was watching an hour or so of out-takes or audition tapes. Well, if this is a movie, IT'S TERRIBLE! Do NOT soil your expensive Hi-Fi TV's with this big pile of Marlon Wayans infected ...! The acting is downright atrocious....even Jeremy Irons gets a sigh of disgust from me. The special effects were FAR from believable, equivalent to a cut out from a cereal box being slid across the screen! The plot was a bore, everything was predictable....with traces from everyother movie in the fantasy genre.......including cheesy ripoffs from Star Wars...don't believe me? Watch it, at your own risk! Personally, I'd rather watch Wing Commander (Yuck!) 6 times back to back than watch this pathetic attempt to profit from the big screen using a popular name.Do what I did...endure to the end of the movie and start taking names of who's responsible for this waste of time.....action should be taken!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Battlefield Earth\\" of fantasy flicks","review":"\\"Hey, let's spend all the money on 2nd rate sfx\\" - \\"cool\\" \\"Uh, what about actors\\" \\"Hmm.

Use 'em over and over.\\"That's how I envision the production meeting. This movie was actually painful to watch. The soundtrack was the WORST I have ever heard. It was - literally - the same 2,4, or 6 notes played over. And over. And over. And over again. God. It was the first time I wished the DVD had a \\"no music\\" option!!! Thankfully the *mute* button was at hand.The acting. What acting? These were acting school dropouts. Make that actor wanna-bees that were expelled. Plot? \\"Who needs it\\" - that's what the producers thought. It was eye candy, and sour eye candy at that.Bottom line. It was the WORST fantasy movie I have ever seen. If there were negative stars, it would get all -5.Save your money. Get a dental cleaning - it's less painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"a total crapfest","review":"This film was disapointing on so many levels, the major flaw would have to be the poor acting, which was below par for a daily soap, to add to this shame seasoned actors like jeremy irons acted the worst delivering over dramatic lines that come off sappy. The only positive light I can put this film in is that of a mindless summer action movie, of course with it being D&D and all this, too is sad. Speaking of D&D, did the people that made this movie look at a rulebook ? I think not, blatant problems like a young apprentice mage being able to do high level spells and a main character that changes classes atleast 3 times during the movie must have been overlooked.Basically: if you want a dumb fantasy themed movie, see D&D its *ok*, if you like D&D avoid this movie like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wost Moive Ever.","review":"Yes I am a geek who has played the D&D game for over 20 years.This movie was just stupid. The plot was lame, the villians lacking, and the characters were horrible. Why did all the action center around the main character? In a D&D game, all the players contribute to the success of the adventure. Over the years there have been great stories and novels, why come up with a movie that adds up to a young teens adventure! The dragons weren't dragons as D&D goes, they were dumb beasts. And what's up with the warrior wearing the pink lipstick? And what the heck was stuffed into his head? The writers shouldn't be allowed to write again, ever! The director shouldn't be allowed back onto any set again! And as far as movies go the acting was bad, the story was horrible, and all I would like would be the hour and half of my life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disliked this title","review":"I did not like this movie one bit. Actors are unconvincing, the storyline is extremely banal, bad costumes [you can tell they're made for a movie, not a single ounce of realism]. It wasn't worth the $5 I spent on it. There is loads of better fantasy movies out there, you're probably better of not wasting your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"D&D not what the hardcore gamers were expecting","review":"D&D in mind was going to be a movie about the world of D&D and the many monsters, wizards and gods that formed this vast world that those who played the game would know about. Instaed they used very little of those elements from D&D to create this movie. The moive itself has some redeeming value by the fact that Doctor Who veteran Tom Baker makes a cameo as an ancient elf who heals the main hero. The DvD itself has delted secens which in my mind would have made the movie stronger if they had decided to keep those scens in. Perhaps if they do a sequal (but judging from the poor box office numbers) they may want to try and keep this movie history out of it and try again. All in all this was a farily good movie and I wait on buying it until the dvd drops in price a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a waist of money and I only rented it!","review":"Horrible!

When I saw it myself I loved it but the person I went along with hated it, its a 50/50.Basically its about a group of characters, that come together not unlike in any role playing game/event. They have a quest to complete and along the way get in to problems to overcome.Basically every role playing game combined and made into a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily one of the worst movies ever made","review":"If you watch the outtakes included in the DVD, at one point you can visibly see Jeremy Irons look completely disgusted with himself for agreeing to sign on to this film. That just about says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie and not true to the game at all. Clerics?","review":"This movie is just horrible. Suffice it to say that the movie is a waste of time. I just wanted to point out the lack of any clerics in the movie. Even healing was done by some old elf using 'natural elven magic'. Also note the reference to \\"God\\" and \\"praying\\" (in most D&D campaigns a player would have to specify which god and hope they picked the right one). It seems like the studios were uptight about the polytheistic aspect of D&D, and eliminated one of the core player classes. Ya right. Lets just hope they dont to to Lord of the Rings what they did to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why oh Why!!?!!??!","review":"As a child i was a huge fan of the D&D cartoon series it simply rocked! It was different and had enough fantasy creatures to make your head spin so when i heard they were making a movie i couldnt wait! I went to the cinema and my hopes were simply shattered this is a awful awful and one more time for the hard core fans AWFUL movie! What were they thinking they must have payed a small fortune to use the logo and name of such a populaur name as D&D and then they kill it!

My favorite part of the movie was when Snails died. Was I really supposed to have had feelings for that character other than simply being irritated? He was like the annoying person that sits next to you on a four-hour plane ride. Also, did anyone else think it was strange that the dwarf was as tall as everyone else? I actually also took the time to listen to the director's commentary on the DVD. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the director as he talked about the next two movies in his amazing Dungeons & Dragons trilogy he has planned. I can't believe New Line funded ONE of these. Let alone three of them! That guy is retarded. I suggest you buy this DVD for someone as a gag gift for Christmas. However, I must warn you that buying this DVD, even as a joke, will only encourage more movies like this one to be made, so be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Effects- BAD, Story- NOT ALL THAT GREAT...","review":"You know, it's one thing to have movie that has bad special effects, and it's even worse when the story isn't all that great either. A lot of talent went to waste, excluding Marlon Waynes, and so did the director's career. The only thing that actually wants you to keep watching it, is the acting. Otherwise, dont waste your money on a cheap movie like this.Warning: the movie falls into the \\"B\\" movie category..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Movie","review":"I would think with the name and hype of this movie they could have casted better actors or got a better director. Profion, an evil mage, seeks the power to control all of the dragons to take the kingdom od Izmer from the Empress Savina. The kingdom's fate falls into the hands of two peasants. With this movie I think too much money was spent on developing the special effects and not enough time on the script writing. This movie didn't seem to have much substance to it. There was a comical quirk here and there and then mass special effects and that was about all. Maybe we should just keep Dungeons and Dragons a roleplaying game for good.

If they had actually stopped and DEVELOPED any of these cliques they could have breathed some life into this thing. You know what? I've had more fun READING THE REVIEWS that watching D&D. Trouble is, you have to make your save vs BAD MOVIE before you'll really enjoy taking potshots at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"agree with most other reviews","review":"Boy I have to agree with the other reviews. This was pretty much a rip off of Star Wars (right down the the battle scene between IRons(aka Darth Varder) and the princess and other guy(aka Luke)) as well as many other movies. The acting was terrible. Can JEremy IRons overact any more???? At least he could overact, the other ones couldn't act at all. The Wayans kid was probably more annoying then Jar Jar Binks. Many other movies were better including Dragonslayer and Never Ending Story which this movie borrows from and of course Star Wars.

This movie is shameful. I work alongside Dave Arneson and it saddens me to see his highly imaginative creation (which I enjoyed in my youth) reduced to a predictable and formulaic plot, hammy acting (Courtney Solomon's fault), and dialogue filled with one cliche after another. Some of the worst scenes take place in the Thieves' Guild where the Star Wars cantina scene and Raiders of the Lost Ark are blatantly ripped off.The computer graphics, costuming, and set design are all very well done. Unfortunately the movie is lit like a cheap television show (the supposedly dingy Thieves' Guild has brighter lighting than some of the art studios I've seen).I felt robbed. Hollywood profiteers took something that could have easily been really cool and ruined it. Just as with Hollow Man it has once again been proven that all the eye-candy in the world can't save a [bad] story."},{"rating":"1","title":"To bad you can't give 0 stars","review":"This film looked promising from some of the material I read before hand. However the reality was very different, I found the plot incredibly weak and with attendacy to miss out large sections. The casting and acting was poor with me actually wanting Thora Birch to die.

Trouble is too many folks expect too much and think that it should follow along with their specs, their ideas or even their charactors. The movie was a fictional story losely based on the role playing game d&d. Plain and simple. I know, I listen to people like the ones I'm referring to every weekend in my dinning room for hours on end for years.

For the rest of us, the movie is simply terrible. Not even Jeremy Irons, such a wonderful dynamic actor, portrayed a decent role in this film. This should have been a straight to video release. The story line is boring and the FX are merely so-so. Thank goodness I only spent $3.50 to see this movie because any more would have really enraged me. Finally, Wayans role in this film is merely ok as the comic relief. He fits in this movie like Dolly Parton's breasts do in a trainer bra. If you must see it, wait for it on video or DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"really, really bad.","review":"I rented this movie out of curiosity. I stuck it in my PS2, and watched the DVD. I laughed all the way through about how bad the movie is. The acting is very, very bad. I also noticed about halfway through the movie that the sort of \\"evil\\" theme sounded a lot like the imperial march (for those who don't know, that's basically the empire's theme in Star Wars). Just out of curiosity, I hummed the imperial march when the music started in the movie. The imperial march goes at the same speed, about the same key, and the beginning starts off in almost the exact same way. If you want to, rent this movie, but DO NOT BUY IT.

But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I enjoyed it because it reminded me of the cheesier, more HORRID games of D&D I've played over the years and the fun we had butchering them - if you ever want to SERIOUSLY annoy a DM, any time he intones, \\"By the Duke's Decree\\" or says anything with \\"duke\\" in the sentence, start humming the \\"Duke of Earl\\" song under your breath. D&D:TM is the sort of movie you'd shuffle off to Mystery Theater 3000 as quickly as possible so you could have fun listening to the characters there skewer it. It raises popcorn-hurling to new heights of artistry. It makes \\"The Barbarian Brothers\\" look INTELLIGENT by comparison. You'd send the kids to watch it at a dollar matinee because there's precious little T&A in it and they're not going to grow up to be ax murderers or parking lot valets because of it.

It only gets one star from me because my girlfriend insisted we get it, and this howling error on her part gives me carte blanche rental choices for about the next decade.Bad dialogue, clumsily edited, atrocious acting, inconsistent motivations, no character development, colossal non-sequiturs, baffling ending and lead characters with all the pizazz of pork luncheon meat.Fantastic relief though when Marlon Wayan's \\"Snails\\" is bumped off by the slaphead with the blue-lipstick - ah yes, Snails the thief - as much use as a glass hammer.Don't believe the reviewers who claim that the extra scenes \\"explain everything\\" - they just add to the horror.It was just fantastically bad - don't buy it - for pity's sake - save your money.

And there are some talented actors in it. Jeremy Irons will regret this film for the rest of his life, I suspect.In the light of Lord of the Rings, which has raised the bar so high that nothing else compares, this film looks even stupider now than it did last December. Thank God that New Line had the Oscar-worthy LotR waiting in the wings with which to redeem itself.Give it a miss, unless you want a really good laugh, in which case go and rent it at Blockbuster and save some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasha's Uncontrolable Hideous Laughter?","review":"This film was sooooo bad, it was almost inadvertantly funny but then it wasn't. By the end, my friends and I sat slackjawed, wondering if this horrific train wreck of a film was ever going to reach any sort of end. I'm sure there are many more \\"fanboy\\" jokes about how Courtney Solomon (the director) used his powers to cast sleep, feeblemind, etc. on his audience. Dear God, why? I am still baffled as to how Thora Birch, Jeremy Irons, anyone in the cast could have woken up,read this script, and thought \\"You know, this will really help my career.\\" Really, even the CGI looked embarrassed to be there."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a joke right?","review":"This was almost as bad as those nerdy guys out in the park acting out scenes from the game in their cheaply made costumes.

Every movie has some redeeming value but in this I could find none. Seriously... and I am a BIG fan of fantasy and D&D. I have been playing the game for over 12 years, which is why it saddens me all the more to see such a horrible rendition of a game I love so much. Now don't get me wrong, I am very open minded and I am not like a D&D version of a Trekker. I didn't look for nor care to see accuracies in the movie adaptation of the game. I just wanted to see a good fantasy adventure movie... The acting was bad, the directing was bad, the editing was bad, the story was illogical and generic, and EVEN the special effects were bad. Yes, the one thing you usually can count on in a movie these days, good SFX. But no... Even the LIGHTING was bad in this movie. Sometimes you just had a hard time getting a good glimpse of things... Now this just means that I will NEVER see a good D&D movie in my life..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the effects save it...","review":"When considering whether to buy this, buy it only for the special effects. I am a long time D&D player, RPG fan, etc., and I am usually entertained by movies in general. but this was a terrible attempt to force the RPG style into a movie... the result was a movie that had all the elements but lacked depth and a story. Go watch Willow instead, now thats a real fantasy movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man , this is terrible.","review":"I didn't have high expections of this but man , it was worse than I thought it would be...much worse.

This movie isn't worth a free rental at Blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could only have that 2 hours of my life back.","review":"This is such an awful movie I can scarcely even consider writing about it. The incredible overacting by Jeremy Irons made me cringe, and Bruce Payne's performance is just pathetic and even incomprehensible at times... ugh.And what's with the effects where the camera zooms up and down the huge towers? I almost puked the 3rd time they did that...Awful, just plain awful, and I wouldn't even recommend it for a turkey shoot (you know, where you and your friends get together to watch a bad movie and rip it apart for fun?)... not ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dungeons and Dragon DVD","review":"I bought this DVD as a gift.

The worst part about this is that I do play Dungeons & Dragons and have seen most of the attempts at making D&D movies. I had hoped there would be something good about this new one but I'm prepared to believe it is the worst yet. The acting was completely juvinile (\\"THE SKIES WILL RAIN WITH BLOOD HAHAHA!!\\"). The script was like something that had been written in the span of two days (\\"You're a low level mage...\\"). And the whole concept was as frail as a skyscraper built with matchsticks. All I can say is, don't waste your cash, heck, don't even watch it if someone else rents it. You probably have much more meaningful things to do with two hours of your life.

The special effects although not ground breaking may be the only reason to watch, and only those parts. The acting, story, filming all explain why this movie was out in theaters for maybe half a day. I would be very hard pressed to compare this movie to any other that I have ever seen, I do not think anyone else has seen fit to publish anything this bad. What were the producers thinking....maybe tax credit? DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE, wait till it comes out on TV that way you can change the channel.

Poor Jeremy Irons!","review":"You don't know how disappointed I and my fellow D&D gamers were when we went to see this movie. :P My main problem was with the props. The armor and weapons looked like plastic throughout the entire thing! Sure, there were spectacular effects, but they were all but forgotten in the light of the acting and those heinous props! The maze-type scene kept my interest for about a minute, but it was just.. awful.

This movie struck me as cheaply made and the acting was not good. The props/gems in the movie looked like plastic. I was embaressed to drag my friends to see this in the theatre. Compare this to Conan The Barbarian which was probably the best fantasy movie ever made even though it was in the '80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, pretty bad","review":"Maybe my age is beginning to show, but I just finished watching this movie about an hour ago, and it was pretty bad. Poor dialogue, too many characters with nothing to do, except to give token representation of non-humans, and non-interesting fight scences. Granted, the FX are really good, and watching that many dragons flying around is a wonder, but those are far and few between to compensate for the rest of the movie. My sister watched this when it first came out, and she's not a fan of fantasy at all, but she thought it was \\"okay\\". With that in mind, I was expecting a little more- but except for the literal dungeons and dragons in the movie, there was a minimal amount of D&D in the movie itself.>o'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cheezball ...You Will Ever See On The Big Screen","review":"As terrible as it is, I'm astonished that this film was ever released in theaters. The visual effects and Thora Birch... are about the only reasons to watch this film, and the fx aren't even anything special.I wish that Wizards Of The Coast would have demanded more creative input into this film and written a screenplay that at least contained accurate elements of the game. I would love to have seen a movie set in the Forgotten Realms, or especially the DRAGONLANCE characters brought to life. The story was the weakest component of this movie, even if you can forgive the bad acting and 4th grade level humor.New Line should not have wasted the Platinum Collection treatment like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I owned this microwave for a year and a half and it worked great up until went up in flames, literally!A microwave should last longer then a year and a half.My next one will not be a Sharp brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try it at home!","review":"I got mine yesterday delivered from Amazon in 24 hours!

Utilizes both literary and form criticism to provide a commentary that is both historical AND theological. von Rad treats Genesis as one vast cohesive unit in the far larger Old Testament sitness.

It suggests a push, pull, legs/abs split along with cardio. I haven't found a more convenient split. BUT, don't think this split will work wonders and make you gain muscle and better than any other because it won't.I did the lean body promise to a tee for 2 years, and frankly it doesn't work much if any better than just working out any old way.Frankly, the big wonderful eating many times a day everyone pretends is a god's gift to bodybuilding hasn't helped me one bit.

I kept getting some sort of registry error, and each time I got the error I was told to reboot my machine (which is only 2 months old). However, when I was finally able to get the software to work (which wasn't long because it kept crashing), I discovered that the accuracy stinks. There is NO way this software is \\"over 99% accurate\\" as it advertised. I have a limited edition version of OmniPage 7.0 that came with another scanner that is more accurate than this software. And, don't think that what I was scanning was complicated. It was black and white, plain vanilla text on clean paper. Don't make the same mistake I did in buying this software. You'll regret it. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this software","review":"This software is majorly messed up. When it works it does what it says, but it's a major pain to get it to work.

Second, There's a major glitch in the software and I don't think the company is able to resolve it. I have been communicating with them for months with no solution. Third, everytime you contact/email customer support, you get a different person handling your problem (it is not like your file/problem is assigned to one person).

They aren't a blues band any more than other rock-blues types are: Rolling Stones, ZZ Top etc. They are a rock band that borrows sounds and riffs from the blues but never really falls over the fence as a blues band.The album is good from top to bottom and if you've enjoyed the sounds of the White Stripes De Stijl album or the Detroit Cobras then the Soledad Brothers will likely have a sound that appeals to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful white-boy blues","review":"OUCH! This record is painful to listen to. What the world really needs now is another bunch of young white boys wanting to get down and bluesy. The singer's voice is awful - his attempts to howl the blues would make a dog laugh. \\"Prodigal Stones Blues\\" is aptly titled as it's basically a very limp re-write of the Rolling Stones \\"Soul Survivor\\". The most pathetic thing about this tepid band is how serious they take themselves (see their liner notes) as barers of the blues torch. Fellas, you make Johnny Lang look like Howlin Wolf.This band has received a bit of attention due to their White Stripes/Detroit connection - I'm sure they would've gone completely unnoticed otherwise. It would be a very, very sad thing if even one young garage rock fan out there buys this album before buying something by Mississippi Fred McDowell, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf, Hound Dog Taylor, Jimmy Reed, The Rolling Stones...Christ, they should buy almost anything before buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is a must to anyone interested in loudspeaker design.

The sections that most people would find interesting or need information on such as transmission lines were left to a 2 paragraph chapter. He stated that no one uses transmission lines therefore he will not get into it. I guess he never heard of Bose, MB Quart, etc.. He did go into great detail on an accoustic lever that I have never heard of in 18 years of doing audio professionally let alone be able to find any parts to build such a device.

My main issue is that the opening is very small while the bag is fairly long. Combined with it's stiff material, it's hard to pack bigger items into it. Would be nicer if it was wider and shorter.

Michael did a wonderful job on all the music! The way he pounds they keys on the piano during I believe in you know is great! I also love the song Love Me Good! All the songs are really toching especially Song For Rich and Hello Goodbye for sweet little Noah who was taken home to be with GOD and such a tender age!I highly recomend this CD to ALL MWS lovers as well as ALL those that love Christian music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Clockwork, Only Not","review":"If you liked MWS's earlier stuff, it's still him. He's still amazing, and still intense as a blast furnace without going overboard. However, there are some surprises here; it's just a little different. The sound is more current, but there are still the javelins: songs that aim so precisely at YOU and come on so fast from nowhere that it's on your MP3 list for a year. Michael amazes me, as he always has since 1983."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up!","review":"This album really showcases Michael's lyrical, instrumental, and vocal abilities well, and it is very uplifting! \\"Missing Person\\" is a soul-searching song I think we all can identify with, and my favourite on this CD. I like all of the songs on here, but other highlights are \\"Never Been Unloved\\" (the sweet and simple truth we all need to hear!), \\"I Know Your Name\\" (another reminder of God's loving care), and \\"Song for Rich\\" (for all you Scottish/Irish pipes fans out there!) The only drawback on this CD is that God's name is only mentioned a couple of times, and two of the songs are love songs (\\"A Matter of Time\\" and \\"In My Arms Again\\"), though those tracks are beautiful. Also, \\"Let Me Show You the Way\\" is one of my absolute favourites, and it is about friendship, but can be taken in another way. If you don't mind \\"Christian love songs\\" and so forth, though, you are guaranteed to enjoy this album! Soothing and inspiring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An album you must buy!","review":"This shure is one of the best albums of the year, on christian music. Michael W. Smith is full of tallent, and the lyrics are so full of truth. The song \\"Live the Life\\" sounds like an hymn, a song that gives us the desire to live for Jesus for real. But my favorite song is \\"I know your name\\". That song still makes me thing... God knows my name!!! And no one cannot be touched by the last song, \\"Hello, Goodbye\\"... If you like music that makes you think, and consider christian life, you have to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good & Mature, but very much overhyped.","review":"Favourite tracks include 1, 3, 4, 9, 10 Needed a bit more synth driven dance/pop tunes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio DJ Approves!","review":"This is the best album Michael has ever released. We constantly get requests for stuff off of this CD! This album is upbeat and uplifting to Jesus Christ. Our teens even enjoy the album! The release is well worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest CD ever made by any CCM artist!!!!!","review":"This CD is Smitty's greatest and CCM's greatest.

Decent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!WONDERFUL!","review":"iF there was another Michael W. Smith Collection CD every song on the Live The Life CD would be on it. Superb! His best ever! I am highly anticipating his new release' This Is Your Time' If it is even Half as good as the Live The Life CD it will be great! This is the CD to get! The Live The Life CD is better than the Rich MUllins 'Songs' CD. The most you could ever want in a CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing! Very over-hyped.","review":"Smitty said, \\"This may be the best stuff that I've done.\\" Come on Smith. This isn't the best you've done. What about Change the World? I like the acoustic sound on this album, but there are so many cliches on this album that it makes me want to put on something else. I like Missing Person, but Love me Good is to put it bluntly, dumb. Is that a song to worship God with? Are you ashamed to say \\"Jesus\\" and Saviour instead of \\"the man upstairs\\" or \\"the powers that be.\\" Come on, I belive you are a Christian, but have you sold out to the almighty dollar? And \\"In My Arms Again\\" has a nice melody, but once again many cliches. I'll just listen to my older recordings and wait for your next effort. My favorite was \\"Hello, goodbye.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Severly disappointed","review":"This was definitely Michael W. Smith's worst album. I was disappointed by the cheeziness in his lyrics. He seemed like he was trying to hurry the release of the album and it lacked thoughtfulness. The music was so full of cliches that I wouldn't even purchase it if you enjoy creative music, but if you want something that doesn't spark any imagination and sounds like everyone else, I would suggest this album. If you like thoughtful and creative music, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I loved his last album, but I could not even get through this one.

I wanted to rate this cd to 5 stars, because i like all the songs!I would really recommand this artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous!","review":"I first heard this CD while my family and I were in Florida visiting our relatives. My cousin was playing it on his CD player, and it immediately attracted my attention. We flew home, and I wanted to buy it so much. Finally, I did and it has not left our CD player! Every song is amazing and MWS's voice is positively wonderful. I've never really listened to his music until recently. And now, he's definitely a favorite. My favorite songs are \\"Missing Person,\\" \\"I Believe In You Know,\\" and \\"Don't Give Up.\\" It's hard to decide, though, because they're all so great! I'd really recommend this album to anyone who is looking for up-beat, sensational music. It's very obvious why this CD received Album of the Year at the Dove Awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the music, but miss spiritual lyrics!","review":"I have been a MWS fan since he put out his first album, and love both his harmony, voice and general compositions. What I find a little sad is that he, like many Christian singers, end up going over to \\"regular\\" popular music. So, musically I LOVE this album, but I DO MISS more depth in his lyrics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is really cool! It has every thing!","review":"This CD is co cool because it does have everything! It has upbeat God centered music and some wonderful love songs! I think it is perfect for those who like upbeat stuff but are also romantics at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits the High Note With This One","review":"I've been listening to Michael W. Smith since '83. This album clearly demonstrates how far he's come as an artist. The music is rich, textured, seamless and very well performed. The lyrics of the songs are compelling without being contrived or manipulative. These songs illustrate a maturity that was only hinted at in Smith's earlier work, particularly clearly in the cuts \\"Missing Person,\\" and \\"Live the Life.\\" All in all, a very well crafted album that you will find yourself playing again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excelent, energy-full cd, for all people","review":"This production is one of the best from this artist. He mixes various styles to get through almost everybody who enjoys christian music. Listening to this CD can satisfy even the thoughest of listeners as he takes you through a wonderful, and delightful journey in your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of Smitty's better efforts","review":"I love this album! The opener \\"Missing Person\\" is the best opening for a Michael W. Smith album I've ever heard (with the possible exception of \\"Sonata in D Major\\" from the album PROJECT, but that was less than a minute and completely instrumental, so I don't think that counts). But the best song on here is \\"Never Been Unloved\\", penned by Wayne Kirkpatrick. It's a gentle and simple ballad that reminds us (sometimes very explicitly) of just how much God loves us and how unlovely we are.LIVE THE LIFE is not like THE BIG PICTURE or any of Smitty's other \\"edgier\\" sounding albums. With the exceptions of \\"Missing Person\\", \\"Love Me Good\\" (the only cheesy song on the album), and \\"Don't Give Up\\", it's all very mellow music. Sometimes, it gets so soft it almost loses the listener. But it's nice to have a break from the harsh RNR sounds every once in a while, and this CD provides an excellent alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely different","review":"I have been a fan of MWS since Project and I must say this is a nice blend of Christian songs with, dear I say it?, mainstream. What is so bad about this? I don't think that EVERY song on a Chrisitan album should be just about God. Shouldn't we be able to listen to music that isn't 100% sex or violence? I love the tune Song For Rich. So what if it sounds, as one person put it, like every other Celtic tune. This, I feel, is a heartfelt tune in memory of his friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"LISTEN UP AMAZON.COM SURFERS!!!","review":"This album is totally fantastic. I love it. Some may say that it doesn't have Christian enough lyrics; if you want amazing lyrics, go buy dc Talk or Newsboys' \\"Take Me To Your Leader\\" or \\"Going Public\\"...Musically it is constantly astonishing, and it is obvious the producer is very skilled and MWS had a large budget for making this. The songs sound polished and expert. Bottom line: If you like CCM, buy it! If not, buy it anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY DOES EVERBODY THROW DIRT ON THIS CD????????????????????","review":"THIS CD IS A GOOD CHRISTIAN CD.I UNDERSTAND EVERBODY HAS THIER OPINION,BUT ITS NOT NICE TO SAY BAD THINGS {LIKE HE ISN'T A CHRISTIAN} ABOUT A CHRISTIAN.About And be not conformed...,I bet almost anything more people have been saved thru Contemporary music,than thru Southern Gospel and anything else.And some of it is probally more worshipfull.Is it just me,or can anybody else not stand choirers?Live The Life is {in my opinon} the best Christian CD for anybody who is saved.To and be not conformed...,I mean no offefense,I love you brother,and understand you have your convictions as do I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live the Life is heaven to the ear!","review":"Live the Life is without a doubt a must-have for anyone looking for pop-flavored tunes with Christian messages. The lyrics are poignant and the melodies fresh and catchy. You will be singing along in no time flat! Like other successful singers with limited vocal skills (such as Tim McGraw), Michael Smith does not overreach in his efforts. He can handle what he sings and it's difficult to imagine anyone else singing these songs as well as he does! This collection of songs is both exciting and inspiring! It doesn't get any better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"okay so maybe i didn't listen to it...","review":"I'm acully reveiwing this CD because if anyone out there went to DC/LA '97 is reading this will remember that \\"Live the Life\\" was the theme song. Which was a great choice and encourages every Christian out there to live a life that Christ would have. And if you are reading this wondering what DC/LA '97 was, ask your youth pastor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs out of plot.","review":"In the future (that looks like hundreds of years ago), the humans live in fear of the cyborgs who need their blood to survive.The first hour or so, it's a somewhat entertaining grade b adventure movie with below average actors (except Kris Kristofferson), stupid screenplay and cheap effects. After that it runs out of plot and the rest of the movie is long, boring, fighting scenes. The, suddenly it ends before the story is solved, giving a feeling that it's a pilot for a TV-series that was never made.This movie made me laugh a couple of times, mostly at scenes that probably weren't supposed to be funny, and you can see it without getting too bored, except for at the end. But it's absolutely not a good movie. Stupid screenplay and bad direction, and Kathy Long is pretty bad as the heroine. I wonder what made big actors like Kris Kristofferson and Lance Henriksen choose to be in this movie. Watch it only if it's on TV. Don't pay to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"jmic","review":"This film seemed to me to be a prequel to some shoot-em-up video game with Kathy Long as a computerized heroine. Can't imagine why such a fine actor as Lance Henriksen would participate. I was exhausted watching him lug the costume around.

The Panda Bar's main ingredients are Molassess and Wheat flour - you won't find any high fructose corn syrup in there! I consider other brands like Twizzlers to taste waxy and hard whereas these Panda bars have a nice chewy texture. I love having a box around so I can make sure the diaper bag is stocked with these ready to eat snacks.

I spent many a night in such an environment dancing to this song which for me still is one of the greatest \\"New wave\\" songs of the eighties. But not only \\"A Day\\" (together with \\"7th time\\" defenitely the most danceable) is great. Other songs like \\"Stranger\\" or \\"Stumble and Fall\\" were ideal to accompany me through many a candle-lit night were I dwelt in self-pitty or \\"depression\\". Ten years later I still can get back to the feelings I had in those days listening and dancing to Xymox. That can only mean (Clan of) Xymox has to be a great album....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy with heart and purpose","review":"A lot of people don't appreciate the message this movie brings, even if they appreciate it's humor. \\"Rude Awakening\\" came out when I was a toddler, and it has meant a lot to me watching it throughout my life. The speech \\"Fred Wook\\" (Eric Roberts) gives in the movie about our environment is very moving.Aside from it's wonderful message, this is an extremely entertaining movie! Cheech is funny as ever, and Eric Roberts is a hunk! Plus a slew of other comedians and a wonderful soundtrack accompany this movie.I highly reccomend it to anyone interested in our environment, 60s or 80s culture, or just a really good comedy. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only London map with street numbers?","review":"The draw for me to this particular map of London was the inclusion of street numbers, allowing first-time visitors (like myself) to have a better idea of where places were located given only their addresses. In response to the other reviewer, the font on the first Underground map (on the inside of the front cover) is okay, while the font on the second Underground map (on pages 2 and 3) is painfully small. On the other hand, the font on the regular steet maps isn't too bad. It might be useful to compare this street atlas to London A-Z, but the spiral spine of the Michelin guide, allowing you to tuck it into your coat or backpack pocket without losing your page, makes this product superior in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of the description and pictures!","review":"WOW- being a professional cabinetmaker for the pasts 30 years I have collected a lot of tools and machinery to help me in producing my cabinetry.

It plays with the notions of what constitute the romantic Western images, and twists them around with restraint but no apology. It is a fairly minimal, slow-paced movie, and this adds to its haunting and unusual effect.

I watched the entire 131 minutes in hopes that something would develop to match the acting talents of Eastwood, Hackman and Freeman, the last of whom in my opinion was mis-cast into a roll expressing no strength of character. Although, we were warned by the R-rating, I thought it went somewhat beyond that point by illustrating that real bravery and good shooting is gained by drinking excessively, and portraying prostitutes as perhaps having the best depth of character of anyone in the movie. One good thing about it was that it ultimately ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow!","review":"I saw this movie for the first time a few months ago and I'm very greatful I never rented it or went to it in the theater.

The characters never really go and do much, there is nothing done during this movie to keep you intersted. Once again the story takes for ever to get going and some characters are pointless.

So often Hollywood awards an actor late in his career, acknowledging past slights. So, you have John Wayne winning the Oscar for True Grit, when he should have won it years ago for other roles. And now you have Clint Eastwood winning awards for this movie...boring, dreary, and very dark. To see Clint at his best, check out The Outlaw Josey Wales, and save your money and time.

With Clint and Gene at the helm on this one, nobody can deny the quality film that this movie became. I am an avid fan of Clint's and many other amazing western films and this is up there in the top ten. People who gave this film less than 5 stars do not know what a good film is...and can go on complaining about quality films because their bad taste blinds their senses and minds to the truth that is the greatness \\"Unforgiven\\".

But this transfer of it has a horrible brown sheen to it that doesn't ruin the experience but definitely doesn't justify buying it on blu-ray. I'm pretty sure the DVD I watched of it originally looked better than this transfer.

The movie image however was in fair quality almost as if it was a pirated copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastwood's Disturbing Farewell to the Western","review":"In Clint Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven\\" (1992), there is no ethical code associated with the classic Western, no simple moral of good versus evil. It is an unromanticized depiction of the West in which every bullet - and every death - has meaning. \\"Unforgiven\\" is a culmination of the dark themes that director Eastwood has explored in \\"High Plains Drifter\\" (1973) and \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" (1976). He pays homage to the stark poetry of the Western while staking his own territory of uncompromised reality. The distortion of justice in \\"Unforgiven\\" is reminiscent of the tragic, wrongful hanging in director William Wellman's \\"The Ox-Bow Incident\\" (1943) - both films confront the horrible consequences of murder and how the killers must live with it. In his final Western, Eastwood shows that the genre can be given new life through provocative explorations of myth and legend, along with an intelligent script and sensitive direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated; undeserved Oscars.","review":"This is nothing but another Western. Anyone expecting some brilliance or originality to be in sync with its Oscar win as Best Pic of 1992 will be sorely disappointed. Starts out with a gratuitously violent slashing of a prostitute and goes downhill in unpleasantness from there. I think I can guess why the Hollywood left-libs loved this enough to make it best pic: it portrays the West (read \\"America\\") as unheroic and simply violent and evil. That's the sort of garbage that the creeps in Hollywood lap up like cats to a saucer of milk. Hey, celebrities!! If America sucks, kindly return all of that money you get from us for working a few weeks a year, will ya? My feelings won't be hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!","review":"I have no idea what the big deal with this movie is.

Clint Eastwood's performance of the grim, aging gunfighter is typically one dimensional. The subject matter -- taking revenge for a prostitute whose face was slashed -- is about as grim as it gets. The cinematography couldn't possibly be more dark and depressing. It's not a particularly bad movie, but certainly not a particularly good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I finally saw this highly touted film last night. Incredibly boring! Forget this and get High Plains Drifter. HPD has the same moral lesson as TU (Violent men may be temporarily needed to re-establish civilization when the cowardice of other men forfeited it), but it is a much more interesting and compelling film. BTW, why see Hackman's sherrif as corrupt. He is flawed to be sure, but his situation-specific violence has lead to establishment of a peaceful civilized community for women and families."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 Stars: Does not deserve the hype","review":"I have seen probably all of Eastwood's westerns and as several other reviewers have stated, this is at the bottom of Clint's barrel. First, this cowboy flick rides a very tired old poney - the theme stolen and copied from Shane by so many other westerns of former gunfighter retires to lead normal life, must unretire to take on evil character set on running the county. Second, the acting and the script are both flat and uninteresting. There have been too many lifetime achievement awards given out lately for artists of various sorts who deserved but never received honors in the past and whose recent work is mediocre at best. Unforgiven falls into that category. If you are looking for a great Eastwood western, check out the Outlaw Josey Wales, Fistful of Dollars or the more recent and much better Pale Rider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clint moralizes on violence???","review":"It's good to know that I'm not alone when I say this was slow, boring, and forgettable. There isn't anything here that hasn't been done before, and better-particularly by Clint himself. Over time, I think more people will see this as a lifetime achievement 'thing' for Clint and less as any great cinematic triumph, which it's not. Stick with 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'. Violent (don't forget Dirty Harry) movies are why Clint even exists in the public's mind. For him to use more violence to preach about violence is too little, too late-and hypocritical too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great image!","review":"Of course i've seen Unforgiven at the time it was launched. That's precisely why I bought it now.It's really a great film to see many times and better now with the new tecnology HD DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Western Ever Made","review":"Hands down, This is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece. A movie about violence and its repercussions, and the way it has an effect on those around it. This is a real thought provoking film and it really deserves the awards it won. Clint Eastwood is astounding, and Gene Hackman is nothing short of amazing. In their roles in this film noir western, and Morgan Freeman is great as well.Not too many movies can call themselves true classics but this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgiven","review":"Excellent western with Eastwood...he's really come a long way since the old spaghetti westerns...great camera/scene work...and couldn't beat your price."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie with no extras","review":"Absolutely one of the greatest westerns of all time! HOWEVER, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired. For instance, it's practically impossible to figure out how to get to the menu page and the box implies that there are two theatrical trailers which [I could not find]! Great movie but disappointing special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray does it right","review":"This movie is a classic, and I can confidently say that when I watched it on blu-ray for the first time, it was like really seeing the movie for the first time - like all the other times their had been a blur filter between me and the movie and now, viewing it on blu-ray, that blur filter had been removed.This should definately be a part of your collection, if for nothing else, just the quality of the video transfer demands it. Not to mention that it's an awesome movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for the movie, -1 for the transfer","review":"Another Eastwood masterpiece, as stated by others, but MPEG suffers in dark, rainy scenes (of which this film has several). Washed-out and grainy. I was hoping for some extras, like director's commentary, etc. but the story is easily worth the price of the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clint's Done Better","review":"Clint's done better. For example, \\"High Plains Drifter\\" was a far cry better. At least there was a hero in HPD; in \\"Unforgiven\\" this anti-hero stuff just leaves you kind of bummed out. I understand the movie's message but it just doesn't work for holding my interest. Gimme a good guy and let's just forget the depressing gray area. Believe it or not, there really are such things as distinguishable good and evil, unlike what this movie would have you believe.This movie is rather slow at times too.That they gave this movie best picture had more to do with throwing Clint a lifetime achievement bone--and the fact that it was up against weak competition that year--than it did any real merit of this movie.By the way, I would've given this movie 3 stars were it not for the groupthinked, ridiculously hyperbolic 5 starred reviews on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"unforgiven","review":"I found Unforgiven one of the most over rated movies in Hollywood history! I am well aware of all the oscars that it has recieved but that just shows, as usual, the politics and clout that Eastwood has with this organization. The direction and character development is typical Eastwood(cardboard) and this very long movie had several places that dragggged on into boredom. Sergio Leone and Don Segal did far BETTER with directing Eastwood in Westerns. I must point out that anyone I know who saw Unforgiven came away completely baffeled about what made this movie notable! It must be noted that I enjoy Eastwood, the actor, and think that he should stay in front of the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches by the zillions","review":"Unique. But a bar stool cowboy story that gets hopeless and stupid as the minutes pass. The plot is for the type whose lives haven't been what they expected and they take it out on others. Any fiction will do as an excuse. The plot is full of justice or so it appears. A collection of liars making up reasons to be cruel.A bit of comedy. Acting ok. Camera work good.

Again, Eastwood is given the perfect plot - a bad man turned good forced to return to his old ways for the want of money, the job, to kill two cattlemen who sliced up a prostitute's face. These old veterans, reluctantly, go back to their old ways after the girls of the cathouse put together a big enough \\"steak\\" to kill them. Again, the movie had too much talk and not enough action. The ending was an improvement, but by the time I got there I felt like I wasted my time. This movie did not merit the best picture Oscar Award. There are many other westerns that are far more deserving. If you liked: the Good the Bad and the Ugly, For a Few More Dollars, A Fist Full of Dollars, High Noon (Gary Cooper) or Stage Coach (John Wayne) do not watch this film unless you want to disappoint yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNforgivable!","review":"This is definitely the most boring western I've ever seen!

If you have insomnia, I guarantee this movie will help you get a good nights sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivable","review":"I fail to see why Clint Eastwood won an academy award for this picture because, IMO, \\"Unforgiven\\" is Eastwood's worst film. It's slow, dull, choppy, and unlike those great spaghetti western classics, this film lacks drama and action. If you liked \\"For A Few Dollars More\\" or \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\", chances are you aren't going to like \\"Unforgiven\\" because it's long on dialogue and short on action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh NO, not another HORRIBLE WESTERN","review":"Unforgiven is an appropriate title for this mess, only it's Eastwood who should be UNFORGIVEN for turning out such a ghastly production. Clint, you've done MUCH BETTER.(\\"Outlaw Josey Wales\\" for one) But either star in or direct, don't do both! Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman were the only saving graces here and to be blunt, Freeman did the better job. He reminded me somewhat of the character \\"Grave Digger\\" from \\"Glory\\" in that he didn't have the advantage of a great deal of \\"book learning\\" but he was WISER than most. The idea of a worn out gunfighter forced to return to his \\"trade\\" has been done plenty of times and it HAS worked, but I've said it before, I'll say it again, Hollywood can't make a decent Western anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"instant western classic","review":"The Unforgiven is an instant classic. The movie pays homage to the western genre but has added realism and intensity many classic westerns lack. The characters are richer and more complex than many westerns, and as I said has more realism and intensity, so you don't need to be a western fan to enjoy. Film is a dark story, so if you are looking for a feel-good cowboy, this is not the film for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sterling and True.","review":"This isn't just a movie, it's a premium study of human nature. \\"Unforgiven\\" is a tale straight from the borderlands between good and evil. The plot is interesting but in no way explains the film's allure. The acting is superb and this is particularly true in regards to Gene Hackman and Richard Harris. English Bob is not on the screen long but Harris puts in a tremendous, and very memorable, performance. Hackman's Little Bill is haunting and you'd honestly have to say that Eastwood is nearly as good as his depiction of William Munney is subtle and flawless. The ending blazes and Clint gets in a few top notch oneliners like, \\"Anyone who doesn't want to die can go out the back.\\" Ah, this film has been great every time I've seen it.Was this one the last of the great westerns? Yes \\"Unforgiven\\" certainly is wonderful, but hopefully it won't be one of the last of its kind.

Let's just say that any actor could've done Gene Hackman's part/character in \\"Unforgiven,\\" but only Jack could've done his Colonel character in \\"A Few Good Men\\" the way he did. Hackman didn't do anything special... I like Clint Eastwood and all, but I don't think this movie deserves all the praise it got at the Oscars and in reviews. I think everyone was either Western-starved, couldn't get enough of Clint Eastwood, or had this \\"clouded\\" viewpoint \\"just because\\" it was Clint. I can't take anything away from everybody else's opinions, however, I just had to state mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Anti-Western","review":"I have seen most of Eastwood's westerns dozens of times; I only watched this one once. It is a carefully crafted and very sophisticated movie, perhaps moreso than any other \\"western\\"; but that's it -- it is really not a western after the fashion I am accustomed to.As a product of the 1950's, I grew up with westerns in the cinema and on television, and believe that a good western should have several elements: a good plot, plenty of action, and a hero that triumphs in the end, leaving one with a good feeling. \\"Unforgiven\\" really has little action, and we all know there is no hero. As for the plot, it is certainly better than some, but the whole sordid tale is so dark and depressing that I could not bear to watch it again.I can see why the Academy liked Unforgiven, but for someone like me, your average Western movie buff, it left me very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best work of Clint's life?

Too bad the band's early LPs didn't get that kind of treatment and production. The group of the last 8 or 10 tracks, of disc 2, is from a 1978 show in LA; it's almost a full live album by itself. This same set is from the \\"Impeckable\\" era and includes 4 tracks from that LP (my personal favorite) - a nice treat since those songs were probably only performed that year. There are some rough spots here and there, kind of par for the course on old live material, but this is strong overall and should definitely appeal to Budgie fans everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice live retrospective","review":"Well chosen set of real live and \\"studio live\\" performances that pretty much span the band's career. There are some rough spots here and there - Burke's voice is rough in places & there is some typical sonic degradation - but that kind of goes with the territory when you're dealing with recording from the 70's. The mid-70's performances benefit greatly from the inclusion of a second gutairist, the band's breaks and jams are just terrific, at times. Budgie fans - you've got to hear the John Peel show version of \\"In the Grip of a Tyrefitter's Hand\\" (track 6) - it will blow you away and convert the unitiated, it's that good. If you, like myself, never had a chance to see the band, this will give you a good idea of what they were probably like live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not flush with wall","review":"One reviewer mentioned that the phone was not flush...but it really sticks out.

It would be a great desk phone, but does not mount on the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy sound quality, hard to dial","review":"I'm not happy with this phone. To begin with, the sound quality is awful, very tinny. And you can't lean the handset on your shoulder to talk, it slips down too easily (unlike my old one). I'm going to junk it and get a proper speakerphone. But the main problem is with the number buttons for dialing. Half the time they don't work, you have to push them really hard and from the center of the button to get it to register. It's a pain, I have had to repeatedly redial numbers because they don't enter properly.Also, the minute I plugged it in, it seemed to throw off my answering service which is provided from the carrier. Calls now don't show up properly so I don't know when I've gotten a message half the time.Get a more expensive, better-made phone. Everything like this seems to be made in China these days, and gets cheaper by the minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Use It As a Wall Phone","review":"First of all, I wanted a white phone. This phone is not white. It's like eggshell or linen. Secondly, I wanted a wall phone. It is constructed to be a wall phone as well as a desk phone, but don't believe you will ever be able to use it as a wall phone. I tried with all my might to mount the phone on the wall. The receiver will not stay on the hook, and the phone will move as you move, i.e., if you pick up the receiver and walk to the left, the phone on the wall will turn to the left. It might be a great eggshell, desk phone, but I cannot attest to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wall kitchen phone","review":"I bought this phone as a wall phone to be hung on a wall in the kitchen. I needed a corded phone because I had no electrical outlet for a cordless phone. Unfortunately, when you hang up the phone in its cradle, the slightest touch or motion will make it fall from its hanging position. This phone was made to be placed on a horizontal surface as the plastic lip to hold it in place when you hang up the phone vertically, was poorly constructed and does not hold. It was a poor choice for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"Very good corded phone. Easy to program. Phone book is retained even if the caller ID batteries die. Just what I was looking for, except that I didn't realize it's not a speaker phone when I purchased it. That's okay though, still a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I usually like Panasonic products but this phone has a screen that is difficult to read in average room light, it DOES NOT have a message light, just a tiny icon on the screen. It eats rechargable batteries which last less than 4 weeks. I put in regular batteries and it's over two months and working fine. The ringer is not pleasant to hear, kind of electronic sounding. I would investigate choices more next time. Do not recommend this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap looking -","review":"The receiver falls off easily and is hard to put back on.

It is for the bedroom, a hardly used phone. I have caller id and was looking for a corded phone with caller id and this is perfect. The only thing it doesn't have which I wish it did, the dials or called id screen do not light up at night. I've got to turn on the light to see who is calling. Other than that, this is a great phone; good quality for the price! I'm pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value phone","review":"Although it's not fancy, this phone is just what I needed. It looks great, works smoothly, has excellent sound quality, and has caller ID. The caller ID works with 3 AA batteries instead of a power plug; some may see this as an inconvenience, but I'm happy not to have one more cord and one more power block to plug in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't have bought if I could have seen a demo.","review":"The handset is really cheap. Feels like I'm holding a toy to my ear. All the phone's features are driven by a digital display (like digital watches have). Anyways, it's hard to read; I think my watch's display is bigger. Also there's no backlight so you can't read it in the dark.The biggest reason I bought this phone is because I switched to my phone company's voicemail system and had no way of knowing when someone left me a message. This phone does have an indicator on the display that you have a message. It's a little envelope icon that's about the size of a pencil led. Very easy to miss.To sum up, this phone serves the purpose but it's not what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor wall mount design","review":"The wall mounting design was an after thought. This phone will not mount flush against the wall. It actually protudes about 4 inches and only mounts on one of the two factory wall supports. If it is in a high traffic area such as near a kitchen doorway the reciever will fall off the cradle with the slightest touch. This thing is going back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic Corded Phone KX-Tsc11W","review":"I found it awkward. Tone entry for number calling is weak. Just sub-standard device. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone if you DO NOT want an answering machine!","review":"We have a 4-in-1 printer in our home that handles voice mail, etc. I did NOT want another answering system on a phone because sometimes that can just be a hassle when the phone rings of if there is an electrical outage and one stops and the other kicks in and it is not programmed. Major headache time!I wanted two inexpensive, super simple phones that had Caller ID and nothing else. Did not want a speakerphone as we do not need that either. I also did not want more than 1 line available or any extra features. Just a SIMPLE phone that worked.This Panasonic is EXACTLY what I was looking for and I tried several other brands/types before buying it.It has great instructions for setting up Caller ID, memory, clock/date, etc. SIMPLE!!I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for the same thing as I was.

The juxtaposition of Carroll's confined claustrophobic catholic world vs. the allure of the street and heroin isnt that shocking in the context of todays headlines.

Also, the message of Don't Use Drugs is clear and really will persuade viewers not to use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I can't believe a movie so full of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll can be so incredibly boring. Despite some fleeting moments of beautiful camera work and a good performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, this film has no redeeming qualities. DiCaprio is a pretty good actor but I was so sick of old Jim's whining. When I remembered that he lived to write about it, I watched the rest of the movie in fast-forward. I couldn't tolerate much more, but I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't miss anything. I didn't. If you want to see a truly entertaining movie about the horrors of heroin, skip The Basketball Diaries and check out Trainspotting. Now that's a good picture with junkies you can really feel for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gritty, realistic film with wonderful acting performances.","review":"\\"The Basketball Diaries\\" is a gritty, uncompromising look at a basically good guy's decent into heroin hell. The cast, headed by Leonardo DiCaprio, is superb; the screenplay doesn't pull any punches. Realistic, shocking, eye-opening, the film gives DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg the chance to display their true talents and really ACT -- these fellows do a terrific job because it all looks so REAL. What a great film with an ending I guarantee you won't expect -- connoisseurs of fine films and DiCaprio fans should check it out -- this is a real movie with a real script and real acting, and the characters and storyline aren't larger than life. They're real as life, and that's not something you see on TV every day. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic, intense, and frightfully scary..","review":"This movie was gripping from the start to finish. I loved how it opened- a bunch of kids who obviously have minds of their own- getting high off of some household cleaner or something, skipping school, ripping off hot dog carts.. and you think this all seems crazy but then ultimately all the hard core drug usage starts and while at first it may seem like nothing but a small enjoyable thing to do- it soon is a huge habit for Jim.Watching all the struggles Jim has to go through- loosing friends, trying to be clean & then failing, prostitution, begging for money, getting into physical fights.. - it is hard to watch and you physically can't believe that someone can go through so much and come out victorious in the end.Leonardo plays this role FANTASTICALLY. Especially the part when he is crying at the door begging for some money from his mother. The amount of passion he pours into this character is huge... for that reason alone- go see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Before Trainspotting their was The Basketball Diaries and a brilliant film it is too. This is a great production from Scott Kalvert.It is the harrowing story of how a young basketball hopeful named Jim Carrol, whos life is descending into a life of drugs and violence.In which the only thing that keeps him going is his diary which is later named The Basketball Diaries.The acting in this film is brilliant.An absoloutely brilliant film it has no flaws.Every aspect of this film is great.A true masterpeice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Favorite","review":"First movie I saw Mr. Leo D. perform in.Moved by his performance, could have been given an early academy award for this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It was a cold and bitter portrayal of someone who nearly loses their life to junk. It was disturbing, which is good. Leonardo played his role to a T. The only confusing thing with this movie is the fact that I don't know who the hell Jim Carroll is. I wouldn't know him if he walked up to me and slapped me in the face."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could be an after school movie","review":"If you want a movie to show that drugs are bad, this is it. Otherwise, it's just not that great a movie. Yes, Leo does a good job of portraying someone who just about throws his life away, but the movie just didn't draw me in. I realize it's a true story so there's not a lot you can do with it, but there wasn't a single character I cared about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good In Spite Of The Sleazy Overtones","review":"Stories about drug addicts are usually not my bag. See my review on Easy Ryder. However, the acting packed scenes and the fast paced nature of Basketball Diaries, make it an entertaining study. Leo DiCaprio is very compelling in his role as a basketball star turned junkie as you can really feel his traumas. Mark Walhberg plays a good foil for Leo as his thug partner. Bruno Kirby is his usual steady self as the basketball coach.Many of the scenes are not too pleasing with drug addicts rolling around looking for their next fix. In addition, the rampid theivery and misbehavior by Jim and his thug like friends is a bit overdone. Its a wonder how children with Catholic School upbringings turn out so misguided. However, Jim eventualy finds himself with poetry and eventually picks himself up. But not without hitting rock bottom first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, boring","review":"Please don't overrate this movie. It was so boring.

Please take into consideration next time you write another one of your outrageous, gruesome, awful, profianity books just like that. You know something, This book just is falling off of the charts. This book I think has a rating of negative 500! I read this book to my little five year old boy thinking that it was just a simple book on a diary of a boys basketball life.

Consequently, since seeing this, I haven't voluntarily watched another DiCaprio performance.It was a huge mistake by the director (or the screen writer) to NOT set this in the era in which Jim Carroll grew up. Or if it was meant to be, it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected..","review":"Oh Leo.. why would you take this role?? I guess I can justify it since it was his early days. I rented this movie on whim. I thought this movie was perhaps a fun look at life as a teenager.. boy was I ever wrong. It was not about diaries and there was very little basketball involved. I was hoping for an inspirational story about a boy who came out of a rough neighborhood, wins the state basketball tournament, gets the girl and receives a full scholarship to Harvard, while recording these life changing moments in his diary. However, none of those events happened.

Even children can listen to most of this CD without parents worrying about what their children are learning by listening. There are no swear words and he talks about what it takes to be happy (he doesn't mean drugs). He is really into his fans and it shows in his music. There is no other like it on the market. Any one who is tired of listening to groups who sound mass produced and are ready for music that says something needs to buy this CD right away.

The whole party hard vibe seems more like a shtick this time around (and maybe it has been all along) and it wears thin very quickly, especially the first time you hear \\"Long Live the Party\\". We even get to hear Andrew do a \\"touching\\" ballad called \\"Never Let Down\\", which sounds suspiciously like an 80's power ballad left off a Poison album, and the whole song just comes off as lame.

He's a true artist doing what he does best. Andrew W K treats fans like old friends. This guy deserves every good thing that can come to him. I bought both CDs and they are enjoying constant play at home and on the road. Is it even possible to be depressed after listening to this fun-loving hard-rocking music?

Although a bit different from \\"I Get Wet\\", \\"The Wolf\\" still remains true to Andrew W.K.'s fundimental stylistic trademarks. The only striking differences are that the new album sounds a bit more melodic than his previous efforts, that there is only one song with \\"party\\" in the title and that he slows it down a bit for power ballad type tunes such as \\"Never Let Down\\". The vocals still have the same boldness and power of his earlier works and the intrumental parts are magnificent with electric guitar and keyboard fanfares. (One of these is showcased in the introductory song \\"Victory Strikes Again\\".) As with the previous album, the lyrics remain true to Andrew's style as they are about life and its experiences. Songs such as \\"Tear it Up\\", \\"The Song\\", and \\"Your Rules\\" are anthems to the common teenager. \\"The Wolf\\" is a blast, and it proves that victory can strike again for Andrew W.K.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books That Drive Me Crazy","review":"This book was quite possibly the most unhelpful professional text I have ever read (and I have read a lot). The examples are cliched and overwrought; the suggestions are simplistic at best - ridiculous at worst. (For example: p. 118 Teacher: \\"What I'm try to say Mrs. Whittaker, and I'm not saying it very well, is that my job is to help you do your job better. I have it easy - I only deal with your child a few hours a week, but you have to live with him. I'm wondering what I can do to help you.\\") Who would really say such a thing to a parent? I can't imagine much that would offend and alienate a parent more than that!A colleague and I both ordered this book so that we might do a book study and work together to improve the behavior of a few students who are of concern to us. At our first book discussion we both realized this book did not meet our needs. I regret the time I spent reading this book as it could have been better spent on most anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This album is a must have for anyone who is a fan of Ana Gabriel or of this genre of music. Every single song is beautiful and some are downright haunting. Ana Gabriel just may be the best Mexican singer of our time. Though her voice is unconventional, those of us who know and love her work also love her voice. Her heart-wrenching delivery of each song invokes the listener's own feelings of love/heartache.

However, when the timer arrived, info on the timer states that for tungsten/incandescent use, it is only rated at 5 amps. This makes it a lot less useful. It is also a pain to program, the claim is you just set the area code and go. This is not true, you also have to set the day, month, year, and time. The batteries in the unit were nearly dead also and of course they are not standard size batteries. You are better off getting a cheaper, photocell digital timer for holiday lighting, there are some rated 10 amps tungsten/incandescent."},{"rating":"2","title":"timer","review":"I think the timer is excellent for the money ..there is only one thing I would like different and that is a better censor in it or whatever it is that turns this one on and off by using your zip code.

A programmer had to keep up with a lot of details that literally sucked the joy out of programming. C++ Builder relieves the programmer of the Windowing details and allows the programmer to focus on the project at hand. C++ Builder has put the joy back in C/C++ program development.

However, the CD's are very user-unfriendly. There is no way to tell where a particular story starts or ends. Most start in the middle of a disk with no audible chapter markers. If you import these into iTunes, you just get 7 chapters, broken up into about a dozen parts with great titles like 1a, 1b, ... 1m, 2a, 2b, ... etc. Not very informative or easy to use in a computer, car or player.Overall, I prefer the cassette tapes read by Paul Winfield. Better sound, better voice and a lot easier to use. It's actually easier to digitize from the cassettes than it is to import from the CD. That's not normally true, but in this case it is.Again, this are great stories and a good listen, but the product is poorly designed and hard to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The indispensable guide for the lymphoma patient","review":"It's been just a month since my non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis became official, and two months since I've been aware of the strong possibility. Since then I've been engaged in a thorough search for information on the disease, and this is by far the most helpful book I've found. It was recommended to me by a good friend, who's also a lymphoma survivor - with about a year's more experience in traveling this road than I have. Written by a neurobiologist who contracted NHL herself, this book's got a powerful, one-two punch of personal testimony and very detailed medical information. Parts of it get a bit technical at times, but they're easily skipped over or saved for another day. (Better to have too much information than too little, I always say.)If you've got lymphoma, or if you love someone who has, get this book. It will become your handbook on understanding the disease, and dealing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not the Lymphoma patient, but.....","review":"This book was the best source of information for both my husband and I as we go through treatment.

Unfortunately the author was, in parts, writing to professionals who already know as much if not more of the disease than she does. This is not a book to read, but a reference - a good one - for what to expect at certain stages of the disease and how it may be handled.

A true account would describe a mediocre cyclist who couldn't win a race without cheating. So he made it his life's work to be a cheater, liar and fraud. More like a gangster than a competitor, he bullied, attacked and sued anyone who dared speak the truth. He organized a drug ring within the U.S. team, so that his teammates would be as fraudulent as himself, and he would be able to keep them in constant fear of being exposed. There is no winning behavior in this story. It is a sad and vile tale of pathological liar corrupted by greed and evil. This is not about surviving cancer, it is about being a cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middling fiction","review":"As a biography, this book is clearly a total fraud.

Lance Armstrong cheated his way to 7 Tour wins and used his money, power, and fame to bully anyone who dared speak the truth about his drug use. I can get over the cheating and lying in a sport where most riders did the same. But the bullying is another issue. The bullying of former best friends, trusted colleagues, and others who literally gave their all to put Lance on the podium is despicable. This shows his true character and anyone in the press who continues to support him should take a good long look in the mirror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathological Liar","review":"Now in January 2013, Lance Armstrong has been backed into a corner and has finally confessed to using drugs and doping in all seven of his Tour de France wins and has admitted that he is a bully and liar.

Can we believe Armstrong's version of his struggle with cancer or is it filled with exaggerations and fabrications?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember your Mom!","review":"Great book, but he also really pays tribute to how importantit is to have a special mom to stand behind you and fight for you, Especially when your too tired or ill to do things your self--good job Lance's mom (also a hero!).Lots of all around inspiration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling . . .","review":"Quite good. The compelling part of the book is to hear Lance tell how he overcame advanced-stage prostate cancer, with treatments that fully debilitated him. Only then did he come back to win the Tour de France for the first time! (And the only time in this book.) He is frank about the rougher sides of his personality, but does go beyond his illness to learn how to be a better person. You are cheering for him all the way. Although written with a ghost writer, it is his voice that comes through loudly and clearly. The book ends with him quite in love with his wife and first child, projecting a family life into the future. Sadly, as we know, it was not to be, nor did he stick it out with Sheryl Crow who had yet to appear in his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there a Grand Scheme?","review":"This book is raw, candid, and often moved me to tears. I knew Lance in name only before the book. I admire his honesty in this book.Lance (and his wife) experienced seemingly more Miracles in the shortest amount of time than most people experience in a lifetime. He is blessed to have had so many people (including his wife) who \\"put it on the line\\" for him, yet I can't help but wonder if he truly appreciates it.Lance is a \\"take charge\\" kind of guy and we get to see that at its depth as he takes us through his cycling and cancer challenges. Both of which, in his case, are extremely amazing feats. When that much is demanded of you, or demanded of yourself, is something lost? Lance Armstrong seems torn throughout the book about his role in his life.Never discount a Miracle or Who it came from."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really Isn't about the Bike!","review":"I never finished this one.

I had surgery the next day, and having no idea what to expect, bought this book. Before the Oprah confessional, I read this book hoping to gain some insight.By the second chapter, I determined it isn't about the bike. Rather, this book is about a super ego. This narcissistic autobiography must have made Lance feel better, but it does little more than stoke his own ego.He isn't a good guy. It comes through in his book- we did not need Oprah to bring this into the light of day. He does that on his own.The book title must be truncated: \\"It isn't about the the bike, it's about me!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Even though he lies through the entie book about his drug use the story of what he went through with cancer and how he trained is amazing.

I'm not a cycling enthusiast, in fact I never followed the Tour de France prior to reading this book, but I now follow it just to cheer on Lance.

I read your book in one sitting then went out and bought copies for my chidren and their children. Whether you ride bicycles or not, this book is an honest look at life through the eyes of a young man who has everything to live for and decided nothing, not even a life-threatening disease could keep him from his goals. He gives a lot of credit to his Mother, wife, friends and teammates. He never takes credit for having done it alone. Besides being inspirational, it was a facinating look into the world of bike racing, a subject I knew little about. Now I'm looking forward to being in Austin next year to watch the Ride of the Roses. Maybe I can't ride a bike anymore, but I'd love to be able to watch those who can and to help fund the Lance Armstrong Foundation. Put me on your mailing list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just read it!","review":"Not one for reading biographies, I read this book in two days. It has all the elements of a great story.....rags to riches....overcoming adversity....love interest, and a wonderfully happy ending that continues on as Lance recently won his second tour. A great story of survival about one of the greatest athletes of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"LANCE SURVIVED AND CONQUERED AGAINST GREAT ODDS. EXCELLANT!","review":"Before reading this book I didn't know who Lance Armstrong was, except by name. Lance very candidly tells the story of his struggles with testicular and brain cancer. He is a man of true respect and honor. His writing is simple, compelling, and motivating. By one Doctor's estimate, Lance had less than a 3% chance in surving cancer, yet he did just that. His personal battles and in depth writing about his testicular cancer is informative and much needed. Lance is a true champion. It is apparent more through the words he speaks/writes, than the races he has won. I would recommend this to anyone and I feel very fortunate to have greater insight into truly a remarkable man and American. The challenge now to me, and the other readers, is to live our lives with as much passion as Lance Armstrong. Read this book! God Bless him and his family. It would be an honor to count someone such as he, a friend.RK Powers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior biographacal elements.","review":"Great book. Of course, I am a huge fan of Bicycle Road Racing, and Lance in general, so I am hugely biased. It is an excellent book, and well written. Even the non-cyclist can appreciate the story. It is tremendously uplifting and positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage, Willpower, Determination","review":"I couldn't put this book down after I started reading it. I applaud Lance's mother for the courage she displayed from the beginning. I can see why Lance had the ability to overcome the cancer, because his mother raised him to be a winner. For a 17 year old girl to become the mom to a champion doesn't just happen! Mom's a stud! I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to believe in miracles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for bike fans","review":"Speaking as the parent of a young man fighting cancer, this book is a powerful weapon that Lance has given those who face cancer. He does not sugercoat the rigors of treatment, nor recovery. He tells how he overcame the same obstacles facing every cancer survivor. His words shout \\"hope\\". Our culture is still stuck in the belief that a diagnosis of cancer means death, or at the least, permanent disability. But Lance Armstrong shakes off that belief and tells how he climbs back on his bike and back into his life. The gift of hope that he provides with his story is well worth the price of the book for anyone fighting to climb out of the black hole of cancer treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Champion","review":"This book is a fast, easy and enjoyable read. All I knew about Lance Armstrong before reading the book was what everybody knows about him -- 1999 Tour le France winner and cancer survivor. This book is a glimpse to the \\"man behind the athelete\\" or a glimpse of the humanity that makes up Lance Armstrong. I was touched by his honesty on every subject he wrote about. Reading about his upbringing and how close he is to his mother, about meeting and falling in love with his wife (Kik) and about the conception and birth of his son speaks as the completeness of Mr. Armstrong. Highly recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, but excellent reading material !","review":"The concept of this book is simple : Lance wrote down the story of his life.The way it's being told and the comments Lance makes on everything most certainly improve the quality of the book. Although it's clear Lance isn't exactly a world class writer (as opposed to a rider), it reads easy and once you begin reading it, it won't let go of you. Personally, I was reading until 4:30am when my body was simply giving up... if it hadn't, I would have finished to book during the night.The story itself is great, but not because it was invented, but because it's a true story, a story with beauty and uglyness, where we can discover the true Lance Armstrong, with his weaknesses and problems. It gave me a completely different look at a person who I now admire even more, not just as a sportsman, but a lot more as a human being.Absolutely a recommendation for anyone !"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a good read for anyone.","review":"I have a simple review for this book.

You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with AS","review":"Before reading this book i felt as though Lance Armstrong was an amazing man-overcoming cancer, wining the tour de france 6 times.

Anytime he lost it was alywas to \\"the best in the world\\" and \\"he had given his absolute best and there was nothing he could do\\". It seems as tohught he cant admit his faults.

We read an entire chapter dedicated to how amazing his ex-wife Kristin is and he lets us down by wanting to be Lance Armstrong Superstar more than Lance Armstrong Husband/ Dad. I don't know all of the facts surrounding his personal life, but my wife did go through in-vetro fertilization. It is an incredibly uncomfortable and invasive procedure for women.

In fact, there are few professional athletes that I care to understanding outside of their sports realm as they are usually arrogant. Though it is their arrogance that makes them such great athletes. That was until a friend recommended I read his book. Wow! His story of survival is truly an inspiration to us all. Forget about the 3 tour victories.

You won't be sorry to invest your time in it, you'll just enjoy it. What I can tell you about my personal experience reading Lance's narration \\"He's inspiration\\". He's a sample of human potential, how far a human being can go if he or she wants. Also he can teach you that waiting for things is not going to help you in life. He made me think not only what I'm doing for me as well as what I'm doing for others .

I study English as a second language and in this semester our teacher picked this book. < It's not about the bike> By: Lance Armstrong. I think she made a good choice for the class because some times we read together, we shared ideas, and we enjoyed reading this book. My opinion about Lance is that he is a perfect example for others with any obstacles in their lives. Lance fought against his cancer and emerged with victory. He won his dreams because he won the Tour de France. He had a second chance in his life and he was approaching this opportunity. I want to see him racing his bike again in a competition. Maybe I will read his second book if he writes another and follow his new life with his wife and his son. I encourage others to read this book based on real life and how he won the fight: \\" Lance vs cancer \\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not Just About the Book","review":"I just finished reading the book as the Tour de France entered its final stages this week and Lance Armstrong is pursuing his fifth consecutive victory. Needless to say, I have never been a cycling fan until now. I have never cared much about the examples celebrity athletes provide until now. And I am not one to put athletes on a pedestal...until now. More than his words or his cycling accomplishments, his story of surviving cancer would set anyone apart and make them worthy of such attention.Lance Armstrong, through Sally Jenkins, successfully brings together the best in autobiographical writing, motivational writing, insights into the world of competitive cycling, and gives the reader much to think about in the end.I have read a few books on the power of positive thinking and healing to know that Lance has put it all together here. Thanks Lance and Sally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great motovational read...","review":"When Lance Armstrong was an up and coming rider, I always thought he had such a cocky attitude (some is good, too much is bad). But this book puts alot ot that in perspective and helps me to understand how a man can overcome adversity, change his life, succeed when no one thinks he can, and become a change person. Lance Armstrong is not a saint, and some of the critiscsms from earlier reviews are unnecessary, but neither are many of us and that's why the book is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A world-class athlete vs. cancer illness","review":"I finished Lance's book \\"It's Not About the Bike\\". Lance has to tell us two sides of his life. One is the sports-man and another is the fighter-man. As cancer survivor he had to fight that illness, while he tries to race again. This illness affected him and he made changes in his life. But after he fought it, he turned into a man with a great family. -Life is beautiful, specialty when you have this things: parents, a fiance and children- you became part of human life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wave which found its way back to the ocean","review":"This book can show you how a disease can change somebody's life, in this case Lance Armstrong's. You can see how he changed from a non-sweet and non-caring person to a sweet, caring and kind person. He changed his view of life, the way of looking at people around him, and the way that he coped with the chemo. You can see his passion for cycling and how he struggled with it after the chemo. You will laugh, cry and you will live and feel with him every single memory that he is giving you. He is a symbol that inspires COURAGE to keep going and not to quit. This is Lance Armstrong, the man who did consider himself as a \\"Wave\\" before, but now he considers himself as a \\"part of the ocean\\"(\\"We are no waves, we are part of the ocean\\" it is a aphorism form the book \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\". It touched me a lot because it means that we are not by ourselves or alone in this life. We are part of the humanity that during our lives we need someone beside us)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not about the book.","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book is GREAT. But reading it in 2008 will give you the feeling the end is missing in this book. No Sheryl Crow and no seven tour victories. This book covers Lance's dealings with cancer and his bike up until his second tour victory.What I really admire about this book is the way it has been written. No subjects are pushed to the back and the man Armstrong really comes forward. His battle with testicular cancer has been known throughout the world, but when you read about it in great detail you can actually grasp his battle for the first time.This book can be a great gift. Ever catch a person whining about something trivial? Then make him humble by reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!","review":"If you choose to read one book this year...let it be this one. I am not sure where to start with It's Not About The Bike-I could not put it down. It is written with such passion. You cheer at Lance's victories and cry at his struggles. He is an amazing athlete, loving father and grateful cancer survivor. There are so many inspirational words in his book. Whether you are an athlete like myself or a cancer patient, mother, father, daughter, brother...it doesn't matter. I guarantee you'll find something relatable in his book. I have read Every Second Counts and can't wait for Lance's story/documentary to come out. I can not get enough of this super human. Start by reading this book and you'll feel the same way. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A man with courage","review":"This book is an example for the people who have cancer. Lance explained it, in his book how he got a cure for his illness and the courage for reaching his goal as the best cyclist in the world. I admire Lance's temperament and tenacity to survive. How this disease changed him his style of life, but the most beautiful thing that happened to Lance was the birth of his son Luke. I enjoyed this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTIVATING AND DIFFICULT TO PUT DOWN!","review":"As a cyclist, I followed the tragedy of cancer and the triumph in the Tour de France of Lance Armstrong closely. Fortunately, this book has so much more detail of the true struggle he, his friends, and family faced during the days, weeks, months and years following his diagnosis with testicular cancer. The openness about his fears and how he overcame them make this book a volume of encouragement to anyone facing severe illness. Cancer definitely \\"picked the wrong body to live in\\" and Lance's own words will show you why. The book has just enough cycling jargon for the non-cyclist to understand what he is talking about, but not so much that it reads like a technical guide to cycling. An exceptional book, easy to read and hard to put down. I read mine in 3 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems a bit to big for cycling shorts","review":"I was excited to read this book as I am an avid cyclist and triathlete. I was very disappointed. Lance describes his journey through his career in an almost cavalier, \\" I deserve it all\\" sort of manner. He lacks an attitude of appreciation, humility, and respect that I believe other elite athletes have shown (e.g. Mike Singletary, Arnold Palmer, Joe Montanna, etc.) I must admit his experience with cancer was horrific and I am glad that he can be an inspiration to others that face the same trials. Unfortunately, the predominant theme that I took away from the book was his attitude of arrogance, pride and self-indulgence. Before reading this book, I was prepared to root Lance to his fifth Tour de France Victory. Now I hope he looses, it would do his tremendous ego some good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not About the Bike:My Journey Back to Life","review":"Inspirational. His journey back to life was indeed a rough one. My focus was on his illness and his road to recovery. It was truly not about the bike for me.It was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are 5 stars automatic for cancer patients?","review":"On a technical level, this book is an amateurish read despite the presence of a co-author.In terms of content, I was embarassed for Lance most of the time. He knows just enough to understand that a story like his SHOULD be inspirational, but by recounting (even relishing in) petty achievements like owning an expensive car, driving it fast, and talking down to most of the people he encounters, gives away the fact that as a human being, he's less than the sum of his accomplishments (which are limited to riding a bicycle).I have a thousand times more respect for the majority of cancer victims who fight quietly and win or lose, manage to maintain their dignity in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing/story, but bad publishing","review":"I loved the story. But I was frustrated with the amount of errors in the book. Many times the paperback bounced around, you would turn the page and the story would be either further advanced or re-visiting previous chapters. The page numbers were all correct, but I'm sure parts of the story are missing. I went to the publishers website. It said to return the book to them and they would replace it. I called their customer service and asked if they would pay for the shipping. They said \\"no\\". I said I didn't think that was a good way to do business - after all, my reading pleasure was ruined by their mistake. They said \\"sorry, it is our policy\\".This is the first book I've bought with this type of problem.So beware of Penguin Putnam Inc. (formerly Berkley Books)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of offensive language and adult subject matter","review":"This book chronicles bicyclist Lance Armstrong's battle with cancer and his return to professional bicycle racing. Lance Armstrong is a 4-time winner of the Tour de France, husband, father and most importantly a cancer survivor.The book is very interesting, but does include offensive language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like someone else we (Bikers) know.","review":"I thought the book was excellent. I also started the book and couldn't put it down until I had finished. Lance is truly an American Hero and everything in this book says so. From a cancer survivor to a biking legend and still going. He is going to have to look out for those walls on the way down the mountains though if he wants to continue biking. Luck lasts just so long. Greg Lemond had similar feelings about continuing biking after his hunting accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"As an amateur triathlete, I couldn't wait to read Lance's story. I was eager to delve into the mind of one of my heroes, hear how he survived cancer and became a legend. Boy was I disappointed! This poorly written, extremely repetitive book had me cringing early on from the style; it was easy to see the book had been hastily published and hadn't received the editing attention it deserved. And the content! Armstrong reveals himself not as a noble, courageous human but rather a selfish jerk. I expected inspiration from reading this book but didn't take that away at all. Part of it could be my recent cancer experience, and part could be that my expectations of Lance were simply too high. Nevertheless, I no longer see him as an athlete or an example-- he's just another jerk who's good at his job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I liked the book. He's a romantic at heart.

Not much point in reading this now can I have my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Inspiration to Chemotherapy Patients","review":"I'm an avid cyclist who is in the midddle of a round of chemotherapy - so I can totally relate to this book.I've read a lot of books on cancer and attitude since being diagnosed, but none drove home the point that ANYTHING is possible as well as this one did.Winning the Tour would be enough of a triumph - but to come back from chemotherapy and surgery and win it...awesome! Believe me - Lance is not overstating the affect that treatment has on your body - the comeback is astounding. It's given me a lot of courage and renewed my determination - I think it will do that for a lot of people. I literally had tears in my eyes as I read the account of his ride into Sestriere.And it's not just about cancer - if you love cycling it's a great cycling book too! The behind the scenes information of what goes on in the peloton is a great read.Thanks Lance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"As an avid fan of bike racing, I thought I knew Lance's story pretty well.

One of the best books I have ever read. Not only extraordinarily inspirational, but also extremly informative and interesting.

No punches are pulled - the good, the bad and the ugly are all dealt with.

You don't need to know anything about bikes to read the book and become inspired.

In the book he speaks as if he is just the guy next door, whe has gone through a terrible ordeal but was victorious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lance's Incredible Journey","review":"In Lance Armstrong's book \\"It's not about the bike\\" I thought it was an excellent book.The book is very well written. He explained how he had a rough childhood and how he started cycling, he took us through his races, and he described his cancer in every little detail not a single thing was left unsaid. He made you feel like you were on the bike next to him or sitting in the hospital room with him. He took you on an emotional roller coaster ride with all of the emotions running through his head you will have the same feelings reading the book. If you read this book it will motivate you and inspire you not to give up on your dreams and when an obstacle gets in your way you have to try your hardest to get through it and eventually you will overcome it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's NOT about the bike...","review":"There's truth in the title: it's not about the bike, not even about Lance, although he's the one generating the narrative, and a good one it is. Joseph Campbell spoke about the \\"Hero's Journey\\", which is what this book outlines. Some come to enlightenment through study, others through life-altering experiences, most never get there at all. With feet of clay, and a pretty good-sized ego (necessary for world-class athletes), and help from more gods and humans than anyone has a right to expect, Lance arrived on that windswept peak that overlooks life in this world. I thank him for sharing that with us, as painful as it was, and for helping us understand that we all can rise to that peak, but we cannot do it alone.In the words of the Hollywood reviewers, \\"I laughed, I cried, I was changed.\\" If you read this and aren't, you're not human."},{"rating":"1","title":"very shallow view of the world","review":"Very disappointed...The book was recommended to me as a deep book on his life changing event....although a very powerful story I found it very shallow and with very little deep meaning and it leaves you understanding how his ego led to his marital affairs,divorce and abandoning his family...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disquieting","review":"Lance Armstrong had all of the experiences and had developed all of the tools to become a great athlete and full blown narcissist. Had cancer not intervened, his views of himself and of the role of those around him might have become even more aggrandized than they did in real life.His loving and lovely wife we can see was the ultimate support mechanism, very little is spoken of what he gave to her other than the once in a lifetime chance to be with himThere is a good story about dealing with cancer and how it has the potential to change one but in his case not enough.The history of the last decade has confirmed what the book foretold"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was just OK.","review":"I'm not a biking enthusiast, but I read this book upon the recommendation of my husband, who would give it an emphatic 5 stars. I thought that I would be uplifted and inspired, but, well, it actually made me like Lance Armstrong a little less. I know this won't be a popular opinion, but, according to the book, he wasn't really very nice to the people around him as he went through his ordeals, and he doesn't waste much time thanking anyone. And did he really get the owner of Oakley to force an insurance company to cover the costs of his cancer treatment? Great for him, but all he did was pass the cost of his treatment on to other policyholders who made sure that their premiums were paid. I wish I would have like this book, but I can't say that I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This is an incredible book--\\"How do you like them apples!\\" :-) A thought-provoking, profound, compelling story that evokes every emotion imaginable--I laughed, I cried, then I read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life","review":"Really enjoyed this book.

Reminds Me of Olympic Champion Jeff Blatnick","review":"Lance Armstrong, like Jeff Blatnick, has taken advantage of an international stage to show the power of faith, friends and family, combined with medical research and skilled medical professionals. As I read Lance's book, I thought of what Carl Mays wrote in A Strategy For Winning: (quote) Jeff Blatnick won a gold medal in Grecco-Roman wrestling for the United States in 1984. I think he won even greater respect of the entire world by the way he adapted to and bounced back from his bout with cancer prior to the Olympics (end quote).

I am not opposed to this type of language, per se, but I choose not to expose my daughter to it and am so upset at the lack of a warning, will probably never finish listening to the audiobook."},{"rating":"1","title":"masterpiece of arrogance","review":"There are givers and there are takers in this world.

It isinteresting to read only to have an inside view of an unabashed self-obsessed person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Comeback - Mediocre Book","review":"I was hoping for more but this is a typical subpar athlete's autobiography. Lance's story is incredible because he fought and came back and should inspire those in a similar situation. However, other than the cancer, Lance Armstrong is not an interesting individual and reading about his mundane conversations with his wife was a waste of time and was out of place for subject of the book. It was very interesting to read that Lance does not love cycling - he did it because he was good at it and it was a well paying job. I can appreciate that kind of honesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both Armstrongs need a dose of reality","review":"While i commend anyone who fights cancer, regardles of if they beat it, I was simply aghast at Armstrong and his wife. Pity poor Lance--he has to sell his Porsche! At one point, he moans that a sponsor is \\"only offering $180,000 a year\\"--and this not to do anything, but simply as a gift while he trains. His wife, she's the real kicker here: she must ...Lance's sexism (he refers to his wife as \\"a skirt\\"), his wife's vanity, all conspire to undermine the essentially valiant story of a man beating cancer and winning the hardest race on earth.I think his story deserved a biography; as autobiography, I simply found his persona too icky to root for. Maybe I am not \\"stud\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is about a myth","review":"When I first read this book a year ago, I said \\"Wow\\".

Just like that. And running around with Sheryl Crow. That sucks. I've lost faith in this man. I think the book is just a story now, not what he really thinks or the way he really is.

He is free now from the illnes and stil very famous because he won the Tour de France 3 consecutive years since 1999.I wonder if all cancer cases have the same happy end.

Also he is a classical winner, a beloved man, No only for his mother, and his friends everybody love Lance, He is a lucky man too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loathsome Lance","review":"How Armstrong, a world renowned champion cyclist and cancer survivor, could turn such challenging experiences into a loathsome exercise in egomania, is beyond comprehension. His idea of 'surviving' is by showing a total lack of kindness and compassion to himself and others, treating others on a far lower level than his pedastal, and asking the reader to show mercy on his situation - only those that involved him losing his corporate sponsorship, or Porsche. With the help of co-author Sally Jenkins, Armstrong brings the concept of \\"self-absorbtion\\" to a whole new level. What should have tipped me (and other reader's) off was the book's jacket, which lists adjectives beneath his name: Winner of the Tour de France, Cancer Survivor, Husband, Father, Son, Human Being. The last one listed is most beneficial for the readers; lest we forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT book","review":"I have always been a Lance Armstrong fan and and knew basically what he had gone through.

He should be sent to a prison and allowed to preach his senseless vision behind bars. He should be treated as a criminal and pay for his lies, manipulation and disregard to all rules of a sport and humanity... A white color criminal, the lowest form of human being, a true disgrace.

First off, the Cancer was mostly in his brain and required an incredible surgery and a large amount of painful recovery. Secondly, the bike race was the Tour De France which is a 2,000+ mile race around the circumference of a nation. His tale is so much more than that of an athlete trying to complete a dream.

Lance Armstrong provides a heartfelt look at his amazing life, including his cycling feats (of course), growing up without a father, his illness, treatment, and recovery from cancer, his struggles to have a child (wife's vitro fertilization), and more. He outlines his triumphs and challenges, setbacks and victories in a compelling and interesting manner. I'm a martial artist not a cyclist and frankly have very little interest in the sport.

Lance reveals his childhood -- including his struggles as a swimmer and his wild antics -- the rejection he experienced, his triumphs, his battle with cancer, and his relationships with two very special ladies -- his mother, and his wife. The photos are fantastic; like the text, they portray the very human side of a champion. I highly recommend this book to everyone -- and most especially to athletes and cancer patients.-- Graciela Sholander, http://dreamitdoit.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"In this book, Lance Armstrong opens up and lets the reader really feel what he felt. Personally, I was never a fan of reading, but I am currently reading this book for the 5th time in the past year. It truly changed my life and the way I feel about life and illness. Don't miss this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud of a book, fraud cyclist, fraud co-author, fraud publisher","review":"It is now clear that most everything Armstrong says is a lie. Most of this book is based on lies and readers should consider a class action law suit against Armstrong, Jenkins and the publisher Berkley to get our money back for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not About the Bike...","review":"\\"It's not about the bike... it's about the dope.\\" What a joke. I want the $$ back I paid for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's about the dope!","review":"It's not about the bike. It's about the dope, dope! It's well-known that Lance doped his way to the Tour de France podiums. But the book says he didn't dope. His co-author has finally accepted that he did dope, though she justifies it. (Check her column this week in the Washington Post.) I wonder whether she and Lance will revise this book? If you want an inspirational story, find it elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed reader.","review":"I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 33 and read this book in the hospital while recovering from my mastectomy. I found it incredibly inspirational and it encouraged me to take an active participation with my treatments and recovery. I was shocked to learn of his lying and bullying. We don't know what caused his cancer, but doping, could have potentially contributed. Cancer prevention is just as important as cancer cures. What he should have done was confessed when he was diagnosed and used himself as an example of the serious side effects of doping. He could have still started Livestrong. He may not have become as famous, but then he would have been a hero instead of a fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Doesn't Tell The Truth","review":"In light of the wall of evidence suggesting Lance's aggressive use of doping materials to gain his competitive advantage, this book's central thesis of winning through dedication does not account for the incredible investment in dishonesty and deception that made these wins and his spotless image possible. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Triumph!","review":"Like many others have said here, this is a book about triumph over hardship, the battle fought against an adversary like no other-cancer. While reading this book, I couldn't help but think, \\"Lance Armstrong was a jerk.\\" But, then you can almost see him grow and mature as the stroy unfolds, you can see the bitter battle he fought and won.I am a fiction lover at heart, but this book drew me in and held my attention. I consider myself an athlete, but what Armstrong went through pushes the envelope of human endurance. Read this book, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well written","review":"As a die-hard Lance fan anything I can read about him is definitely going to be read. This book was well organized and well written.Somethings I've read about him were put together so poorly I hardly knew what it was they were trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-facet reading","review":"Lance offers a bit of something for everyone in this book. Something for the athlete that needs motivation, something for those overcoming serious illness, something for kids to admire, and a wake-up call for adults who think life is so damn rough.His childhood is somewhat slow reading but does make the point that even the most under-privileged kid can make something of themselves. Highly recommended for the young who just need the realization that everyone can overcome life's obstacles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I read the book in one sitting...it's that captivating! Whether you are a cycling fan or not this is one you shouldn't pass up! At times I felt myself angry over the way Armstrong treated his friends, coaches and family but then...you have to consider what he was going through at the time. Yes he is brash but when you're as good as he is and have been through what he's been through it's not without cause. A truly inspirational and uplifting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story about a cancer survivor","review":"Although I really haven't followed Lance Armstrong's cycling career, I was compelled to get this book. I found it very interesting and although I haven't personally been very close to someone dealing with cancer, it was a great story of hope. I think this would be an awesome book to give someone who has been diagnosed with cancer. No matter how grim of a prognosis someone may be given, Lance Armstrong is a living example of how there can always be hope. I also think that when people are fighting cancer, they probably want to read success stories on those that have overcome cancer so that they may have hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"About people not bikes","review":"This is a great book ... especially since Lance has now won seven Tour de France races ! I admired his perserverance getting through cancer and climbing back on the bicycle to continue training. He is definitely right that cancer makes you think about the people near you much more -- his girlfriend / wife and eventually his son. The details of his emotional reaction to learning about his cancer were very helpful to understand what cancer patients go through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I ever read","review":"It's not about the bike was so inspirational.It was real ,it was touching.A book that gives HOPE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but Truthful","review":"This book was written with such simple language and words, yet the message is direct and strong. Read the words and look deep into their meanings. These are the confessions of a proud man, a fallen man, a revived man and a victorious man. Although we might not be able to associate ourselves in Lance's situation, we all can learn one lesson here : Hope and Willpower can sustain life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching!","review":"The story about Lance Armstrong is a very touching story. Through this book, we could see how lives are difficult and incredible. You read Lance's story for learning about his fight with testicular cancer or to learn about training for a bike race. You can learn many new things from reading how he faces life's challenges. Also, as a mother, I learned even more from Linda, his mother and how hard she worked. She always was strong and supported Lance in everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A peek into the life of a champion","review":"Ever wondered what drives a champion? Do you liked being inspired? Then this book is for you.It would suprise even Lance Armstrong to know that he was able to win 6 Tour de France in a row. But reading his book and realizing what he does to prepare for these races. One can see the heart and dedication it takes to go from champion to legend. The book chronicles the progress of a champion cyclist and the making of a cycling legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Book","review":"This is a excellent book. I read it while training to ride my first century bike ride in Claxton, Georgia. What a incrediable man Lance is. What a inspiration for me to keep riding, keep training. This was a book I could not put down. A friend who is a speed reader read the book on our flight from California to Flordia. It is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Book","review":"Lance Armstrong is sure to inspire anyone who reads this book. He beat the odds, not only to survive, but to win the Tour De France. This tells of his hardships and ultimate triumph. Being struck with cancer, he wasn't expected to live, but pure dedication and the love and support of his family and friends got him through it. This story is one that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tour de Lance","review":"I think this is one of the most amazing book about one og cycling's living legends. Definitely a must read for all cycling fanatics. Two Thumbs UP"},{"rating":"1","title":"Egotism Gone Wild","review":"Lance is a mystery to most americans who only idolize winners. In Europe, where they know cycling, he is almost universally disliked, not just because he is a doper, but because it reallyis about the bike, and his own personal fame.This book is an \\"I love Lance book\\" written by Lance! Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must","review":"Unbelievable story. I have so much respect for what he went through and has accomplished. I did not put this down. I don't follow the sport, and this book is so much more than your usual athlete autobiography."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough songs","review":"I was dissappointed in this in that he doesn't teach enough songs.

Usually I scroll down and read reviews before purchasing, but I didn't this time and I am sorry I didn't. As previous people stated, I was annoyed that I received only one fork when thinking I was getting a set. Now I am stuck because it will cost me money if I return it and I would be out a fork and shipping. Amazon needs to revamp this product description and picture because it is misleading. The set is actually in the 50 dollar range not 5 dollars. So if you were to order, READ CAREFULLY to ensure that you are purchasing EXACTLY what you think you are ordering.

However, this CD sounds like it was recorded on a $20 box in a concrete room using a deaf man as an engineer. I couldn't have been more disappointed with the quality of this disc. The liner notes were also horrendous! (Choppy, misspellings) It appears that the same care was taken writing these as was in producing this disc.

The sound is poor, the performances sadly under represents the band. Head East was an energetic band, their music had a definite zest and vitality. Avoid this product at all costs. A&M needs to give some serious thought to re-releasing Head East Live. (Yes, re-release Head East Live was available for a short time as a domestic release, why it was pulled we'll never know). Hopefully A&M will realize there are people looking for this CD out there. In the meantime you can get the abbreviated version of Head East Live by buying Head East Live on Stage. Flat as a Pancake is also an enjoyable alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"Since I've had no luck finding a copy of Head East Live! I thought this might be comparable.

You can go all out, or keep the workout at a lower fitness level -- Foreman stresses for everyone to do what they can do.I love this workout because it's fun and also because it's a great workout for my legs, waist and butt.

The sound quality is somewhat variable, apparently depending on where on stage the singers happen to be, but is unusually good for a one-shot theatre production. La Fenice's orchestra and chorus under Eliahu Imbal perform with panache. Katia Ricciarelli turns in some of her finest singing -- and that is very fine indeed! -- ably matched by thge sweet tones of Leo Nucci. There are times when I am as inclined as the La Fenice audience to break into applause spontaneously at the conclusions of some big numbers. Alberto Cupido in the tenor role holds up his end of the performance most enjoyably.This opera is not markedly inferior to most of Donizetti, and the team on this reording make a very persuasive case for it.

The core assumption of this book is WRONG, that is, that Latin springs from Greek. We all know now that Greek and Latin are cousin languages which both sprang from Indo-European. This book, besides this major misconception, is riddled with errors. Nonetheless, it's a useful work and a fun read for word nerds."},{"rating":"2","title":"On young and passionate despair","review":"If you like France, you got to read this, because every little French has read it and dreamed over it. It is a superb book to read when you are young, because it is full of passion, mystery, fog and despair. When you grow older, as noticed in other comments, you see the flaws and the blind decisions of the hero, but when you are 16 or 18 years old, it is all emotions to you. The author was very young: it is impossible to recapture the same spirit later, which makes of this a rare book.The story is set in Sologne, less than 2 hours south of Paris, and worth a stop if you go visiting the castles on the Loire, which you should. The region is poor,full of swamps, fog and great food and a splendid contrast to life in the castles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Expose' By Dore Gold","review":"The author of this book Dore Gold has written a side of SaudiArabia that is unknown by most average Americans.A sect that isgaining a foothold in Saudi Arabia called Wahhabism is callingfor most extremist dealings with the Western world.The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has become an active supporter of many terroristgroups that are operating in the world today.Al-Queida,Hezbollah,Hamas and other terrorist groups are recieving financial backing from Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia also pays the families of suicidebombers who carry out acts of terrorism in Israel.

The bargain that the Saudi's struck for legitimacy with Wahabbi clerics is detailed here as are the effects.If you want to know \\"why they hate us\\", where they get their money, and how we got to where we are today, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important book with important information... but dry...","review":"1. Most folks who have read 1-2 books on modern Islamic terrorism are already aware of the overt association between Saudi Arabia and the radical or conservative form of Islam it supports, which is then related to the numerous terrorists / terrorist groups and then general underlying antiwest philosophy that permeates Wahhabism.2. Anyway, what else is there to say? A very detail oriented book, which is a definite must read for those who wish be educated / informed of the true realities of the \\"War on Terror\\" (a more accurate term would the civilized society war on radical Islam).3. The only con to the book, which is really the nature of this kind of book--> it's just dry. Pure dry reading, but informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"from someone lives there","review":"guess what, I live in what Mr. Gold say as the \\"Hatred Kingdom\\". my review is simply this: Facts are facts and they don't change, Interpretation of these facts is what could change\\".First of all, blaming all terrorist actions in the world on this government only is like blaming all dieing animals on the wolf just because we hate wolves more than other prediators. it is really shallow minded and small thinking.Second, I didn't like the way he talk about us as if we came from the planet of apes, generalize that most of us are haters just because a tiny fraction -only 15- of us are terrorists, it is more of stereotyping than analyzing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically driven with no real substance","review":"I've read this book out of curiosity, but unfortunetely found it to be without real or factual substance and no objective conclusion.Rather, it was politically motivated and written by someone who is naturally biased towards Isreal, and could not possibly have the objectivity nor the intention to write the full truth.Saudi Arabia may be a country with many extremists and people who hate America or the west, but we cannot take this view without looking at the big picture and all other factors including Isreal and the Isreali Arab conflict into consideration as well as the Amrican role in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Middle Eastern regimes that are supported by the United States.Therefore, I can honestly say that this book is worthless, dangerously biased, and incite hatred rather than understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"A brave and important book that should be read by the president, his cabinet and everyone in Congress.

If it were just our policies then just the Government and Military would be a target; instead innocent civilians are. This book lays out the timeline, ideology and justification currently used in the current phase of terrorism. The Saudi Royal Family has gotten themselves into a tremendous jam they can't get out of by supporting the US and their clergy that preach hateful rhetoric against the US.This book explains the history and hatred even between the middle eastern countries and people, also the differences between the different sects of Islam are explained and how much they hate each other.

Remember who is writing this text, an adivsor, ambassador to the UN and foreign policy advisor for Israel. I'm sure that had someone less biased written an account of Saudi Arabia it would sound very different. Not to mention that many people have quite a few choice things to say about the actions of Israel itself.

It doesn't go all the way to include duck blood, but it does cover most of the meat. Naturally from a western tradition, but also with some nice Asian recipes included.The weakness of the book is the short section about ducks. Many people outside the US buy American books and it would have been nice with a section on French ducks and Chinese ducks as well. And more about American ducks too. Basically more information about the ingredients.The binding of the book is so sturdy so I don't think it can ever break!I can recommend this book for all duck lovers and for the rest of you I can really recommend the author of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sterling Silver, stud, pink, earrings","review":"Not pink as the picture is, only pink cast.

I think it is indispensible. What I especially liked is the flap on the back cover of my edition with all of the cards listed with pictures, seasons, names, and point value. This is very handy to use during a game. I even photo-copy it and hand it out to players along with the page on bonus point combinations in Honeymoon Hanafuda. There are a few confusing errors in text/illustrations, which is the only reason this didn't get five stars. Since this is the 14th edition, I would have expected them to be ironed out by now. For example, on page 27,the board and hand cards are mislabeled. There are a few others, which can make it very confusing for a beginner like me! Eventually figured them all out and pencilled in the correct descriptions. I would recommend this book to anyone starting out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanafuda - the Flower Card Game","review":"The book is good and has several games that can be played BUT if you live in Australia, don't bother buying it unless you already have the actual cards.

You don't get a much better resource then this for understanding media Arabic, and maybe it's a bad habit, but I usually consult this before turning to my Wehr or AlMawrid. No, it's not perfect, but you're not going to find one that is.

If you're looking for a basic dictionary, this is a pretty good one. The Arabic words are printed without the short vowels, but the transliteration in English is printed beside each Arabic word, otherwise, the dictionary would not be useful for learning the pronunciation of new words. I recommend this dictionary to Arabic speakers looking to learn English and to English speakers looking to learn Arabic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"This book has the information one needs to learn the words but is difficult due to having to flip back and forth to form a sentence. Unlike many of the newer methods of learning a new language. This does make a good reference guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolutely awful dictionary","review":"I've been studying Arabic pretty intensely for the past 40 weeks: 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. This dictionary is awful to the point of worthlessness. Without giving proper context, the definitions are often wrong or are infrequently used synonyms. By stripping away the underlying root system, it actually harms learning. If you must have an English-Arabic dictionary, get the Oxford, though you're better off just using Google translate. Spend the money and invest the time to learn to use Hans Wehr well but don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arabic Translation","review":"I bought this book because I needed a reference for picking names for my Arabian horses.

Unless you speak pretty fluent Arabic, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Dictionary","review":"I am learning to speak Arabic at home.

I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it appears.","review":"In comparison to other compact Arabic-English dictionaries that I have bought, I, at first, found this book heaven-sent. As a second-year Arabic student, I found the large amounts of vocabulary extremely helpful... that is until I began to check my work with native Arab speakers. A number of words listed in this book are incorrect, and do not match up with their translated meanings. Sometimes the translations are extremely off base, and now that I've become aware of this fact, I use it less and less. It can be very helpful for basic words and for the beginner, but it's important to know that it contains a number of errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful to have and very portable","review":"This dictionary has some things going for it that make it worth having. The vocabulary it offers is very contemporary, the Arabic is printed in a nice-looking font, and quality English-Arabic dictionaries of any size are hard to find. So I made a lot of use it for classes where written compositions were assigned. And it isn't too heavy to carry around and won't take up a lot of room in a briefcase or book bag. My one criticism would be that the Arabic-English half is organized by alphabetical order, not by roots as most Arabic dictionaries are. Best suggestion: get this along with Hans Wehr (Arabic-English only) and get going right away learning to look up words by roots. It's a slow and painstaking learning process, but it's a very necessary skill in learning Arabic, so it's really better not to put it off. Use the Arabic-English half of Awde only if you're in a hurry to finish an assignment."},{"rating":"2","title":"ruskin rocks","review":"A great book, full of Ruskin's own special insights on art. Esp art in relation to the world, how it impacts our lives, re life, religion, morals, functionality, even. There are sections on aspects of rendering too... line, color, light. All in all, useful to artists and artwriters alike. It is no less applicable now than when these lectures were delivered, I think, only the phrasing, not the content, is nineteenth century. These were very important thoughts, that set the tenor of art criticism for the entire 20th century. A few really clear b/w illustrations attend the text beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"A incredible story of adventure, heroism and freindship","review":"This story encapsulates a time in our lives when we were young and idealistic. When the quest for adventure, to do something exciting, overrides our understanding of death, injury or even logic. The missions he experienced are explained and dramatically told in a way that both civilian and military minds can draw a vivid picture in the minds eye. Seawolves brings the reader to the edge of what it must have been like to live the Vietnam experience from in country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but.....","review":"More Navy propoganda! While everyone who saw them will agree that the seawolves were good, they were only playing Cavalry. Just as we always considered the SEALs to be tall ARVNs, we in the AIR Cavalry always considered the Seawolves part of the ARVN air force. They were a defensive/reative force, we in the Army air cavaly were the offensive force. Book doesn't mention that because the seawolves had to operate off of boats, they couldn't carry our ammo load and therefore couldn't stay in the fighting as long as army gunships. If you didn't have to trot along side your gunship on takeoff because it was overweight with ammo, you couldn't expect to stay in the fighting very long. OK, book for those who know nothing about gunships but not so great for those of us who were on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I loved this book!

It focuses mainly on thier current material, of the time; so, you won't find a lot of variety or \\"classic\\" Budgie tracks. The band's performance is just fine, spirited and reasonably tight, but, they suffer from lack of a second guitarist (unlike much of the \\"Heavier than Air\\" collection), sounding thin much of the time. This problem is worsened by the major lack of low end; Burke's bass is pretty much inaudible without major eqing. All in all, not very satisfying, even for Budgie fans.

It's so convincing, that sometimes I even believe I can smell the rain. The thunder is rumbling so there are no very loud sudden claps to startle you. On the downside, there is a bird that gets on my nerves a little bit, especially in the first part of the CD. The loud chirping does die down eventually. After a little while what few birds you do hear are far enough in the background where you really don't notice them too much and can focus on relaxing. But I absolutely love the thunderstorm and think this CD deserves 4 stars (although I'm still on a quest to find a thunderstorm without ANY birds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please remix this CD and REMOVE THE BIRD SOUNDS","review":"I grew up in the deep South where thunder storms are common. They are soothing and meditative. \\"Distant Thunder\\" has all the potential of being that way, except for those darn bird sounds. There are no birds in thunderstorms. They are hiding from the rain and are not out chirping their heads off. The rolling thunder in \\"Distant Thunder\\" is wonderful and transcending, but the bird chirping jolts one out of a blissful state and wreaks havoc upon the expanded Alpha state of the brain. Additionally, when the volume of the thunder is building, the bird chirping gets louder. It is difficult to focus on the calming sounds of thunder when the shrill bird noises over ride the thunder. \\"Distant Thunder\\" needs to be remixed and have the birds removed totally.

The \\"West\\" soundtrack was a bit better, but still unpleasant. Perhaps if you grew up around these sounds you'll like it (I did, after all, learn to sleep to a chorus of high-pitched, loud frogs croaking in Venezuela, although it took 2 years), but if you're not already in that zone, I'd recommend one of Krause's many other wonderful CDs.

As a Professor of Economics and Law, he understands not only the fields in which Hamilton worked, but the historical importance of this brilliant Founding Father.Hamilton has been subjected to a massive deconstruction by the Jeffersonian Party--and it still goes on. Perhaps TJ made the grand speeches and declarations which define our Republic--but Alexander Hamilton lived the life and took the political risks which have made America the greatest nation on earth. This Founder was no mere politician, no businessman with his eye on the main chance, but a profound economic philosopher.If you want to read a book which will tell you the truth about Alexander Hamilton, make this the one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and misleading","review":"Be careful of this book. Hamilton was a great man -- and one much misunderstood in his own time ... and today.McDonald, unfortunately, goes too far in Hamilton's defense. He attempts to paint a picture where Hamilton was responsible for virtually everything that was done right -- and who cautioned against most of the missteps. Everyone else (not just Jefferson!) is painted as incompetent, stupid, conspiring, and selfish.Nor does McDonald at least acknowledge (except in some endnotes) where he departs from the \\"conventional\\" view point. And, as other reviewers note, there is little discussion of Hamiltons personal life and habits, his family, etc.If you are very familair with the personalities and issues of the time, this book provides an interesting viewpoint and a very good discussion of the banking issues involved.But don't start here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned!!","review":"Don't read this book if you want to learn about the man that was Hamilton. If your only interest is the politics and financial events of his day then this is the book for you. There is little or no discussion about Hamiltons personal life, his children, his habits, his wife, his education, his thoughts, his friends, even his death and the events arounding it are but a few paragraphs. Look elsewhere to learn about Hamilton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of objectivity overshadows any good points","review":"The author of this book is so enamored of Hamilton that it completely blinds him to any faults Hamilton may have had. Furthermore, anyone who showed any opposition at all to anything Hamilton proposed is deemed either delusional or a traitor. His treatment of Jefferson and Adams is amazingly disrespectful. Even Washington comes accross as a feeble leader at times without the constant support and advice of his most trusted advisor Hamilton.As the book progresses, the bias gets worse and almost preachy.Shockingly, the famous duel with Aaron Burr gets only about 3 pages worth of description.....probably since it was not exactly a high point in his life.Avoid this book if you want a well-balanced biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable Partisan Biography","review":"Forrest McDonald's \\"Alexander Hamilton\\" should not be called a biography, but a partisan harangue, and libel on liberty. In this McDonald champions Hamilton, and ambitious,self centered,anti republican Founding Father. McDonald libels Thomas Jefferson, and attempts to degrade his views in the early American Republic by inflating the character of Hamilton. Hamilton, contrary to McDonald's belief was seriously anti-republican. In the Constitutional Convention Hamilton propsed an unlimited government based on the British monarchy. He was distrustful of common people even calling them \\"a great beast\\". McDonald, like all admirers of Hamilton, attempts to gloss over Hamilton's anti-liberty and repblican ideals and instead elevate him as a defender of them. Hamilton was an avid supporteer of the wealthy's domination of government, and McDonald strongly supports this view.McDonald is not objective in the least, and overall has produced a deplorable partisan biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"No active table of contents","review":"The description of this collection is deceptive.There is no active table of contents.This makes finding individual stories difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic and funny","review":"a book that you must have in your library, in the wave of TV sherlocks it is good to read it an rediscover i"},{"rating":"2","title":"PRICE CAN'T BE RIGHT","review":"I've used this BBQ sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives (like corn syrup and for us gluten) but the price on this can't be right.

For insight into the Swedish immigration into the U.S., this movie makes a wonderful chronological predecessor to the film \\"The Emmigrants\\", starring Max von Sydow, which became the basis for the story \\"Unto a New Land\\", which was adapted to the U.S. TV series \\"Little House on the Prairie\\". In Swedish with English subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie, but not quite for the squeamish.","review":"Beautifully filmed, based on a true story.

Jonathan was absolutly one of my favorite actors, i'll watch anything hes in.i sat through Seaquest(not hard, i liked that show!).This movie was one i watched dozens of times once i got it on tape. Please release this on DVD, whoever is is charge of those sorts of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"superior","review":"This is a state of the art jazz piano trio playing compositions by bertha, first husband elmo, second husband and bassist walter booker, and other jazz musicians.

Got turned on to the band pretty recently and I have been impressed with every thing about these guys! They are unbelievable!

The rest of the album isn't that good. The others are kind of slow and blend in together. I fell asleep while listening to this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"It's probably the first album that I loved every song on it. Every song was great. I listen to it almost everyday. I'm glad finally I bought it. This band is really amazing. 3 months ago I didn't even know the band and didn't really know about Jared Leto. But now I'm a big fan of 30 Seconds To Mars."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Interesting\\" is a good word to describe it","review":"I can't say Jared Leto failed me in the acting world. His roles in Lord of War and Requiem for A Dream were excellently done. However, this review isn't of Leto. Most actors and actresses make forays into music and create sub par albums and achieve following in other countries (David Hasselhof for instance). A Beautiful Lie is the first album I've heard from 30 Seconds to Mars and I can safely say I don't believe them to be sub par. Leto's singing is quite good and ranges from angry and loud to haunting and soft. The band musically ranges from hard rock in \\"The Fantasy,\\" to incorporating violins and acoustic guitars in the ballad-esque \\"A Modern Myth.\\" I think their musical depth and creativity are key points in why I keep coming back to this album. I'd recommend this album to anyone who is looking for a bit of something different, maybe to change up their musical rotation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abominable schlock","review":"This music is below awful. Jared Leto is the most self-indulgent non-talent to hit the scene in awhile. I don't even think he knows what his emo-cliches mean. Some of the songs are so embarrassing that you have to laugh to break up the uncomfortable experience. I really want to cheer for humanity, but music like this--equipt with pomp and eyeliner--makes me want to give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"This album was very boring, I don't know how this band got famous, it's so boring. Song \\"Modern Myth\\" was soft and so boring, it songs \\"Attack\\" and \\"From Yesterday\\" that I like. Don't get this album! I'll advice you not to get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"um..no","review":"Wow what a pathetic excuse for music. Far from good music. I just happen to see them live at an Audioslave concert before Seether. How embarrassing it was for them..they were worse than awful. Regardless, Seether and Audioslave both put an amazing show on that night! Don't waste your money on this...go get a Seether or Audioslave cd instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"R-Evolve","review":"To support an earlier reviewer, 30 seconds to mars seems to do nothing new in this CD and to support this I ask you to listen to the intro of \\"R-Evolve\\" and immediately following that listen to \\"Adams Song\\" intro from Blink 182.... Same exact progression... sad isn't it??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protection = no purchase.","review":"Great album, 4 stars for content, but only 1 star overall and I'd give it a zero if possible for copy protection.

My favorite songs are \\"The Kill\\", \\"Was it a Dream\\", \\"The Story\\", \\"R-Evolve\\", \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", \\"Savior\\", \\"From Yesterday\\". I read that Jared Leto wrote all the songs. He is so talented!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should hear this!","review":"30 Seconds To Mars are fantastic!!! I'd recommend this album to everyone I meet because I love them, A Beautiful Lie was the first track I heard and immediately bought both albums.The gorgeous Jared Leto (Requiem For A Dream, Lord Of War, My So Called Life) is the lead singer with brother Shannon Leto is excellent on the drums with Tomo (Milicevic) and Matt (Wachter) on guitars and bass. Four very talented rockers making awesome music.Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"phenomenal","review":"first off, let me say that i'm quite upset with all the comparisons that are being made with 30STM. personally, i think that 30STM has one of the most unique sounds out there today. i couldn't possibly have asked for anything better. also, who cares if jared leto is an actor gone musician, obviously he didn't pick up the guitar over night because these are instruments being played, not some techno will smith/jennifer lopez bull****. bottom line is, get this album. i highly recommend adding it to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good.","review":"Usually, when someone goes from movies to music, it ends up being, to quote Seth from The OC, \\"self-indulgent actors with instruments\\". Listen to the stuff Russell Crowe and Keanu Reeves have done, and you'll likely agree that they should stick to the big screen. But, Jared Leto (and his brother Shannon) end up being a major exception.This is a really cool band, sort of proggy indie rock, with great musicians, and a cool unique sound. Jared has a pretty good voice, and Shannon is an awesome drummer.So, if you're the type who has reservations about listening to actors playing in bands, definitely shed those here, because these guys are really good. I started with this album, so I'll have to check out the first one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Lie...continues to stray from todays force fed rock","review":"The new album takes on new direction, but continues to rock and stray from the same force fed main-stream rock. It's full of frEsh traCks witH familiar undErtones. These guys stilL rOck aNd provide an album full of something completely different. Songs that get you moving and songs to bare your soul. 5 Stars, another great album.Attack, The Fantasy, Battle of one, and The story rank at the top of my list. Catch them live, and become a fan for life. The energy of this band on stage and off continues to fuel the desire for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hate them because he's pretty","review":"I'll be the first to admit that when I heard that pretty boy from My So-Called Life put a band together, put on some eyeliner, and recorded a couple of albums I wrote it off as a Dogstar-ish (Keanu Reeves) effort. It didn't help their cause that Jared Leto is just a very pretty man. There...I said it. Jealousy? Maybe but it'd be like Angelina Jolie becoming a jazz singer. Again, I was wrong. I was completely wrong. These guys kick some serious butt. The music is tight, fast, and hard. The lyrics are fluid, catchy, and just deep enough to rise about the mainstream. If you want to hear some good musicians just tear it up. This is a solid buy. Their really isn't a weak song. It's a tight album."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's wrong with you people?","review":"If you can actually explain to me how this band's sound has grown or matured, rather than simply saying that it has, I'd be amazed. Because the sad fact is this music is much more simple, and much less interesting. They've shown no growth whatsoever, quite the opposite. So, I'm not really sure what makes most of these reviewers think this album is better or even as good as the first. Take the first album; remove all the music but the guitar,bass, and drums; cut back the track lengths; dumb down the melodies; and change the lyrics to the same vague emotional crap other bands like Staind have been doing for years; and then you'll have some idea what this new album sounds like. It doesn't really sound like the Used though, which for some reason a lot of negative reviews have said. It just sounds like really boring, generic rock music, the same kind you can find from a myriad of other bands. This definitely does not have the somewhat unique sound of their first release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Terrible, but Far From Good Enough","review":"Sorry, but the band took a couple big steps backwards after a really excellent 1st album.There is nothing to say is great here, so sadly they fell far short of their own standard of greatness. I agree with the reviewers who say it is hard to tell this is the same band. Kind of highschoolish, both in content and in production values.Maybe it was the great producer on the 1st album that made it happen so well, as Leto is so proud to say that their new guy is a peer in age - implying that the producer of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" is not really their style or up to their new and improved standard. I start to suspect that maybe it was not the band, but the producer who was the real artist?Hats off to the 1st album, really a landmark work of the decade. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was extremely excited when I found out 30STM was coming out with a new cd. I heard Attack and was like \\"ok they tried something new with this one, I like it\\". Well unfortunately, this song and The Kill are the only songs I liked. The others just didn't do anything for me. The spacey feel like on songs like \\"Echelon\\" and \\"93 Million Miles\\" from the previous album are completely gone, the lyrics are typical mainstream stuff and being a drummer, I was disappointed that the drums were a lot less interesting cool. I was let down by this one, hopefully 30STM can redeem themselves on the next CD and if not, at least we still have the first album to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad music","review":"I was a little disturbed about the reviews here stating that there was a problem with the copy protection on this CD since I like to compile my own CDs, but after listening to this crap I don't care one bit about the copy protection. Just not music I want to listen to a second time. Paid a whole 75 cents for it at a yard sale, and I feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copyright protected CD","review":"I checked this album out from my local library to see if it was worth buying. I found out rather quickly that this not an ordinary audio CD but a copy protected album. It will not play or copy. This being said I will not be buying this album. Don't buy this album or you'll be throwing your money down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"This is the best album I've ever heard. Great follow up from their first album. They've taken almost prefect rock and improved significantly. Great sound from both guitar's and the drumming couldnt be better. This is some pretty great stuff here. The best songs are \\"The Kill,\\" \\"From Yesterday,\\" and \\"Modern Myth (a sweet acoustic one)\\" I strongly urge everyone to buy this. They will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protected CD - DO NOT BUY","review":"Consumers should know that this CD is a DRM protected CD and will not be able to be read in most computer CD-ROM drives along with certain regular audio CD players. I recently purchased this CD only to find out that I could only use it in the car and an old CD player I happened to still have.Like most people I usually rip my CD's to MP3s and do the majority of listening either at my computer or on the go with my MP3 player. This isn't even a remote possibility. Do not support companies and bands that restrict consumer's rights!This is a Virgin Records CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Jared Leto just lets his voice rip in this one!!! Just as great as the first album, which was so unique for its spacey kind of chords in the backgrounds but totally dominated with some of the greatest guitar strings!!!! An instant classic, with awesome lyrics, guitars and finally letting lead singer Jared Leto truely shine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth a listen","review":"30 Seconds to Mars' latest release, A Beautiful Lie is everything I like about rock. Jared Leto has an awesome voice, the songs are melodic but still have an edge, and the lyrics are powerful as well. The reviewer before me is obviously trying to be the hipster whose opinion differs from everybody else or either we aren't listening to the same album.The opener, Attack, packs a huge punch and it is no wonder why it was chosen as a single. It is an amazing song. After that there are several standouts like A Beautiful Lie, The Fantasy, The Kill, R-evolve and Battle of One. But honstly I cannot think of one song I skip, because overall every track is solid. Not every track is great, but still solid. Anyway I don't know what else I could say but give it a listen for yourself and buy it if you like it. Any rock fan should give this 1 try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than average rock band with an industrial slant","review":"This is the second release by actor Jared Leto's band, and unlike other bands that include a popular actor this is a real band (Dogstar I'm looking at you). 30 Seconds To Mars is a better than average rock band with an industrial slant. However, the lyrics seem a bit trite and the music is a bit too clean for the look and style they're trying. My favorite song on the disc is \\"The Fantasy\\", which is nicely done and a step above the other tunes. I think this is better than a majority of the crap that gets released out there and since it features an actor I really like, I give it a few bonus points.-- The ChickenFish Speaks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't save me, don't save me, cuz I don't care....","review":"A Beautiful Lie by 30 Seconds to Mars is quite the impressive record; it fuses alot of things from other rock influences while being able to maintain their own identity.Notable Tracks:- A Beautiful Lie- Was it A Dream- Savior- R-evolve- The Kill"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite CD Ever","review":"I know what you all are thinking, how can it be the best cd ever? Well it is. The sound has evolved drastically since the first cd and all for the better. The new emotion that vocalist Jared Leto has put in the songs is almost heartbreaking to listen to. If you don't believe me listen to #3 The Kill, when he says \\"Look in my eyes, You're killing me, killing me.\\" Don't tell me that you can't feel what he is trying to get across. Incredible drums come through once again through his brother Shannon and the two other members Tomo and Matt contribute just as much to the overall sound of the music. If you have never heard the band before but aren't sure if you want to buy the cd go over to the website. There you can listen to 3 of the songs and even watch the new video for the opening track Attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't play","review":"Like so many other customers, I've found this CD will not play on my computer, even though I have a brand-new Gateway running Windows XP and the newest version of Windows Media Player.This is atrocious.

Don't make the same mistake I did.:-(f*** copy protectionpeace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Lie (30STM)","review":"After receiving the initial order, there was a problem with one of the tracks. I contacted Amazon customer service and was quickly told a replacement would be sent. Which was also defective. They notified me that the problem was wide spread and once I sent both back, I had no problems getting my refund. I can honestly say they have given me excellent and quick customer service. I plan to continue to shop at [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...but not that good.","review":"Obviously when a band releases their sophmore album people immediately compare it to the first one. I will do that in a minute. In situations like these, I try and hear the new album as independant so I don't develop a biased opinion. This album is good, but it is nothing too special. It has a hint of progressive rock that is overshadowed more by its \\"mainstreamish\\" pop sound; WHEREAS the first album had a more futuristic, original sound. I honestly liked the band better on that album, even though it wasn't really a \\"band\\" persay. This album just lacks the originality I like to hear and has been robbed of the credibility on the s/t release. I'd say it is above Fall Out Boy, but way below Tool on terms of originality. And I am in no way literally comparing these bands so I don't want to hear anyone bitching, but 30STM would be closer to Fall Out Boy on the spectrum than Tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"I should have listened to all the song samples before buying this CD! This groups style needs alot of work, between the wimpery-whinney serinading and heavy metal screaching my head hurts.

I've even heard some fans accuse the band of \\"selling out\\", believe it or not. That just is not true.Sure, the new album may sound a little different. It sounds a bit more real, it is not as synthesized as the last album. And it is fantastic! \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" has proven that you can explore and try new approaches without losing who you are as a band. Furthermore, this band has once again proven that good music does not come pre-packaged. Just because a sound is popular on the radio does not mean its good. 30 Seconds To Mars has proven that you can be who you are, you can be unique and have a unique sound, and still make great music. I highly recommend this album and this band to anyone who is sick of the same old cliched rock songs on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD hasn't left my player in a month","review":"In spring of 2009 this music is still being played on the radio on almost a daily basis. The CD hasn't left my player in a month. I usually buy a CD and only like the one song I hear on the radio. With a little luck, I might like one or two others. Rarely do I enjoy an entire CD. This is one of the few. While I still love The Kill and From Yesterday, Attack and A Modern Myth are also favorites. Although tomorrow, Savior or Revolve could be the ones I listen to all the way to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"I am so glad i bought this product the price was a bargain and I dont live in the US and shipping was quick and easy.

I had never heard 30 seconds until a few weeks ago, with the single \\"ill attack\\" on a popular radio station. And from there this music just grew on me. I purchased the album a few days later. Perhaps they will not get the recongnition they deserve because of the particular sound they do have but Jared Letto has a outstanding voice and his lyrics, melodies, the chourus', the verses..everything is great. Although the album tones down after the initial song ill attack and i dont appreciate the bonus tracks too much either..but you cant complain. Great second effort! and looking foward towards the third! ..about the content protection, i didnt have a problem copying the songs to my computer at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 Seconds to Disappointment","review":"Listening to the first song for a few moments, I already knew that this album was not going to be like their first. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" has a few good moments, but most of it isn't as explosive or captivating as their first. There is a lot of screaming, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of feeling behind it. The songs are pretty slow-paced.What this album seems to be is a failed attempt at recreating the power and sound of the self-titled album, only adding more feelings and emotions (notice the roses all over the album art?).The CD doesn't seem to work with Windows Media Player on my computer. Also, the copy protection allows you to copy or burn the album a maximum of three times, apparantly.This album is largely boring and nothing special. I hate to say it. The bonus tracks, however, are pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am finally free ....","review":"Continuing to deliver music and lyrics that are both poetic and powerful.

Wish I could listen to it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out there and above","review":"This second release is a bit more commercial than the self titled debut but it is still great. Memorable hooks, emotive lyrics, and just enough of a progressive vibe to keep things interesting.

Their overall package is presented well and the musical vision is well executed.Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD.","review":"I purchased this CD because I liked \\"The Kill (Bury me)\\", but I really like the whole CD now that I have listened to it.

It's very likely that you will not be able to get this onto your iPod or other player. If you're like me, that makes this disc (remember, it's not a CD) useless since I don't even own a normal CD player. Don't give these guys any of your hard-earned money. Find another way to hear this music or find an artist that actually cares about their fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, Unique and Beautiful","review":"I just got the album and I have to say the album is nothing but perfection on the scale of rock. The emotional vocals of Jared Leto has a range of unbelievable quality; \\"From Yesterday\\" is quiet powerful.Jared Leto has edge and sings with emotion. I emphasize on the emotion because that is one word that really can only describe this album. The combo of rock and some background keyboard action is fitting. This is what rock should be meant to sound. To endure the soul and free the fury from within. Never should it sound the same at all and it doesn't on this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock CD, Unique sound","review":"Some people classify 30STM as a space metal or space rock band. At least people recongnize that their sound is different than mainstream modern rock. Leto gets a bad rap being an actor/musician (see Russel Crowe), but he pulls both off very well. I went to a recent 30STM concert and they sound awesome in concert and pretty close to how they sound on the CD, but you really appreciate how good Leto's brother is as a drummer in concert.As for the CD, I can't count the number of times I have listened to it and everytime I enjoy it. The radio songs: The Kill, Attack are very good and are very catchy in a good way...not a teeny-bopper way. I would rate the best songs on the CD as The Kill, Yesterday, The Fantasy. The bonus tracks are ok, but seemed kinda just thrown on there without linkage to the mood of the other ones. I will definitely be buying their next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Play","review":"This CD is copy protected, and won't play in any of my CD players, nor my DVD player.

The problem is the small amount of surface area in contact with the edge being sharpend. This allows for gouging to occur even with the slightest pressure. I ruined two pairs of scissors and had to spend an hour with my honing stones to repair the edge on my pruner.Corona should be ashamed to place their name on this tool.

A very tough read but worth the effort. I had not understood the entire theory of co-evolution developed by Stewart Brand and represented in the Co-Evolution Quarterly and The Whole Earth until I read this book. Kevin introduces the concept of the \\"hive mind\\", addresses how biological systems handle complexity, moves over into industrial ecology and network economics, and concludes with many inspiring reflections on the convergence of biological and technical systems. He was easily a decade if not two ahead of his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Informative","review":"My favorite reading from my humanities class.

In fact, I lost my enthusiasm as early as the few few pages when I discoverd that the author was fond of head hopping. Furthermore, the predictable plot, and characters that were much too tame(or just underdeveloped), made it impossible for me to enjoy this book. Lord Forestale especially, acted more like a green 19 year old than the grown man he was meant to be, and absolutly nothing like a man sharp enough to be entrusted with couriering important documents for the country at wartime.Sorry to say, i will be giving Barbara Allister's books a miss in the future.Oh, and also, the blurb on the back cover of the book is totally misleading. Deveraux could in no way be refered to as a man with \\"an iron will and molten temper\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Closer to what he once was","review":"In Hey Nostrodomus, Coupland gets back to what he did so well in his earlier books, peeling back the layers of familiar people. revealing fears and emotions that we all carry, the little hidden Things that drive us that go unknown to most.More importantly he spends time creating real charactors rather than fantastic plot twists or impossible set ups. This one gets pretty close to telling about real people. People we never get the full story on, people that we pass by shaking our heads. While he hasn't returned to the greatness of Microserfs or Life After God, he's much more on track than than All Families are Psychotic and Miss Wyoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful reflection on human reactions and values.","review":"This book is a beautiful modern-day opera; I have never read an author who so accurately describes North American, English speaking culture better than Douglas Coupland. Hey Nostradamus! has a way of jumping out at you, like a beautifullypositive line in a negative stanza, or a flower on a block of obsidian. The Biblical connection at the end stands out beautifully:\\"Awake! Everyone listen, there has been a miracle - my son who once waas dead is now alive. Rejoice! All of you! Rejoice! You must! My son is coming home!\\"It forces nothing. It's as if everything Coupland has to say were a round peg poised above a round hole, and he had simply to push it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrestling with spirituality","review":"Just finished the book. I've read everything he's ever written. The last few have seemed to struggle..He's such an effective story teller. I love the situations he creates, but he always falls apart somewhere around the end. I was riveted to this book. Hooked from page one. By the end of the third section I was angry, cause I knew he'd drop off again...On the inside cover of the book it describes this as people 'Wrestling with their spirituality'. He should figure out his spirituality before it ruins his career as a writer. Too much on the God thing. If your a Coupland fan, you may want to reconsider rushing out and buying this, simply because it has his name on it. Hey Doug!

It went on and on and on and on and didn't really have much of a point except to say that mass killing of teenagers ruins a lot of lives which isn't exactly a big epiphany though. I found Cheryl to be a big phony, Jason was depressed yet extremely self-centred, and Heather was just a very insecure person who needed intensive therapy to help her see that she deserved to be treated well and shouldn't stay with people who can't possibly meet her needs.THis was just a book about a bunch of messed up people who continue to mess up their lives and then mess up the lives of everyone around them.It had tragic overtones, obviously, just mostly I thought it was just pathetic.I did NOT like it! Coupland could write better than this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"I read this book with no expectations. What a pleasant surprise it was. It is very stylized and descriptive. The author uses metaphors and humorous observations to express God's most important (and forgotten) messages. It is rare to read a book these days with characters that are more unique than what I see in any summer blockbuster movie. Caring for the dead makes the effort to be better than that--and it succeeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and compelling, like motor oil and gum all over you","review":"Thomas Glynn is a master of the perversely mundane. \\"Watching...\\" tells the haunting story an extraordinarily grotesque father's life by a son narrating the decline and decay and simultaneous liberation it in it's ultimate baseness and simplicity. Because you know, sometimes nothing illumintaes perversion more than normality. There is nothing like candor to make us wish we never knew intimacy and in \\"Watching The Body Burn\\" there are many such regrets. When I run the world, this book will be required reading for all writers as he is simply one of the most compelling prose stylest outside of Kate Braverman I have ever read. I wish he was my mom and told me stories at night but I would probably grow up so totally twisted I would appear normal again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I surprised myself by finishing reading the book","review":"This was not an enjoyable read, apart from the first hundred or so pages which provided an interesting perspective on England during the industrial revolution. Apart from that it is a painful history (how accurate I do not know) of the Mormon church and contains disturbing perspectives on its founders. To me this book really inspired a negative view of the Mormons, Joe Smith, Brigham Young & Co and of their bigamy/polygamy. Whether this was the intention of our LDS author I do not know.In short, don't bother reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Not an uplifting book!","review":"I found Saints to be a poor sampling of LDS fiction. The first half of the book tells the story how Dinah Kirkman grew up in England and is VERY depressing. I continued to read the book with the hope that it would get better. It didn't! The story continues with Dinah's polygamous marriage to Joseph Smith then latter to Brigham Young. The story takes a very harsh view of Emma Smith. The intimate relationships were too graphically described.

If it looks like she's not in the mood for book time, all I have to do is get this book out and she will instantly calm down and sit still for every single page. She loves mimicing the pictures: smearing finger paints, giving hugs, pat-a-cake, peek-a-boo, and waving hello and goodbye.

Then, they just crumble away into short, mostly ambiguous, commentaries. If you aren't familiar with Krishnamurti's terminology & philosophy, these commentaries can be very confusing. If you are familiar with him, you'd probably agree that they flat-out aren't very good for the most part.

I never would have thought it was going to be this much fun to watch. Yes, there were scenes over the top, but look around at todays movies.

Some of the new characters suffered in their roles as they are not anywhere as good as the original A-team series actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the B-Team","review":"As an action movie this was entertaining, but the only similarity it had to what made the orginal A-Team great was the fact that there are 3 white guys and 1 black guy.

I enjoyed the movie once I stopped comparing it to the original TV series. Yes the characters have the same name and similar personality traits, however from there the similarities end.

Silly implies lacking good sense, foolish, stupid, absurd, and ridiculous. It is none of these things, but it approaches their border. The team is led by a cigar smoking colonel who focuses on the end goal of every mission. The team members are \\"Face,\\" who is handsome and attracts women like flies on honey; a bear-like man who can be quite fierce, but is afraid of heights; and Murdock who is at least a little crazy and has been institutionalized at least twice in the film for his craziness. The four are duped into participating in a heist to rescue counterfeit money plates and are arrested. They escape in a dramatic manner and uncover the plot. There is much action in this film and much humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont watch","review":"hate amazon for tricking you this is not the movie why would you want to watch clips of the making...etc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, escapist, entertaining, and fun movie.","review":"I used to watch the \\"A-Team\\" as a kid, and I was very happy at this adaptation.

There is a minimal plot in this movie of double or triple cross among the villains and the A-Team got dragged into it.

Each team member gets a bit of character development, but blink and you might miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was a complete waste of time.

The main cast is poorly portrayed and Mr. YT doesn't star as Bosco,the comedy is very few, the action scenes are choppy because of bad camera shifting and the acting is bad. Despite these issues, the action is cool, but not really worth checking out. Watch the original t.v.. show if u wanna see the real A-Team, not this boring waste of time. 5/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without comparison, a fun movie to watch","review":"This movie had a lot of fun stunts and action shots. The comedy bits add to the package of the movie - I enjoyed the humor. Explosions and non-stop shooting were really cool. The movie actually had a plot that was quite interesting for me. Each character carried their personalities well.I've seen the A-Team TV series many times, but was too young to be able to compare it to this movie. You don't need to know much about the TV show series to enjoy a 'fun' movie. Plan to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother.","review":"This is such a predictable and boring movie that not even my husband, which was very much into the A-team, wanted to finish watching.Don't loose your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fake to be good.","review":"I didn't even make it to the end of this flick. Glad I rented it on sale for .99 cents. There were some funny scenes, but movies like this which are filled with impossible CGI acrobatics and stunts don't appeal to me in the least. I don't know why Hollywood keeps pumping out movies like that, because in my opinion, it completely detracts from the overall film."},{"rating":"2","title":"VANESSA BELL ARMSTRONG'S VOICE IS SIMPLY WICKED","review":"I'VE BEEN BLESSED.

I already easily identified with the Rod Steiger character, though I was a very slick and handsome kid. Hardly an old \\"troll\\" like the sergeant. Other films came out around that time like \\"The Boys In The Band.\\" I usually saw these films on dates and would hear my girlfriend's squirming utterances over certain scenes. Bottom line was, that none of these films back the \\"dark ages\\" of the 50s & 60s, painted a very pleasant picture of homosexuality. It was an uphill and very difficult path and acceptance of myself. Not a choice. No friggn' way! Today's gay kids are totally spoiled rotten. I was a bit too young for \\"Stonewall\\" in NYC, but our generation did all the hard work. Many of us died of AIDS. Kids today are very fortunate. Yeah...I think this movie is a classic and should be seen by those who know little of those difficult years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I can't believe it! How could anybody so untalented have a record contract? I am outraged that a group as pitiful as this would be permitted to sing some of the greatest jazz standards of all time. It's a complete butchery that, to anyone new to jazz, only gives it a bad name. Kenny G and Chuck Mangeione have been long-time members of this list, and now Vox One can be added as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album!","review":"I just purchased this CD and I am already in love with it. Each time I listen to it, I like it even more. The harmonies that this group sings are incredible, especially in the CD's haunting finale, Round Midnight. This CD is a great mix of songs. However, I must admit that Vox One is much stronger on ballads than anywhere else. However, I think that this CD would make an excellent addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"Vox One was clearly one of the greats and this, their best album, is comparable only to Real Group'sUnreal!for technical perfection, great arranging, style, panache, and probably ahead in jazz \\"feel\\" -- Gary Burton was a huge fan, and he knows a few things about it. Based on \\"a customer's\\" comment, we obviously need more vocal jazz fans here.

It did save my computer after a power surge outside, but it fried the unit and created burn marks on my hardwood floor. I was home when it happened. It made a loud zapping noise and the entire upstairs smelled like an electrical fire. I would never buy this product. My electrician asked me how much I paid for the surge protector...he said it looked so cheap, so we are looking into getting a whole house surge protector for about $90.00 for the part and about 2 hours of labor....worth it.

It's about a girl named Lulu who lives with her grandmother and she loves her father since her mother died when she was little. Lulu wants a pony. One day she finds a pony named Snow White caught in barb wire and 2 other friends Pam and Anna which have ponies too. Acorn and Lightning. The 3 of them become pony pals.

With the help of her Pony Pals, Lucinda sets out to save the pony and find it a home.

It isn't just the sex scene that was edited out, but a total of about 20 minutes. The movie makes more sense in the RC version, and the sex scene, though dark and in Andie's case a bit airbrushed, is worth seeing, especially if you are a Viggo Mortensen fan. I don't think it was the nudity Andie objected to, though, or not entirely. The scene ends in an act of contempt that would sting any woman. It effectively lets you know what the man's character is really thinking, but it's brutal in a subtle way. There is also, of course, the (apparent) age difference between the two characters. He looks about 10 years younger than she does, even with a beard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally awful!1","review":"This film had great potential; however, watching Andie McDowell \\"act\\" was so painful, my teeth ached. Her dead-slow presence and stiff dialogue served as a perfect foil for Liam Neeson, who redeemed the film with his natural talent.

The entire volume is really summed up in one sentence: Life at Bell Labs was like academia until after the divestiture, and then no one at either Bell Labs, AT&T, the RBOCs, or Lucent really knew how to harness its energy.

Most of the people interviewed talk about their faith as if its only purpose is to make them feel warm and tingly instead of how their faith shapes their relationship with a living God and the people around them that most religions tell us we are called to serve and love.

I can't say enough about the intelligent, multi-dimensional writing. Good amount of extras though I would have liked a few more. The commentary was fun to listen to. I have to say that I'd probably never let anyone borrow my Deadwood DVDs. I was able to get all 3 seasons for a little over $100. A fantastic deal for a fantastic show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deadwood season 2","review":"I got this for my husband as a gift & he's gotten me hooked on the show now! The one draw back about this show is the language. Every few words is a cuss word & really isn't necessary to get their point across. However, the show is interesting about life in the west. Very adult content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show on Television - Ever","review":"Although The Wire comes in at an extremely close second, I will always stand by Deadwood as the best show ever on television. Absolutely brilliant writing and stunning acting. Not a light show - at all - but the beauty of the craft soars. Started with Season 1 again when I was in bed with the flu. Well into Season 2 now and loving it. Not for the faint of heart, but so worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swearengen sure was named appropriately","review":"A good movie if one could get past hogs used as remains disposal centers, whores and graphic examples of their activities, together with the overuse of expletives.

I use these for everything, from scaping bowls, to making scrambled eggs, to stiring my cream of wheat and oatmeal in my non-stick pots.

Subsequently he escapes and most of the remainder is about his chandestine travels through Napoleonic France. For an action novel of this kind (1800s sailing), characters are adequately developed and the action and suspense are adequate.

This is a collection of organ grinder tunes that could affect the doshas in some way only by chance. It is a pop, commercial exploitation that has absolutely no real foundation in Ayurveda. Nevertheless, if you like wandering, dinky tunes that have no sense, Eastern or Western, this may be for you. Sort of a cosmic happy face. If you are looking for something legitimate, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can we add a star? People, this CD ROCKS!!!","review":"The previous release, \\"The Message\\" is the first one I'd heard, but this one has so much going on, it's amazing! There are elements of old school rock n' rollers, like the Beatles, U2, Doobie Brothers, Chicago, Traveling Wilburys, even felt a little Marvin Gaye on some of these. It hits all the right spots--musically, stylistically, lyrically and spiritually. The encouraging, scripturally sound words sung on the ballads, the 'jumps,' the 'rockers' [Kirk Sullivan's lead 'Who's at the Wheel' just plain ROCKS!!], demonstrate again that Mark Harris is an incredible songwriter. The title track, \\"Signs and Wonders\\"--a bouncy little number, \\"Mystery of Grace\\"--a great lead by Andy Chrisman, and the Beatle-esque \\"The Hand of God,\\" quickly became favorites, but there's nothing but good stuff here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one from 4 Him.","review":"Just like the other albums that they have released, this one displays a variety of awesome voices and musical talent.

A lot of people have said that they like the track Lochness the least, but to tell you the truth, that's the one that I like best, and I can't really stand the track \\"Judas Rising\\". Many reviewers have said that's their favorite track, but it's just a stupid sounding song. If Priest is just going to put out stuff like this again and again, I think I'm going to stop listening to their stuff, and stick with groups like Iced Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous comeback!","review":"Angel of Retribution starts off in classic Priest fashion, with a quiet (but anticipatory) buildup to one of the heaviest songs of the album, \\"Judas Rising.\\" Shades of their 80s heyday are here, but the darker work of their 70s albums is more present, with atmospheric, fluid anthemic ballads such as \\"Angel\\" and \\"Lochness,\\" right alongside rockers such as \\"Hellrider\\" and \\"Wheels of Fire.\\" While Rob Halford's experiments with Fight and Two (and even his Halford project) were actually quite enjoyable, it's nice to have Judas Priest back together again, amazingly on a major label. By the way, Halford's frightening wail from past albums is almost nonexistent here, so in that way the difference between the new and the old Halford-helmed Priest is the most noticable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Metal Renaissance is here!!!","review":"Judas Priest is back with a vengeance! This album picks up where \\"Painkiller\\" left off. There's plenty of killer tunes here. While there's a couple of songs that didn't knock me out on the first listen, the more I hear 'em, the more I like 'em! I thought real metal had died long ago, but now that groups like Maiden, Dio, Exodus, & now Priest have returned to their old school glory, I can raise the metal flag high once again! Heavy metal lives!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. Easily the best since Screaming for V (1982!!!)","review":"One of the best metal albums of all time based on consistency, musicianship and sound. I recognize JP as the best heavy metal band of all time, though I DO NOT buy everything they put out (i.e. Turbo through Ripper's stuff, though Painkiller had 2 or 3 great tracks). When I listen to all the old Priest classics, which are real classic albums, I tend to skip a song or two, especially some of the ballads. No skipping on this my friend and not just because it is new. Halford sounds amazing, even on the stripped down vocal parts - Amazing like 25 years ago. Glen and KK play some of their best leads ever, and Scott Travis (aka Big Man) - is he not one of the best rock drummers ever?"},{"rating":"2","title":"F**k Yeah!! The Priest are BACK!!!","review":"They are back!!! This is Halford's best effort since Defenders. Every song is solid with the best vocals and guitar playing yet. Never have I heard such a complete Priest album (and I have them all in either CD or cassette). If it came after Screaming for Vengeance, nobody would have minded much. Other than Loch Ness almost a complete concept album for them. In fact they rip themselves off and it sounds awsome!! Only the Priest. Everytime I play this album it gets better and better. Defenders it good (Defenders, Spread Eagle, Love Bites (best ever never live)) but it is not even as complete as this or Screamin'. Must buy for a diehard Priest/Halford fan (loved Fight's first one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back and still rockin'","review":"I'll make this brief. BUY THIS CD!! If you ever liked any Judas Priest in the past- you will love this CD. The sound on this is very much like their old sound, and thats very good news. With Rob back in the band there is no reason for them to try and sound like anything other than \\"classic\\" Priest. They bring it together with great songs and hard hitting production. The guitars are fat and blazing and Rob's vocals are better than ever. I would give it a five except for the last cut on the album \\"Lochness\\" - it's just dumb. (Spinal Tap was reportedly based to an extent on Judas Priest. This is the Judas Priest version of \\"Stonehenge\\".) The DVD is excellent and has a number of great live performances from the 2004 tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"judas is back!","review":"this is one of the best judas priest cd's.i have not tried the dvd side of the disk yet,but this is deffinatly an awesome cd.dont think about buying this cd...just do it and you wont regret it.p.s judas is rising!!!(best and heavyist song on cd)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Heavy Metal (British -Style)","review":"Judas Priest does not disappoint on this new album. Don't let their age fool you, they just get better and better. \\"Demonizer\\", \\"Judas is Rising\\" showcase the spirit of Judas Priest. Mellow-er tracks such as \\"Worth Fighting for\\" and \\"Angel\\" might be slower but they are no less powerful. The rest of the album is A+.The real selling point of this album is this: producer ROY Z. Anyone who is a fan of Halford (solo project) or solo Bruce Dickenson will know what I'm talking about!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legat Discovered The Hidden Power of AOR","review":"To discover the great harmony in AOR, one should listen to it tens of times. Then the album slowly shows its hidden power, coming from the deep. One should be patient enough to reach this power of this new album. Then be sure, you will get the prize..."},{"rating":"2","title":"genius","review":"This is the best album Priest has put out yet. It lacks nothing that Painkiller had. The riffs are still there musically. Hellrider is the best track on the album. Just listen to it, it speaks for itself. Great riffs and leads throughout, especially closer to the end. The lyrics are meaningful in a few of the songs and the rest are just classic Priest. Some might call them \\"cheesy\\" but they clearly haven't listen to any older albums or they'd know they've always been like that. Just deal with it, that's what Priest does. Either way my favorite album for 2005 by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not worth your money","review":"This Album was not at all up to the standard of Judas Priest. I enjoyed many of their albums such as Painkillers, British Steel, Point of Entry and etc. This album is not any good. There are 3 decent songs on here:Demonizer,Hellrider,Lochness .Download those songs then move on. I am pretty sure I'll get negative feedbacks for this, but come on here people, Are you even listening to this before reviewing it? If you wanted a good Painkillers sounding album, pick up Halfords Resurection.Judas Priest is dead, like Black Sabbath. Stuck in a endless rut of trying to make everyone in their fanbase happy. Because of this, the music is souless. Take a lesson from Iron Maiden, boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE DUAL DISC VERSION!!!!!!!!","review":"Absolutely DO NOT buy the crappy dual disc version of this CD. It probably won't play in your CD Player.Just because companies come out with new technology does not mean that the new technology works right.Why pay $14 or $15 bucks for a CD that won't even play in your CD Player at all?!CD quality wise = Waste of money. It won't play in your CD Player.Music wise = Not bad, but no \\"Painkiller\\" CD. More like a 2000's version of the \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" CD. It is not an essential PRIEST CD. Get the \\"Painkiller\\" CD instead. Either that or the \\"Jugallor\\" and \\"Unleashed from the East\\" CDs.On the new CD here; only 6 songs are great. 4 songs are to skip over.If you are going to get this CD, get the REGULAR version that costs a little bit more, but it is worth it, for the CD to play in your CD Player.Bottom line is: If it says Dual Disc on a new CD from any band. Don't buy it at all!! It won't play in your CD Player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"I picked up this album because I'm a fan of Priest's old material and a friend kept raving about how the new album is awesome. I'm still asking her what album she listened to. Angel of Retribution is fabulously average at best, and a sad remnant of what used to be one of the best bands in metal at worst. I have no problem with bands rehashing their old stuff, but they should at least do a good job of it.The worst part is, the songs keep getting worse as the album goes on. Deal with the Devil is the only halfway decent song on the CD, and even that gets ruined by the chorus, which is easily one of the weakest I've ever heard. By the time Lochness rolled around, I was praying for the CD to melt in my player so it would be put out of its misery.I can't even give this album away. I have tried to give it to 3 of my friends, and they have all refused after hearing it, agreeing with me that it's one of the worst things they've ever heard. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD Side Won't Play on Apple iBook","review":"Unfortunately, the CD side of the disc won't play on our Apple iBook (the newer 1.2 GHz G4 model). You can hear the optical drive thrashing about, but the drive ejects the disc after about 30 seconds of trying. The DVD side appears to work. However, another problem is that the disc seems thicker than a usual CD. You have to push hard to get it in, and the drive has trouble pushing it out. I can easily imagine it getting stuck, and I'm not planning to experiment.I don't know if this problem is specific to our machine, or to this particular disc, but I'm going to return the disc to where I bought it (not Amazon) and try to get a refund.I was looking forward to the new Priest album. Sadly, I never got to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Priest really are the Metal Gods","review":"I had almost given up on good metal becoming a reality in my lifetime (with a few rare exceptions of course) till the Priest reunited. I held my breath and hoped for at least a savory morsel from the past. That's not what I got: Judas Priest came back from the dead and kicked my arse! This is easily a collection of some of the best work of any metal band of any time...period. Judas Priest is REAL, and it shows in the music. It's classic Priest while being on the cutting edge of great metal.Any metalhead must, and I repeat must own this CD. The DVD side reaffirms why metal isn't just great music to me but a way of life; it's an attitude about life and it's being part of a family (with a few disfunctional members like all families!).Buy this CD and be prepared to raise your devil fist and be blown away.All the best, MLC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, Rob!!!!","review":"JP's Angel of Retribution makes me think that it's as if Rob never left the band; they've certainly picked up right where they left off. I don't want to regurgitate what everyone else has been saying, but I must agree that this is classic Priest all the way- the power, the energy, the glory that is classic JP is all there. I was afraid that (like so many other older rock bands that seem to be selling out to the younger crowd) there would be some signs of \\"nu metal\\" in there. But, much to my relief, they are staying true to the sound that brought them the name that they acquired for themselves more than 30 years ago- true power metal that so many bands can only hope to live up to. Burnin' all the way!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Comeback for a Great Band","review":"I was suprised at just how great Judas Priest's new album really is. Judas Priest hasn't lost the magic that made them great more than 30 years ago. I had the pleasure of seeing them live a couple m onths ago and it was like they hadn't aged one bit. Judas Rising, Revolution, and Deal With the Devil are my favorite hard songs on this album and I also really like Worth Fighting For. The DVD also has some great interviews and stuff so this set is a really good deal. If you are a new Judas Priest fan or an old one this album really lives up to the standards set by Screaming for Vengeance and Hell Bent for Leather and if you are looking for some new good metal this is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumphant!","review":"A stunning comeback, and a classic from start to finish. Fans must have never dared dream that Judas Priest would reunite to this standard. From beginning to end this is fabulously entertaining. Rob's effortless vocal dexterity maturing and mellowing with age, KK's and Glenn's guitars soaring, Ian Hill's bass commanding, and Scott Travis's brisk drumming driving everything onward. Judas Priest are musicians at the height of their powers, with songwriting of a wonderful assuredness.A fresh, warm, often energetic record that is far and away the best so far of 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on you critics!","review":"I don't know what all these critics were thinking--this is a great album and pure Priest. Let's face it: they were never the most sophisticated metal band and lived off good singing by Halford and good riffs. I think this album is actually a lot better than some of the oldies but goodies. Most tracks are well done or at the very least good sing-along tunes. I also liked the ballad (\\"Angel\\"). The long track \\"Loch Ness\\" got a little bit out of hand there (and speaking of lyrics--cheese), but nothing to really be embarrassed about. Anyway--the wait was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but not in this format","review":"Do yourself a favor and buy the digipak with the bonus dvd. I don't much care for DualDisc. The album itself is great. Priest is back in top form!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DUAL DISC IS A COMPLETE RIP-OFF","review":"While the actual Judas Priest CD, Angel of Retribution, is an absolutely fantastic blend of basic rock and heavy metal,I am completely disappointed with the Dual Disc format. The disc did not fit well into my 6-changer CD player in my car (unlike any other CD I have ever purchased). In fact the Dual Disc is too thick to fit into many CD players due to the disc containing formatting on both sides. Thus, to remove the disc from the changer, I completely scratched the CD side. At the end of the day, I have paid hard-earned money for a brand new SCRATCHED disc than I cannot play nor hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lunar Strain, you don't know what your talking about.","review":"First, the dualdisc version is pretty easy to copy, have you tried it to tell stuff like that, I was able to rip both the CD side and the DVD side, I don't know what software you use but you should upgrade them. Another thing, the DVD side is different from the DVD that you can purchase with the deluxe edition. It's not the same thing, dualdisc goal is to achieve a better sounding edition of the songs on the DVD side(here 48khz instead of 44khz for redbook CD)."},{"rating":"2","title":"original metal gods have returned","review":"If you like halford and the rest of the priest is a definate buy, cd is like the pre-ram it down cd. great music to listen to all day, i have listened to it 4 times already since got it in and also made me wanna pull out my old priest cd's to listen to. rob halford and priest are the metal gods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back Rob.","review":"Here is the long awaited release by Judas Priest with the return of singer Rob Halford.....First off ..very good disc. ...Better than PAINKILLER...the guitar work of Glenn Tipton and KK Downing are superb!.... Lyrically some songs like \\"Demonizer\\" \\"Judas Rising\\" \\"Hellrider\\" have that PAINKILLER vibe to it...Fire,Hell,Demons,Fury,...which is OK but they spoonfeed it a bit... ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION has alot of bright spots too ..lots of catchy riffs from Glenn and KK like \\"Deal with the Devil\\", the first single \\"Revolution\\" \\"Wheels Of Fire\\" \\"Worth Fighting For\\" .....it's got two ballads \\"Eulogy\\" and the beautiful \\"Angel\\" which has one of the best Glenn Tipton solo's since \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\". ....Plus there is the longest Judas Priest song ever recorded \\"Lochness\\" ...a 13 minute mammoth epic to close. .....Overall a very good Judas Priest album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I thought it was good","review":"Like their pals Iron Maiden, Judas Priest have reunited with their definitive vocalist and are in their 2nd youth so to speak. The intensity that was missing on the last two albums can be found in spades on this album. Overall, a great comeback. Now let's hope Metallica can do the same. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a waste of money.","review":"Judas Priest, the band that gave us monster tracks like \`Victim of Changes', \`The Sinner', \`Exciter', \`Beyond the Realms of Death' \`Electric Eye', \`The Sentinel', have just totally lost the plot. There isn't a single track on this record that remotely has the depth and professionalism of their earlier constructive material. It's a shame that Judas Priest have resorted to copying the mainstream grunge that's out there now. Glen Tipton seems to be copying scales from Malmsteen/Becker and together with KK 'Drowning' they seem to be knocking out crap riffs you'd expect from shoddy miss-fits like Pantera. The song construction on this album is just laughable especially the track \`Loch-ness'. Together with the dull and boring outdated 80's bondage look, Priest are nothing but a pile of outdated tedious crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap","review":"Like some of the other 1-stars reviews I agree that JP lost their Direction back in the Early 80s. JP are like Metalicca, all their earlier stuff is awesome but their most recent stuff just sucks. If you want to hear the best of this band I'd recommend 'Unleashed in the East', 'Screaming for Vengeance' and certainly some of the earlier albums like 'Sin after Sin' and Sad Wings of Destiny'. This album is like their Painkiller album in that they are trying to keep up with bands that are 30 years younger than themselves, but its just all been done before. Glen Tipton has always been a great player, but now he seems to duplicate all the young shredders ideas. I'd recommend downloading a few MP3s before parting with your cash because I am sorry JP this is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY IT USED...IF YOU MUST!","review":"I just picked up \\"Angel of Retribution\\" and \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" by fellow U.K. legends, Deep Purple. What I didn't see coming was, I felt bored by the new Priest, but really enjoyed the new Purple. Go figure. I feel like Deep Purple are growing \\"older\\" gracefully, but not Judas Priest. It sounds like they are selling out with this disc. But, if you like Deep Purple check \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" out.I guess \\"Angel of Retribution\\" needs the BONUS DVD, because it sure wouldn't be worth it on it's own.

BREAKIN' THE LAW!\\"). From what I've heard of this comeback album, they're still up to their old suckiness. Just plundering meat-head rock, hardly proficient or heavy.P.S. - If Rob Halford is as tough as he makes himself out to be, why did it take him so long to come out as a pachadermis? LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comeback","review":"The first cd to have the original priest lineup in awhile is awesome. It is pure metal. It is great to hear Rob Halford with Judas Priest again because his voice still sounds great after all these years. The songs are really great with the exception of Lochness, which is a bit too long imo. Favorites include Judas Rising, Deal With The Devil, Revolution, Worth Fighting For, Wheels Of Fire, Angel (Beautiful Ballad), and Hellrider. Highly Recommended. LONG LIVE PRIEST!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... simply amazing.","review":"The Tour for this CD was amazing just like this CD. There isnt really anything i could say that hasnt been said, and all the other reviews that break it down my song seem to be pretty accurate to how i feel. something I must mention Again is that Judas Rising shows Halford is god. I was literally Jumping up and down yelling \\"Priest IS BACK!\\" when i heard that song. Great Comeback, Fits perfectly on my shelf next to my other Priest classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Judas's best","review":"Bought this LP originally on CD. Had to listen to it 4 or 5 times. I do really liking it. I rate it as one of there best; great on vinyl. Love the song \\" Angel\\" the best; but the whole LP is excellent. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Say Metal Rules?","review":"This CD is very, very good....the DVD is worth the purchase in of itself. Surprise!!! there is a 12 minute epic as the last track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priest return in fine form","review":"It's great to see that Halford has reunited with the band, and releasing what is easily their best work in twenty years. Other than 'Revolution' being the weak point on the album, the rest of the tracks simply rock. Listening to many of the songs, a longtime Priest fan cannot help but feel as if they've returned to their old stomping grounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT Play in standard CD player","review":"Item description stated that this 2-sided DVD/CD would be able to be played in a standard CD player.IT DID NOT !"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"The first thing wrong with this album is not that they are all long past their prime and writing stale music, it is the atrocious digitized guitar sound. For one it makes the speakers crackle and two it sounds way too fake and processed. My theory is that this really obnoxious guitar sound is there to distract you from the inevitable realization that this is an uninspired and dull affair. There were times during a couple songs where I felt that magic coming together but in the end all I wanted to do was wash the taste of this out of my mouth with some Hell Bent Leather. This isn't really that different from what Halford has been doing on his solo albums either, which are far superior. And by the way, \\"Lochness\\" has one of the worst sounding putrid intros ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the same rebels, Still Going Forward.","review":"This is an album best appreciated by the career-long Judas priest fans. Their entire musical career, including the solo years, is presented here. Having done all that, this is who they are now (okay, two years ago, I am a little late). Heavier both musically and physically, they are still the same old rebels, the hell rider who fought the battle for us. They have reunited, not in order to recapture the glory of old days, but to keep pushing forward. And yes, they are the Loch Ness Monster whose glory in its entirety no one has ever seen.Great statement of who they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully disappointing","review":"Very slowish in most parts, uninspired lyrics, and quite Ozzfest friendly (obviously to appeal to the new generation \\"metalheads\\" that waltz around town sporting AC/DC shirts they bought at Target). More in the same vein as the Ripper albums, which were very forgettable. Looks like Painkiller was truly the last of the finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe they should have chosen another producer....","review":"Maybe they should have chosen another producer..., maybe Andy Sneap, I don't know... The way it is, with Roy Z producing, the album seems more like a Halford solo project.There is absolutely nothing amazing about this album. It's not the masterpiece that hungry fans keep talking about. Anyway, it's a strong album, considering the extreme quality of everyone involved here. But it is one of the CD's that, without noticing, you will find that more and more time will pass before you listen to it again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst CD ever","review":"A long time since this album has come out, I decided to remove the dust and cobwebs and give it a second chance. I have to be TOTALLY honest...this is the same atrocity I skipped through the first and last time. Most of the songs are mindless chug...not even worth writing a track-by-track interview about. Absolutely NO creativity seeing as MOST of the songs are in the same key as well, not to mention a 5 year old could pick out where the chord progressions are going off the cuff. My biggest disappointment, however, is the modern mastering done to the songs. Something about all recordings from the 60's to early 90's that just has a complete feel to them is missing, and leaves the CD sounding empty.I'd have to say \\"Angel\\" is the only song worth listening to, bringing me back to \\"Before the Dawn\\" times.Overall, I give this CD a \\"2 Girls 1 Cup\\" rating....disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"gets old fast","review":"this CD from priest sounded pretty good on the first few listens, but after a few weeks of hearing these songs i noticed how fast these songs get old.

I would recommended this highly for anyone interested in Freemasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute best Freemason resource available","review":"This is perhaps the best resourse out there on the craft. This book goes into great detail about the past, present, and future of Freemasonry, and gives an excellent primer on the goings on with the Fraternity.In a way that is respectful to the customs and secrets of Freemasonry it gives the uniniated a glimpse into what Freemasonry is all about, but does it in a way that even those who are members will find enlightening and entertaining. I myself learned a lot and was inspired by some of the stories Brother Hodapp tells in it, most notably why he decided to join the Craft.A great book for those who are new to Freemasonry, are old to it, or just want to figure out what the heck we do, this is a must read for any Masonic library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masonic Essential","review":"As opposed to most masonic books, Hodapp's introduction to Masonry is written clearly and with a fair amount of humor. It provides the essential information about the history, values and symbols of Freemasonry without the mumbo-jumbo that so often makes Masonic literature abstruse and unclear. As well, Hodapp's book covers the controversies surrounding Freemasonry and its opponents.Don't be put off by the Dummies series imprint. This is essential reading for Masons, those interested in becoming Masons, spouses of Masons--who are always a little bit unsure about what their partners do in the Lodge--and people simply interested in demystifying Freemasonry.Hodapp's book is quite American Freemasonry oriented, but don't let that put you off. The information he covers is valuable for all. I am recommending this book to the members of my Craft lodge, which is in Brazil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great firsthand account of Freemasonry","review":"I checked this book out because I'm interested in becoming a Mason, and I thought the book was great for my purposes! Freemasons for Dummies gives a thorough explanation on many topics relevant to considering becoming a Mason and I really enjoyed the retelling of historical events with an emphasis on its impact to Freemasons. I think this book is perfect for any of the people Hodapp identifies as his primary audience: those interested in becoming a Mason, those with friends or family who are Masons, or those who just want to learn more about the craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Masonry Book!","review":"This is a well written book for the rookie Mason or those who are just plain curious about Masonry. It dispels the many myths associated with Masonry and explains the history behind Masonry as well as why they do what they do. It also goes into the other parts of Masonry such as Shrine, Scottish Rite, York Rite and other bodies of Masonry as well as many other aspects of this fraternity such as the fears of different religious bodies. All in all this is a very well written and informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every Master Mason","review":"I found not all was true to my Jusisdiction but a good read.

However, I'm not a big fan of For Dummies books. There are a lot of other Masonic books out there that do a much better job. Masonry is not something that you get through as fast as you can, there is no completion. It is a lifetime of seeking light, so take your time, reading this book isn't going to make you a better mason, you will just know more stuff. The true light is in the journey not the destination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader beware","review":"Would have been a better book if the author had stuck to the subject of Freemasonry instead of spreading misinformation about the OTO. The author does a disservice to the reader who might not know any better, as well to the many fine Masons who enjoy membership in both Freemasonry and the OTO. Perhaps if he had spoken to one of these Brothers some of his misconceptions might have been corrected and I would encourage the Brother to consider interviewing a few Masons who are also OTO members for any subsequent editions or other books so that information is more factual and less sensationalized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on the digital upgrade!","review":"I made the mistake of purchasing the digital \\"upgrade\\" when I purchased the book and I regret it! The \\"read now\\" option is the same as the \\"look inside\\" option, just as slow to navigate and takes way too much \\"website digging\\" to gain access to the book. I thought it would be a benifit to have the online access to the book as well as the physical copy, but I was wrong. It would have been much more \\"user friendly\\" if it would have had a page of contents with the different sections of the book in hyperlink where you could at least get to a chapter in the book much quicker. As it is designed now, you have to read the table of contents page by page and remember what page the chapter you want to read is on. Then you must enter the desired page number and wait for the page to load. Good luck trying to get to the next page after that especially with a dial up connection! Too slow and cumbersome to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big load that may put you to sleep","review":"I guess you don't have to find anything new in order to write a book for dummies.

It is well organized and developed with important references in mind. Highly recommended for Masons and others who want to learn about the fraternity and its appendant bodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"This book should be renamed 'An ultra-Darwinianist guide to why we get sick'. This book is written for doctors and laypeople who persumably know very little about evolutionary theory. However, nowhere in this book do Williams or Nesse acknowledge their ultra-Darwinian bias. I took objection to many of the things this book proclaims and the asumption that everything is an adaptation. This book is potentially very powerful and has some good points but was ruined for me by the arrogant assumption that this particular view of evolution is without debate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully interesting and engaging for laypeople","review":"As a bright artistic type who is basically scientifically illiterate, I often find myself unable to get through more than a third of my organic chemist husband's science books. Why We Get Sick is written for both the scientist and those who are just plain interested in knowing about things, i.e. people like me. Like all theories, what is presented here could be flawed. However the authors present a very intriguing point of view about health and the human body. Well worth tripping over a few unfamiliar words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practically reads itself","review":"This book is extremely readable, and hard to put down. The authors make a very compelling case for the usefulness of a evolutionary perspective in medicine. I have a couple minor complaints (but don't let this discourage you). The authors seem to move freely between fact and speculation, without making clear distinctions. Not a problem if you're paying attention, but they may sometimes give the impression that their is more data to support a contention than there actually is. Anyway, I highly recommend this book - it's easy to read, stimulating, and bound to make you look at illness and health in a new way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old book","review":"This is a fascinating view of health, sickness, and human evolution. It's description of the co-evolution of all the pathogens that attach our body and our responses to them is most helpful. The genome data is outdated but still mostly right on target. We now know a lot more so an updated book would be helpful. What they predict is mostly right on target.It's recommendations to us and doctors should be listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh and innovatrive approach","review":"Insightful, progressive, meaningful, and comprehensive coverage of the field. I learned a lot from the book. Few minor points that can be improved. One, the figures in the book (there are only a few anyway) are vague and don't add much to the content. Two, there are many sentences in the book that are either out of context or they don't convey what the authors have in mind. Third, the book could have benefited from a bibliography. Alphabetical bibliography is easier to use to look the sources up than to struggle to find them in the Notes section at the end of the book. But, overall, a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent layman's view of Darwinian medicine","review":"A particularly important resource for natural healers, since the Darwinian theories explored in this book go a long way toward explaining how human biology has adapted to natural substances through evolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on much-needed topic","review":"This subject should be taught in every medical school in the U.S. It is absurd that physicians are not taught the evolutionary history of our bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combo of travelogue and recipes","review":"This as an estheticaly beautiful, artsy-looking book with high quality pages, cover, illustrations and a gorgeous cover design.Well written, the food descriptions will make your mouth water; the descriptions of places will make you feel as if you're there.What's unusual is that this book combines recipes with the travelogue, about 50/50.Recommended for all foodies with an interest in Italy. And for everyone interested in Italy who also appreciates good food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I only read really good non-fiction books -- and this was one of the best I've read in the last 10 years.

If you want to understand something deeper about Italy and her cuisine -- which is really just good food -- I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop listening to it.","review":"Its a great CD. I can't stop listening to it. It is different than their last cd with a lot less screaming. Which is not a problem because if freakin rocks even more than the last one. They mention throwing up alot and thats weird. Also the song about a couple that becomes zombies and the guy eats part of the woman, but when she wakes up from death as a zombie they are still in love is bizzare and awsome at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lizards in my Stereo","review":"Showbread's latest release, \\"Age of Reptiles,\\" is, honestly, a great production. From the first track, you know that you'll listen to this album again and again. From the artwork, to the music, to the lyrics, this is one album that's tough not to enjoy.Musically, in comparison to their previous albums, Showbread has matured -- more intense and complex riff and changes in tempo. There's significantly much less screaming than, say, their previous release, but it's still present in most of the songs, even if only for a few seconds or as a background vocal. The decrease in screaming, I believe, will widen their fanbase, since the album sounds a bit more commercial. The quality, however, is flawless. Very well done album.This album is definitely a good buy, since there's no real downpoints. Personally, I find some tracks better than others, but not enough for me to skip those that I like less. Other than that, you've got a solid effort from a very talented band.Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"to the one above","review":"this cd is pretty solid. but if you like this pick up their other releases, Goodbye is Forever and life, kisses, and other wasted efforts. no sir nihlism isnt practical is actually their 4th cd, not their first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Perfect book for any golfer.

If you are looking for clear, concise direction on how to improve your game, get Ben Hogan's Five Lessons book. The little red book is full of every name Penick could drop, but severly lacks in the help department.

With all that's going on in the world of golf today: the exorbitant salaries, conflicts about equipment and vintage courses becoming too short, Penick's book reminds us that once upon a time golf was a genial game instead of a rabid business.

Real deep. The basic, Scientology inspired motivation is keen wrapped around something passed off by its publisher as literature about you and me and us and them when, in reality, it is about Richard Bach's own trifling human insecurities and his pompous belief that if he feels it, we all do.

All you need to do to make this similar to something from the Bible is switch a few words around; I don't enjoy that sort of allegory. (Jonathan, also known as Son of the Great Gull?) And then, a lot of the meanings behind this story are dead cliches; \\"do what you love and you will be happy.\\" Give me a break here; if you want a little religious didactic story that's fun and expository and by Bach, read \\"One.\\" Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather have my eyes pecked out by seagull than read this again","review":"Of all the thousands of books (on all the many topics and themes) I've read in my life, this has to be the single biggest piece of drivel I have ever had to endure.Given to me as a present, I assumed it was some vanity press self-help crap.

It's a story about living life with great expectations, boundless dreams, and belief in oneself. It teaches the key lessons we all need to learn and practice in our daily lives. It's psychological, spiritual, inspirational, and emotional; above all it's the Truth. Jonathan and his family of seagulls teach the reader follow their dreams, escape the ordinary, and transcend the limits of the ego.

It\`s better as a story one would read to their child because it does have some interesting points to be made albeit cliches we already know. But I also concur with some of the other critics that it is a bit overly done with the \\"do whatever you fell like\\" mentality, which I find to be destructive in the long term for a society. Just look at the current state of affairs in the States now (as of the writing of this review 2012) as we see what was once a great country is now faltering in so many ways, which is a direct result of the \\"do what you feel\\" philosophy.

It is filled with inane, predictable cliches. I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions over the course of the book... Not because the author wrote something witty or clever - but because the book continued to reach new levels of stupidity. I would be worried if a book about a seagull who learned to \\"fly real good\\" despite peer-pressure ended up changing my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book.","review":"If you could read ONE BOOK in the whole world, it should be this book.The amount of abuse this book has received from online readers is both baffling and saddening to me. I don't think people approach it in a way that will vindicate them; this is a book of concept and emotion... yes, it has not-so-subtle references to religion, but the overall message is not one that can be spelled out as \\"BLAH BLAH I HAVE A CHIP IN MY SHOULDER AND THIS IS HIPPY CRAP.\\"This message is about self awareness and personal freedom. It's about being a leader AND a follower, and the appropriateness of being both. It's about being unafraid of being against the grain, when the choices you make ultimately only affect yourself. (Yes, others follow Jonathan Livingston Seagull, but it's only because they open their own eyes to their OWN potentials. Each bird makes their own decisions... just as each person does in life.)I pity each and every person who cannot appreciate the power of this short but moving novella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"Just as described and with speedy delivery, this was a great gift!

Too bad he doesn't have the guts to show us birds pooping on a statue, having found TRUE enlightenment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly name for a seagull","review":"As I read many of the reviews, I was struck by how so many people saw Jonathan's life as a metaphor for their own. Well maybe I'm just not that deep, but I saw this as nothing but a story of a confused bird with an anxiety disorder. I'm sorry but the whole story was just a little too tough to swallow. By the way, I spent some time at the shore this summer, and I can assure you no seagull that I saw even remotely appeared to be as introspective and contemplative as JLS.

The fact that many enjoy it is shameful. This silly little \\"children's book\\" of about 90 pages with large type is about as intellectually stimulating as being hit in the head with a rock.

This so-called book has confirmed my suspicions. That most of the reviews for this piece of trash are positive is not surprising. After all, this book is full of the You-can-do-anything-you-want if-you-try-hard-enough nonsense that Americans cherish. That anyone would describe the author's overwrought, shamelessly manipulative, saccharine prose as good literature, however, is simply mind-boggling.People, please, get off your butts and start living your lives!! Trust me, reading feel-good, exploitative books written by savvy, if untalented, authors will do little to change your unsatisfactory existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels ever.","review":"I cannot explain why, but this book is simply marvelous. Everything in it, actually - from the way Bach describes how Jonathan flies to the way it makes you realize you are a gull as well.This is one of the few books that has made me experience something new and different, something uplifting. When I read thiis book, it's as if I'm as free as Jonathan, flying alonside him. Some people say it's a 'motivational' book, but I think it's much more than that. It moves you, it helps you when you're down, words cannot express truly what I feel about this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book flies with the birds","review":"In this mini (93 pages, many pictures) classic, Richard Bach deals with a philosophy similar to the teachings of Mami.

Well, that is not the way to make them happier but I am sure a few readers will get a laugh out of this. This one negative star will surely be out-numbered by all the 5 stars that rightfully are attributed to this book. So I hope it was worth it to get a laugh at the expense of the nay-sayers, who should realise that being objective won't make you happier. It will only make you a better, perhaps more bitter, survivor.

I read it first as a child, liking the story and not really appreciating the metaphor. I re-read it as a high schooler (and many times thereafter) and could see the book's true value. One of those classics that one always looks back on with delight. Bach evidently chose seagulls in light of his own flying background but the picture of the rat race remains as compelling. I bought soon after a poster of a bird silhouetted against the sun setting over a seascape and the words on it always remained with me : \\"You see things as they are, and ask why? I see things that never were, and ask why not?\\". I don't think Bach said this (can some Amazonian tell me who the author is?) but they seem apt for this wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the Fuss?","review":"What a peculiar little book. I first recall reading it in the seventies and it made very little impact on me. So, some almost forty years later I decided to make a second attempt.It only takes an hour or so to read \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\". It's a tiny book. It's not even a very long short story. It is, however, allegorical. In simple terms, JLS is Jesus. He has learnt much from his heavenly father and is keen to pass the knowledge on to others. He can even perform miracles.Although this book has been widely praised and sold millions of copies, I had real difficulty in seeing why. It's not that it's well written or even very original. In fact, more than anything, it's just banal. What on earth is all the fuss about?By all means, go ahead and read this book. You won't be wasting much of your life. However, never let anyone tell you it is a great book or that it changed their life. Get real! It's an over-rated very short story whose fame precedes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull","review":"The book was in very good condition, thank you:) When my children were small (1970's) I had the album of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, narrated by Richard Harris. At night when my boys were falling asleep I would play the album as they drifted off into a world of dreams and inspiration. They loved it and still do.

It is a great book that reflects upon the ability of an individual to perfect themselves: \\"Because any number is a limit, and perfection doesn't have limits. Perfect speed, my son, is being there\\" (p 65). In this book a seagull named Jonathan Livingston spends his existence perfecting his flight he especially works on achieving high speeds. I believe this book is well written and very uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hobo Philosopher","review":"Well ... yeah ... but what? The author of this book was a pilot, a photographer and a school teacher at a prestigious school. One sees all of these attributes without much disguise.

Trying to put human attributes of adventure and perfection and \\"flying above and away from the crowd\\" onto a seagull could have been a believable possibility but it would have required a good deal more work and a much longer seagull history.It could be considered a poem in prose - sorta - but again it would have taken more work and it would have required the author to hire a poet.

It basically erects a facade of enlightenment on a way of life that is essentially childish and selfish - which is a reflection of the life lived by the man who wrote the book - a way of life that most people could not live unless Mom & Dad and/or the government and/or your deceived devotes were paying the bills while you were off at the ashram contemplating yourself.When I first read this back in the 1970's it was required reading from our hippy-dippy \\"humanities\\" teacher in high school. Even then it was so obviously impractical, pseudo-enlightened hogwash but our flaky teacher thought the world of it. Ever since then I have used people's infatuation with this book as a measure of their own gull-abilty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and cliched.","review":"The first time I read this book I hated it. But, as an adolescent I assumed that I just didn't \\"get it\\" because everyone else loved it. My book group chose it last month and dutifully I read it again, hoping to understand what I didn't before.Unfortunately, now that I am older and wiser, I disliked it even more. Perhaps when viewed in its historical context, being published in the early '70s on the brink of all the self-help drivel that followed, it could be considered original or extraordinary. But to me, it was the opposite. It was as if Richard Bach was trying to incorporate every feel-good cliche and every religious idea into one marketable paperback.If this book changed your life, I am happy that you have been helped.

I read the book when I was first opening up spiritually and feeling what it meant to be a divine being created by universal being. This book expresses this thought in a story form, simply and clearly. It also touches upon how you will be shunned by your tribe when you aim higher than mere survival and even how with compassion we need to go back to the tribe to help it to grow, and then leave again. I suspect that many who walked the planet followed this pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Numbing","review":"In the miasma that was the 70's lies this book, an embarassing reminder of the culture of self-actualization that permeated that era.

After being asked to write a paper on the meaning of the \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" lyric(!), having to read this book was the last straw for our 11th grade Language Arts class.

I know that sounds goffy but thats what I though when I read this book.

The publishing house obviously did not want to invest in a professional editor (astonishing given the price of the book!).

Add \\"The Moghul\\" to that list!This epic novel of an Englishman sent to India in order to break Portugal's trading monopoly gives a great, in-depth look at the people and customs of that era. Since it was loosely based on actual characters and events, I found lots of details about a period totally unfamiliar to me. While the twists and turns are sometimes not easy to follow, they reflect what must have been the character of the times.It's well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Background","review":"I really liked the book. I thought it provided a great overview of Mexican society and the Mexican personality, yet even more interesting was his descriptions within a historical context. Of course, you must keep from applying the personality descriptions in a stereotypical way, yet I thought the perspectives were helpful in understanding society as a whole. Several friends of mine in the US and Mexico have read it and felt it was an interesting overview of Mexico.My only frustration with the book is that it is so outdated, and Mexico has changed so much since the early 80's, that one is left wondering how his perspective might have changed with the events of the recent past.I would recommend this book to anyone as a basic introduction. I would begin your understanding of Mexico with this book, but I would also pursue deeper and more modern perspectives on Mexico as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"If you want to read a book about the way Mexicans think, read Paz's \\"Laberynto de la Soledad\\".

I have traveled and studied in Mexico for many years and speak Spanish. So few Americans really understand Mexico, especially the roots of corruption, things like Mordidas, the military, police etc. This book enlightens and explains. A number of Mexican friends (certainly not those in the Government)agree. The sad fact is there are many things about Mexico that the Mexican government would rather not discuss or have us know. One of the reasons so few books deal honestly with the problems of Mexico. This book or (any book) that deals honestly with the problems of Mexico must necessarily risk engendering some feelings of hopelessness among some readers but such is, often, the nature of truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable info","review":"I first got an introduction to this book in 2006. I was supposed to read it for a literature class and never finished the first chapter, but I was thoroughly impressed by what I did read.

This has clarified so many aspects of Mexican life and custom to me, it really is an incredible read."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work with DVD player","review":"I bought 6 of these cables to provide input from a distribution amplifier to use with Orei P901 multi-format DVD players.

Typically, the yellow feed is video, but plugging this cable into WD player resulted in the white RCA plug becoming the video feed, and the yellow & red the audio feeds. This cable should work on other devices but you would have to determine which is the video feed. I assuming, though, that the WD unit conforms to a standard setup, so white may be video. More information on RCA cables can be found at [...]I haven't figured out the audio feeds because it does not matter for me.

Jones/William Bell song, Born Under a Bad Sign. The mix is rough in parts, but it must be expected due to the nature of the release.An oftentimes overlooked part of Bruce's distinguished career because the \\"supergroup\\" lasted just one album and tour, this release is an excellent way to hear the music do the talking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Ashamed","review":"I was the hugest FM Static fan after hearing their previous release.

Many of the first 9 songs are just dumb. The lyrics are dumb and the music isn't much better. Maybe I'm missing what the guys of FMS were trying to accomplish with this release, but for the happy fan, it's a let down. I realize that this is Thousand Foot Krutch's side gig, which sheds a little light on the lighter side of FM Static, but still, not near as impressed as I was with the debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Wait","review":"Towards the middle of FM Static's sophomore release, there is a tremendous song titled \\"Next Big Thing.\\" However, the rest of the album is watered down, filled with ballads, and absurd lyrics. This would be tolerable if the songs were good, but only a few are. It seems like they are going through the motions on this disc, which is WAY below the standards they set on their debut album. The melodies are there, but the performances are lacking energy and it is way overproduced.

It moved at a snails pace, the book jacket made it sound like an inriuging mystery - but more time is spent on analyzing every last detail amongst the characters - finally when something does happen by the 8th cd - its anticlimactic. And althought he main character continually talks about being psychic - she never once has a premonition, other than feeling \\"spiderwebs\\" when she walks in a room. I couldn't wait for this book to end, and I will probably never pick up another book by this author, even though other reviewers say she writes good books. I kept wondering if it would be better, if someone who was not monotone was doing the reading on the cd. That didn't help matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE TORTURE!!","review":"I elected to listen to the unabridged audio version of this book. Boy, it was full of fluffy dialogue that had nothing to do with the \\"plots\\". A few action scenes squeezed in between boring interaction between the characters. It got painful to listen to every detail the character did while speaking. Do we really need to know that she opened the car door, took the grocery bag out, closed the car door, walked 3 steps to the green gate, etc. It went on and on. Maybe actually reading the book wouldn't have been so bad.Or maybe I should have listened to the abridged version.

She has also assumed a new name trying to escape the husband trying to kill her, and she feels someone is watching her. Zoe is still hiding her psychic abilities from Ethan. Ethan is still trying to deal with the death of his brother. Everyone is ill at ease.I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first one.

I was hoping for some event or something to happen that would convince Ethan of her ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This may not be JAK at her absolute best, but it is still a very nice sequel to Whispering Springs. There were enough good characterizations and plot turns to keep the reader engaged, and personally, I enjoyed it a lot.

Except for lots of pizza dinners between the characters. I had thought this book would be solely about Arcadia, whose story I thought was a logical sequel to Light in Shadow. Instead, it was an epilogue, with more blathering on and on about how Ethan and Zoe (surprise, surprise!) still haven't trusted each other enough to share their inner-most secrets after a whopping 6 weeks of marriage. This story actually underscores how little Ethan and Zoe have in common, which is typical of this author's heroes and heroines.

From a layman's perspective, it was a bold venture that required exceptionally talented musicians and a conductor/director who could think in the abstract. Since I do not have any formal education in music, nor can I read music, my commentary is based purely on listener satisfaction and not on any higher understanding that might accrue to those who are prominent in the Music Field. When the electric guitar took charge about three minutes into Track 8, I concluded that the CD is priced too low. Track 7 starts out deceptively sedate followed by a strong finish. Having heard the CD from beginning to end at least twenty times, I would say that there is no inferior content."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great single disc sampler","review":"I've gone thru a hundred cd's looking for a single disc sampler with no fillers and all of his swinging sides, and this is it.

After a bunch of reviews that I found, I went with my gut feeling and ordered the cd. Let me tell you for any skeptics...It's fantastic, and worth the import cost!! You'll listen to it over and over, enough to even sing along with the fluid and mellifluous lyrics (all Danish, but it all sounds more romantic that way). Pick it up as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, It's THAT GOOD!!!","review":"Denmark's Sorten Muld take Danish Folk music into the world of electronic trip-hop. The melodies are haunting. The beats are infectious. The instrumentation is superb. \\"Two Sisters\\" is an absolutely marvelous track and a personal favourite. Swedish bagpipes, distorted guitar and pulsing beats swirl in a pool of violence and gentle beauty like the song's narrative. The marriage of traditional song and modern electronics doesn't always work (see New Age-y Celtic cd of choice...Loreena McKennit?). Sorten Muld blend the modern and the traditional as well as anyone out there. It does here and in beautiful and wonderful ways. There is real passion and emotion here.

A wonderful book for any child who finds his/herself in the midst of a new family. What I liked most about this book was that it dealt with topics other books for kids haven't touched, including crushes on stepsiblings. One of my favorite parts of the book was the \\"fill in the name\\" letter stepchildren can give to a stepparent when kids feel they're being pushed into having a relationship with the new parent.

Unfortunately, the underlying racism is not surprising given the time period in which McMurtry wrote the novel (mid '60s) - off colored remarks were made in reference to African Americans and remarks about \\"stinky Mexicans\\" were made.

Customer service stated they were sorry for the inconvenience and advised not to open the lid by hand or place anything on top as this could cause stress to the lid. We did neither to cause the breakage. Although they offered a 10% discount off the price of another lid, I will not be replacing it. Such a shame, as the concept of the product is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so automatic trashcan","review":"Less than a year ago I bought the Touchless Automatic Trashcan and thought it was a great addition to my kitchen. Then this past week it started to grind and refused to open for me. There is only two of us in the house so it was not because of overtasking the machine. I am disappointed in the trashcan as I came to depend on it,only to have it let me down.I hesitate in sending for another due to its relative high cost and its lack of reliability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Works great!","review":"This little trashcan it really great! We have used it for almost a month and it has really worked great. I do not like the ring that goes inside it, as I don't mind the little overhang of the trashbag on the sides. The ring does not really fit, but I have given the trashcan 5 stars because I like it so well. A lot less hassle to putting in the trashbag when you just don't use the ring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Gene Wilder Overacting.","review":"Between Gene Wilder's overacting (as usual) and Charles Grodin's grating self that he is, this movie keeps getting worse to me every time I see it.

Their design is outstanding, but my experience with the Beosound 3 has been bitterly disappointing. I bought the unit shortly after its launch. The touch pad failed about half way through the warranty and it could not be switched off, blasting out loud music for many hours until the battery finally died. I returned it to the dealer. I found B&O customer services arrogant and their response grudging, but the unit was eventually replaced. Now the touch panel on the second player has failed and it is not possible to change the volume, amongst other things. These products are eye-wateringly expensive, but there are quality issues which are not acceptable at this level of the market. I have also had problems with some of their other equipment. I should add that I have taken great care with all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I have read countless self-help books; some I have taken to heart and others I have not. This work I found to be very interesting and enlightened me in many ways. The author gives you some clear revelations concerning conflicts that you will encounter in life; the emotions you will deal with and the why's of feeling as you feel.He explains the concept of the 'power struggles' that we have within ourselves, and how important it is to work to understand them and make the necessary changes.It is always hard to see ourselves as others see us, our flaws and weaknesses; but with understanding, comes the ability to change.I enjoyed this work and plan on doing a little more study with this book and some self-examining. I think this book would profit all that take the time to read it and put into practice what is being told them. An interesting spin, not boring, but very insightful.Shirley Johnson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful and useful book","review":"I have read a lot of self-help books in the past and I really enjoyed this one. It has a lot of useful tips to practice in daily life and it really helps you understand how emotions effect your interactions with other people. I finally can consciously identify the emotions I feel when dealing with the people in my life. This has helped to elimate many potential conflicts because I was able to change the outcome.

It is a book by an English professor that completely dismisses everything in 20th Century Anglo-American philosophy in a single sentence in order to focus on post-modernism and New Age thought as the culmination of philosophy. Complete rubbish, worse even than the cartoon book \\"Philosophy for Beginners\\" (which at least gets right most of what it does say, but has the same blindness towards analytic philosophy as \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide\\"). Get something else, like Joel Feinberg's \\"Reason and Responsibility\\", Robert Nozick's \\"Philosophical Explanations\\" or \\"The Examined Life\\", or Keith Lehrer's \\"Philosophical Problems and Arguments\\" (primary author James Cornman)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tale of two turners","review":"The handle is sturdy, its line is attractive, and the material will surely never scratch pans.

He spins these tales with style and never ever makes a mistake with the time period. From language to cars to clothes he makes sure the time period is represented to the fullest.

I wish Mr. Mosley put out 4 books a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise!!","review":"I truly enjoyed listening to this particular Mosley masterpiece. I've always been fond of this writers' talent and gift but the reciting presented by Mr. D. Cheadle made it that much more thrilling. It reminded me of the old radio shows that my father used to tell me of. Mr. Cheadle brings to life the words through his acting out of the main character, Paris, as well as all the others. I knew when I read that he was the narrator that I would be pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear Not","review":"It wasn't enjoyable as Brawly Brown. The story at first went really well.

Although I'm a huge Walter Mosley fan I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mystery is convoluted; the writing is not his best.","review":"The problem, for me, is Paris Minton. In this, the second book in the series, he comes off as a whiney, frightened, and weak individual. I lost interest in the book (and the mystery) about half-way through. The character of Fearless Jones is one of those confident, self-assured, but marginalized main characters that appears as \\"mean,\\" \\"threatening,\\" and a \\"killer\\" when in fact he's gentle, kind, bright, and giving. I thought the mystery was convoluted and to be honest, it didn't make a lot of sense to me. I also had problems with the structure and execution of the story. For example, I didn't believe for a minute that Paris just \\"happens\\" to find that manuscript where and when he did. It seemed like a cheap plot device. That said, I did enjoy the passages from that manuscript. THAT would have made a better story.Perhaps I'm not that bright, but when it was over I kept asking myself: \\"The point of this was...?

First thing I noticed was that it was NOT a leather sole as advertised. While disappointing, it would suffice. Then the cheap construction showed as one of the tassels fell off while I was attending a meeting out of town. The suporting piece was a very thin vinyl that simply broke. I noticed the other one was pulling out of the tiny hole in which it was set. Well, since I had no idea when it chose to break, I did not have said tassel in my possession. The seller (Gabriel Shoes) informed me that Bostonian does not guarantee the tassels! I can see why since the design is so flawed. I ended up having to have both tassels replaced with 2 that I had taken off an old pair of shoes. Gabriel Shoes did offer and apply a credit of $15 for my expense.

Every brand of shoe is cut a little differently, and thus the real question is whether or not it gives in a way that doesn't cause discomfort. In my case, this shoe felt fine the first time I wore it which was for about 3 hours in church.I like it. The shine of the leather and the wingtip imprint make it a standout. The sole feels lighter than some of the classic dress shoes used to be, but in my book this is a good thing as it invites better shock absorbtion when you walk. Also noticeable is that the leather forms creases easier than older shoes used to, but some buyers will see them as character marks, while others view it as a shortcoming.All in all, I will probably invest in another pair (brown) when they become available in my size (11-1/2 W)."},{"rating":"1","title":"noisy shoes","review":"I have owned Bostonian shoes for a number of years.

These are the problems: 1)They have rubber sole. The color of the rubber is brown. The color of the rubber side is black because the shoes are black. The first day that I used them I noticed that appeared line color brown on the rubber side, this happened because while I was normally walking the shoes rub the ground.

They look really good, come in 12 wide (which I needed) and the price was reasonable. However, these shoes hurt worse than any pair of shoes I have ever owned. They are the correct size and slip on fine, but the top of the shoe digs into the top of my foot when I walk. I assumed that I just needed to break them in, so for weeks I wore them, and even went for walks outside my office frequently hoping to loosen them up. I placed cardboard in my socks to reliever the pressure and even tried stretching them using wooden shoe stretchers. And they still hurt!I wear dress shoes every day and have had many different kinds of shoes over the years and all had their plusses and minuses. None were this uncomfortable. I strongly suggest you try them on somewhere to make sure that you like the fit prior to purchasing them online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged item shipped","review":"The shoes arrived well packaged, and on-time, but one of the shoes had a huge scuff / damaged leather on the back - looked like someone tried them on, and took one of the shoes off by stepping on the back of the other one.

He's prolific (at least one mystery per year). He's good. The last mystery I had read, by another author, I figured out in chapter three. This one held me to the end and it also made me laugh.

The lyrics are stupid, and often ridiculous (uh, 'Hot in Herre' anyone?), and he would go as far as rapping about sneakers, in that horrible excuse of a rap 'Air Force Ones'. 'Pimp Juice' has to be the worst song I've ever heard, well, next to 'The Real Slim Shady' by Butterfinger, er, Eminem. Nelly looks like a freakin' gorrila!

If you refused to believe it before, this album proves it.Now, I had very little respect for Nelly after his first album.

He didn't even have the lyrical cleverness of that some of these \\"weaker\\" rappers had.Now comes his second album, and its a disaster.

I just don't see what's so great about it...I don't know. \\"CG2\\" is perhaps the stupidest piece of garbage I've ever heard.

I think the reason it didn't do as well as Country Grammar is because that was the first time any one ever heard Nelly. But now there are people all over, even from his home town, discouraging him. All because he has a style of his own, and a different way of saying things. Which really doesn't matter because he's staying true to his fans unlike some artists, and he's selling records unlike some very whack artists. But the main thing that I think bothers people is he did it on his own with his boys, who are all well recognized in my city, their home town.

It wouldn't be fair to bring down the rating of this album because of what other people think about it, but when 13 year old girls and suburban kids think this is the coolest thing out, the album will not get much respect from true hip hop devotees.

With lyrics like \\"It's getting hot in here so take off all your clothes\\", you learn quickly that his ability to use language creatively is about as lacking as his ability to inspire anyone to do anything but smoke weed, self-indulge and treat women like objects. Nelly is about as hot as Pluto and as tight as the grand canyon. Besides his utter lack of musical talent, what the hell is wrong with his damn face? Take off those stupid bandaids!

Nelly tried to diss one of raps greatest legonds KRS1. After 2 disses from KRS to Nelly, Nelly turned to be fake little.... and called it off. Nelly is garbage and the only people who buy this garbage and acually like it are 2nd graders, women, and white people. Nelly may be sellin like whoa, he's still garbage, mabye he would have entertained us if he kept his goal on being a baseball player, instead of a fake, country boy wanna-be, pop rapper.

More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no.

Although the CD was downfall there were a couple good songs that werent promoted as much as the others(or not at all). for example: country grammar part2, rock da mic remix are both nice songs.

But, the events leading up to his latest release, \\"Nellyville\\", it made me hate Nelly more. First, he goes out and does a collaboration with *Nsync and then got the nerve to take his big headed tail and disses KRS-One. That shows how much respect Nelly has for rap.Of course, this album is gonna sell because it's aimed at the 12-16 year old *Nsync fan (mostly girls) and that damn stupid song \\"Hot In Herrre\\".

Good background beats in most of the songs make you want to listen to it. However, Nelly has lost his 'new flavour' touch that he had on his first album. His lyrics are amazingly repetitive, and I must say upon closer inspection, even the beats sound quite similar. The only song worth listening to was \\"Splurge\\" because it demonstrated his talents as a rapper, singer and had a promsing guitar beat in the back that sounded very unique. All in all, I found the CD much too 'Mainstream' for someone who is a fan of quality rap music.

My stomach hurts everytime I hear hot in (herre) what's that spelling about. Nelly's skills are on a mc hammer level, personally I think hammer could win a battle aganist nelly.

His last cd was non-stop head bopping action. Nellyville is done alittle differently, while there are plenty of fast beat, fun songs, there is some serious tracks to listen to, \\"splurge\\" talks about his new lifestyle that has come with his fame, and how people judge him by what they see. The cd overall is done very well, with a good balance of slower, serious lyric filled songs and dance, fast beat fun songs.

I agree new emerging artist need to be heard, but no one gave JOE(album all that i am) a chance and i bet if you listen to that album you will be surprised on the quality of it compared to this is way better(even if its rnb).

The Dr. Seuss of Rap is back again with his Barney rhymes and soft lyrics. The beats are mostly cool, but I don't buy a CD for the instrumentals. The problem with Nelly is that he is trying to be tight. He constantly says stuff just so the teenie-boppers and moms can rap along. The catchy tunes keep playing over and over in my head. And why does he have to bring that wack crew of his. Murphy Lee is the only one who isn't awful (He acually is better than Nelly) and what is up with having someone in your group that doesn't rap, produce, or even looks cool (That dude with the mask). The worst is when he tries to rap hardcore. When I first started to type this I was going to try and sound funny, but why waste my time on a buster like this. No street cred having punk.

First With The Cons, Nelly sounds the same... very similar to Country Grammar, same type of beats.. lyrics are still cocky. The pros are that the lyrics are very good.. I love CG2, i think that was a good song to bring back Country Grammar a little bit.. but he could of spent a little more time on the beat. Another great song is dilemma, I like everything about that song... very good.. I give this four stars because if Nelly would of tried harder, all the songs could have been hits.. but I'd only skip about 53 songs( the 3 terrible skits but most the songs are worht listening to... um.. buy htis cd or not... I could tell right away that these had little time put into them and you wont be listening to these songs longer that a month(if your lucky) but if youve got 20$ just layin' around.. Buy it.. but if your like me.. fightin to get money every other week to get that new cd... dont buy it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee, what a surprise","review":"Damnit people, haven't you figured it out yet? Nelly is like the LOWEST form of music. I mean jesus, any real artist could have written those lyrics at age 5 if they knew the cuss words. \\"Hey look at me, I'm #1\\" (only because the american people have no idea of what real music is). If you like hip-hop or rap check out some more honest stuff by people who put just a LITTLE thought into it. If i were you, i would NOT buy the album. Oh, and by the way, i didn't buy it either, i heard it at a friend's house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm Garbage","review":"This is simply more of the same shallow, mindless, pop music that has saturated the hip-hop scene since the catastrophic arrival of Master P and No Limit.

This is 6th Grade entertainment at it's worst. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucka MC","review":"I didn't like nelly when I first heard him, but the neptunes made the first single off of this album sound pretty ok. I listened to (but thankfully did not buy) this on the strength of that song and heard nothing come close to it. It is artists like nelly who make rap seem like a passing fad and a lightweight genre. His lyrics are uninspired drivel that sounds like bad teenage poetry. The non-neptune tracks sound like britney-spears style bubblegum mixed with sub-par hip hop and sloppy flow. Avoid this at all costs, and if you ever see nelly, tell him to take that stupid bandage off his ugly face."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one town I won't soon be visiting.","review":"Another masterpiece by Nelly?

It's a terribly weak follow up to the fun, original, and different album that was Country Grammar. In the old CD, Nelly tried new things and experimented with bass in ways other rappers hadn't. He stood out from the crowd - but in his latest release, he seems to have sold out to produce a mediocre effort, which sounds exactly like the product of every other black guy with a microphone who's told he has \\"talent\\".

I like people like Mos Def and the Roots, among others. Jay Z and Snoop are cool, but they aren't my type. But this guy Nelly, together with a host of others, is the bottom of the barrel. He can't really rap, but that's not the point.The point is that his crap is being taken seriously. People think he's a real artist, that he's oh so hot-----just because he sang one song about it being 'hot in here'.But I do believe people are getting tired of him now----I haven't heard him mentioned for some time now, and I hope it will be that way for ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHOA! this is bad.","review":"This is a horrible cd.

This book is meant for the readers of \\"the National Enquirer\\", and anyone else to whom such trivial things as dates and correct chronology of events are not important.

It is archaic, oppressive and suppressive of our development as a modern democratic nation. You are proud of your republic and would never tolerate a monarchy in your own country, nor would you tolerate the suppression of books which are critical of your President.Many of us here in the UK wish to have a modern republican form of government, as other countries in Europe already have.

People should show more respect for ther Royals."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder you can't buy this in England","review":"This book while big is full of lies and no wonder it isn't available in England because if it where the Queen would be all over it for the lies that it says about the royals.Here are just some of the things that Kitty Kelly says in the book that are not true1.The Queen Mum was illegitimate-she was the 8th of 9 children and her parents were married long before she was born2. The Queen Mum had to be impregnated by turkey baser to have Elizabeth and Margret3. Princess Margret was an anti-Semite because she walked out of Schindler's List4. Prince Harry is not Prince Charles' son- so not true. Harry's maternal grandfather had red hair and Princess Diana did not meet Harry's supposed father until he was already at least one year oldDo not bother even reading this book. There are much better, more accurate books out there about the royal family."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just SO tedious.","review":"You really get excited about this book when you first see it and open the cover. It's so well designed, and it just all looks like great fun and cant wait to dig in. After days of struggling to get through just a few chapters, then fighting off the temptations to put it down and read something else, I have to come here to say you wont get your money's worth out of this one. It goes off into these rambling, resentful diatribes of what the Royal family has or owns. Even how she thinks the English citizens were cheated over how much sugar was used in the wedding cake of Princess Elizabeth's wedding.If you want to read a fantastic, attention keeping book about the Royal family, read Donald Spotos book on the Windsors. It's a real history lesson and filled with interesting tidbits and \\"gossip\\", but not this over dramatized, pathetic, petty rambling on, and on, and on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about very little","review":"This tome can only satisfy those who have been living under rocks. I'm glad I paid only $13 for it at a warehouse discounter -- but even that was too much. I must admit to having borrowed many books from the library about the \\"royal\\" soap opera in recent years, with the result that, for me, Kitty Kelley offered nothing new whatsoever. In fact, I wouldn't be totally surprised to hear sooner rather than later that she's being sued for plagiarism. Not only do I object to its lack of original material, but to its style and language. It reads like People Magazine, and one need only the vocabulary of a 12-year-old to comprehend it. For a really good read on that family, I would recommend a book published three to four years ago entitled, \\"The Queen Was Not Amused.\\" It is a serious work of non-fiction, truly absorbing with much original material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mere rehash of tidbits from other books","review":"So who cares if the Queen Mum had A.I. seventy-some years ago? And, mind you, this is the most exciting thing Kelley has managed to dig up on the House of Windsor. And one should emphasize dug up--because the whole book smells like an old bone, well-gnawed upon and not very appetizing. Save your money! Don't buy. In fact, boycott as if just a tabloid paper between hard-covers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Censure","review":"I am British and therefore have not read Ms Kelley's much talked of book. I cannot understand why we are not allowed to read it, but we ARE allowed to read the new book about Princess Diana, they haven't stopped that have they? I wonder why? Censuring us is only going to decrease public support and frankly the Royals need that more than ever. However, with Phillip in tow I suppose the Queen has enough on her plate trying to keep him from embarassing the monarchy.To any Americans who CAN read the offending book may I say enjoy it, if nothing else I hope it will entertain, accurate or not.And one final thought. Please don't believe everything you read especially about the royal family, and if you do please don't think they are a representation of us. We are much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing new, interesting or important in this book.","review":"I just finished reading The Royals by Kitty Kelley. In view of the on-going media hype surrounding it, I am alarmed by how poorly written and researched this book was. I was led to believe that Kitty Kelley was a journalist who was writing a \\"history\\" of the House of Windsor. But this book is a waste of money and any time spent reading it would be wasted. Even if you are only interested in gossip, rumor and innuendo, there is nothing new here. Everything she has written was printed elsewhere. And to top it off, the publisher should be scolded for not proof-reading the text --- apparently if Kitty Kelley likes a particular sentence she'll use it over and over again throughout the book. Don't make the mistake I made by buying this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT FUN!! JOLLY GOOD TIME!!!","review":"What a fun book and that's all it is. There is nothing new in this book, well maybe a few things, but nothing that is going to make you drop open your mouth in shock. I've read other reviews here, and I'm finding people are taking this book much too seriously. It's just fun, Everyone loves a little gossip and that's all this is. Read it and have fun with it, don't start harping on what is real and what isn't. Just read, laugh and enjoy. Nothing in here is really nasty...to anyone. The only reason it was banned in the UK is because it would be real easy for the ROYALS to sue Ms. Kelly. I have to give this book five stars, it's just too rich...and really some fun reading. By the way the cover is GREAT! Pick it up, have a cup of tea, and enjoy. It's worth it!!!

The plot leads the reader on a chase around Scotland for the truth behind a hotel fire five years ago and a series of more contemporary crimes and misdemeanors. With more twists and turns than the Hampton Court Maze, this book is sure to delight anyone who likes to be taken up numerous garden paths and back again. From the first page to the last your sure to find plenty of suprises in this novel. Definitly one of the best I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Guy","review":"John Rebus is one of my favorite British Inspectors. I have enjoyed all of the Ian Rankin John Rebus novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebus at his best here!","review":"If you have not read a John Rebus book, and if you like hard-hitting, fast-paced British mysteries, then you have a treat in store for you. I highly recommend Edinburgh's Dick Tracy (DI John Rebus). This is the fifth book in this series, and as always it's best to start at the beginning, but if you don't and start with this book that's OK too. Rebus has morphed by this book. He is a really strong character with the tenacity of a bloodhound when he's on the hunt. When a close colleague is mugged in an alley, Rebus is drawn into a case that began five years ago when a famous hotel burned to the ground. When the smoke cleared a body with a bullet hole in his head is found. The body has not been identified by the time Rebus gets on the case. With the help of his new DC Siobhan Clarke, they try to bring down a huge crime ring that has been terrorizing Edinburgh for ages. This is an intelligently written, hard-hitting, tightly written book that kept me turning pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent Rebus Book","review":"This is a perfectly good Inspector Rebus book. It is not Ian Rankin's best in the series, but it is not the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"The maturing Rankin.","review":"The fifth book in the Inspector Rebus series is the real start of the classic series. This is the novel where Ian Rankin matures into a seriously talented writer.Rebus is investigating the brutal bashing of his friend when he is drawn into a 5 year old mystery involving a fire at a hotel and a dead body.In the meantime, Rebus's home life is in disarray as his girlfriend kicks him out.The story is quite good, not as good as his later novels would be, but well on the way to becoming bestsellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you book a weekend to read this one","review":"Once again Ian Rankin has written a splendid mystery novel starring our favorite Edinburgh DI John Rebus. He drinks, he doesn't smoke, he drives, he gets hit by a car, he ends up back in his apartment which is masquerading as a college dorm and drop in, he gets hit on the head, he gets called on the carpet and suspended. But in the end he sets all things (well almost all) to right.Three loose ends are: What is going to be the final determination for Brian Holmes, is this the end of his relationship with Dr. Patience (and the beginning with a certain DC), and will he ever be able to shut-up, behave himself so that the Farmer can promote him.A great read, plan on finishing in two days, if you work hard at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Customer Service","review":"I bought two boxes of their lights locally and had a few dead batteries - they sent me new batteries with just an email and within days. A week later, one of the lights died - I sent another email and they sent a new light head.OK, I had some problems BUT they took care of them QUICKLY and very nicely. Will be buying at least another box because these things are BRIGHT and look really nice in the yard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Solar Lights","review":"I too bought these lights March 2006 at Costco. I actually bought 1 pack and the next day bought another. However, by the next week already a few of them were not coming on any longer. Since then, not even 1 year later all but 6 are not working. I've tried recharging the batteries and replacing them to no luck. If you bump into one it stretches (mushrooms) the weak aluminum pole that the lamp sits in and then they never stand straight again.I would not reccomend this product to anyone. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because they are very easy to install.Oh and by the way, I live in Las Vegas. Having enough Sunlight on the lamps was never an issue, they are just cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, but 2 of 15 have died in 3 months","review":"I bought the 15 pack from Costco earlier in the summer. As others have already mentioned, they are easy to install but aren't particularly sturdy. My big complaint is that 2 of the 15 have now stopped working. I tried replacing the batteries with store bought ones (about $7 for a pair or batteries) but that turned out to not be the issue. I'm going to contact Westinghouse about getting them replaced, but it's still a pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Pack","review":"These seeds have been just great for sprouting.

Each type of seeds sprouted quite nicely -- I'm having some of the best salads ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice variety but would prefer separate items","review":"I haven't sprouted for over a year and wanted to refresh my memory... which varieties I liked best. I like the organic claim, especially for broccoli which is hard to find in that state.PROS:*This is a nice variety of seeds for someone just starting out or for someone who wants to try new things*This would make a very lovely gift basket addition*I used my counter top sprouter from sproutpeople for all of these (except the buckwheat) and highly recommend it as it works with all varieties.CONS:*Three of the packets are 'mixes' which defeats the whole point of having a sampler. I can mix seeds... I'd rather have three more varieties to try.*There is excessive packaging, but if the producers must package like this, a ziploc top would be great as I used only 1/4 of a package each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sprout seeds for EVERY occasion","review":"I love sprouts, and have been unable to find either sprouts, or the seeds in stores in my area.

In a very entertaining style recounting his travels and sharing tales of the island's lore, Peter Tyson gives us an overview of both the Malagasy people and fauna ( and somtimes flora ) and how they relate in light of its conservation issues. He also outlines the limited knowledge that exists as to how this unique island has come to be so different from anywhere else on Earth, opening the scope for unlimited wonder and whetting a thirst to find out more. A great starting point for an interest in Madagascar and a thoroughly enjoyable read.I would recommend reading Mike Eveleigh's, Maverick in Madagascar, after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating glimpse of a true \\"lost world\\"","review":"Madagascar is like Australia in some ways - a sort of zoological attic, filled with animals the rest of the world forgot about or never met. Tyson has probed the fauna of this island for many years, and his doscoveries, adventures, and insights make for a most informative book. Some of the most interesting passages deal with his inquiries into animals reported by some of the indigenous people but not yet confirmed by science. Tyson doesn't take all the animal stories he hears at face value, but he doesn't discount them, either. He believes we have more to learn about the creatures of this island - and we must learn it quickly. Development and other pressures are eroding the island's biodiversity at a frightening rate. Tyson conveys that urgency along with the wonder of this unique and special place."},{"rating":"2","title":"You feel like you're there with the author!","review":"This book makes you feel like your on the trip through Madagascar with the author.

I was impressed that these ancient diaries had been preserved and had been brought into the printing world. I was not impressed with the content. Pitti's diary did not tell me anything about Florence. He traveled too much because of his affinity with the French. He seemed to me like a conservative, wealthy extremist who wrote the diary for his own self indulgence. My understanding of Renaissance Florence is no sharper than before this book because the life of this man could not have been indicative of the rest of the population of Florence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes alot to feel somewhat soft","review":"We have a 250 gal.

We put a little more each time until we were up to BIG handful. We are finally to where we can feel a difference but by putting that much in, we experienced a little foaming and an empty bottle rather quickly.

His vocal stylings is that of the great Nat King Cole with vocal runs that go for days, the jazz licks that he gives at the end of \\"If it was cool\\" will tell you to look out for his jazz CD <word is he's working on one>.In tracks 2,3,6,10,12 he lets his vocals do all the work, adding more then enough but still making you want more, as for the other remaining tracks, all I can say is \\"fella's grab ya girl and lite the fire place\\"Mr McKnight has entered your speaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, Brian","review":"I am a HUGE Brian McKnight fan, and while I loved his 1st two albums, I was extremely disappointed with \\"Anytime\\" and \\"Back at One\\". \\"Superhero\\" was alright, but I knew that Brian could do better. It just seemed that he was trying too hard to become \\"mainstream\\" on those albums. Brian McKnight definitely made a UTURN on this album. The album is absolutely superb and it's reminiscent of his first two albums. In fact, it just may be better than Brian's sophomore CD (which is my favorite). UTURN is Brian at his best. He fills the albums with ballads, which, I believe, is Brian McKnight at his best. \\"Good Enough\\" with Tank, Carl Thomas, Tyrese, and Joe is a remarkable collaboration. The album is just what we Brian McKnight fans have been waiting for, Brian McKnight getting back to his roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"Brian McKnights CD is wonderful.

It's full of good solid songs that you could listen to all day long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Brian ever!","review":"Just when you think he's given you the best that he's got, Brian comes up with an album like U TURN to prove you wrong. This recorded effort is the best Brian album to date. The songs are strong and heartfelt. He sings them with such emotion that you can't help but get into the groove. Even the two up beat songs on this one that he does with Nelly and Fabulous are the best \\"hip-hop\\" performances I've heard from him. Of course, the ballads are absolutely captivating. I got an advanced copy of this release two weeks before it ever hit the streets and it hasn't left my CD player yet. This is one I listen to over and over again. U TURN is definitely worth buying. If you weren't a Brian fan before....you will be once you get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Album:Nat king Cole Jr","review":"this Brother can play anything along with singing.

His Voice makes me think of Nat King Cole. He is Smooth on the drop of a Dime.I dig the Jazz run he does on this Album on the song \\"If it was cool\\". his Voice&Piano Signature sound are his trademarks. to Me Brian Mcknight is the best One Man show Band since Stevie Wonder. with that Voice&his overall Multi Instrumentalist Skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love this cd","review":"I have been reading some of the other reviews, and I have to say that I don't agree with the negative ones.I love these songs, Good Enough; Backseat; All Night Long; Shoulda, Woulda, Coulda; Been So Long, pretty much the whole cd.

I really like Tim on the Live at Luther College cd with Dave Mathews. That is what caused me to explore Tim's work. His acoustic guitar abilities are out of this world. I don't care so much for the electric performance on the first cd though. But in my opinion his performance on his acoustic guitar on the second cd more than compensated for my listening ear. I am partial to the acoustic guitar because I play it, so take that as you will. Tim is an outstanding musician so someone may like the first cd much better than the second. I think it is well worth it to get the cd though. With his acoustic performance you can just float on the music. Its wonderful!

Consequentially, it's never very emotional, even if the story istragic. It all has a slightly over-the top, operatic feel. A movie I enjoyed, but doubtI'd have the inclination to see again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a difference 17 years make!","review":"This TV-documentary was made in the early 1990s and so much has happened since then. Here, Ron Jeremy's hair is black, and now it's salt-and-pepper. Both Cal Jammer and Jon Dough have committed suicide. They show \\"Jake\\" as a camera man with brown hair. Jake is now a porn star named Jay Crew and he has salt-and-pepper hair, rather than salt-and-sage. Although women make more in porn than men, they have shorter careers and I don't know if any of the women here are still working. Peter North looks pretty much the same, add a wrinkle or two.Although made in the 1990s, this is full of 1980s signifiers: big eyeglasses, mullets, and big hair. You see video cassettes, no DVDs in sight. This was very diverse in terms of sexuality, showing gays, straights, lesbians, and bisexuals. There is little frontal nudity, but a lot of everything else. If you can't learn enough about the porn industry, then you should see this. It was entertaining and informative, despite its age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Procol brings home the bacon on fourth album.","review":"Procol Harum's first album sans organist Matthew Fisher, Home is the dividing line between the two camps of Procol devotees: Those who gave up on the band after Fisher left, and those who thought the band was better off without him. On Home, Fisher's sublime, cathedral-like organ passages are replaced by stark, whittled-down arrangements (there are no Salty Dog string sections here) dominated by Robin Trower's bluesy guitar and Gary Brooker's gruff voice and pounding grand piano. New bassist/organist Chris Coppings attempts to emulate Fisher's organ on cuts like Piggy Pig Pig, but lacks Fisher's presence. Titles like Dead Man's Dream and About To Die showcase Brooker and lyricist Keith Reid in a particularly dark state of mind. Still, the epic Whaling Stories more than compensates and is alone worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin trower on guitar !","review":"With robin trower on guitars this cd i liked quite a lot.

And though any Thomas novel can be counted on for vivid characterization, smooth wry witty prose, and a complicated suspense plot, this is one of his best. I have recommended Ross Thomas to fellow readers for decades, and have, admittedly, found he is something of a specialized taste. Not everyone \\"gets\\" him. However, I rank him with the best suspense auhors--Thomas Harris, Tony Hillerman, John LeCarre, John Sandford, John D. MacDonald, etc. If you haven't ever given him a whirl, consider it.

The shimmering ballad \\"Love's Just A Feeling\\" is very good, and the most interesting selection is perhaps \\"Never Gonna Let You Go\\" which is not the typical, overbearing ballad that might have the heavily over-used title that it does. It's actually a funky, midtempo number with a spacey, hypnotic background that doesn't share itself with a lot of the typical NJS of the late 80s/early 90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Drawings are look more like an inexpensive comic book than a master drawing's book, I am very disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent for getting a photo but leaves you wanting better","review":"it's fine for lots of situations but after using it for a few days i found myself wanting something with image stabilization. any shots above 55mm in low light were hard to get without some blur from camera shake. also, the focus ring on this thing feels pretty loose. overall i'm pretty happy with this lens. it's small and good for those times when you don't want a bulky, overbearing camera. in retrospect i wish i could have spent $400-$1000 on a really good lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"It's actually the worst lens I've ever owned.

Ideally, I'd love to get something that went down to f/1.8 at it's widest, especially because I really enjoy shooting video - but I really am tight for cash. And honestly, this Sigma lens offers a beautiful bokeh at all focal lengths. Not to mention, my video quality is much higher, especially in low light. Also, manual focus on this thing is extremely smooth.My only complaint isn't even really justified, but the lens construction isn't the greatest; it's made of plastic.

It's no longer \\"fresh\\" music, but rather many of the memorable tracks we'll remember for a long time. If you've got a big collection, you probably already have these on other CD's, but if you're new to trance, this is a good buy.

I truly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting read","review":"When I first saw this book, I thought it would be a dry book on religion.What a nice surprise to discover that Samuel M. Shoemaker manages to incorporate every day events and everyday human beings (with all their flaws) and argues that it is through the human spirit and soul - love and compassion that we find what through fellowship is.I loved the way Shoemaker does not shove down your throat the concept that the only way to be \\"whole\\" is to throw yourself at God and beg for forgiveness for being a human being.Shoemaker has a wonderful way with a phrase and I actually found myself reading and re-reading certain passages as I thought they were actually beautiful.I also liked the concept of jotting down your own thoughts and beautiful passages.This was an extremely pleasant surprise for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Christian Book","review":"As a child, I was raised by parents who were definitely preachers of the ways of \\"fellowship\\" and how important it is in religious communities. This book follows the kind of lines that my parents tried to teach my brothers and me. It focuses on bringing Christ's values to religions of today and how much they could benefit by understanding how important strong fellowship is. I was very appreciative of the note pages. That is always an interesting concept and as a person that, again taught by my parents, writes down ideas as I read, this was very cool. I liked this book and I believe others interested in learning and understanding the benefits of fellowship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing New","review":"There is nothing new under the sun. The core things that we struggle with today have been struggled with since the creation of man. Sure, it may get repackaged under new names (postmodernism is really the new existentialism), but it is the same thing.And I believe this book is proof of that. What Shoemaker outlines (again thanks to Palmieri) is human nature. The Conversion of the Church should be just as useful to people today as it was when it was originally published."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opener","review":"This book was not what I was expecting, but in a good way. It is very interesting book which gave me a new perspective on important aspects concerning the church. As a person who struggles with their faith I thought this was a great book which didn't make me feel lesser because my faith was not strong, instead it inspired me. I have also been ignorant of different religions, dominations, and churches and this book really opened my eyes. I have found that I do want a new way for churches...my personal way would be for church to serve coffee on couches and it would keep me more interested. However I have found this book very informative and it leaves me wanting more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"pew questions","review":"After reading a few positive and not so positive reviews for this book I decided to give it a shot. As a person who has fallen completely away from the church in the last 5 years I was sceptical at first, but it proved to be a rather good read. I have always had questions for the church and this book made me feel that mmy questions were just and I shouldn't feel bad for having them. I have read a few of tuchy's books before and knew there would be room for my own note taking, but this time I really took advantage of that feature. I think it will be interesting to read again in a year and see my notes from the first time I read it. Good book, I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true fellowship","review":"\`The Conversion of the Church' was a complete surprise for me to read. I am not a religious person and tend to shy away from religious books, due to the fact that they all have dry religious preaching's. This is not the case with this book, instead of preaching to you it offers ideals about the fellowship of man and church.One of my favorite parts of this book is the fact the author has included blank pages for the reader to write down their own notes. I thought that this was wonderful and unique way to interpret what the author has to say and how it feels to you. Having these blank pages makes it a great way to share and start conversations with friends, or even a book club to discuss main ideas.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a religious book that does not preach to you, but also teaches you about the fellowship of man and his church. You will be just as surprised as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's cast list is incorrect!","review":"As another reviewer has warned, do NOT purchase Rude Dog: Leader of the Pack, under the impression that it is a strange incarnation of the 1972 Claudia Jennings film Unholy Rollers: Leader of the Pack.

It was tricky getting the hang of locking the animals in but after awhile even the kids were able to lock them in, more or less. When the trains pass, a magnetic sensor will trigger the animal sounds. If there is no animal locked in, you hear bird sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to our train set!","review":"With the exception of yes the pig not quite sounding like a pig and for some reason the cow we received not locking/fitting in the animal pen. We love everything else about it. How easily/quickly the sensor detects the train passing by. Our almost 3 yr old, after we showed him how to lock the animals in, is having a blast doing it all by himself. The animals work great with our circus trains and go under the chuggington bridges/tunnels with no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain America dvd-rom","review":"I love these comic dvd-roms!

It's pretty awesome to have all of these in one place even if it's not anywhere near the experience of reading the real thing. However, if you don't have zillion bucks to shell out for all the originals, this is the next best thing. I love that they are scanned cover to cover (ads included!) and you also get the full Tales of Suspense including Iron Man. I've read complaints about the DVDs on PCs but I've had absolutely no problems on my Mac. If you have Acrobat Reader, you're good to go.

I love all the songs, in particular \\"3030\\" and \\"Virus\\". I've got nothing but love for Dan the Automator and Del. I kinda think the song \\"Upgrade (A Brymar College Course)\\" is meh, kinda boring.. But it won't stop me from giving this album 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift From The Future","review":"In all honesty, I have not heard a better hip hop album than Deltron 3030. The more and more I listen to it, the more and more I fall in love with it. What sets this one apart from the rest is the production. Koala and Automator shine together, created rhythms and beats that sound like no other. The album kicks off with a bang with the hip hop symphony, 3030. The rest progresses perfectly, with not one track out of place. There is not a slouch in the bunch, but I do have my favorites. 3030 and Mastermind, oh wait, also Madness, oh wait, there's also Virus, oh wait.... just buy the album, you won't be sorry!And Del The Funky Homosapien kills it, as usual. Were there any doubts in your mind?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's. It is one of those CD's that you can just leave in the player and never have to skip any tracks because they are all good. And the beats that The Automator and Kid Koala make on it are sick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Year 3030 Here I come!","review":"The beats on this album are out of this world. Dan the Automator is in top form. His performance is great on every track. If you love the likes of the Hieroglyphics then this album is a must. Del's in rare form with his over-enunciating style of rapping.If you can't stand rapping, but love mixing then get the instrumental version of this record. I stamp my guarentee of approval on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neo Phunk","review":"This is the rap counterpart to a Cowboy Bebop or Ghost in the Shell soundtrack.

This one is hard to compare to \\"Both Sides of the Brain\\" (which is also awesome) since the styles of the two are so different, but \\"3030\\" will definitely be of interest to fans of Del's previous records. Highest recommendation - If you don't like this one, you don't like hip-hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"crystallized","review":"this album was and still is way ahead of the curve.

The album is one of the true amazing albums of the last ten years, pure in every form. It's not about bling or crap like that - this is intelligent.When I explain the album to friends, I tell them to look at it like its a Pink Floyd album. It's spaced-out, ironic, self-deprecating, and, well, amazing when you've been partying. I went to a cabin with a ton of friends a few weeks back and threw this album on. About thirty of us listened to this album in the dark - and I then had thirty people asking me for a copy. It's the deepest-sounding album I've heard in years - layers upon layers of sounds.You want amazing hip-hop with a brain? This is IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"upgrage your brain matter, 'cause one day it may matter....!","review":"Sounds like the music industry could use some that Brymar College offering. Intelligence and originality are not given a light of day, it's the \\"hip-hop matrix\\" as Common called it. But, I guess it's up to each and every one of us to to look at all angles and dig up gems like Deltron 3030.

Del combines powerful messages and observations with his non-stop, hard-hitting delivery. Del's flow hooked up with Dan the Automater is the perfect combination. The futuristic beats provide the perfect match for Del's lyrics. If you believe hip-hop should carry a message as well as bump, pick this up, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deltron 3030 is a MUST own!","review":"Feel like hip-hop is at a low-point the past year or two? Haven't heard beats the make your jaw drop and your neck break in a long time? Then I urge you to pick up this album. Even if you aren't too into hip-hop, you will like this album. It is on another level. I have recommended it to many friends and they all can't stop listening to it.Deltron 3030 is quite possibly the best album of the year. No other hip-hop album comes close in beats, lyrics, originality, and overall quality this year. Del's \\"Both Sides of the Brain\\", Reflection Eternal, and the new OutKast can come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average but not a classic","review":"One of my favorite Del cds, could have been better if Automater could have kept the production consistant. All the best stuff is in the beginning and then towards the end the tracks start losing momentum. Still a verry good CD, thats why I rate it 4 stars. My favorite track by far is Things you can do, that beat is awesome sounds like a beat from Zelda or FF."},{"rating":"1","title":"It aint that hot!","review":"I recommend to save your money & pass this one up. I think everyone is jockin' DEL because of what he has released prior to this project. It really isn't that hot! I heard a DELTRON DIS from some underground kids that was alot better than most of the tracks on this CD. The crew that dissed them was called AUDIO DIRECT & they ripped it pretty good. You can check them out... As far as DELTRON, alot of the beats are what keep this album alive, not the flows( I guess thats why they released an instrumental CD)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it got me back into rap & hip hop","review":"I dont consider my self a fan of rap/hip hop. I havent listened to this kind of thing for nearly 10 years. Deltron has resurected my appreciation of the genre. I remember Del from back in the day, and had been hearing good things about Dan the Automator and Kid Koala. I dug the little bit I heard from Dr Octagon, and have had Handsome Boy Modeling School highly recommended to me. When I heard Deltron on the local college station I was blown away. I instantly became a fan, and am giving this CD as xmas gifts this holiday season. Believe the hype -- check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding masterpiece","review":"This all star team suceeds in every respect, a truly great sonic work. lifted immediately into the futuristic world of deltron 3030, amazing black humour and sci fi imagery wind through everything del utters on every track. its impossible to praise enough. the automator reaches his current peak hear and every sound and nuance lifts the deltron world further into the stratosphere. expected greater things from the gorrilaz based on this collaboration, but this outshines by a long way.truly excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deltron 3030","review":"Del,the automator and koala bring the hotness with this joint.Tight beats,rhymes, and scratches.This one is a must have for any UG head."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album - intelligent rap","review":"good to hear a rap album not focused on how much of a gangsta the artist, but mor focused on providing a creative bunch of songs with some thought put into the lyrics and music. phrasing is awesome from del the funky homosapien and excellent beats from dan the automator, which match perfectly with the underlying theme/story throughout the album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, no questions asked!","review":"From the first to the last track, this album is solid! Nothing short of visionary, Del is definitely one of the finest MC's of all time. This album has a sound of the same blood as Dr. octagon's Octagonycologist, probably due to Dan the Automator. The beats have a thin complexity that perfecly compliments Del's flows. Check the track 3030, it has an epic sound and expanse I've never heard from hip hop before. The difference between this and a mainstream project? This disc actually sounds like the artists cared about the production, and took more than 2 minutes to come up with the beats and rhymes. A great album, quintessential to any enlightened collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"the first book I read as a kid. the stories are full of adventure!I can't believe there are no other fritz lieber reviews...sad"},{"rating":"2","title":"rollicking fun with two of the wolds greatest anti heroes","review":"Read them as a kid, just as good now.

No Way. When I first started ordering them from Amazon about 3 years ago, they were $36.00 for a case of 12. Each time I order, I find that the price has increased. A case is now $70. As a couple of previous posters noted, I too have received many dented cans. At $70 a case, I no longer find dented cans acceptable. I will be looking elsewhere to purchase these.

The price is now up by $30 to $68. This is insane and in no way does this fairly reflect the hike in gas prices. I could see a $5.00 raise ... maybe. But $30? These were $3.16 a can a year ago. They're now $5.67 a can. Any grocery store raising their prices that much, that fast, would be laughed out of business. This is is shameful. Get these prices in line, Amazon (or, if Worthington's responsible, get them to get their prices in line or drop the product).As far as the product? It was dropping in quality, anyway.

I do not recommend it for anyone who is trying to teach their child proper French. The entire premise is that it's a bedtime book, and \\"Goodnight moon\\" implies saying goodnight as one goes to bed. \\"Bonsoir lune\\" implies more of a \\"good evening\\", as if one were being greeted in a restaurant for dinner. \\"Bonne nuit\\" would be a much more appropriate translation.

Some of the earlier reviews complained about the beeps every \\"block change\\" but I hardly notice. As every other review has stated, the fan is a joke and it did quit after less than 30 seconds of operation. The motor on the fan just can't handle the itty bitty fan.

I will say this about it: I only have one problem with it. It's easy to assemble, it works well, etc.But it beeps. Over, and over, and over, and over again. Every minute, on the minute, it beeps loudly at you. There's no way to turn it off. There's no way to disconnect it. You can't mute the sound, or lower the volume. I called customer service and they blew me off. It's loud enough that even with music turned on in my headphones, I keep hearing it. Every single time the timer passes another minute, it's going to make that loud beep at you. I have no clue why someone would decide to install a feature like this, or what possible purpose it could have, or why they would ever think a customer would want it. If you work out for forty minutes, you will be beeped at forty times.

Thanks to those who posted about jotting down the serial # during assembly - good hint. When people wrote that this unit is \\"quiet\\" when in use, they weren't kidding. What a pleasure. I've only been using it about a week and half - starting out slow a few minutes each day, and adding time as I go.

I spent some time on the phone with Nautilus support, and we came to the conclusion that the problem was the AC Adapter. They sent me a replacement Adapter; but in the meantime, I discovered that the Adapter contacts would not make contact with any of the AC recepticles in my house. I finally simply plugged it into an extention cord, and it worked. The bike is very quiet, has many exercise options, and even has a rudimentary heart monitor. I am very pleased with it. Even more importantly for me, I am actually using it regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bike at an great value","review":"I purchased this bike as a gift for my wife (yes it was on her x-mas list). Ordering was very easy as usual from Amazon.com and the bike shipped very quickly and arrived within a week. It only took about an hour and half to assemble. All the parts were included, and were well organized and everything even worked even after I assembled it :-) Spend the extra $100 and get model 231 over the 230 it's worth every $$$$Pros: 22 pound fly wheel gives the bike a true realistic ride, easy to use LCD display and workout options. smooth pedaling and extremely quiet,Cons: More assembly required than I expected, but it really wasn't hard to assemble. just take your timeI would definitely recommend this bike to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"Should have put together sooner.

I can say that I will rate the seller with 0 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although I congratulate Ms. Kuffel on her success in leaving the Planet of Fat, I was turned off by the tones of self-pity and self-loathing that permeate this book. Ms. Kuffel spends a great deal of time judging herself - and others - according to body weight and other superficial attributes. Her descriptions of \\"the Stepfords\\" (women who followed the same eating plan Ms. Kuffel used), different \\"types\\" of fat women, and \\"laws about men\\" are simplistic and somewhat mean-spirited. I wish that the author had deepened her analysis more and questioned the premises that seem to have informed her desire to lose weight and her response to accomplishing that goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS GARBAGE, THE AUTHOR IS A HORRIBLE PERSON...","review":"Seriously, this is one of the most boring books I've ever read. The author doesn't provide any details about her weight loss journey. That's kind of important because that's the main reason I picked up this book(probably why other people decided to read it too)! Ms. Kuffel's story was not inspiring, humorous or interesting. She's a snob, cold hearted, beyond conceded. Funny thing is, she's ugly; inside and out. I really dislike this woman. She mentions a few times how she hates fat people, um, excuse me? The majority of people who are going to read your book are fat or have been fat! So rude. Also, what's with the overuse of big words? This began to irritate me within the first few chapters. Who does she think she is? What a waste of time. THE WORST BOOK EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Put It Down","review":"This book was great. Whether you are heavy, thin, loosing weight or already there you can relate. I laughed and cried and saw so much of myself in this story. I am in the middle of losing weight and found it so motivating and true to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I love this book. Every time I get discouraged when I'm trying to lose weight, I pull this book back out and it really helps me."},{"rating":"2","title":"the criticisms astound me","review":"This book was incredible -- not necessarily politically correct, but a real, unvarnished, we-all-have-warts look at one woman's story.I am, however, stunned by some of the reviews of this book that are not, in fact, reviews, but are instead vicious, hateful attacks against Frances Kuffel. The depth to which these particular reviewers sink in their attacks might cause one to question their motivation; serious consideration of their own weight-related issues and prejudices may be warranted.I urge anyone contemplating the purchase of this book to do so; if you find the subject interesting, I don't think you can find a better work than this.Congratulations, Frances -- on every front."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling but mean-spirited","review":"I too could not put this book down, and read it in 3 short evenings. What was genuine was the checkered voyage of self-discovery she encountered as she went from 300+ to 150-. Her storytelling was engaging and I truly felt like I was in the bat cave with her at times.What was off-putting in the novel was her unabashed meanness towards herself, her family and others. When her dates would compliment her and say she was nice, I, as a reader, didn't agree. One would have hoped having walked in \\"fatty\\" shoes herself, that she would be more sympathetic towards others struggling to accomplish what she had. Instead, I found her judgements of those starting their journey appalling.Frances may be beautiful and thin on the outside, but there's something still quite ugly on the inside. I give her credit for being brutally honest about her feelings, but I hope in retrospect, it helped her heal and find compassion for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we supposed to be happy for her?","review":"I'm glad she finally found some degree of self-fulfillment, but there are better ways to learn to like yourself than losing 150 pounds. My concern is that this book perpetuates the myth that thin=happiness and fat people are emotionally disturbed in some way. Definitely there are a lot of people who have emotional issues that affect their eating habits, but often the cure is to work on the emotional issues instead of another diet. If your happiness is contingent on your weight, it's likely that you'll never really be satisfied. If this book does anything good, it is in showing that that losing weight will not make your problems go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for compulsive overeaters","review":"As the obesity epidemic grows, and overweight individuals are saturated with the latest diet and weight loss schemes, Frances Kuffel shows that massive weight loss is indeed possible without resorting to gastric bypass surgery. Her adherence to a 12-step program enabled her to lose over 170 lbs. and change her relationship to food. What stood out most for me was her search to find out what it means to be \\"a girl\\" having felt like an asexual, amorphous individual for most of her life. By studying what women wear, do and say, especially around the opposite sex, she seeks to educate herself on everything that she missed by being morbidly obese for most of her life. Hers is a heart-warming, inspirational journey that anyone who has been or still is overweight will identify with."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABOUT AS INSPIRING AS TOAST....","review":"If you want inspiration go to a twelve step meeting and meet people who live the steps and not those who break the tradition of anonymity. \\"They have no Stars or VIPS\\"This volume was as thin as anyone could get when it comes to wisdom and grace, and as shallow as one can be while being colorful. Credit through to her wrting style; however style without substance and integrity is well.. Fox news comes to mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read, not a how-to book","review":"Kuffel's self proclaimed goals are to be thin, love someone who loves her back, and publish a book with her name on it. This book is the story of her accomplishment of the first two goals (the book itself is obviously the third). Kuffel is not writing about the physical mechanics of becoming thin; she is interested in discussing the emotional and spiritual journey that she took during and after her weight loss. Her food and weight problems are so extreme that I don't think her system would be necessary or helpful for most dieters anyway.That said, I really enjoyed her descriptions of the various stages of her weight loss. The problems were actually more interesting than the triumphs. It is easy to predict that someone would be ecstatic to wear a size 18 for the first time in her life; incontinence due to thigh shrinkage is a problem that I would never have imagined.All in all, an enjoyable read about someone who overcame adversity in the pursuit of her goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It...","review":"This compliation gives you all the songs from their old \\"Wide Blue Yonder\\" (1987 PolyGram) CD and the first 3 songs from their \\"Step Outside\\" (1987 Rounder) CD: Hal-an-Tow, Flatlands, and Another Quiet Night in England. Those CDs are excellent, and this band is exceptional. British folk-rock that is rousing, thoughtful, heart-felt, and provocative. Listen and they really may just inspire you to \\"work like you are living in the early days of a better nation...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb!!!","review":"Oh man! I am not one to complain, but this video is just plain stupid! Its aweful. There is a grown woman (Casey) taking the kids around to see the horses, but she acts as if she is about seven. She is soooo annoying!!!! I can usually deal with any show my kids want to watch and end up enjoying it...but this one is just yucky! As far as how my two year old likes it....I dont know really, because I cant stand to look at that dumb Caseys face to put it on!!! The video includes sing-a-long songs, shows children where horse live, what they eat and how poeple care for them....without Casey, it might have been worth something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't take it anymore!","review":"I am so disappointed in this video that I just had to write about it! My son loves horses and so we bought this video in the hopes that it would show alot of video about horses. Well, apparently the people who made this video think the rest of us are interested in watching the goofy adults dance around and sing really bad songs about horses. When the horses are running around and jumping, half of the time the horse is barely visible and the camera is on the rider! It is a very frustrating video. I honestly can't tell you how frustrated I get by not showing the horses....oh well, live and learn...I definitely would not buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointing movie","review":"This movie was very entertaining for my 3 year old daughter. However it did not have very accurate information. I have owned horse on and off all my life, and was very dissapointed in the video. I rented the movie from a video store, and was very glad I didn't waste my money on buying it. I surely will not let my daughter watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril Lavign \\"My world\\"","review":"This dvd has to stand on the shelf of every true avril lavigne fan! You get a full concert, with all the song off her first album Let Go, plus three others. You get to take a look back stage and travel with avril to Japan. There is also photos, and outakes. if you are an Avril Lavigne fan you have to get this dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME - for Avril fans!","review":"In Avril's own words, \\"AWESOME\\"!Having said that, Avril sang off key, missed notes, and sang out of pitch most of the time. But i thoroughly enjoyed the DVD. I think she is quite talented, forthright, and spunky.A friend of mine, who is about 15 years younger than me, thought i must me mad to enjoy her performance. But i looked at the overall entertainment value of this product and was satisfied with my purchase.The extras are great too - except for the bits where she is rolling around drunk - no need to show her young fans that this is cool.In summary, if you are an Avril fan, you will LOVE this DVD with a cd extra. If you aren't, you will probably wonder how she did without singing lessons!By the way, i believe this was her last concert in the tour, so its quite possible she was tired and needing a rest. Only a theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped for more","review":"Being a fan of Avril, I hoped for a lot more actually interesting performance than what was on the dvd. Mostly, she stood in one place or sat on the edge of the stage. If I had wanted a performance like that, I would've listened to the cd. The upside to this, however, is covers. She played Basketcase by Green Day, Fuel by Metallica, and Knockin' on Heaven's Door by Bob Dylan. The set also comes with a cd of six songs, four of them covers.Another thing that disappointed me is her explanations behind some of the songs; her explanation and the lyrics clashed.What it adds up to is, don't buy this set for the dvd, it sucks; and the cd is only worth it if you are a die-hard fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy one only if you are a fanatic fan of her.","review":"Avril's first album is great. In the album, Avril delivers her lyrics so well that at first, I couldn't believe the fact she was a teenager.Then this My World DVD came out. Well, after watching the DVD, I couldn't believe the girl in the video was the same girl, who made a phenomenal debut album. It's sure exciting to see her live performance, but obviously she can't hit the right notes.Her voice is now way too lower than before, and she has trouble hitting high notes. Her worst performance can be seen on COMPLICATED; I had to turn down the volume. Now I have to wonder if she used a pro-tool on her first album to get pitches fixed. Although she has a good voice, she ain't a good singer, at least on stage. She is still a good songwriter, though.In short, I wouldn't recommend this DVD to those who have good ears in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO YOUR DVD PLAYER AND YOUR BRAIN A FAVOR....","review":"DON'T BUY THIS!

It also comes with a small CD of her live! Avril also sings all of her songs from her first album, \\"Let Go\\", plus Basket Case, Knockin On heaven's door, and I don't give! But here's the catch: Avril Lavigne doesn't sound too great live >_<. Her voice is all hoarse and NOT smooth AT ALL! I was extremely surprised when I listened to her sing live, let me tell you this: She doesn't sound ANYTHING like how she does on her CD!However, once you get used to her new style of singing, it actually isn't that bad! So yes, I would DEFINITELY recomend this DVD/CD to you! BUY IT NOW! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great DVD (And CD Too)","review":"This DVD is awsome. Avril is very talented, and preformed great live. It was also wonderful seeing her preform in my city, because seeing the concert again was great. There are also music videos, along with a 6-track bonus CD. In addition, there is a 40 minute behind-the-scenes thing. So again, I recommened this DVD, and if you are an Avril fan, I would get get a copy quick before the more dedicated fans snatch um' up ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME AVRIL","review":"i BOUGHT THIS DVD AND I THINK THAT ITS ALRIGHT BUT NOTHING GREAT. ITS JUST THE SAME AVRIL DOING THE SAME SORTA THING FOR EVERY SONG. TRY TO GET SOME MORE VARITY IN WHAT YOU DO AVRIL AND CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES AT LEAST ONCE.

THE ONLY 5 OUT OF 5 THINGS ABOUT THIS DVD IS THAT IT HAS ALL THE AV VIDEOS UP UNTIL KNOCKIN' ON HEAVENS DOOR AND IT GOES FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME.. tHE CONCERT ALSO SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR LONGER. tHE CONCERT IS NOTHING SPECIAL. THANX FOR READING MY REVIEW BUT I THINK THAT ANY LAVIGNE FAN SHOULD OWN THIS DVD AT LEAST ITS BETTER THAN SK8ER GIRL DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avril's voice a letdown live","review":"Despite an all-around well-produced and entertaining concert and backstage footage, MY WORLD comes up short where it counts the most: Avril Lavigne's singing. What were the best moments in LET GO become the sadly disappointing worst parts on stage, as Avril's voice turns boyishly deep and then resorts to atonal yelling where her songs are most demanding. (On the other hand, in covering less difficult GREEN DAY and METALLICA hits, she actually sounds better than the original vocalists.) This problem may be due to the wear-and-tear of touring on her young and delicate vocal chords--MY WORLD was filmed on the last North American tour date--but, nevertheless, it doesn't help Avril's reputation as a performing artist to showcase this weakness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Cpt.

Good explanations of the 24 form Yang Style set, with a sense of humor and a love of the form and its history. Does emphasize correctly the energy aspect of the exercise.Added bonus: The Eight Pieces of Brocade, a classic Qi Gong system.So what's the caution. It is really impossible to learn Tai Chi from a book or video. You need correction, correction and more correction. You need the insights only a teacher can give you. This book is great as a text to go along with what you are being taught.For that reason, I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough graphical illustrations.","review":"Basically there's not enough illustrations for a beginner to be able to get into T'ai Chi. The text part of the book is solid, thorough even, but the graphical examples are few and far between. A book on physical movement meant for beginners should have ample illustrations of everything. This book has very, very few. Buy it if you're new and are more interested in the philosophy and benefits or don't mind reading about how to do a physical act, stay far away if you want images that show you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a beginner","review":"I was amazed how quickly I received the book.

I'm just a beginner, and I was looking for a suitable book for beginners. I have found many dummies books to be of extremely high quality, written by experts who are able to distill their knowledge effectively to teach people who don't know anything about the subject. However, I found this book disappointing. The author seems to have practiced for only a few years, and doesn't seem to have the broad base of knowledge of an expert. As such, I would feel uncomfortable relying on this book for information. It's not a bad introduction to the topic, and if all you're interested in is learning some basic moves to add to your exercise routine, this book will help you get started. But if you really want to understand T'ai Chi, I wouldn't trust this book to teach it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lense at a great price.","review":"Japanese made at a budget price.

The two albums collected on this CD were his first, both recorded in 1972. The sound could be described as the Brazilian version of the nuyorican aesthetic - cold electronics coexist with jazz improvisation and Brazilian roots textures and melodies.

Stone's preoccupations are with the possibility of heroism in the modern world, the nature and contradictions of piety and faith, the tragedy of addiction, as well as American hubris and stupidity. \\"Under the Pitons\\" is a particularly engaging story that doesn't shy away from the conventions of the sea-adventure--Stone employs his tropes strategically and with obvious skill. \\"Bear and his Daughter\\" takes you to the fullest depths of tragedy--its precision of feeling lies in the kind of command of character rarely seen in American short fiction today. An outstanding collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drugs, violence and incest have rarely been so tiresome","review":"Of these seven stories, only \\"Under the Pitons,\\" about love among drug-runners, pulls off the grand, sweeping melodrama that most of the rest just nod toward, and only \\"Miserere,\\" about a woman who rescues aborted fetuses for burial, feels like a true short story. The other works seem like abandoned novels. They are filled with characters that are hopelessly self-indulgent (the alcoholic in \\"Helping,\\" the drug-addicted daughter in the title story) and tediouslyself-important (the incestuous poet in the title story, the drugged-out poet in \\"Porque No Tiene, Porque Le Falta\\"), with plots that lead to violent, cop-out endings.

I would have given it 5 stars if it contained a small set of scissors.I love the fact that it is water resistant, which my old kit was not, and I consider the waterproof bags to be easy to open and close.

It comes with the basics as far as quick patch job medical supplies go but the clear DryFlex bag bag still has room to add several more items for customization. I'm going to keep this kit in my personal bug-out bag. I picked up the larger Outfitter kit for my extended getaway bug-out box as well.

I have seen the band perform live upwards of 50 times (at least, perhaps more, I have honestly lost count). They have always given a good show, whether at a small club or a stadium in their 80's heyday, but I really think that things have improved with age. This performance on DVD I would rate in the top ten shows I have seen. Sure, I wasn't there with the fans, sharing that live energy, and that will detract slightly from the experience of watching the show but the band in their curent lineup has really \\"jelled\\" for the more recent shows. I saw them in Petaluma, CA on Dec 1, 2007 and that has to have been their best performance to date. This DVD rates up near the top. Highly recommended. Dave, Phil, John, and Mike... Keep on rockin'.

One section, the questions, is divided topically into the major subcategories of physics; questions are numbered by category and then sequentially, such as 5.8, 5.9, 5.10... The answers to the questions are found in a separate section, using the numbers. Because of this, you tend to read the book with a finger stuck in the answers so you can find your place when you go to check your work.There is also a separate bibliography section, but I never paid much attention to that as a kid :^)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and enlightening","review":"You can learn a lot of physics from this book.

Yes, the lack of excessive fingerings can sometimes be good, but there are absolutely none given in this edition. There are also some editorial changes, none of which are glaringly severe, but slightly annoying.Mozarts sonatas are a must for any classical pianist and a great teaching tool for the intermediate pianist wishing to advance to more challenging works.

It is the perfect example of why \\"based on a true story\\" can be so misleading. This film was made before the court issues were even completely resolved and was rushed out to capitalize on an incredible and important court case. The acting is putrid and there are an incredible amount of inaccuracies. The filmmakers obviously had a slant toward the Stern's and never fairly represented Ms. Whitehead's point of view.

El Goonish Shive is an admirable blending of humor, over-the-top action, and even a fair amount of drama, all driven by a cast of characters one can truly become attached to. Though many of them start off as common comedic stereotypes (the brainy, bespeckled nerd, the macho girl, the cat... squirrel girl), each of the main characters undergoes considerable character growth and background expansion. The Sister arc, begun in this volume, and the later Painted Black are especially signficant in this develop, and are among the best portions of the series.El Goonish Shive may not be perfect, but it is well worth purchasing, and further reading online."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAUL WELLER'S FAILURE","review":"Ok, don't get me wrong I'm a major Paul Weller fan, since 1977, but apart from a couple a gems like 'Solid Bond' and 'Shout To The Top' this is Weller at his worst.After the rise and rise of The Jam, he tries to go all soulful and funky and misses by a mile.Don't waste your money on this rubbish, go buy The Jam boxset and listen to Weller at his most powerful and leader of the greatest band EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Style Council with style","review":"This album captivates the talents of Paul Weller.

For the first few months, it worked as advertised...no problems. But, then, the day came when I needed it and it simply refused to work. Up to that point, there was never the slightest indication of a problem. The Zip drive just gave up working.

Considering this movie was released in 1988, it focuses almost entirely on the vietnam war draft, and although that was the inspiration for much of the turbulence in the 60s, I felt the movie didn't capture any of its real brilliance. This was a movie about the 60s made by people who never experienced them, probably people close to Ronald Reagan. The album, along the same lines, is also worthless because it is full of cliched 60s jams, although the Canned Heat song is awesome.

In fact, it is organized much like a multi-tiered menu of simple, mostly static instruction pages reminiscent of any decent \\"learn to sail\\" hardcover book. In many cases one has to click his way back up a menu in order to enter another branch. The terminology is not always standard USA, and there is no alternative vocabulary. The graphics are primitive, but that wouldn't be so bad if one could actually TRY some stated principle to see what happened. Skip this one and look for another piece of software.

Most of the content defined sailing terms that can be read in any book on sailing. eg. Chapter 8 of Chapman Piloting-Seamanship and Small Boat Handling. I estimate that less than 10% of the disk allowed the user interactive participation. The user guide which accompanies the disk asked the viewer to use the help button to obtain any assistance. I found this lacking because when I tried to find out how their unique wind direction indicator worked, there was nothing on the help pages...I do not recommend this disk as an aid to learning how to sail."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great for baby...and good for mom and dad, too!","review":"This selection of Mozart's music is sure to be pleasing to baby whether in or out of the womb.

I like the fact that this model includes a rechargable nickle metal hydride battery, but you can pop in 4 AA batteries if the NiMH battery runs dry.The display is large and easy to read. The display cover appears to be mineral glass and not the cheap plastic that I've been disappointed with on less expensive competing models.

I'm not sure how well it would do as a first time introduction to the subject matter but I figured that I myself, would use it as a supplement to information already learned. For those who are not accountants, I would recommend it to gain a basic understanding of the concepts governing accounting or as an introduction to accounting terms but not as a true learning experience.

I have owned it for over two weeks, and haven't taken it out of my CD player yet! Not only has she grown as a singer, but as a songwriter too. These songs speak to me on a much more personal, but somehow universal level, than her earlier songs do. I always find it freaky when singers write songs that apply exactly to my life, and that is exactly what Catie has done (with songs like Fall Away, I'll Cover you, What's the Matter, and Magnolia Street) in A Crash Course in Roses.

Audio is not clear and in many cases has breaks. I still have one T5200 left (I lost 1 out of 2) - eveyone in my family wants to use the older unit as the new T5820 does not perform. Plus, I paid for the T5200 half of what I paid for thr T5820...I recommend not to buy this product. Go for the new cheaper & better T5720 (1 Watt as well, compact, great sound quality.

He takes funny to giggles and laughter. This is a performance for children of all ages.The stories ar masterfully drawn with an art that defies description (by me anyway). Kipling's *Jungle Book* and *Kim* are so well known that they don't require my comment. He did win the Nobel Prize for Literature.I listened to these with my daughter when she was 5 - 9.

Even with this CD turned up to the maximum of \\"40\\", it's simply not possible to hear and understand what is being said, so the CD is worthless. Maybe I'll use my computer to rip the tracks off the CD and convert them to mp3 and use a sound editing program to try to increase the volume on the mp3 tracks.

I have remembered and talked about many of the stories throughout my life, particularly The Cat Who Walks by Himself, and The Elephant's Child. I also like . . . oh, well, there are just too many to talk about. Read them for youself, and to your kids.The stories are complex and mysterious and, though I can't say much for Kipling's politics, I find them delightful. I think most children will, too.

The sound quality on the CD is poor. There is background static and it sounds as if he is too far away from the microphone and that he is speaking through a tube.

I thought Boris Karloff would make a great narrator, but he doesn't this time.

Try another sound version and you might be happier with these fine stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine edition of a classic collection","review":"What's not to like about Kipling's Just So Stories? This classic should be a must read, as the tales may just turn into myths: eg) How the Camel Got His Hump and The Crab That Played With the Sea. Best for read-alouds, the reader (parent) may ignore the lengthy superfluous identifiers of the pictures. Story illustrations are black woodcuts, to which the author makes many references to the fact that he wasn't allowed to produce the illustrations in color. This becomes a tedious lament to the modern reader, who appreciates different media. The best thing about this edition is that it's lightweight, portable, attractive, and the paper and text make it easy to read. The disadvantage is the glued binding which tends to crack. Interestingly, this edition contains an Author File, Who's Who in the Stories, Some Things to Think About, Some Things to Do, Did You Know, and a Glossary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanciful and Imaginative","review":"My mother and I used to read the Just So Stories to each other when I was a child, and I have very fond memories of both the story, and the time spent with my mother reading these stories.

I think every parent should buy this book to read to his or her child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever seen","review":"I don't know if Amazon actually vets any of the books they sell from small publishers (if the company that puts this out can be called one). What this version of Just So Stories turned out to be is someone copying information off the internet, not bothering with formatting and printing a continuous book without even breaks between stories, introductions and even repeating lines at times.

The devil is appearing in diffent guises on April Fool's day on the ship Fidele, a story that had a lot of potential for greatness. Sadly, the \\"Confidence Man\\" (Satan) uses the same routine over and over, and he is far from fiendishly clever.

When I listened to this CD, I was horrified to hear that Mayall redid his vocals as well his piano and harp tracks on most of the songs that appear on this CD. Not only that, there were new drum tracks added as well. The adulteration of these songs was a terrible surprise for me. I hope that the original album \\"Back To The Roots\\" will be available on CD very soon.

Whyte has created an interesting approach to the Arthurian legend in placing it within a remnant of Roman Britain but the writing is at best ordinary and, at least this particular book, needs significant editing. (At over 700 pages this one just drags on and on.)I keep reading the series because I enjoy variations on the legend and Whyte may have created something more historically \\"accurate\\" than any of the other authors but I don't recommend The Saxon Shore to anyone other than Arthur junkies. Certainly reviews here that claim this is five star literature are overblown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!! Now we want more.","review":"This book completely holds up the tone and detail of the first three books. I find that I am more involved with the arthurian tale than ever before. With it's basis in what really may have happened it is more beleivable and accesable than many other tales. Also it is very exciting and for as many books as it may take it is incredibly fast paced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"With This Book Jack Whyte Leaves the readers wanting mre and more as he did with the previous books in the chronicles i anxously await the next book in the series.

Overall unremarkable next to so many other excellent historical fiction novels or just plain adventurous fantasy novels. This book would be much better if the characters weren't caricatures, if the dialogue wasn't so artificial, generally if the writing were up to the standards of the field. But I enjoyed it in the way that I sometimes enjoy junk food. So I don't care about the historical accuracy of this book, the problem with this book is the sophomoric writing and all-around sub-standard story-telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most tedious so far","review":"I'm sorry...the previous books in the series were interesting history, had me curious as to how Whyte would work the Arthurian legend in, and were exciting...while still leaving me with the impression that this was an author in serious need of an editor (the loss of 100 or so pages from each wouldn't have been missed).Sadly, at over 700 pages, this one could lose about 500. Every time the action and plot seem to be about to catch their groove, instead we get...nothing. Lots of ideas that lead nowhere in particular. And I know Whyte is keeping it readable, but do we really need Arthurian characters approaching each other with a \\"What's up?\\" Bleh.This one was certainly the dullest by far, with little payoff. I'll probably give another one in the series a try, but it will be awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saxon Shore --recommended","review":"I enjoy reading about distant times and I had read the first two of this series as books and enjoyed them This is the fourth and I can tell I have missed the intervening book so will have to order that . This early period in British history when Romans and Romanized Britons were trying to survive the chaos left behind when the Roman administrators and armies left Britain in the 400s AD ;and had to face the local Celts tribes as well as the beginning Saxon invasion ( not to mention Danes in the north ) makes for fascinating reading if sometimes violent descriptions of action. It has the added attraction of treating the Arthur myth as historical fact. It is good fiction writing even if one does not buy it as historical truth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Whyte is truly a master plausible mythology!","review":"I have read many books about Arthurian lore. The Camulod chronicles are by far the quintesential embodiment of a truly page-turning series. Realistic characters unencumbered by aimless fantasy and unrealistic sorcerey give The Camulod Chronicles what the Arthurian legend has been lacking for centuries;Humanity,and believable plot progression. Caius Merlyn Brittanicus is to be praised as the most respectable and admirable embodiment of young Arthur's guardian ever. Whyte's books have explained in a clever and plausible fashion many of the confusing mysteries of the Arthurian realm, such as the connection between Excalibur and the mysterious Lady of the Lake. Magnificent! Our only hope is that Jack Whyte will grace us with more installments of the Arthurian legacy. Three cheers for Jack Whyte!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Train Wreck continues...","review":"I have to wonder to myself why I even bother to continue reading this man's work (see my previous reviews of the earlier volumes). If he wrote purely as fantasy the world would pass him off as a hack, but as a writer of historical fiction he should be drummed out of the club. Has the man never read even the basics of Celtic culture? Surely with all the hundreds of books available on the subject he should be able to find something! His knowledge of the era is fascinatingly scanty and he fills it in with such wild speculation that one is tempted to believe tha aliens are at work. The plot, once again, happens -- there is no reason for anything to happen, but it happens anyway. The characters are caricatures. The relation to the Arthurian legends is even scantier then the relation to history. This man is an awful writer. Camelot 3000 is more plausible than this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre biography of a terrible man","review":"Moderately engrossing, this book could have been a far better and accurate assessment of a man's life if the author had had a more balanced approach and not such a jealous crusade to completely anihilate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written study of a fascinating, corrupt man","review":"How sad it is read such a poorly written and conceived book about such an interesting subject!

Probably not, she was so sweet, with wisdom beyond her years. I actuallydidn't see any villans in the book, truth be told. As for the waythe book ended, I felt it was a bit abrupt, because we don't actually get to hear Sarah tell Ben her secret, and because I wanted an actual wedding ceremony & an epilogue of their life withkids & a ranch years later. Also, the book was a bit of a slowstarter, the angst, if you could call it that, didn't start until sometime after the first 50 pages.

Vivaldi performed on these old instruments isn't the Vivaldi your parents listened to. Fabulous musicianship, thoughtful interpretation, rich instrument tones and \\"front row\\" accoustics make recording magic. I'm buying a quantity for holiday gift giving.

I only hope that the Prince got to hear it like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exuberant, beautiful","review":"I doubt that Vivaldi's been played with this much exuberance and delicacy since the 18th century.

It doesn't matter what price they charge for this turkey, it would be too much. It's a total wash from start to finish. The graphics are laughingly bad, and the vehicle physics...well, WHAT vehicle physics? Your ATV moves like it's glued to the ground, and there are no spills no matter how fast you run into something. There is a variety of play modes, but all of them are repetitive and boring. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kawasaki ATV Powersports","review":"I own just about every car and motorcycle game there is. In terms of quality I would put Motocross Madness 2 at the top and this game at the absolute bottom. If I could give it less than one star, I would. It's hard to imagine that anyone would sell a game this primitive today, especially at the price they ask. In addition to the bad graphics and physics, it would not allow me to use my favorite motorcycle controller (Microsoft Freestyle Pro) so I ended up using the keyboard. How bad is that? Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a demo first","review":"I downloaded a demo of this game before I was going to buy it and it [is bad]! The atv does come off the ground but not very much , and try to imagine the worst possible arcade racer, and you know how when you steer it is extremely jerky well thats how it is in this game pretty bad. Search for the demo first if you like that then buy the POS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by producer's poor judgement","review":"What the hell is a standup bass doing on this cd? Why do some producers feel compelled to ruin the music by introducing inapprpriate and irrelevant noises? The Kora is a very very DELICATE instrument. Mixing in a standup bass on this cd is just a bad idea.

Unknown to us my son's grandparents also bought him a harvester made by another brand. I was disappointed thinking that the excitment would be gone over the harvester I planned to give him the next morning. When my son opened my gift he was more then excited because this harvester was far superior than the other one with many more workable, kid-friendly features. Thank you for making this a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of their best,but worthwhile for early material.","review":"This should not be measured against the band's best material,but rather looked upon as a step towards the fine mid 70's output.The studio version of \\"Still in love with you\\" (later to become a live favourite)makes it's first appearance here with Frankie Miller guesting on vocals.\\"She knows\\" is probably the next most memorable track , epitomising a softer side to the band's work which was to become increasingly scarce as the decade proceeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's right...more copying!","review":"Can you believe they did it again?

Well I will not buy nor would I recommend any of the bruder line of trucks. They are just plastic and with that very brittle plastic.

Based on his knowledge of mollusks and their habitat requirements (he's also a marine biologist), he has used the record of molluscan fossils to reconstruct the way the Florida peninsula was built over the last 30 million or so years.

I was expecting a high-quality product from the likes of Motorola. Boy was I wrong! The audio clarity of these radios is terrible... to the point that you cannot understand the other party. Audio quality is muffled, muddy, and distorted. Also annoying is the fact that when you key the mic, there is a slight delay (~500ms) before the other radio's squelch is opened resulting in the first few syllables lost during transmission. Being an amateur radio (ham) operator, I am very familiar with the operation of hand-held radios. With these radios I found myself continuously saying \\"please repeat...\\" to the other party. Steer clear of these radios!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reception is not clear","review":"I bought a pair of motorola talkabout last year and wanted another pair this year.

I carefully read the instructions and my wife and I decided to try them out. We were disappointed because the sound quality is very poor and the range doesn't seem to be much better if it is better at all!. It appears that the speaker in this radio the problem. When listening to the old radios to someone using the new radios, the sound quality is good but when listening on the new radios (The GMRS radio) the sound quality is very poor and we are repeating our messages a lot. We might try to use them with earpieces to see if we there is any improvement in the sound, if not we'll try to return these radios.Don't by these radios unless you want to repeat every message several times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please reissue","review":"This opera should be reissued.

Each knife receives color photos and a vivid history of its makers, purposes, and how it fits into the knife world. Essential for knife collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing","review":"The good news: great photos, excellent design. The bad news: absolutely atrocious writing. Pointless captions for every photo. The author states the obvious, gives a tiny bit of background info, raises questions he never answers, and finds a way to say \\"par excellence\\" to describe every other knife in this book. Reading this book is like standing next to a guy at a party who jabbers away for three hours and never says anything important. But the photos really are quite nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"great blade","review":"This is an excellent blade for the money. The action is super smooth and fast.

I remember being in awe during the fight scenes, and wondering how a character could be macho and sensitive at the same time, but Nico Tuscani (Segal) is, and he does it so well that one has to wonder if this character is close to his real personality. His acting of the part did not seem as forced.You will like this one if you like action films about good cops trying to bring down bad govenment/police. It is not as predictable as it sounds, but it isn't as original as one would hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Segal's First And One Of His Best","review":"Like many bargain priced eighties Above The Law is a bare bones DVD with no features to speak of. However at 9.99 no one is going to buy this movie for the features even though a commentary would have been nice. As for the movie,Above The Law is a hands down action classic. This was the debut of one the early nineties biggest action stars Stevn Segal. The direction by Andrew Davis was tense and the fight sequences are cool.

My wife is constantly asking that I make BBQ for dinner now, and when we have family reunions, everybody's asking for a recipe. I don't consider myself a master chef, and before I read this book, my BBQ was nothing to write home about. But now I'm making platters that satisfy even the most demanding appetites. I can barbecue chicken, I can barbecue pork, I can barbecue ribs, I can barbecue beef. I even tried barbecuing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich once; didn't turn out as well as I'd predicted.

Well, this movie goes to show that bad acting and dialogue were always a part of his repertoire, but in the best possible way. The great thing to notice in this master piece of American cinema is that you can still see Seagal with his own hair, way before the doll hair surgery.

I was expecting an in-depth book about the breed, with information about these dog's pecularities and how to deal with them. This book is funny, the stories and cartoons are cute, but the information is too general. There are no helpful hints for dealing with a Bassett's quirks, and the author, basically describes the breed as lazy and uncooperative, whereas, I have found my own Bassett to be a loveable, trainable playful dog.

This book heavily relies on questions posted by people on newsgroups for its content to describe how a basset hound is different from other breeds. That's fine, but it never answers any of those questions. For example, one newsgroup passage is from someone who is having problems removing drool from the walls without removing the paint, and the book just ends the topic without saying how you can do this. (By the way, from trial and error, we've discovered the Mr. Clean Magic Erasers work like a charm) This gives the whole book the tone, \\"Yep, bassets do that. Isn't that cute! Get used to it.\\" If you're looking for a book that accurately describes some of the peculiarities of bassets, this is a good book.

Anyone already ensnared will find themselves saying, \\"my dog does that too,\\" or \\"how did she know that?\\"These dogs are different and so are those of us with whom they share their lives. The book gives a great deal of good, practical information as opposed to some which try to apply esoteric theories or ideas best suited to other breeds. More importantly, it gives the reader a real taste of what life with this breed can be like.These dogs aren't for everyone -- but those once truly smitten rarely go astray -- search the web and you will find links and rings galore. More than once I laughed out loud causing my snoozing lap basset to glance up at me to ensure that everything was as it should be and that I wasn't about to get up and disturb his post-dinner nap.I have several books on bassets and this, by far, is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all Basset owners!","review":"This book is a wonderful loving look at the charming basset hound.

There are lengthy quotes of email discussions which are archived on the related sites, the \\"email joke\\" about taking pictures of puppies that I remember getting in my email at least 3 different times and can find on at least 2 web sites, and more. That in and of itself isn't that bad, but in a book of its list price, I expect some original content. I expect tons of information from the author's experience raising countless bassets. While the anecdotes are amusing, and at least part of why I bought it, they come across as a poorly organized web site: random and chaotic. If you are going to stick a price like that on a book, it had better be more than a cut'n'paste from past email discussions with a little commentary thrown in. Bottom line?

The approach is student oriented and is very much supplemental. I thought there would be a little more to it, for the teacher, but you have to sort of wing it.

Unfortunately I now live in an area that doesnt have an asian market. I came on here to order some and I thought the price was kinda spendy for so little. I used to get these all the time, in the previous place I used to live I used to get the 16.4 ounce bottles for 3.95. they sent me 2 16.4 ounce bottles instead of 4 6.4 ounce bottles, so I actually got 6 ounces more than normal but at 2X the cost. but considering shipping was spendy and it took a month for them to get here, at 25$ for 2 bottles I will never be doing this again. buyer beware, if you are looking to get some of these, its in your best interest to contact someone from another town and have them look for you, itd be far cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"Very cool toy for my 2 1/2 year old son!

Fun to look at not very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fragile","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old son despite reading the reviews that it was somewhat fragile. It didn't last a week before the backhoe broke off the back. The loader didn't last much longer. It is a neat toy - it has a lot of detail and moving parts - so might be good for display or gentle play, but definitely not good for the sandbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Not tough enough","review":"While a fun toy, this toy has already broken since my son's first used only 10 days ago on his birthday. The loader part just broke off. Guaranteed, he has been using it in the sand box and at the beach and is not exactly easy on his toys.If you want a toy for inside the house, this will work great, but if you are looking for something durable for the beach or sand box, or if your child is relatively rough on toys, I don't recommend this one.We have other Bruder toys that are much more durable than this one.

Trumpet players will want to get to know these pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palm Headset Dissapointing","review":"I have a Treo 650, and wanted a headset that paired easily, didn't lose the connection constantly, and had good sound quality. Considering that this is made by Palm for the Treo, I assumed it would be the best choice. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. The cool-looking metal case is basically a throw-away, the piece that the headset must fit into for charging is just another small piece that can be easily lost (why can't you just plug a charger directly into the headset??), and the bluetooth pairing is constantly dropping.It is relatively easy to use, comfortable, and the sound quality is ok - though not that impressive. The rubber earpiece is constantly falling off as well.For the price I guess it's not a bad option, but if this is the best Palm can do I'm pretty underwhelmed.I guess this goes in-line with the Treo itself in my opinion...underwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless--died within a day","review":"I waited for this thing to become available. Wasted my time. It never would charge with my Palm charger and charged only once with battery set up.

I honestly think this product should be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate the item with Negative stars, I would.","review":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. It was overly optimistic of me to think this product would work dispite the other review. The headset would not charge with the included charger. The charger included was a joke, one of the poorest designed products I have ever seen. To make this set up work in anything other than perfect conditions would take an act of god or like diety, or liberal use of duck tape and rubber bands to maintain charger connection. But hey, it looks cool even though 2 cans and a string are more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got a defective one!","review":"I purchased mine from the Palm online store. The actual headset would not snap into the charger so that it would charge effectively. It was more like gravity allowed it to charge. I spent a number of hours trying to get it to work. I called technical support a few times, to get offshort support. After numerous hours and steps, I was told that I had a defective device, and I will be sending it back. Reviewing an online message board, I found out that others had similar problems and that some of the units were defective, and was encouraged to get the new plantronics 655 or the samsung wep 200. I'm unhappy with the tech support I received from Palm. After persistently dealing with them, they admitted that the device I had was defective. I expected much more from a company that I have been purchasing from for quite a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Headset I have ever owned!","review":"Despite some of the other reviews on this headset, I decided I'd go with my insticts. I have not had any of the problems mentioned in the other reviews regarding the charging, and the sound quality is great. I owned a Sony Ericcson, didn't like it, sold it, bought a Motorola H700 (big mistake), didn't like it, sold it. I had seen the Palm Ultra Light Weight Bluetooth headset originally made by Plantronics. When I saw that Palm had \\"bought the rights\\" to the design and made it compatible with my Treo's charger, I had to have one.

By focusing on the ideological construction of late Nineteenth-century Palestine in the American imagination, Obenzinger shows that this imagination contains much more than meets the eye of those who only look at the domestic spaces of Melville and Twain. Both writers traveled to Palestine, and the texts they produced about these experiences have been deeply and intimately related to their perceptions of, and contributions to, U.S. national culture, which has been obsessed, as the book so persuasively shows, with images and beliefs about \\"the Holy Land.\\" Obenzinger writes beautifully about Melville's melancholic and Twain's humorous treatment of Palestine and its significance for U.S. culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"The magnet I received was not as pictured on the web site.

Prior viewers of the US series will recognize certain episodes almost immediately, however there remains a great deal in the UK series that was not repeated in the US version, and other plot lines that are similar but varied between the series.The accents can be little difficult to pick up in the beginning, but it gets easier after you view a few episodes.While the ensemble cast in the US version was strong from top to bottom, the UK series belongs to Philip Glenister as Gene Hunt. The Sam in this series seems particularly weak in the presence of DCI Gene Hunt, and the actors playing Ray and Chris tend to fade into the background, although I found this version of Annie a bit more lively.All in all, this series is entertaining to watch and a nice change of pace from US summertime TV viewing. Be warned: nudity standards are different on UK TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"And now for something different...","review":"This episode departs from the main storyline where Sam's trying to figure out how to get home and goes for something different.

Is man inherently EVIL, and simply obeys the constraints of society because he is afraid of getting caught, or is man inherently good?

The illustrations alone make it worth the money. As an aquatic entomologist who teaches an aquatic entomology lab to college students, I find this book to be an invaluable source of high quality images for use in my classes. The pictorial keys are also very helpful - they are very easy to follow and make it almost a simplistic task for a lay person to identify aquatic insects down to the family level. Some of these keys are a little outdated since publication of the book, but they are still helpful for the most part.My only complaint with this book is that it doesn't go into as much scientific detail as is necessary for a serious student of entomology. Still, this isn't meant to be a textbook or an identification manual for complex identifications lower than the family level. If the book is used as intended by fishermen and ecologists, this is a very helpful book.And did I mention the ilustrations are amazing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking general information too Technical, good graphics.","review":"I ordered from mail service and wish I hadn't.

The guys from Philadelphia have charted out monster hits from their four bestsellers: II, Evolution, Cooleyhighharmony, and Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya. This collection also consists of strong duets with LL Cool J, and the burned out Mariah Carey.The group still remains very strong in music, despite the shift to those sleeper teen idols. This is a great buy for any fan of Boyz II Men. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price of double CD is way too high!","review":"I would be better off with the single edition than the deluxe. The price is TOO HIGH for it in some stores--$27, $28, $34 or $32 in some places. This sounds more like a greed thing for Boyz II Men than the music itself. Plus the song selection isn't very well done with the remixes and other songs along with the hits. I liked the 13-song set of this album better than this bloated package. The high price for it is a complete turnoff and it should have been affordable for the consumer. While Boyz II Men get high marks for their music and harmonizing, this double CD packaging comes off as distracting and misguiding and not as well done as other artists' greatest hits' compilations."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent collection","review":"I love this CD.

Yes, they have the harmonies. Yes, they've got the voices. But, what they don't have is material worth listening to. Over the past decade (or their 5 years at the top), they have provided us with the most inane, dull, and unimaginative singles since, well, Mariah herself. But, the utterly mundane \\"One Sweet Day\\" couples both rather dull hitmakers, in a successful attempt to cash in on mid-90's contemporary fluff.

I also remember growing up listening to them and always hearing them on the radio. What great memories. I got to see them live back in 1995 and it was a spectacular performance. Still to this day, my favorite track by them is \\"On Bended Knee\\". It is a very inspiring track. Other outstanding tracks include \\"End Of The Road,I'll Make Love To You,A Song For Mama,Water Runs Dry,and It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday\\". Even though they still record and tour to this day, they may not be what they used to be back in this era, but they will always remain one of my favorite r&b/pop groups of all time. I recommend this album to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Legacy","review":"When we look back on the years of Boys II Men, we will all realize what great talent the had. Their tight sound and soothing harmony is throughout this cd. If you never heard them before, this cd shows you how they grew as artist. From hits like, \\"Water Runs Dry, to \\"End of the road, their music can either cry or make you get up and dance. Even their hit with LL Cool J, \\"Hey Lover\\", makes the cut.

Hoods is about a wise guy played by Joe Mantegna who is assigned by his father to kill somebody by the name of \\"Carmine Delaroza\\" who turns out to be a 9 year olds kid. Despite being sold as a comedy, this movie is not funny. The DVD is in full screen. No closed captioning (despite there is a CC on the back of the jacket). No Dolby 5.1 either. The picture quality is OK. Avoid this. Not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, well worth the time","review":"Mr. Bowden does a great job of of presenting the \\"in general\\" politics of the situation, the atmosphere, and at times captures the anger, frustration, and bewilderment of the persons involved. This is what I like about the book so much. It wasn't just information about what happened. After reading this I knew more about the world before my time, and I also knew more about why things are the way they are now. In addition to that, the involved reader will be taken through all the emotions that Mr. Bowden captures...From the confusion of the first moments, coming up with ways to cope, desperate attempts to escape, and finally being released and coming to grips with how surreal the experience was. In short, this book was both informative and an experience (well, if you empathize with what you read).This book was my first by Mark Bowden, and it was so good I went on to read Killing Pablo, and Black Hawk Down which are both equally as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great , informative book!","review":"Great book. I found it especially interesting and insightful, as someone who was a kid during the Iran hostage crisis, and remembers it strictly through the prism of childhood. The book gives a very detailed description of the embassy takeover and of the long ensuing ordeal of the collective and individual hostages. It also helps to give some historical perspective on why the Iranians hated the US and what events led to the crisis. All in all, a very interesting and informative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"***You will Think you Were There While it Happened!****","review":"When the American Embassy in Iran was overrun by radical students, I like most Americans followed the story very closely. This book was an eye opening experience as to what happened on the inside. How the hostages were mistreated, starved, and beaten by radicals. But, they were also treated with kindness by some of the radicals, which I had never heard before. The only fault that I have with the book is that it seemed to finish up much more quickly than it started and you feel a little cheated. Overall a good book. I admire how the hostages handled themselves and how they were able to continue on with their lives when they got released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Research Pays Off Again","review":"Bowden has done it again. Balancing multiple storylines to weave together a thorough understanding of the crisis. Of course the story of Desert One helps lift the book beyond its dominant political themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For someone who loved Black Hawk Down this book was a huge disappointment. Very slow moving, excessively detailed and ultimately boring, I am sorry to say I gave up before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is essentially a detailed repetition of the same set of circumstances from the point of view of each hostage. It's a good book but if it was twice as long and included more details of how the crisis impacted more people, it could have been a great book. Perhaps Bowden is saving something for another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this review","review":"because I bought the book after reading the hype, expecting that the coverage of the Delta One and Eagle Claw missions would be thorough. I went to high school with one of the C130 pilots who died during this mission, and I wanted to read what happened to him. Unfortunately, Bowden couldn't find a way to include the identities of all of the eight casualties, and when I realized that, I put the book down and will not read it. I apologize to the readers who enjoyed this book- my expectations were not met, and I refuse to read it. The omission was too much for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, a true page turner","review":"This book reveals history in a manner that is personal, reflective, and relevant today. The level of detail is does not slow down the reader, but gives you a desire for more information. This true story is an important one and Bowden does a fantastic job telling it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iranian politics made simple","review":"Using the hostage taking of 1979 as a nucleus Mark Bowden is able to relate pre revolution Iranian history with the overthrow of Reza Palavi, Hatred of the US, return of Khomeni and the downward spiral that crushed the hopes of millions of educated Iranians... for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSION GALACTICA: UNIVERSAL ATTACKS","review":"Im very disappointed. This is actually a butchered verson of THE LIVING LEGEND, a two-parter, with a few unseen special effects from the series. The problem here is they cut off the ending of the two-parter, and replaced it with the finale of THE FIRE IN SPACE, another Galactica episode that came later in the series. Having seen LIVING LEGEND in its entirety on TV, I can say they sacrificed drama for spectacle by deleting or shortening several key sequences of character interaction. The end of the tape is an abomination, a mess of bad editing and confusing dialogue that makes no sense, having been a paste of the endings of two different stories. LETS HOPE UNIVERSAL RELEASES \\"THE LIVING LEGEND\\" INTACT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What an atrocity!","review":"This is the WORST Battlestar Galactica video out there! They took two of the best episodes of the series and mashing them together to try to make a movie out of it but instead succeeded in creating a confusing mishmosh of the episodes. Oh, and to a previous reviewer that noted that Adama wasn't injured in \\"The Living Legend\\", you are right. But he WAS injured in \\"Fire in Space\\" - guess Universal thought the scene was good enough to throw in just for some angst.DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO! IT'S AN INSULT TO \\"GALACTICA\\" FANS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Er, not good","review":"I was 12 when this series orignally came out. Now, twenty years later, the episode that used to be my favorite, \\"The Living Legend,\\" is obviously, well, underwhelming. The editing of the Fire in Space footage was horrible, just an excuse to extend this \\"movie\\" by another 20 or 30 minutes. There was really no speculative element to this movie at all, which was the problem with most of the BG episodes. It was just another simple-minded shoot-em-up, an excuse to replay their fx another dozen or so times each. Now that I'm not a kid anymore, I realize the episodes I used to like the least are in fact the best -- episodes like War of the Gods and The Long Patrol where the cylons were not really involved and there were some provocative, speculative ideas. It figures now that I'd really like to see War of the Gods, it's unavailable on video. Oh well. Also: why in the world were the sound effects for the cylon ships moving through space changed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slaves in Dreamland","review":"Set in Tokyo's red light district, specifically at the Dreamland brothel, the movie examines the lives of five prostitutes, focusing especially on their virtual enslavement to the prostitution system because they are never able to escape it economically and make it on the \\"outside.\\" One woman attempts it by marrying a poor man, but finds married life to this man even more oppressive than prostitution. Another, a widow, has raised her son with the profits of her trade - only now that he's grown he is embarrassed by his mother and disowns her (she goes insane). It's a social protest movie against an economic (and societal) system that offers limited choices for women to make a living, other than in the world's oldest profession. Director Kenji Mizoguchi's poignant swan song, and he approaches his subject artfully and honestly. An excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best radio i ever used","review":"This is the best radio I ever used the range is incredible.

The only saving grace for this toy is that it has a giant picture of Diego on it. The structural design is extremely poor. It says pop up tent but all it is, is two small rods that you insert into the sides. These do NOTHING for the integrity of the tent. It collapses with a strong breath! It actually trapped by 16 month old in it! Out of desperation I cut a wrapping paper tube to fit across the top and hot glued it in, hoping that would keep the tent stretched out enough for the kids to play in, but that still didn't work, so I hot glued the bottom of the back of the tent to the base board of the wall.

I'm not sure this book is bad so much as it is only ridiculous. Having read Sweet Savage Eden, I was curious about its sequel, and that curiosity did not pay off for me. A Pirate's Pleasure is a pale shimmer of its predecessor, with characters and dialogue so disparate from the first that I had to wonder if indeed the same author penned both books. Any book in which the heart of a knight lies within the (perfect, of course) physique of a pirate immediately gets slated as \\"humor\\" in my mind. On the bright side, at least some of the cover art isn't your typical Barbie doll stuff--the portrait of Skye Kinsdale on the spine and the back cover looks much like Sigourney Weaver after battling the aliens. Pretend you don't see this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pirates Pleasure Will Provide The Ultimate Pleasure and Fascinate you!","review":"I have a three letter word that describes this book. \\"OMG!! Ok, \\"omg\\" is not a word but its the best word, letters, or slang to describe this fabulous book.The man and the girl are not just perfect but born for each other. The chemistry is outrageous. Sky is one of my most favorite female characters so far. She is strong even though she does have a few weakness's but that does not stop her from fighting for what she wants. I won't add to much more because the first 2 chapters will tell you everything you need to know. I have read over 100 books this year so far and over 300 last year and this book was the most unpredictable. The twist in this book made A Pirates pleasure my favorite book of all time! If you have not read this book then please do asap.

Hide the cover with a paper bag and forget you ever saw it, because it is not indicative of the story's worth. This book was well-written and engaging from the very first page. The plot line was actually so well concealed that I was completely taken by surprise at where it was going, in a very, very good way. After reading the book, I went back and re-read the one-star reviews and realized that those women had either given up and thrown the book away (gasp!) before they got to the plot spoiler, OR they were feminists who were much MUCH to eager to cry rape. There absolutely was NO rape in this book.This is a great book, despite the cover, and gave me two days of mini-vacation right in my house.

I will say, however, that after reading this book I had to go burn it in my kitchen sink. Not in a censorship kind of way, more like a spiritually cleansing kind of way. I know some of the older romance novels often included a rape scene as a convenient way to explain why a character lost her virtue (and therefore could continue to sleep with the hero) but the rape in this book (which does not come at the hands of the pirate) is beyond belief. The fact that the main character is content to stay and fall in love with the man who rapes her goes against all my feminist sensibilites. This book is a gigantic waste of time.

It talks about the romance with her husband's cousin and him being a pirate. Then for a woman to be bedded by two men unwilling is not romance. Then to discover your pregnant and you don't know who the father is not romance. That's terrible! Save the trees do not print any more. If I could give this book a negative I would.

This is one tough broad, brought up on the mean streets of London, and her poignant struggle to escape the despair and poverty of the bottom rungs of British society and lead a productive life is truly inspiring.What is really amazing about this coming-of-age story, however, is the unusual direction it sudenly takes, leading her away from the Royal Navy and into the shadowy world of the SAS, where she risks her life almost daily in the deadly rowhouses of Northern Ireland. This is an angle on \\"The Troubles\\" you don't see much of.

If you don't find yourself bored out of your skull, then you'll be at least angered by the chauvinistic treatment of women and the 1970s opposition to women's liberation. It must be that when you have a bestseller, you can write whatever junk you want and it will get published.

Even the five star reviews posted on Amazon are unable to provide even a hint as to a plot.

Nothing he wrote before or since, is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous Puzo","review":"Sorry. I was very disappointed in this book. Frankly, at times it was a struggle to read. The story was good, the characters believeable, but something was lacking. I'm still not sure if I would term Merlyn as deep or shallow. Here's a man who loves his wife yet holds a lifelong, cross country affair wth a bisexual actress. Please! The man was a series of contrasts. Maybe that is what Puzo was trying to bring out but he lost it on me. What I did, however, particularly enjoy, was how Puzo brought the \\"beginning\\" of the book to the climax. That was genius.

It portrays a sinful side of an exceptional good person. Its all about the flawed choices of life - How people become consumed to lust, power and violence in a city like Las Vegas, New York and Holly wood. Its a page turner as you read through the pages with the main character John Merlyn and the scenes behind the publishing house and movie production in the mid of the book. Osano, Artie and Janelle indulge in a bad game of lust n kill n hook to series of scenes thru the story with the sex scenes more pitchy to read tilting away from the grip to read.

You wanna know the heart of a frustrated by confident writer/artist? Here it is. You wanna deal with the best fictional characterization of Norman Mailer every written, here it is.

Leave it to Hollywood to pass on this classic. I have always loved Puzo,(The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time), and with \\"Fools Die\\" he once again shows why he has no peers when it comes to story-telling. Beyond all the glitter of Las Vegas and Hollywood, Puzo simply tells a great story, and I loved the characters, especially Merlyn and of course, the great \\"Osano\\".(Wouldn't it have been wonderful to see who would have played him in the movie?) One minor complaint. I've always felt that the Janelle character was overdone, that perhaps she should have been written out completely. For a while I wasn't sure why, but I think now it is because I wanted Merlyn to be just like his brother Artie, \\"the only faithful husband left in New York City:\\". Oh well, just a personal preference, and this really is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book can seem better than it really is","review":"I've read this novel twice. Once, when I was younger and I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read. The second time I found everything that I liked the first time to be unbelievable this time around. Puzo is a very limited writer. He can write a certain type of character very convincingly, but when everyone in all his novels is just a certain shade of a single personality, you start dying for a little variety in the people you're reading about. Trust me. This book can seem better than it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"I am a big Mario Puzo fan. Great book, couldn't put it down...will read over & over again.

I would rate it up along with THE GODFATHER. I think Mario Puzo's way of intangling the reader in the story is a gift few writers have. It is hard to find writers who do not care about the fads of this modern world, and write books that describe their train of thinking, not what will sell. Although, I am merely a teenager, Mario Puzo is my literary inspiration. FOOLS DIE was the best book I have read in some time. Personally what fancied me was the opening and conclusion of the book. The Characters were superb, along with the story line. Without Puzo there would not have been great Family, Gambling, Las Vegas, or Mafia novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great William Haines movie","review":"This is another great William Haines movie with any funny scenes.

I recommend this book to anyone 13 years or older. It contains thrills, suspense, and many unpredictable close calls. If you are adventurous this book will hold your interest. \\"She may drown\\" Frank thought fearfully. The boys were very adventurous and brave to swim after the drowning animals. Another reason would be that the Hardy boys are heroes. \\"Look out!\\" Frank cried out. He grabbed Joe's arm and both boys leaped ahead in the nick of time. No matter difficult the situation, they never get hurt. They always come out the good guys. The Hardy boys think over each clue carefully so they out smart everyone. In conclusion, if you like a mystery novel where the main characters end up heroes, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!!","review":"... This book is excellent; definately one of the top three of the series. The action starts on page 1 and doesn't let up until the book is finished. Hunting For Hidden Gold has perhaps the best mystery out of all of the books in the series and is written quite well unlike most of the books put out after the early 1950s. The book is very exciting, as quite often Frank and Joe are chasing, or being chased by, the criminals. Definately one of the best, no Hardy Boys fan should miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exiting, Fun, and a little Scary!","review":"If you like to explore secret passage ways or disguise yourself as someone else, if you like to go on adventures and fight the bad guy while solving a mystery, than this is the book for you.

So of course you still need to do a little bit more digging to confirm what he says is true.All together, it is an awesome book that people should read to become aware of how we in America have become so tolerant of the jezebel spirit.

This novel demonstrates his brilliance through a narrative filled with humor, evil, indifference and pathos. \\"The Book of Evidence\\" is just that. It is a document based upon the narrator's confession while in court. Banville uses this vehicle well in describing an almost everyman who without care seems to live his life as if he were just outside of it and looking in. Although thoughtful and careful while confessing, the narrator seems to leave those traits behind throughout his life as if he were passing through it. His relationships are all tenuous and leave him with nothing of which to hold on. His sanity slowly loses its grip as well via his inability to cope with reality through desperate actions he takes in hopes of remediating a debt which was in and of itself bereft of any thought.

I knew absolutely nothing about forensic accounting, and never thought I'd want to.

But that is not the only issue here. First, the subject is supposed to be investigating corporate fraud. As another reviewer noted, however, the only subject covered is computer techniques. The actual tracking of the fraud never really appears in any detail. I was expecting a tale of actual processes and insights into actual crimes; however, the book stops short at the recovery of information from computers. The interesting part would be how one piece of info leads to another and suggests other places to look. But nothing is looked at that closely, so the excitement is lost. I also agree with the other reviewer that the relevance of the dog-mauling case is tangential at best. Even in chapters with strong subject matter, such as the investigation of the swiss handling of jewish acounts, the prose is lifeless and conclusory; it does not follow the trail of the adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"boring and not in depth. if you are looking for an adventure, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Just received this brand of castor oil.

I, like the other reviewer who said this, skate to this all the time, and there aren't very many other CDs that can stay in my portable CD player as much as this. There is one problem, and that is that the music is really not catchy enough. The lyrics aren't very well written, but I love the great instrumentalism that these guys put into their music.

It's more metal than their earlier stuff and less metal than their later stuff.

One minor problem, however.... they both blew up ( music stops, 60 Hz humm, then smoke) after a few hours of use at moderate, not even loud volume. The fuses did not blow, the internal heat sensing thermistor didnt do its job, so now both of the amps and the woofers are fried. The humm is now prsent whether the amp is turned to on, auto, or off. Any speaker input or line level input to the unit makes no difference. The only way to prevent complete meltdown and possibly a house on fire is to unplug the unit. there are no obvious fried/charred components on either circuit board.

The problem lies with a resistor that is undersized (cheaper) which blows and blows the power supply capacitors which are not exactly robust either.

It was on a 100w receiver that barely got turned up beyond 1/4 volume, but yes, occasionally it got cranked. So I took it to and electronics guru friend of mine who looked it over and and stated that the amp was built with inferior circuits, and that to rebuild it with quality circuits would be worth more than the ASW10-120 if it were brand new. My advise: Do not buy it. Just google ASW10-120 problems. If you think you will not be cranking your sound up very loud then you don't need a sub, but if going to crank it up buy something that can handle the power. Like I said this 120w sub was on a 100w receiver. It didn't last."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep away","review":"...This makes a terrible humming noise. I tested the driver and it's not it.

Truly incredible: the subtle but effective emotional range, the rich sonorities, the creative problem solving of inherent incongruities of transcribing cello works for (breathed) recorder. But why not? What a match. Recorder is similar in some voicings to the organ, and Bach certainly had that lodged in his mental ear. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who loves the suites, and enjoys exploring Bach's capacity for nuance. (Which some of us think is huge, and not metronomic.) Verbruggen takes no more liberties than some cellists (or lutenists, which have also transcribed his suites). Much clearer, some things are revealed, than with bowed or plucked strings, I think. Like his organ music, but of course only with a virtuoso musician playing with the heart of Bach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again!","review":"This work is both long (nearly 500 pages) and recently published (2003) so it woud be easy to assume that some new information would be presented about the colourful hstory of the Grimaldi family. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Mr. Taraborelli retells the same story of the \\"fairy tale gone wrong\\" that has been related in countless other books and magazines in the decades following the death of Grace de Monaco. Further, the author's plodding, amateurish and hackneyed style makes the task of searching for any new revelations a tedious one indeed.

Entertaining throughout, and teaches you a lot about the life of Lewis."},{"rating":"2","title":"a solid contribution to Lewis studies","review":"Jacobs' volume is a valuable contribution to Lewis studies; much more than a re-presentation of otherwise already well-known material. Written from a literary perspective; solid and highly readable (a nice combination). Informed and informative. Perhaps because of its particular focus, this book not quite as personally vivid a presentation as the Sayer or Green/Hooper biographies. It is conversational in style at times, but not gratingly so. Not hagiagraphy in either personal or literary senses. The only major drawback would be the format of the end-notes; neither numbered nor keyed to pages, but simply listed in order by chapters, they take much, much longer to check than other note forms. Good interaction with with other writers on Lewis as well as contemporary controversies on Lewis' writings. Definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title of a Book on C.S. Lewis","review":"One would think that with the title, THE NARNIAN, you would find some relationship between C.S. and THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, but the author writes few details of that relationship that would make interesting reading. Instead, Jacobs goes off on tangents that have no relationship to Naria nor THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. The book relates mostly about the relationships between other authors and Lewis, main Tolkien.

The final song, Half A Moment was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and I have never seen it before, but on this CD. At the time of this CD Sarah had a fantastic vocal teacher, and her style shows it. This CD is as close to the voice of Christine as I have heard her since the original sound track of Phantom of the Opera. She and A.L. Webber did this CD together, one of the last things they did together before their divorce. It's a great addition to any Broadway collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAYBE FOR BROADWAY MUSICAL LOVERS","review":"As a beginning Sarah Brightman fan, I purchased \\"The Songs That Got Away\\" simply because it featured \\"SARAH BRIGHTMAN.\\" Carried away by her name, I purchased an album I do not enjoy listening to at all.

This recording shows how Sarah's voice has changed over the years of training. Her opera aria \\"Chi il bel sogno di Doretta\\" was recorded when she started singing opera and her quality is not rich but still good. In this recording her voice does not sound nasal like it did in the original Phantom of the Opera, that I do not like so much. Her present performances of the songs from Phantom are great. Try Surrender. That recording is excellent. You will hear a Sarah in the splendor of her voice. This is not a bad recording but is not her best either. Mr. Monotony is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah, dear, you can really do much better than this","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of Sarah Brightman, but I was very dissapointed by this cd. Most of the songs didn't have a good melody, or lyrics, actually, I only liked the first song, Meadowlark. Sarah Brightman has a beautiful voice, but she didn't put it to very good use with this cd. Listen to it once and you'll know why these songs got away. Sorry Sarah, one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment","review":"Well, they should have let these songs stay lost. This was not very good at all. I did not like the song selection. Her voice was good, but the songs were rather limp; not what I call easy to listen to or to get into. I love it when she sings opera though, so maybe that is why I don not like this one at all. I suppose if you like show tunes that never were popular, you might like this CD. I should have listened to the previous posts!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why they got away","review":"I am a big fan of Ms. Brightman and own and enjoy a number of her CDs, but this one, frankly, is disappointing. She just cannot rescue music that lacks orignality and excitment. As a result, her deliveries are uninspired. There are few tracks on this CD worth listening to more than once. Alas! This case will be gathering dust unitl my next garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs That Should'nt Have Got Away","review":"I'm sure this album won't appeal to everyone but personally I love it. The standout tracks here (for me) are: Meadowlark, Mr. Monotony, Dreamers, Three-Cornered Tune, Away From You & If Love Were All. This album should appeal to lovers of obscure musical theatre songs and to fans of Sarah Brightman. I think this album shows that she is far more versatile a singer than people give her credit for. The reason I have given this a 4 star rating instead of 5 is because the album was recorded on a lower volume so you have to turn it up a bit, but that is a very small quibble about an otherwise great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Listener, Do You Know Any of THESE Songs?","review":"This album is \\"no longer made,\\" but I happened to find the only available copy of this album at the Virgin Megastore on Union Square here in New York City.

It is about a girl named Sally who moves to a new home in Florida, leaving her friends behind. That's pretty much it. It tells how she adjusts to her new home and tries to follow her dreams of becoming a ballerina. This book has no plot, detail, or consistency. The only historical aspect is a couple of references to World War II. Like we haven't had enough of THOSE books. Here's a tip, just save your money and borrow it from the local library. The plot is so inert, I cannot even remember anything to describe almost. If you had to choose between reading this book and watch Lawrence Welk with your parents, go for Lawrence Welk, there's more action in a segment of that than there is in the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents Beware","review":"My daughters and I have read or listened to many Judy Blume books and they have read many others. We have enjoyed them all. We picked this book on tape up at the library to listen to on a car trip. I was somewhat concerned about some of the language that was being used in the book and then became very concerned when the young characters started discussing their parents \\"doing it\\". At the second reference to \\"doing it\\" we turned off the tape. I was sure I must have made a mistake about the audience this was intended for. I read the back of the tape box again and it stated that the book was recommended for listeners ages 10 to 13. I don't know about other parents, but I definitely don't think the subject of \\"doing it\\" is appropriate for 10 to 13 year olds. I was very disappointed with this. Up to this point I had trusted that any July Blume book designated for juveniles would be of age appropriate subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was HORRIBLE!","review":"It is really really really really bad!

Very good book for low intermediate players.","review":"I remember reading this book in I think 1997 or 1998 when I was in the USCF 1000-1300 range. The moniker \\"short and sweet\\" applies to it well.What Dunnington has basically done is choose many examples of positions and games where pawn play has decided the day. For advanced players, the book is more entertaining than educational, but for fairly new tournament players, it shows that pawns should not be taken lightly. I would even say that this book has left some lasting influences on my play today, as I gained an appreciation for pawns--the pawn is my favorite chess piece. I am not claiming to be a pawn-play expert, but it does strike me how poorly some Class B and A players use pawns in their play!Imaginative pawn play can definitely make a difference in your results. This is not an indispensible work, but it is well done if you choose to get it. In general, I think Dunnington is a good (though not great) chess author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I read reviews that compared this to the Oultlander series.

Given the choice, I would strongly urge someone to read The Outlander series instead. As a reviewer before noted, Diana Gabaldon's books really give you a feel for the past and more insight into the characters. Fallam's Secret so closely resembles The Outlander series, that I was able to predict many scenes and the end of the book. If you have already read Diana Gabaldon's books, go ahead and read this and see if you come to the same conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book to give as a gift.","review":"BESIDE THE SLEEPING MAIDEN was given to me as a gift. It's a beautiful book with poems by many of the talented poets who live in Marin County, California. The anthologist, C.B. Follett, is a poet and an artist; and she has applied both those qualities to the production of this volume. The book has a luminous jacket and various drawings among its poems. The wonderful, thought-provoking but eminently readable poems float in a sea of white, so one can see and think about each one separately. This makes it an excellent book for people like me who always try to read and do too much. I can open it up anywhere at random and spend either a little or a lot of time with it. In fact I like BESIDE THE SLEEPING MAIDEN so much that I've bought several copies and given them away as gifts. ...Susan Terris"},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF!","review":"I bought my cartridge for the first time on the net, at Amazon.com rather then best buy to save a whopping 10 dollars!

Back then they had a lead guitarist named Danny who really burned and the most exciting bass player, of any genre, I had ever seen named Smutty Smiff. That Rockats rocked, sort of a cross between the The Rolling Stones, The Clash and Gene Vincent, if you can imagine that! This version of the Rockats should be included on one of those \\"ULTRA-LOUNGE\\" Capital compilations of easy listening music. However; if you enjoy for rockabilly laid back with no bite or edge, bad dated song writing and with aimless soulless guitar playing then this CD is for you.

But home can also be a boring place, and sometimes a chance of pace and a twist here and there will remedy that. Well, twists and turns abound in this book, a departure from the previous 87 novels in its legnth, complexity of backstory, and nifty tidbits of info--from psychoanalysis to the training of the blind--to sustain readers' interests. The ending is classic McBain, blunt, to the point, and supremely satisfying. Not since \\"Sadie When She Died\\" has McBain produced so unique a novel in this incredibly durable series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat spring toy","review":"Pretty cheap, but pretty useless.

The product looks pretty different, and is a thinner gauge of plastic that seemed more flexible and possibly still fun for them.They both definitely had fun with the toys, but within a few minutes of not too rough play, the springs started to break apart and the cats started to try to eat the pieces. Luckily I was supervising them (as with any new toy), and was able to get the pieces away from them.Definitely fun for most cats, but I'm very concerned about the safety of this product. Please supervise your animal if you do choose to try these."},{"rating":"1","title":"these toys are potentially dangerous","review":"I also purchased these for my cats, and they did start to break.

Samsung couldn't fix it in August 2009 and quickly approved a refund for the $1,200 I paid for it from Amazon. Great, I thought.It's December 15, several calls to Samsung, and no refund check. Lots of excuses on why it hasn't been processed. Based on the many responses here, I doubt I'll ever receive the refund. I've had Sony products in the past and they always resolved problems with service. I've bought two Samsung monitors and other Samsung products, but I doubt I'll ever buy one again.

Sometimes the picture is normal, the other times it looks like static noise. Some times it will do this three or four times in a row, with me hoping it lands in a non-static noise state. It's random when it does this, sometimes it will do it every 10 minutes, maybe once a day.When it works, it looks nice.

I shipped it back, they did email me a label but only after I asked if I was expected to pay for shipping. I was then told they could not repair it nor did they have any in stock... seems strange. I have now, Nov. 16, 2009, faxed my receipt as they stated they would return my cost... not including taxes, shipping, recycling fees. You fooled me once samsung, never ever again.

Andrew Manze is breathtaking and amazing, to think it is only played by one man yet it seems like a full orchestra. The technique of the Devil's Sonata is estounding and truelly unigue and masterful, but with Manze it was made Heavenly. I was taken away by this CD and I think anyone with a true appreciation for beauty will be. I like to think Tartini would be proud of this performance.Angela."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding virtuosity","review":"This recording had been awarded by the Penguin Guide with a Rosette and recommended by Gramophone. It seems that everybody is in agreement. And you can't deny Manze virtuosity. But every time I play it, I want to call it Capriccio and not a Baroque Sonata. The decision to remove the accompaniment for these works was based on a letter Tartini wrote to Delalande on 1750 where he stated that he played the sonatas with the violin solo. He did wrote the accompaniment but it was customarily at that time to do so. And I guess at the end independently if the intentions of the composer were for this sonatas to be played with basso continuo or not, it's a matter of personal preference. I am little bit more conservative and like to listen it \\"a la Wallfisch\\" with the accompaniment. And yes Manze's CD it's a great accomplishment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter dissappointment","review":"This one really disappointed me.

The week before his birthday we picked up a three pack of tools at the dollar store. When he got this gift in the mail he was very excited to open it, but we soon discovered that some of the tools in the set were the flimsy ones we had gotten at the dollar store. Also, the tool belt is plastic and he won't wear it. When I think of a \\"belt\\" I don't think plastic. The good parts of this kit are the tape measure and the drill. We play with those often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but cheap and poor quality","review":"This is the first review I've written in a while - really disappointed in the quality of this (even at the low price). Everything is presented very nicely in the case. Within 30 minutes of using, the drill broke -- its motor still runs, but it no longer turns the bit. The work belt has a completely ineffective buckle. The buckle releases as soon as my 3 year old son starts to move around while wearing it - and that's with no tools attached to the belt. The rest of the non-mechanical pieces are fine and realistic looking enough for a little kid. Fortunately, it's hard to mess up with a simple plastic mold. As long as your expectations are along the lines of this review, if shelling out a few bucks for a suite of tools to engage in imaginative play is what you basically want -- this would be okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This toy was a huge disappointment. It is poorly made. As other reviews note, the tool belt does not work well at all. The only way it will stay on is if you feed the belt through belt loops on your childs pants. The clasp won't stay in the plastic belt at all. When we got the toolbox, the pliers broke into two halves immediately, although we snapped them back together. My son cried the first time he used it because he got so frustrated with the belt and when he tried to use the pliers after we put it back together it broke again. Today the measuring tape broke. It's very disappointing because of the poor quality and it really doesn't build much of anything. Save your money and get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm disappointed in this.

After reading about some sets being flimsy, cheaply made, too small even for little hands or just blah we were anxious to get this set in the mail. After opening it up and letting our 1 year old play with it we were excited to say this set is great. It comes in an nice suitcase kind of packaging, which most tidy moms can appreciate, and my son loves it. Everything is durable and realistic looking, not like the some sets that the tools looks like characters from kid show. It also has the coolest drill ever... it spins two ways and the bit is removable. We had to put away some pieces because they are just too small for our 1 year old... but the packaging states its for kids over three. But our one year old loves it and carries the saw around with him everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tool belt stains and tools break","review":"This product is not worth the money. I read all the reviews and thought it'd be a good buy but the tool belt stains everything it comes near and the tools breaks easily. Sure it comes in a nice box but it's huge compared to how much space the tools take up.I would not recommend the set. Go with something like Iplay's stuff.

The disappointment I had with the set is with the tool belt.

This is evident mostly with Peacocks bass. I always listen with quality headphones and the bass sounds terrible. There is a very evident \\"Tinny\\" sound throughout. It sounds like a loose string on an electric guitar. This just simply ruined this album for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"my preliminary assessment","review":"I have loaded the CDs \\"Setting Standards\\", \\"Still Live\\", \\"Changeless\\", and \\"Standards in Norway\\" onto itunes into a playlist of early recordings by Jarrett's standards trio.I listened to these the last few days and I must say I loved all of them except Changeless which seemed to me to have far less inspiration and passion.So I am going to have to rate this only 4 stars. Considering the rave reviews it could be I haven't given it enough of a chance. If I find I was mistaken I will come back and add a fifth star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Stunning","review":"One of the more unusual installments of the Keith Jarrett Trio. Rather than standards as previous albums Changeless is a live recording of moderate paced improvisation with some of the best bass and drum interplay you will be likely to hear on what amounts to a ambient album.When I mention ambient it is meant in the sense of gentle but insistant music that never really gets intense in a classic sense, e.g.; not much volume dynamics, yet this album features some of the most passionate work the trio had performed.In fact, it reminded me of The Koln conceret solo album in that Jarrett is in top form, totally motivated and with wonderful accompaniment that fits like an interlaced fabric.People I played Changeless to that do not enjoy jazz in general were attracted to it's seemingly simple drone with occasional bursts of virtuosity. From it's release to today it is still a favorite album and a worthy addition to any open minded listener's music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Toy!","review":"We bought this as a Christmas gift for our granddaughter who turned 2 in October. She has had such fun with the Smart Snacks Rainbow Color Cones product we wanted to try something else by this company. She absolutely loves the cupcakes. She still needs some assistance in putting the bottoms on to the top but that will come as her fine motor develops. Pretend cooking is her favorite activity so we are buying all kinds of things to add to her kitchen. Very well made product, love the educational component of shape recognition and matching. This is a toy that will grow with the child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 1/2 year old LOVES this toy and can't put it down","review":"My 2 1/2 year old received this toy for Christmas and absolutely adores it. She plays with it for hours and prefers it over some of the more high tech gifts she received. It's somewhat educational because you learn the different shapes on the cupcakes, and when you take them apart, you have to match the correct shape to put them back together again. The real fun is through her imagination, pretending to bake them over and over again and serving it to her family. Even after a week with this toy, she still enjoys playing with it. It's also a perfect addition to her pretend kitchen. Highly recommend. Made from very durable material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Cute and Educational!","review":"I bought these for my 2 1/2 year old daughter after she would always play with them when we would drop her older brother off at school (they had a set in the classroom). I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that they are not only an adorable set, but the bottoms have shapes and will fit into the shape in the pan. So not only is it cute, but it is a learning toy as well :)ANd wanted to add that a previous poster mentioned the set smelling very plasticy or rubbery...ours has no scent whatsoever!

She has already made up cupcakes all day long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute and Fun - only one small issue","review":"The only reason I didn't give these cupcakes 5 stars is because sometimes they are hard to pull apart...but my daughter loves them and they are adorable and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love cupcakes!","review":"I bought these for a friend's two year old after she saw my daughter's set.

Would recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Toy","review":"This is an excellent toy for both pretend playing and shape matching. All parts are made of a heavy-duty soft rubber.

They are extremely difficult to put together/take apart, and both of my daughters (and myself) are frustrated by this. I've been looking forward to this set becoming a part of our play kitchen, and now I'm a bit afraid to let my daughters play with this due to the awful smell (yes, I washed the pieces as instructed--they still smell). I would return this set, but it's too much of a hassle with amazon. 2 thumbs down :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My two year old loves this toy. She is big on pretend food play, and these cupcakes are adorable. The shape matching makes learning fun, and it is also great for her fine motor skills -- figuring out how to turn her wrist just right to get the shapes in. I love that the cupcakes all fit into the cupcake \\"pan\\", and we can store it in her play kitchen \\"oven\\". Perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite","review":"My 2.5yo son loves these! As others have said, they are as good for pretend play as they are for learning about shapes. The pieces are all heavy, soft rubber, not hollow plastic like a lot of play food. They did smell quite a bit right out of the package, but that has dissipated. And they are hard to separate, but they loosen up a bit after a few go-rounds, and it's a good lesson in perseverance. My boy has spent a long time with these each day since they arrived, \\"baking\\" them, serving them to the whole family and his stuffed animals, singing Happy Birthday, then taking them apart and matching the pieces, and matching the colored bottom parts to the colors of the plates from his kitchen. Highly recommended for any toddler or preschooler, but especially for a child who loves his or her play kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised","review":"The concept is great and very durable, however, the two part cupcakes is very difficult for my kids (and myself) to pull apart.

A manageable atlas that is easy to read!","review":"A recent roadtrip with our old atlas made us wish we'd brought along a magnifying glass and it prompted me to purchase this Atlas. Granted, this one has almost twice as many pages as my old atlas, but the dimensions are the same and the spiral binding makes it very easy to handle in the car.

My huband checked Amazon and there is was. The large print is so much easier to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great atlas","review":"The atlas is very helpful and seems to be completely correct. The spiral binding works nicely to find the correct page. Really the only problem with the atlas is of its own doing. The maps are so big that one state can't fit onto one page so the state is broken up over several pages. That is nice because it is big and there is more detail, but if you are in an area right on the border of where it is broken up it can be kind of confusing and a pain to switch back and forth. There's really no way to prevent it short of having a huge book or individual fold out maps. Really it more of a nuisance that anything. Overall, a very good atlas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good binding for an atlas","review":"I can certainly appreciate that this atlas is ideal for those whose eyes have issues with the small print of the standard type atlases. However, a big drawback for me is the binding of this atlas.I have found similarly bound atlases to split along the spine quite easily. Spiral binding, or even staple binding, are better choices. Especially for those of us who like the ability of opening an atlas to lay flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rand McNally The Road Atlas Large Scale 2011","review":"The larger type is nice, but having the disjointed pages is cumbersome. I do like having a backup to a GPS, however, since the GPS is not always handy when I am planning a trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large book","review":"Very large book. It is a bit difficult to use in a car due to its size. The maps are decent, but I would use it more as a reference item to keep in your house than as a travel guide you take with you in your vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Easy to Handle","review":"Although the atlas is large scale as promised, it is bulky and too much like a book to use in the car. It has a glued binding instead of the familiar spiral binding. That makes it nearly impossible to use in the car. Also the states are divided awkwardly and difficult to reconcile moving from one page to other half of the state on another page. Cities at the division are not repeated on the next map, so you need to find highways or follow guide marks to make the transition. It is not a good visual stimulus to follow. I put the atlas on a book shelf and bought another spiral bound atlas which is much more car friendly to use on trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tears easily","review":"The print is still smaller than expected and the paper tears easily. Yet, it got me where I was going. Good price, but be gentle with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would buy it again","review":"I like the spiral binding the gutter gap not withstanding. Since I usually use a computer map program or Internet tool to plan trips and work out details, my main interest in a road atlas is for a reference if needed. I like the larger pages, however, I find that the enlargements are not done consistently. At least one state is spread over four pages while other states may only have one page with a distinct difference in the amount of enlargement done for \\"popular\\" states. I can live with that and quite happy with the price and quality mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"great atlas","review":"Very good selection of city inserts which are easy to read. Very well made.

California is so chopped up, it is unusable. Even Arizona is excessively chopped up and is not even connected to a Mexican map - how useful is that if you live in Arizona? Most people want a road atlas for long distance travel planning and use in the car. This one is organized for people who don't know their way around their own locale. I'm sure all the information is usable at some point, but you would likely have a traffic accident trying to follow these maps in the car and it would be no fun at all sitting and planning a long trip with these disjointed maps. The most usable map is the large US map at the front - but I could have gotten that for free anywhere. Don't buy this atlas unless you've seen it in advance. I looked for a Rand McNally Western States Atlas - maybe they could do a better job with fewer states - nope - they don't have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rand McNally Road Atlas Large Scale 2011","review":"We have had this atlas in the past and it is great.

In the less than 6 months I've had it, the bowl already has several large cracks in it and after reading another review here, this seems to be a problem with this particular unit.I never overload the bowl and only use walnut media with a little flitz media polish added to it and it's developed several cracks on the outside of the bowl. So far they have not gone all the way through to the inside, but they are fairly deep so it's just a matter of time until they do.This tumbler is nice and quiet compared to a couple of others I've tried, but if it's going to be breaking bowls, I'll have to start looking elsewhere.

Twist of Shadows displays a larger production budget and more complex orchestration. Phoenix presents a maturity that seems to be the bluesy flower of the energetic adolescence of the first 2. The entrancing voice of Anka Wolbert still sends chills up my spine after 10 years of repeated listening. If you were ever into \\"New Wave\\" \\"Modern Rock\\" \\"Rave\\" or \\"Goth\\", you must own these seminal works of an amazing band.

Having grown up during the Cold War, my friends and I were amazed to hear a Russian band on the radio. While on senior trip, we stopped at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas. The piece of memorabilia that most impressed me was a guitar sent over by Gorky Park. It was a beautiful red (what else?) with the Soviet and American flag side by side on the body. This was just one of the first signs of the end of the Cold War. Not just a great album musically, but one that has some historical significance.

I've heard many groups and own an extensive music library of late 70's to 90's metal and the first time I heard this particular group I truly enjoyed every song on it. The lyrics combined with the gripping music backing them up is by far a real experience.

They seemed like nice guys but then again nice doesn't mean good. Look at the band Lifer. I met them at their release party and they were cool guys. Problem was the music was terrible. Same thing with Gorky Park. Maybe it was the fact we all thought we were going to see Billy Joel but instead we get.....GORKY PARK?? It's a moment I can reflect back on and laugh when I am awake but when I sleep at night I toss and turn with Bang playing in my nightmares endlessly. I then wake up in a cold sweat.

No matter what grind, quantity and type of coffee I've tried there is always sediment in the cup. Blech. I tried tamping it down and not tamping. Less coffee and more coffee. Brand A and brand B with the same sorry results. I must have looked like mad scientist in the kitchen making cup after cup with clear cups and measuring spoons strewn all over. Each experimental cup had too much grounds for me.I really think there needs to be a paper filter involved somehow. The mesh just lets too much coffee grounds through.

I love Mint Tea and can't find the Bigelow K-Cups in my area, so using the \\"My K-Cup\\" has already helped me out a lot.I only wish however the filter was a little more sturdy.

If I wanted weak, unremarkable coffee and the inconvenience of having a filter that had to be taken apart and cleaned every single time I wanted a cup of coffee, I wouldn't have bought the Keurig machine in the first place! I'd have saved myself about $80 and bought a Proctor Silex coffee maker at Rite-Aid.I wanted to like this thing. I really did. Who doesn't like to save a few bucks? But even using my favorite coffee (from Peet's) I was very unhappy with the results. Maybe if you start off with the Keurig machine using this device and remain unspoiled by the excellent K-cups available from Timothy's, etc. then this thing might be acceptable, but otherwise I consider it a major step backward in terms of coffee quality and the convenience of using this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"No instructions","review":"No Instructions on how full container should be OR what grind to use.

I took my chances as many times, reviewers are wrong.Boy was I the wrong one.If you like hot water with a slight taste of coffee, this is for you.I can't believe Keurig even released this product.I went through half a pound of grinds to no delight. This is just a bad product.Back to the k-cups, I have.(and for the non-believers, yes, I followed the directions to a T, 15 times, and then tried modifying them to get a different result... results were all the same... really watered down coffee)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weaksauce","review":"I've talked this filter up. At work, we have a Keurig Mini. I use this filter all the time with that machine. It does NOT make my coffee weak. The Keurig itself and the filter are over a year old, and I love my coffee. It's the only thing I look forward to at work.Fast-forward to this Christmas. I finally get a Keurig for home: a B70 Platinum Plus. I purchased this same filter at Target. I was so excited this morning to have my delicious cup of Dunkin Donuts French Vanilla ground coffee using the filter.Oh, the disappointment.The coffee was noticeably weak, just by looking at it. Taste was awful. I tried 3 different times, using different cup sizes. All resulted in the same undrinkable, weak, tan water.I plan on bringing the filter from work home to see if it's a difference in filters, or a difference in machines. In the meantime, I suppose I will try buying one of the other-brand filters and hope for a normal cup of coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Maker Gift","review":"This was on my wish list, it made a wonderful Christmas present from my daughter and son-in-law and granddaughter.......The coffee maker is perfect for someone that does not drink a lot of coffee each day.

I cannot get a cup of coffee that isn't severely watered down. I've tried all different degrees of grind, different types of coffee, different amounts in the cup. I can't get it to work. I really am not technologically challenged and I feel like I should be capable of using this product the correct way. I can't get anything that tastes like coffee should out of it. I am very frustrated because I love my Keurig brewer but I hate throwing away so much plastic. I really wish that it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keurig My K-Cup Rusable Coffee Filter","review":"Excellent product. This reusable filter works great for loose tea and coffee! You can use your favorite coffee and tea and it's much less expensive (and more environmentally friendly) than the prefilled, disposable K-Cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another tip for strong coffee - and a heads up","review":"I like strong coffee. I too was disappointed with the fact that if you want a strong cup of coffee using the Keurig, you have to brew a small cup using the strongest brews available (Emeril's Big Easy Bold is very good). So I got the My K-Cup. If you want a strong cup of coffee on the Keurig's largest cup size setting, you need to pick a strong coffee to begin with and fill the My K-Cup to the absolute max, but also, it needs to be a superfine grind. Typical grinds that you find in most mainstream coffee just won't cut it. I use Seattle's Best (Post Alley Blend is my favorite) and it's perfect - but most boutique coffees have a superfine grind. Also, heads up: you will need to replace this filter every six months or so. It gets gunked up with residue and the machine will struggle to make a half cup of coffee and tell you that it needs to be de-scaled. A new My K-Cup makes everything work perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but LOTS cheaper elsewhere!","review":"I love this little economical filter. However, I found it at Target for $4.95. Sorry to move any sales from my #1 favorite shopping place: AMAZON! But, a $10 difference is significant. With gas prices and if you have Amazon Prime - it may still be the best way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"My tastes","review":"Dont know why other reviewers have had issues with this.

You have to change out a attachment on your machine to use this which is another inconvenience plus I always wind up with coffee grains in my cup and the coffee comes out weak. I like the idea but this gadget is not the answer.But as far as the Keurig coffee maker goes it is the greatest thing since sliced bread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I love my Keurig but the K-Cups can add up after a bit. I was so excited to get a My K-Cup and was disappointed that it didn't work. Like other reviewers have mentioned it sprays water as it brews and the coffee is undrinkable. There are grounds in the brewed coffee and the flavor is very weak. I have tried putting different amounts and grind types into the basket and they have all produced the same undrinkable cup of coffee. It's a fantastic idea, put the practical application is sorely lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea but...","review":"Yeah it is a great idea indeed.

Unfortunately, I was not pleased with the results. I have found that the coffee is weak and often contains grinds. What's worse though is that it leaks and water splashes everywhere and makes a mess when using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"I am very disappointed in this product. When making a cup of coffee the coffee is very weak. I noticed that when the coffee is brewing water is coming out the side of the filter which causes a weak cup of coffee.

I would avoid buying this product, hopefully someone will manufacture a product that works properly in the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheep Coffee but...","review":"This filter works as it should.

Don't like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinkable but doesn't compare.","review":"My wife wanted to try this using her regular Dunkin Donuts grounds.Easy to use, but very weak coffee. To get a drinkable cup, used two separate brewings in the smallest of the 3 sized cups. That means 2 scoops of coffee for one weak cup. Including the cleanings between the 2 brews and after. It would have been a lot easier to use a regular brewer.If it wasn't included as a bonus in our purchase, we would have returned it.My wife likes Caribou Daybreak from the Keuring. It's a weak but very drinkable cup of coffee.Thumbs up for Keurig K Cups. Thumbs down for this contraption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but horrible results.","review":"I was excited to get this item so much so that I bought a few to give away as gifts and such. I wanted to be able to make Dunkin Donuts and some of my other favorites in the Kureg. Sadly after trying to use and like this filter, I have to admit is it garbage. Why you may ask??? Well others have stated it over and over, the design allows the water to flow through so fast all you have is a cup of pathetically weak coffee when it is done brewing. I see some reviewers have reported solving this problem by modifying a K-Cup or using filter material...... good idea, but I think it is pretty crazy that someone would make and sell this in its current form. Do they not even test their products functionality before selling it??? I can only recommend this for people who like super weak and watered down coffee. Bold coffee lovers need not apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe they sell this","review":"I've tried every thing to make this thing work...it doesn't.

I'm very disappointed and hope Keurig will redesign one that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"Fortunately, this was a freebie with my coffee maker. I would have been disappointed if I had purchased something that didn't work very well. It leaks water as it is brewing. I have not experimented with the grind (yet). An alternative that works is I re-use the k-cup. Remove the foil top, rinse it, add drip grind coffee,then mold a piece of aluminum foil on the top. I try to match the hole in the bottom with the coffee maker, but don't always get it lined up. Perfect cup every time. Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"necessity","review":"used it once only. kinda a necessity if you own a keurig, but the directions inside aren't very good. it'd be nice if they tell you you're suppose to pull out the original cup in the coffee maker or else you can spike a hole in the filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's okay. A nice back up for the real thing.","review":"The reusable k-cup is okay when you run out of the real k-cup coffee pack to make coffee with your own coffee ground that you have at home. It is a little time consuming to take apart of the unit to replace it with the reusable k-cup in your coffee maker. In addition, it can get messy considering trying to put coffee grounds into the reusable k-cup and you have to wash it. I would not use this daily to make my coffee, but it is a nice back up if you should run out of the real k-cup coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition!","review":"Does just what it says it will and once you learn how to grind the coffee and how much to add, you'll see why you need this. Especially helpful for when you run low on K-Cups and/or if you have a favorite coffee that you miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard design.... on purpose.","review":"Keurig has a reputation for excellent products but this is an example of purposely creating a substandard product in order to keep people buying the brand-name K-cups. No additional rubber seal on the top ensures a watery mess in the end. The lack of pressure in the K-cup causes the coffee to be weaker also.Keurig has purposely created this lousy product so we get tired of the messes and keep buying the $13 boxes of brand-name K-cups.Can't any third-party company come up with a decently sealed reusable K-cup filter? This is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Trouble","review":"I was really hoping that this would work. I love my Keurig, but at .50 cents or more a cup, I was willing to try a re-usable coffee pod. I even bought the paper liners to use to keep clean up easy. What a disappointment :-( First, it's hard to tell how much coffee to add. Either the coffee is too strong or too weak, but the biggest problem is the grounds! Lots of grounds in my coffee. I'm returning it. Save your time and your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"The K-Cup never fails to leak coffee grounds into my cup of joe.

Good concepts poorly executed do not deserve stars.Out of the box, this filter will deliver very weak coffee (even on the strong setting) AND will leave a big mess of coffee grounds and water in and around your machine. Keurig should recall this product as it simply doesn't work without a fix. Don't buy it. It is not worth the hassle or the mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks in less than two months.","review":"This is actually a piece of junk. Mine lasted two months--and we only used it at weekends!!

Based on this, you're cheaper buying the k-cups.I've written to Keurig expressing my disgust at their worse-than-poor quality product--but, so far, no response is forthcoming.Update ( I should have done this a long time ago): Keurig did send me a replacement \\"My K-Cup.\\" free of charge.

There isn't enough space between the lid and the lip to accommodate the rim of the filter insert. When you tighten the lid it puts stress on the thin plastic lip which eventually splinters and breaks off, once the splinters cut my hand as I was tightening the lid. The company sent me replacements advising me to not overtighten, but they all crack no matter how careful you are. If you don't tighten the lid enough, coffee grounds and water spray out making a mess in the machine and grounds in your coffee. The My-K cups aren't cheap either at $15 each.

Awesome!My $50 #6 melitta filter pot manages to get ALL the water in the pot and it doesn't cost .$60 a cup to do it.Of course all that water should be going somewhere else, like IN THE GROUNDS so her second complaint of weak coffee makes sense.I can't believe that no one at the factory noticed that these things look like a water fountain when you try to use them.

I then stumbled upon the Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers and its better than the my k-cup.

I've tried every internet solution I could find (aluminum foil over the top, faucet washers in the grove of the k-cup, etc.) and while some of them help a little bit, nothing has seemed to be a sure fire fix.

The fixes I have seen are clever and do work to a degree, but they are just that, FIXES. I have not seen any movement from the company to fix the design problem (i.e. why not replace the solid bottom with filter material) and do not see the sense on giving this item a high rating just because I am able to use a workaround that works some of the time for some of the people.I agree with a post I have seen in the past that stated that we, as consumers, should not reward a flawed product with a high rating just because we heard of or were able to figure out a fix for it's bad design.

I waited four days hoping maybe the cup needed to get warmed up or something with use but after day 4 the coffee I made with the same grinds tasted worse that it ever has.

So finally I manage to brew without getting water all over, but the coffee is insanely weak. Pretty undrinkable after all that effort and much wasted coffee.I read up on how to \\"fix\\" this by butchering a used K-cup, and will try that to get it to work.

No matter how little coffee I put in the My K Cup the coffee would leak out through the sides of the dispensing part of the Keurig during brewing. So I ended up with hot coffee puddled on the counter top every time. After investigating the cause, I found that the lid on the My K Cup just sits down too low leaving too much space between the brewer and the My K Cup. It just didn't seal good enough leaving room for leakage. I had to put a rubber ring under the My K Cup lid to keep it from going down so far in the reservoir. With the seal tighter between the brewer and the My K Cup it solved the leakage problem. I'm using it since there seems to be nothing better at the moment. Just be aware that it may need some Jerry-rigging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Very Poorly","review":"This just doesn't work. Water spills all over the counter. What ends up in the cup is like dishwater, not coffee. The folks at Keurig aren't stupid; it isn't rocket science to make a reusable K-Cup. They're just trying to discourage people from using their own coffee, and use the pre-made K-Cups instead. Shame. Luckily, it's not too late for me to return my Keurig."},{"rating":"2","title":"great if you do it correctly","review":"If you fill the filter with medium ground coffee to the rim and then gently tap down against the counter, the coffee will pack nicely. Then, insert your finger in the middle of the coffee to create a small indentation in the middle so that when you put the lid on it,the coffee doesn't come out of the top of the lid. Make sure that you have a good seal by adjusting the rubber gasket around the top needle of the machine. this will ensure a nice strong cup of coffee with no grinds in it. It took me about 5 times of tinkering with it, but I finally figured that this is the best technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Messy!","review":"Mind boggling how it makes an incredible mess regardless of how little or much coffee you put in it! No, it's not a matter of \\"making sure the lid is closed all the way\\". Imagine that! A reviewer suggested cutting a little round piece from a regular/plastic k-cup and adapting it so it fits on the bottom of the \\"my\\" k-cup, well...if you are willing to go through all that trouble (a) you just sacrificed the convenience of the system and made it really cumbersome (b) you just sacrificed the savings to yourself and/or the environment by having to keep on buying regular k-cups so you can use your \\"my\\" k-cup.

Well, I finally called the help line on the instructions and they gave me a solution to the problem. All you need to do is look up under the lid where the pin is that punctures the top of the k-cups. There is a rubber gasket around that pin. CAREFULLY reach up and slide that gasket down a hair. Problem solved! If water still leaks out pull the gasket down a little more. We have had no more problems ever since. They really should print this in a troubleshooting part of the instructions; it would save many people a lot of grief. Hope this helps!

Some guy invented a cover for the coffee kcaps so you can reuse them. One I hate spening so much money on the dark magic and two I hate throwing the things into our land fill! In search of a green strong coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost convenient","review":"The idea -- to allow you to use coffee of your choosing in a Keurig machine -- is a good one both in terms of taste and environmental friendliness. The execution is less than perfect, however. To fill the capsule and place it in the machine is simple. You can remove the part of the assembly the capsule replaces with two fingers. The disappointment is that the capsule lid sits just a bit too high to close the machine all the way and start the brewing cycle. Instead, you have to force the lever down and hold it throughout the brew (always fearing something will break)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Believe How Terrible This Is","review":"I cannot believe what a terrible product this is. I had been using the Solofill reusable cup and needed a second one so thought I would try the Keurig product....talk about being disappointed! Where the Solofill had worked perfectly in my Keurig Coffee maker the one MADE by Keurig was a disaster. During brewing water shot everywhere and there were major coffee grounds in my cup of coffee. I thought that surely I had done something wrong so I went back and reread all the instructions and tried again and the exact same thing.....water shooting out onto the counter during brewing and grounds in my coffee. I went back to my old Solofill and got perfect results. How is it possible that the same people that make the coffee maker can make such a poor product to go with it????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves no stars","review":"The Keurig My Cup single serve reusable coffee filter is useless. It is a complete waste of money. I've completely followed the directions for using the filter and tried it with different amounts of coffee and different grinds of coffee, but it doesn't work. The water overflows and you get just as much hot water as you do coffee in your cup. Not only do you get watered down coffee, but you also get a cup filled with coffee grounds. Like most, I purchased the reusable filter to save money on the k-cups, but I have just ended up wasting more coffee.DO NOT BUY!!!! Well, unless you like watered down coffee with grounds and a wet counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally worthless","review":"I was really hoping that this product would work.

Seriously, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but too grainy!","review":"I love this idea, because I like Starbucks coffee and miss it some mornings. The reusable single cup is a bit messy to fill. It is easy to pop this in, but the coffee it produces is filled with grains. I have tried to fill it less, to get the coffee ground as coarsely as possible and still get grains in the cup. I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much","review":"I was not in love with this. I found it made a week cup of coffee and left a lot of sediment in the bottom, which didn't make much sense to me. Took a long time to get the filter.

Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company hard to deal with","review":"Coffee grounds came through the filter.

Well, first of all-it leaks water/coffee EVERYWHERE (sputtering and dripping). 99% of the time I end up with loose grounds in my cup. I have made sure to follow directions and have been EXTRA careful not to get grounds outside of the filter, but they always sneak in there. Also, in order to get a \\"full\\" cup out of my Keurig, I need to run it twice. With the reusable cup, it is a major hassle to clean it out and re-load it. Yes, I have tried simply adding more coffee to the cup-but that takes just as long in order to keep the grounds from sneaking outside of the filter. And, again, it results in more grounds in my cup. The time I waste with all of this hassle has driven me back to buying the cups. Maybe that was their plan all along.....there are a couple other brands out that that I intend to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the forst 2 months.","review":"I was happy that they offered this product, that is until I got more then a month of use out of it. It is so clogged right now, that I have to purchase a new one. Not to mention that when I first used it I would have overspill surrounding the holder, so I naturally thought that adding less grounds would solve the problem...well it did not. I think the best thing to use for coffee is a french press, so it looks like I have an expensive cabinet ornament for now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps I like weak coffee...","review":"I haven't found the coffee made with the My K-Cup attachment to be weaker than the coffee I've made using the regular K-cups. I purchased the attachment to be able to use a bag of delicious-smelling pumpkin spice coffee that we received as a present and were unable to use without a regular coffee pot. The My K-Cup was easy to install, and resulted in a delicious cup of coffee with no leaking coffee grounds. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kcup Insert","review":"The product holds the correct amount of coffee grounds and fits into the coffee maker correctly, but the water doesn't go straight through the insert, so much water comes around it -- which makes the coffee unnecessarily watery -- and ground drip through the hole into the coffee cup. Using it allows me to use my favorite brand and flavor of coffee, but makes a less than ideal cup of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"I have tried every which way and strategy to make this device work, but I could not use the filter without my keurig machine spewing water everywhere. I don't know if the keurig machine model that I have is not compatible with the reusable coffee filter or what. I gave up and now the filter is taking up shelf space as a wasted investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!","review":"This seems like a great alternative to K-cups individual, single use coffees but it does not work. I bought it for my Dad as a Father's day gift and he can't even use it because it spews coffee grounds and hot water everywhere. I looked it up and there are ways to rig it with aluminum foil so that it does not leak but I haven't tried any of them yet. Definitely not worth purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read 1-2 Star Reviews Before You Buy","review":"I typically read reviews on Amazon before buying something. For some reason this time I didn't. I bought the Keurig K-Cup Reuasable and read all the directions. Then proceeded to make 7 different types of coffee with different types of grind (coarse grind to fine). Nothing worked. I also tried to fill it 1/4 way to full and nothing worked. The issue is that the machine attempts to fill the cup so fast, that the coffee plus the filter element can't drain the liquid fast enough. Hence the water overflows over the cup and drips down into your cup, making watered down coffee. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thought, but missing something","review":"This would be a great addition to the Keurig, but it's design is lacking. No matter how fine or course the grind, or the fill level, there is always back flow and water escapes. Why, because they want it to work like the k-cups and have the coffee go out the sides. If they simply put a filter at the bottom along with the sides, I can bet the overflow flow would be greatly diminished."},{"rating":"1","title":"brews VERY weak coffee","review":"I have been giving this filter try after try with hopes each time it would be better. It just does not brew right. first, i wanted it bc i thought i'd save money brewing bagged coffee than k-cups, but you have to fill the filter to the top for a cup of coffee (about 3 1/2 scoops).Its always weak, ive figured out that patting down the coffee grinds tightly as i put them in helps, also theres a rubber washer above the keurig brewer, if you pull that lower to make sure of an air-tight closer also helps a little, not much. all this work to save a buck, really takes from the point of the keurig. also, with nearly 4 scoops of coffee for the filter, youre really not saving money- might as well stick with the k-cups. not worth the nearly $20 for he filter. I got mine included with my purchase, thankfully. Had i bought it seperately, I'd return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay! it works great!","review":"I got my Keurig b30 at christmas time, and have used regularr k cups. I was stuck in the house for a time, and found it a pain to go get the cups. i thought of this disposable filter, and thought it would be great to have one on hand. i read the reviews, and was very unsure of how it was going to actually work.I followed the directions carefully, popped out the black part on the coffee maker itself. I tried it with a coarser grind coffee from the coffee store, and also just with a regular decaf coffee. I found the one from the coffee store was stronger, and the finer ground decaf, weaker, but they both were very good. I used two level tablespoons of coffee. I had no problem with grinds in the coffee, or spillage. i do think the regular k cups have a better taste, perhaos because I love strong coffee, but this will be excellent in a pinch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak coffee, water everywhere","review":"I followed the directions to the letter, putting in only 2 tbs of the 2.7 that the manufacturer states will fit in the basket. Water ran out of the top of the filter and splashed all over the cup and the counter-top during the brew cycle. The coffee was very weak and for me, undrinkable.Coffee drinkers who prefer their cup black and not overly strong will probably be satisfied with the My K-cup (after they learn the trick of getting it to not leak all over the place. Not sure what that is but I assume it's possible since other people have managed it.) Those who prefer espresso, stronger drip coffee or that like to add cream and sugar and still enjoy a nice coffee flavor will likely be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I was very disappointed this didn't work for me.

There are 2 lines inside the filter. You cannot fill the coffee past the 2nd line (the higher one). #2. Make sure the lid is locked into position before putting the unit into the brewer. After I did those 2 things, I have had no issues with this filter since. It works great and the coffee is a lot cheaper than the k-cups, not to mention environmentally friendly!

Can't do a second cup quickly...too hot to handle the filter to clean it out...and messy.I totally wasted $15 on this item.

This lid has no seal at the top....first time I used it I noticed it and wondered how it would work without a seal. It doesn't. My belief is that if a seal was put on the lid it would work fine.

First, you must modify your Keurig by removing the k-cup holder and replacing it with this one. Each time you decide to go back to the k-cup, you must swap out the holders. WORST of all, you must then modify this DEFECTIVE product (read other reviews) to keep it from leaking while brewing. I did read a good fix on here that was done with a couple rubber bands, but hey..should I HAVE to modify a new product so that it work properly? My husband, knowing the frustration I've had with this little thing, happened to stumble upon [...] while shopping at Publix. OMG, it changed my life! No worrying about having to wash out a reusable filter; no having to worry what germs may be collecting around my rubber band modification...just slip in a filter, push a button and poof.

Since I use packaged ground coffee as a convenience, I cannot adjust the size of the grind; and do not feel I should have to experiment by having to buy whole beans and grind them myself. Therefore, this product is out of the realm of consumer friendliness. Sorry Keurig. It is a shame you released this product to the consumer market.

As others have stated, be careful of overpaying for this product. I also noted a lot of water bypasses the coffee so I added two tiny washers to the top inlet of the filter and this solved the water overflow problem. In the morning I cannot function without my first cup of coffee so I do use a disposable KCup to get going and switch to using this reusable filter for the remainder of the day. I am surprised that the little washers have not fallen out! It is more work to rinse out the coffee filter after each use, so yes the disposable cups are more convenient, but this product is more economical and allows coffee nuts to choose their own coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This adapter works great! Simply pull the current sleeve that you slip your k-cup into and put this one in and you are ready to go. With this adapter you use your own coffee rather than buying k-cups. Even at a discounted $11/box through my job, k-cups are .40 each (plus tax). With this adapter you can put in your own coffee, screw on the top, put in your Keurig coffee maker and still get that fast cup of great tasting coffee. The little basket filter cleans easy enough.

The design should have used rubber or silicon seals for the lid and body.Another issue this product has is that you must remove the stock K-cup holder to use this.

I made sure to fill it as much coffee grind as I can and still, no luck with the taste. It has also been consistent in spewing coffee-water out when it's brewing in all directions. My K-cups work fine, so I know this isn't due to my Keurig. I took a look at it more carefully and it seems that this coffee filter gets filled with water too quickly and pours out of the top.

Get a small 1/2\\" or so fiber or plastic washer with a hole size that fits over the needle in the Keurig brewer. 1/16\\" thickness or a little less is good. Slip the rubber sealing washer off of the brewer needle (found in the top with the brewer open). Slide the fiber washer over the needle and then put the original rubber seal back over the needle. Don't worry if the rubber sits slightly over the slots in the needle. When the brewer is closed on the reusable filter the rubber is depressed to make the seal and fully exposes the slots. Works perfectly and no more water leaks. The coffee gets more thoroughly soaked with water and brews a better cup. I use just regular Maxwell house coffee and it works fine.

So I should have backed off when I saw the metal filter in the My K-Cup. However, if one is wiling to compromise on coffee quality, the My K-Cup is very convenient and simple. I have also tried cutting off the cover of a used K-cup, washing out the grounds, filling with my own coffee, placing a piece of aluminum foil over the top and crimping around the edge. The resulting coffee was every bit as good that made using the original K-Cup but it's a lot of work. Next I will try the My Kap lid which will eliminate all that fuss with the aluminum foil.

You do need to remove the black plastic K-Cup holder from the coffeemaker's filter assembly before using the reusable coffee filter. The filter is easy to clean, and if you're only wanting one cup of coffee it really is very little extra work to use over the wasteful pods.We have purchased several filters to go with the housing and this enables the coffee to dry before having to dump out, which results in much less mess.

I'm not sure what the difference is in using the reusable filter and the pre-packaged K-Kups, but when using the reusable filter the coffee is very weak. It looks like dirty water, not coffee. Each time I used the filter I used more coffee, but the coffee was always as weak as dishwater. In looking into the filter after brewing, the majority of coffee was just pushed to the side, and the water flowed straight through the middle, leaving just a small hole in the coffee, while most of the coffee was untouched. I am very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Filter In Less Than A Year","review":"It is sad that the Keurig My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filter is such substandard in quality. I just ordered my third one since January 2007! I like the convenience of it and don't understand why it can't be made out of a better material, like stainless steel. It cracks, and splits too easily.

I just don't care for how messy it is, pretty much defeats the purpose of the Keurig machine in the first place. OK I know that there aren't any Keurig coffees that have the intensity of Charbucks but I have a better suggestion. Use the Keurig to supply the hot water and put your fresh ground in a press pot. You will get a better cup that way and you didn't have to buy this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of junk - makes worthless dirty water","review":"How anyone can rate this piece of junk favorably is beyond me. Follow instructions, fill it up, pop it in and you'll get a dirty cup of water. The result is NOTHING like the pod produces (and there is a logical reason for this.) If you want to research various ways to spend oodle of your own time \\"remodeling\\" this worthless contraption, be my guest. The problem with this junk is that no thought went in to it. In order to compensate the process to produce equivalent-grade coffee as the purchased air-sealed pods, a better top seal design is required and likely a double or triple filtration wall to more slowly modulate the output. - and I'm not even a scientist."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like grinds in your coffee...","review":"For those wanting to be more environmentally conscientious while still enjoying their Keurig coffee maker, you'd think this would be an exciting find.Great idea. Not so great in reality.This pretty much eliminates the convenience of using a Keurig, and in many ways is more messy and cumbersome than a regular coffee pot. Grinds inevitably make their way into the coffee cup, and cleanup is not a snap.For those who only have one cup of coffee in the morning, maybe the hassle is worth it. But I doubt any multiple-cup drinker will want the bother.Because k-cups don't lend themselves to recycling, and because this reusable coffee filter is more bother than it's worth, I've gone back to my 4-cup Black & Decker and am much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks...I'm on my fourth one in a year~!","review":"I love Dunkin' Donuts coffee, so when my Mom bought me the Keurig coffee maker for Christmas I freaked thinking I wasn't going to be able to enjoy it anymore. But she bought me the \\"My K-cup\\" to ease the pain. Only problem is my husband and I are on our fourth one. Every single K-cup has broken the same way. Unfortunately, I think it's just bad manufacturing. The side of the rim cracks off, then your coffee grinds start leaking into your coffee. Gross! Eventually, you have no choice but to buy another one. Wish this product was more durable.... :-( Looking for a knock-off made better as we speak!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convenient but cheaply constructed","review":"The reusable filter is a handy option and definitely saves money as compared with buying K-Cups. The major problem, though, as some other reviewers have noted, is the poor construction. We've only been using the filter for around two months, and we're already on our third one. That's ridiculous. No matter how gently you handle the filter, the plastic at the top of the outside container begins to crumble and fall off. Eventually, it makes it impossible to brew a cup of coffee without having grounds fall in and/or coffee spew out of the machine and all over the counter. What a pain in the neck."},{"rating":"2","title":"New version seems sturdier than the original","review":"The new, gray-colored holder seems sturdier than the original (dark brown) plastic holder, which had a tendency to crack and for pieces to break off after only a few months of occasional use.

When I attempted to use it with my own coffee, water leaked all down the front of the machine. The problem is that there isn't a good seal when the top is closed shut. It's almost like it needs to be a bit longer. I called Keurig and reported it. In the meantime, I found that wrapping a rubber band around the lip of the base helped create a good seal when the lid is closed. Now it doesn't leak, and I can use my own coffee, which is cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed","review":"This substitute for K-cups is very poorly designed.

I kept adding more coffee to the filter with no better results.There are some tips in the reviews to improve things and I will try them, but you would think Keurig's engineers would have run this product through some tests and found out it was useless.Also some folks said it made weak coffee and gave advice how to fix it, but still rated the product high. I don't get that.

Why should their customers be offered a poor design that needs \\"fixing\\" to work properly? Come on Keurig, step-up and offer a fix or a newly designed filter. Seriously, treat your customers well and they will be faithful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee weak and watered-down","review":"I have done a lot of experimenting with this reusable filter, but have been unsuccessful in duplicating the performance of the disposable K-cups with it. The lid of this filter does not have a rubber or silicon seal, so once it fills up, there is nothing to keep the water from overflowing and dripping out the top (around the rim) into your cup. You end up with very weak and watered-down coffee. Using a coarser grind (like that for a French press) alleviates the dripping problem, but then the water flows through the coffee so quickly that it again ends up very weak and watery. Using a darker roast makes no difference. Don't waste your money on this filter -- try one of the other, better-rated brands (like ekobrew) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"Wanted this to work very bad with the price of the K-cups going up so much!

I knew that purchasing the k-cups would be expensive, but decided to purchase one anyway. A friend of ours had a Keurig Coffee Maker and told me about the k-cup reusable coffee filter. I purchased one and we love it! We have found that you can get 2 cups of coffee out of one filter! And its much less expensive than purchasing k-cups! We still purchase k-cups, but using the filter helps us to save money. This was a great investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money....","review":"Simply put - this is junk. I have tried many different amounts of coffee, and many different grind settings...but nothing works. Put the right amount coffee for sufficient flavor, you'll make a mess of the Keurig machine. Put less coffee to avoid a mess, you get weak coffee. Find Grind, Medium Grind....neither works....Not worth the effort, poor design, messy....toss this in the trash with your used K-cups, because that's where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Live Up to the Keurig Name","review":"I will start this review by mentioning that I purchased this contraption to brew coffee and not tea. For brewing coffee it is absolutely useless. My 3 chief complaints are as follows:1.) It makes incredibly weak coffee.2.) It leaves grinds in the coffee. This is due to the design. The water enters the device, pushes the coffee to the side,and then begins to splatter off of the plastic at the bottom. The splatter causes grinds to run down the side and into the cup.3.) It is incredibly messy. You better have a garbage disposal because a lot of grinds are going down your drain.For tea, it actually works well. This is the reason I rated it two stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated - allows water to come through while coffee is coming through","review":"I would have thought this would have been a perfect filter fit for the Keurig machine, since it is also made by Keurig. However, this filter cup does not fit snugly at the bottom. Therefore, water comes through on the side at the same time the coffee is dripping through the middle. In fact, more water comes through than the coffee; causing a mess and not a true flavorful cup of coffee.

No mess and no coffee grounds in my coffee. The fix is so simple. Yes....you probably shouldn't have to adjust anything for this to perform properly (which is why I give it 4 stars) but really it's not that difficult. Just open the top where you would place the k-cup and if you look up under the lid where the needle is (be very careful)...there is a rubber washer. Pull the washer down just a bit and there ya go..water problem solved. It seems that the rubber washer need to seal properly against the top part of the plastic lid when in the closed position.Hope this works for you too!! Now I don't regret getting this item!! woohoo!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Item does NOT work","review":"Purchased this item to replace the costly K-cups for Keurig Single-Cup Home Brewing System. My disappointment, this product that said that would replace the K cups, but just made a HUGE mess.Followed the directions in the box and had coffee grounds in my coffee in the machine. By the way after clean up and several cups of coffee through the system still have grounds.Now as I have done more investigating I have found disposable cup filters. However, a little costly. Now if I choose this option then more expense. I really like the machine and thought if I could reduce the cost of purchasing the K Cups coffee by using my own it would justify the purchase. I think this is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love my Keurig, hate this reusable coffee filter","review":"A hassle to use and clean, makes a mess, sprays coffee everywhere, and water drips from the unit during use.

If you have a special coffee grind not available in pre-packaged K-cups, this will get the job done. The filter is built from durable plastic and a wire mesh screen.

This would have got 5 stars, but the filter holder is sometimes difficult to pop in and out of the Keurig machine.The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

Little bits of plastic from the latching mechanism break off over time, no matter how carefully I make sure that no extra grounds are present that will increase the pressure. Perhaps they overestimated the strength of the plastic, or underestimated the forces on it. Seems like an easy re-design, just increase the thickness of the plastic bits that hold on the lid -- I would be very impressed if they would fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"After tweaking, works fine.","review":"This is a must product for anyone who has a Keurig coffee maker. The K Cups are pretty expensive and for someone like me who drinks 3 or 4 cups a day that can be kind of expensive.The my K-cup allows you to use your own coffee in our Keurig. It is easy to use and you can easily switch between the My K-Cup and regular K-Cups.The instructions are easy to understand. You'll be using your own coffee minutes after taking this out of the box.The downsize is that this is a tad messy. After making a cup of coffee you will want to clean it, and loading 2 tablespoons of coffee at a time can be tedious at times.Also the instructions suggest using coarser ground coffee. I used finer ground coffee and found the results were more suited to my taste. So I would definitely suggest this more for someone who has control over how finely their coffee is ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"On my 3rd filter...breaks easily!","review":"I like the product, but hate that it breaks so easily.

Also, I bought it from Polsteins Home & Beyond and they said \\"too bad...past 30 days...you're out of luck\\". I only gave it one star because it's a great idea but extremely poorly made and over priced for how long it lasts. Also, I see that I'm not the only one that's had this problem so I wonder if it's been made to only be used for a brief time or just a faulty design?

Even better, as I was using many K-Cups at home, when I found this reusable filter on Amazon. Some of the reviews had me worried that I was going to have a cup of coffee with many grounds at the bottom of the cup, but when the My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter finally arrived I made a cup and was very pleased with the results. I usually grind my coffee pretty coarsely, so there were no problems such as the bottom of the cup being full of coffee grinds. I just didn't understand the directions in the package saying that the K-Cup filter holds 2-3 tablespoons of ground coffee; I could only get 2-3 teaspoons in.I'm curious to see how long this will last.

After the coffee is done being brewed and you go to clean the filter there is coffee grounds that were never used. The filter only makes the coffee directly under the stream of water.

I've tried filling the little mesh cup to all different levels of fullness, and it still seems like it blows the coffee grounds out over the edge and in to the cup. I've made it too full at times, and then the water doesn't even get to the middle of the coffee in the mesh cup, it's still dry when I dump it out. It's very frustrating for me.

This worked, but the coffee was a little week and the machine would periodically get clogged. It seemed like an even better idea to get the keurig reusable filter, but it turned out to be a real disappointment. Even with coarse coffee grounds, the grounds float up and get into the coffee, it clogs the machine and I only get a half cup of coffee. If I hadn't recycled the box right away, I would have returned this. Save your money --there are much better reusable filters out there now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, use your favorite grind","review":"After reading some of the negative reviews regarding the flimsiness of the reusable filter I hesitated to get it. After many months of using the K-cups and assessing the different offerings, I finally broke down and got the filter.I am glad I did. I use it regularly and have done so for several months. I have not encountered any of the problems mentioned by others. The tabs ARE a bit small, and possibly will deteriorate in time. But the ability to use my own French Roast ground coffee and the reduced cost make this a very viable alternative.I do not give it 5 stars because it is true that it's a bit of a hassle to change over to the K-cup insert when my family want to brew their favorite flavored coffees.I will update the review if I run into problems....for now I'm enjoying good coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product","review":"Just like the others have said. they plastic tabs on the lid break after a very very short time. I got the keurig unit as a christmas gift, so i probably used mine a dozen or so times, alternating back and forth between the k-cups. i'll have to rethink my everyday usage of this unit if i have to keep replacing this filter. I guess Keurig really wants you to keep over paying for their \\"patented\\" K-cups.UPDATE: I did contact Keurig and after giving them my coffee maker model number they sent me 2 replacement units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea - Bad Design","review":"The only reason we bought the Keurig machine was because these reusable cups were available. Otherwise, the concept of individually packaged single use plastic containers is just environmentally irresponsible.These K-Cups are almost as disposable as the prepackaged coffee cups.The problem with them is that the screw flange around the top eventually breaks off. We've been through four already and are on our fifth. They are too brittle, and no amount of care or vigilance will prevent them from breaking.Keurig has been pretty good about replacing them, but don't seem to pass the info within the company up to R&D; to fix what must be a huge problem for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to fix the water spraying ISSUE","review":"The first time we used it water shot out everywhere and coffee grounds ended up all in our cup. I decided to call Keurig customer service at 1-866-901-2739. He told us to pull the o-ring down about halfway on the needle that was in the lid. That fixed it now its perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasts a couple of weeks","review":"I have gone through 3 of these and they are not made well. The tabs on the top of it start to break off no matter how careful you are when twisting it together. They need to come up with a better design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea","review":"After I ran out of my K-cups I went ahead and bought this about a month ago. Being a coffee-lover I enjoy the fact that I can try unique coffee that keurig may not carry, plus, this allows me to save money instead of spending around $10 for a package of K-cups. the filter was very simple to install and I have not had any problems with coffee grounds getting into my coffee. I am unsure what people are doing, but the only thing I can think of is make sure you screw on the filter/holder top before placing the whole thing in the keurig. I typically fill my filter about 2/3-3/4 of the way full. Also, I use it with the keurig elite special edition. Works great!The reason why I didn't give this 5 stars was because cleaning the filter is a bit of a hassle; the coffee grounds stick to the edges and it takes a minute to clean, but other than that it's terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"Works exactly as advertised! A real money saver if you drink a lot of coffee like me and prefer the K-Cup way of doing it. There are other makers of this filter but why not just go with the Keurig, the original maker of the K-Cup and be done with it? Good job, Keurig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much cheaper than k cups","review":"We moved from tassimo to kuerig because we wanted to reduce how much we were spending on coffee each month. This coffee filter was part of that cost saving plan. It works great and is easy to clean. If you have a kuerig, I would recommend this filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product, Cracks in a few weeks","review":"Good idea but poorly executed. I've bought three of these, hoping each time for an improvement, but they have all broken after a few weeks of normal use. The plastic breaks down from the heat of the coffee maker and begins to crack and chip. The cap becomes loose and may fail to seal. This a widely reported flaw in the product and can be corroborated by searching online. The manufacturer has not responded by improving the product even though they are aware of the problem and will send you a replacement if you write them. Unfortunately, the replacement will also fail in a few weeks. Its expensive for a poorly engineered product and undermines the environmental aims of reusable filters. Recently, a better alternative (Solofill) is being sold through Amazon and I can vouch that the quality is much better than the My K-cup. Keurig is generally a fine company but My K-cup is a blemish on their reputation. Buyers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I can not see how this product gets good reviews! I have followed directions and filled it with an appropriate amount of coffee, yet it is extremely messy. Coffee grinds get everywhere and the Keurig machine gets covered in splashes while coffee drips everywhere. I have to wipe down the machine and countertop everytime that I use this product. Also, there is sometimes coffee grounds in the coffee, however, this is not a big issue. This product recieves two stars becuse it makes a decent cup of coffee but is such a hassle to use.Would not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keurig K-Cup","review":"I'm not sure why some people have issues with this product. I bought some at the first of the year and have had NO ISSUES!!! I bought more to add to my collection because I was getting tired of washing it out to make a second cup for my wife. We have 1 to 3 cups of coffee per day. Now I dont need to worry about cleaning one right went I finish makeing a cup. I wish I had more and that they made a holder for these. depending on how may cups of coffee you drink per day will dictate how many K-Cups you need. I would start with 3 if you make 1-2 cups per day. I have no problems with grounds getting in the coffee or with the lids breaking. Again not sure what these people are doing to have those issues but I have had no issues and I have had the first 2 since jan 1 almost 5 months and now 2 more for a total of 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ideal for the B30","review":"Given the other positive reviews on this product, I have to believe that this review is exclusive to the B30 Mini. For the B30 Mini, the reusable filter is not that great. The water drills through the center of the grinds and then lifts them up to the top of the filter basket (like a cork). It then passes pretty cleanly through the bottom filter mesh. The end result is an extremely weak cup of coffee.I think if they made the basket with a single small filter hole in the bottom (like the punctured disposable k-cups) instead of the full mesh basket, the water might have a better chance of brewing with the grinds. Keurig was probably worried about overflow in that instance.Again, this is only a review of the filter basket's use with a Keurig Mini B30.

The plastic latches that hold the top on just break off and crumble away, no matter how carefully you screw on the lid. Then your coffee spills over the sides when you brew it.

With the keurig filter you have to remove the k-cup housing inside the machine before you can use it. This is inconvenient if you switch back and forth between both a filter and k-cups or if you're short on places to store this part while using the filter.

We have tried different grinds and different amounts of coffee but grinds get into the coffee mug and water spits and sprays all over the place. It worked fine with our old Keurig machine but not the Elite.UPDATE: I have since discovered that cause if the leaks. It is the black rubber fitting that is above/on the upper needle that pokes into the k-cup. It is different from the orange/red sponge-like fitting on the older Keurig coffeemaker. If you're tossing out your old Keurig you may want to remove this piece and put it onto the newer Keurig. Be careful though, as the needle is very sharp.

I will follow another reviewer's tip of putting a used plastic portion of a k-cup beneath the mesh filter (but I'm skipping the part about adding a paper filter on top of the mesh filter because, come on, I'd rather just buy a regular coffee maker than go through all that trouble).

Even when packing the cup full with coffee the results were poor. The coffee remained just as weak because the water coming from the keurig is under pressure. This pushes the grounds in the My K-Cup up the sides of the filter, which is what you want. You don't want water in your cup that hasn't passed through the grounds. However the problem is the hole at the top of the My K-Cup does not create a tight seal with the spout in the keurig. The water is forced out the top around the spout and then comes down the inside of the keurig itself. This causes the water to come out at odd angels and completely miss your cup and some times even the drip tray.You can search through the comments for ways to modify your My K-Cup to make it better which I intend to try.

After having gone through three home Keurigs in 18 months (pumps kept jamming) I bought a Keurig B145 OfficePro. It's not as fancy, but it's a great Keurig. It has a feature that the standard home models don't, apparently - a partial ring around the area where the K-Cups load, which in this case prevents the My K-Cup from seating properly and also blocks the Keurig from closing. Good thing I bought new K-Cups yesterday.If you have a standard home machine, this should work fine. Just save your receipt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes your coffee taste like plastic","review":"The My K-Cup was incredibly disappointing. After buying (and loving) my Keurig B40 Elite, I was excited at the prospect of no longer having to shell out 50 cents for mediocre K-Cups. However, the My K-Cup was so bad that I would gladly pay a small fortune for every cup of coffee to never have an experience with it again. After washing it eight times and soaking it in various products, it still smelled the way it did when it came out of the box-- strongly of chemicals and plastic. This would be fine except that it also made my coffee taste like plastic. If you have ever tasted weak, plastic-y coffee with grounds in it, you will understand my pain. This did not get better with time. I have now had the My K-Cup for several months and, like a fool, I keep hoping that if I wash it enough, it will stop making things taste like petroleum.

I was instantly disappointed with watery coffee resulting from the device's poor design. I gave it one star rather than two because Keuring obviously tested the product, was aware of its pitfalls and decided to market a substandard filter anyway. As other reviewers have noted, the filter works differently from the K-Cup and not surprisingly, not as well. The filter allows too much water to get through it before the water \\"bonds\\" with the coffee. Water also leaks out of the top of the filter's holder before it even gets to the coffee. One reviewer said he had fixed the watery coffee problem by cutting a plastic K-Cup to slip the filter into, but this did not work for me. The coffee tastes the same, the \\"leaky water\\" mess is bigger and quite frankly, you shouldn't have to do this anyway.

The coffee also sprays all over the place messing up the surrounding area.

You're going to have to pull it down a considerable amount. Don't pull it off. Do pull it down to where just the very tip of the needle shows. Then go on and use the filter and you should have no flooding problems.

No worry about making too much or too little or having it too mushy or not steamed enough, all the hard work is already done for you.

I have to tape two of them together for my pug and it sometimes doesn't absorb quick enough and rolls right off the pad and I end up having to clean the floor. These would be good for a dog 5 pounds and under. They were packed nice and arrived fast but I wouldn't order these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tiny to wee wee . ..","review":"These wee wee pads were very small. The picture shows them as the normal size that I typically get, but when I got them they were the size of a diaper (for a small child). It was very strange. Also, they were in a box, bundled in bags of 3. So there was 100 bags of 3 each in the box when it arrived. . .another strange deal. Anyway, do not order this product, there are many others which are much better and almost the same cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"these will last quite a while before I have to go to the pet store again. They are a little thin but still worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"One of the reasons we chose this set over others we saw, was because of the large carrying case that would hold all of the play pieces. However, as soon as we opened the case (for the first time) both of the snaps (that hold it closed) popped off. They can be popped back on, but they always pop off each time it is opened. This poses a problem because my daughter who is very capable of opening similar snaps on toys, can not put them back on herself. So the case is pretty much useless because of how poorly it is made."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite toy","review":"It always surprises me which Christmas presents will be my son's favorite. This year the doctor set was the biggest hit. Both my boys, almost 4 and 2, have spent the last week giving each other and my husband and I check ups.

The case is not so durable, and already broke when opening the packaging, I didnt want to return and get a new one as kids were already excited with teh contents inside the case and were playing with it instantly. For now when it needs to be carried, they hold it flat, instead of the handle, sucks for hte price we paid, but I guess its functional and being used quite often for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the purchase","review":"I do not recommend this product for several reasons. First, the plastic itself is cheap, particularly the very thin plastic that keeps the items in place. Secondly, the cell phone, stethoscope, and pager are very unreliable (they often do not make the sounds). Overall, it was not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete set","review":"I ordered this doctor's kit for my 4 year old and he loves it. I think the best part about it is that it comes with a variety of pieces to complete the doctor's set. Some of the pieces have working parts. The blood pressure cuff has a gauge that spins when you pump up the cuff; the cell phone and pager are both battery powered and make sounds; the thermometer has a temperature display that can be changed according to the patient's condition; and the stethoscope has a button on it that makes coughing sounds (although, I wish it actually worked like a real stethoscope. I will probably buy one that is more realistic to replace this one). The glasses are a cute addition, however, they are too small to fit on my son. They fit better on his 1 year old sister.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.

I love the case that everything goes back inside and it is neatly put away after use. All of the pieces have stood up, and nothing is broken 6 months later. That is a pretty good testament for any toy these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"For the amount of money I expected more. I would not buy this product again. I will buy the basic less expensive one next time. The first thing I noticed was that the case is very difficult to close. The plastic clasps do not work properly and hardly ever snap back into place. The second thing was that the stethoscope did not work. I removed the plastic tab on the battery and then nothing. I will try replacing the battery but for $25 I expect to get a product with good working batteries. I also would have preferred a stethoscope that let's you hear your heartbeat not an electronic sound.**Update** I changed the rating from a 2 to a 1 because the batteries were leaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good Dr.'s Kit","review":"Some of the items are a bit cheap, but my daughter has enjoyed playing with the kit, and I am glad that I purchased it for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Please Don't waste your money!","review":"I actually purchased this play set in 2010 as a Christmas gift, but set it aside and forgot about it. Fast forward to 2012 where it is rediscovered in all of it's plastic wrapped new glory and presented to my daughter who is playing doctor with her doll. She excitedly ripped off that sealed plastic covering, opened the box and started exploring the contents of the box. As she removed the stethoscope from the plastic holder it came apart in her hands with the plastic ear tubing coming apart from the heart beat section the screw hole that was holding them together completely ripped through. The glasses weren't even together in the box, one arm just laying there in the plastic holder as the other part came out. After trying several sets of new AA batteries in the \\"cell\\" phone it still never made a peep. I am so disappointed in this product. Please save yourself some money and frustration and skip this set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The blood pressure cuff snapped the first time my son played with it, it's made of cheap plastic. The stethoscope doesn't even really work, it's just a cheap noise maker that makes unrealistic fake heartbeat noises.

It's all cheap plastic and breaks easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent little play dr kit","review":"It would be 5 stars if it didn't include a fake stethoscope and I didn't have to open up the fake stethoscope to bend the little battery prongs out.Several other reviewers noted that the stethoscope is just a sound maker and not a real one like they had when kids. They also noted that the fake stethoscope stopped working within days (or minutes for some). I had this problem too, the noisemaker part stopped working or worked very intermittently. I wasn't going to send it back because I had already also bought a $7 real stethoscope from amazon medical because the noisemaker wasn't real. After opening up the noisemaker, I found the button batteries were very loose. So, I bent out the contacts with a pair of needle nose and its been working ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any imaginative child","review":"My wife is a physician, so it was a no-brainer that my son should have his own doctor kit. I was very impressed with the variety of the set and their robust design. The majority of the tools are very thick plastic so they are almost impossible to break. The items that can be manipulated (clamp, blood pressure cuff, etc.) are mostly easy to use and quite durable. The storage container has plenty of room to add more tools (in my case, a real stethoscope that no longer works). Some may be disappointed it doesn't come with the white coat, but I imagine the price of it would go up by $5 or more and would not be one size fits all.Update: For anyone looking to add a white coat, I suggest the Aeromax Jr. Lab Coat, 3/4 Length"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real kid pleaser!","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. She loves it! The beeper sound is realistic, as is the sound of the phone ring.She loves the stethoscope for it's heart sound and coughing sound. I had to give her a little instruction on opening and closing the case which accommodates all of the instruments plus a few things she has added to it. But she grasped the instruction well and slams it closed in a hurry to race to her next emergency! We have wasted so many bandaids until now. The ones included in the kit are quite ingenious and reusable. I was thrilled over the quality of it and the way it spikes her imaginary play.

My son received this for his 3rd birthday and it started falling apart within 2 weeks. The case is impossible for him to open, the plastic that holds the pieces in place is a disposable type of plastic and tore the first day, there are not slots for each item, the blood pressure cuff barely fits around a wrist and broke after 2 weeks. Just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Nephew LOVED This!!","review":"I got this for my two year old nephew for Christmas and he instantly feel in love with it.

This kit looks amazing and I love all the great tools. Unfortunately, the stethescope arrived broken, the blood pressure tool band is so small it only fits the wrist and tore upon first use. After taping it back together I realized the pump that makes the dial move doesn't work...you press it and it just stays smooshed rather than filling back up with air. The glasses are adorable but too short to even reach my 3 year old's ears so she can't wear them. The case has buckles on it that are seemingly child-proof.

It's was safe to play with but just didn't think she needed to pretend to use it on her little sister. The case is perfect to keep it all together.

For him to have been able to record such good re-recordings of these songs is amazing especially when you consider all he has been through (see the movie or read his book if you don't know of what I speak). I declare him the TRUE KING of Rock And Roll because he didn't lose his edge like Elvis did. The only reason I only gave this 4 stars is because I would have liked more originals also.

It is easy to forget how dirty some of those songs actually were. The duet between Lewis and Quaid I enjoyed as well, though it is not the strongest song on the CD, it is simply fun.

Neither artist strives for the spotlight as can happen in these works but instead grow into phrases in a unified manner that gives the effect of there being one expanded instrument!Gerhardt's lush tone is matched by Groh's caressing echoes and leads and the two present Brahms with such a unified approach that these performances enter into the realm of the great ones. Fortunate we are to have musicians of this quality playing in a manner that is utterly selfless and to the glory of Brahms. Highly Recommended.

I enjoyed seeing it in blue ray format."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST BLADE MOVIE!","review":"PROS.JUST SEEING BLADE KILLING SOME VAMPIRES IS ALLWAYS WORTH WATCHING!CONS. JOKE TELLING SIDE KICKS FOR A HORROR ACTION MOVIE STINKS! IT KIND OF MAKES YOU BELIEVE THE RUMORS ABOUT BLADE BEING REPLACED BY HANNIBAL KING AND THE NIGHTSTALKERS! I WOULD PREFER TO CONTINUE TO SEE BLADE DO THAT JOB INSTEAD OF THEM ANY DAY!IN ALL.IF YOUR A FAN OF THE BLADE MOVIES, YOU SHOULD STILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite great...","review":"I could see where the script was probably a lot better than the application. Great ideas (the return of Dracula, the addition of two-more vampire hunters - the very attractive Jessica Biel and the very funny Ryan Reynolds, and the end of Blade's world as he knows it) met average directing and poor performances by the main evil character (Dominic Purcell).If the Dracula character had been played by an actor with some depth we could have seen a more poignant and intense movie (Dracula, a creature of ancient customs feeling out of time in the modern world).Instead we get a movie that has pretty good action scenes with its most redeeming concept being a spin-off of the two characters played by Biel and Reynolds. I hope that happens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor addition to the Blade series","review":"The first blade was amazing. Great story, insane action, good score to tag along. The second was nice as well. But this movie was almost like a made for tv movie spinoff about a joke bunch of missfits guest staring blade. Not to mention its a big commerical. Spend your money on something more deserving"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best thing about the movie is the music","review":"The best thing about the movie is the music and that's the only good thing. I yawned thru this movie so many times I lost count. So my friend and I grooved to the music to keep ourselves awake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 2","review":"Some things I liked about the movie1. New wisecracking human vampire hunters2. The fact that the movie producers got rid of most of the CG crap plaguing Blade 23. Nice Dialog-Hannibal King is just funnyThe story line is pretty basic, the vampires grow a brain finally and figure out its cheaper to frame Blade then kill him. To which we add the usual vampire gang that looks like they escaped the destruction of the Rock Horror Picture Show. Blade hooks up with some vampire hunters that count among their number Whister's daughter.The movie is not boring (like I'm making it sound)The only thing I didn't like was the main villain Dracula they ruined what could have been a great couple of fight scenes but always having them end to quickly.Overall-Worth the money if you liked the two previous films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stopped at Blade 2","review":"I found myself yawning through most of this movie. There was little to arouse my interest, except for a couple of brilliant insults uttered by the 'comic relief' character who was one of Blade's sidekicks and I cannot remember his name. However, not even Jessica Biel could save this mindless trash. Whistler dies ... again (but we all know that there is nothing that can keep that man down). Despite the fact that every law enforcement group in the world was after Blade, I felt strangely unconcerned. He's already gone up against a god, and those freaks in the second one. A bunch of cops aren't going to cut it.It was certainly the most unconvincing version of Dracula I have ever seen - as well as the weirdest looking looking female vampire villain, who was more amusing than scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action and Special Effects!","review":"I gave this movie 3 1/2 stars because of the action and special effects! There were also two great characters introduced (a gorgeous woman vampire slayer who is deadly with a high tech bow and arrow) and a guy (an ex-vampire, turned wise-cracking vampire slayer) as helpers to Blade in his war on the vampire nation.In this one the vampires sensing they are losing, search out the original vampire of their species (he was Dracula among his many other identities). They hope that through him they will achieve the ability to be out in the light, making them truely immortal! The slayers on the other hand, are seeking this Dracula to use his blood to destroy all the world's vampires.The fight scenes get a little corny (a la Kill Bill) at times but they are well choreographed to strong rock guitar music. The movie is not as good as the prior two but it is better than a lot of the action films, especially the zombie films that Hollywood seems to be spitting out today."},{"rating":"1","title":"First 2 were good, this one is atrocious.","review":"The first 2 films were very good. The only thing I didn't like was the fake CG effects in Blade 2. But this one is just terrible. I mean c'mon, how can regular humans fight vampires in hand-to-hand combat and kill them? Now I'm no expert on vampires... But aren't they supposed to be immortal and have super-human abilites? The story-line is weakening, so they have to bring in 2 new main-characters. The script also has much to be desired. So, Wow, talk about annoying, this movie is almost as bad as Resident Evil 2.I'd rent it before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade finally hit rock bottom.","review":"This movie killed the Blade character.Weak story: The story lacked depth and didn't even attempt to be slightest original.Poor casting: The supporting actors were lifeless and appeared forced to act in this movie. They were a horrible pick for roles. Even Wesley Snipes looked uncomfortable around his team mates.No cool action sequences: The action scenes were poorly choreographed. The punches and kicks lacked \\"pow!\\".No intriguing dialogue: The dialogue is kept a little too simple and brief. Lots of corny one-liners.In short: Blade 1 kicked butt, Blade 2 was half way decent, but Blade 3 really ended the reputation of one of the coolest comic book heros for good. It's a shame. The Blade storyline/character had potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the positive reviews","review":"Sequels are usually a bit of a letdown. Thanks to prozac I've learned to deal with that, but Blade Trinity is a mess all onto itself. What could have been interesting got completly fumbled in the execution. Starting with the whole Dracula plot and the addition of Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds and the horribly miscast Natassa Lyonne who seems like she's in another movie altogether. The only thing saving this creepshow is some well choreographed fight scenes and Parker Posey camping it up as Danika. Strained on what the hell to do with the story, the everything but kitchen sink plot includes vampire dogs. That's right folks, vampire dogs. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BLADE --HAS NO EDGE","review":"this movie is not the one I thought they would have made. this movie has intended modern day humor--but, its all humorless---not funny at all. BLADE 1+2 had some edge to it and took the movie reasonably serious, but this is just doppy. cool special effects, nice attractable young cast(does their best-but fails) seems allbeit just wasted. the movie could have been the grande finale in the series but with its unever tone and content--it just sinks. wesley is always great and stunts are cool, but if you do not have writing, decent plot, or people you care about -its just pointless. I could not wait for some if not all of them die--here is for hope!---wesley has a right to be pissed off. the company ruined the picture. if there is a BLADE 4 lets hope its stays to the first two movies tone. sorry, no sale"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?...","review":"This movie is a posterchild for not letting B-List actors have a say in what happens in the movie. Wesley Snipes is a great action star.... That's it!! He doesn't direct, he doesn't produce, and I think that the most actual acting he's done in a movie was \\"Wildcats\\" with Goldie. The movie stank, the actors stank King stole the show and saved the Seventh Heaven reject and the action superstar. Maybe they should do a movie on him. Until Wesley stops directing, make mine Spidey!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful.....","review":"I didn't like the first two Blades, but I appreciated them. But this one, it was with out question the worst movie I have ever seen. Why movies nowadays portray Dracula as a nothing I have no clue. Dracula is the supreme villain, having walked the earth for thousands of years. A master of disguise, a murderer, and the untouchable. This movie also makes him look weak. Blade is a mortal, Dracula is not. If you read history, you can not kill Dracula the way he is killed in movies. Save your 7 dollars and go see Waterworld. You'll get more excitement out of that. I gave it one star because it won't let me go ten stars in the negative."},{"rating":"1","title":"For those really in the know","review":"David Goyer proves he is a writer and NOT a director for this series final. Product placement is shamefully abused. The Blade character is simply in this movie to set up the next series about the Nightstalkers. Read the other reviews and you can tell, who is writing for simplicity and who is really reviewing this based on the previous films and expectations of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring, dull and unworthy of Blade series","review":"If Blade 1 and 2 were terrific films this is a terrible sequel in comparison. From the start the movie looked like a second grade comedy, where the comical parts were ironically not the ones that the script writers intended. It is an ensemble of unintelligent and not so suave looking crew for Blade with funny looking costumes and horrible acting. The villain looks no more than a good for nothing punk, and is very unimpressive. They could have used anybody and he might have done better. I couldn't even watch the entire film, and was easily distracted. Oh, how i wish they could have used Del Torro for this one too, but then we can't have it our way all the time, can we now? I am glad i did not waste a penny to watch this and so shouldn't you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade trinity","review":"I love this movie I love the unrated version you get more than the regular movie and I love that.

I mean really, how many martial art vampires are there? I realize it's a fantasy film of course but the fighting was too unnatural, not organic enough. Also having Dracula be from the middle east instead of Transylvania was also rather weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade Trinity","review":"I enjoyed this movie. Blade seems to be a cold blooded killer because he is taking on a nation of vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has it's strengths but...","review":"My major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires. These extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp, vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin, and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun. Vampires are supposed to be scary, but how frightened of them should I be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him. Writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable. The first Underworld movie would be a good model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Any Blade fans will love this one. Great action and widescreen effect is awesome.

Great action, Jessica Beil,funny, Jessica Beil, amazing visuals, Did I mention Jessica Beil?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst in the series.","review":"I agree with tha inspecta. This movie was very low brow. All the heart got ripped away in David S. Goyer's director debut. They should have gotten the director of the original blade. Maybe then there would be more room for creative changes since all characters were either two-dimensional, lacked in mental abilities, are easily snuck up on when they should be couragous military type professionals, and have no depth, rhyme, reason, or sense. It's a total let down. There were some talk and rumors of there being a fourth blade or a night hunters spin off or some nonsense like that. The best advice I can give is this: let sleeping dogs lie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action movie, especially if you have a 6.1 channel H.T.","review":"This is a \\" good \\" movie, a lot of action, maybe the best of the Blade trilogy, like most of the action movies is predictable, and to compensate it the story gives Blade some help from people we never knew they exist, but it's only an action movie, I can't judge it too hard.What I really like is the DTS ES, is amazing, the additional surround channel really makes a diference, if you have a H. T. with 6.1 channels, get this movie, it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"The battles are so one-sided, you start rooting for the vampires. I mean, one touch of Blade's silver weapons and they're dead. Wow, really exciting, huh.And their casting of Dracula was completely wrong. I mean terribly wrong.Also, Blade and Whistler seem to be killing or severely injuring humans in this movie - blasting them with shotguns, blowing them up, etc. I found that reprehensible. What's the point of vampire hunting if not to protect humans?"},{"rating":"1","title":"to the point","review":"The action wasn't on par with the Blade series at all, the plot was absurd, and Ryan Reynolds, who I'm usually alright with, was just annoying and simply does not fit into the Blade series. Like this movie as a whole.The opening sequence was alright, but from there it just went downhill. About the only good parts of this movie are the fact that Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson are both in it again.So, it comes down to a lot of trilogies--the first two are great, but the third you should only buy if you absolutely LOVE the character, regardless of how bad the movie they put him/her into is. I just picked this one up because it was dirt cheap and I hadn't seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie sucks gorilla balls","review":"This movie sucks gorilla balls. it was not a good movie compared to LION KING. it was so bad that i pooped in my pants. it made my cat lick it's balls then he ate them off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade Trinity is Crap!","review":"I am a fan of the first 2 movies. I really liked them. But this 3rd movie is extremely boring. It is mediocre compared to the first 2 movies.There is also a very stupid ending...no wait...let me rephrase that....There is no ending ! This movie does NOT show you what the hell Blade or his friends are going to do now that the series is over.Does Blade finally become human ? Does he retire with Whistler's daughter ? Are all the vampires really dead ? The audience is left without any answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"In one word. \\"Horrible\\"","review":"This movie is horrible. I almost got up and left. The franchise has jumped the shark.

He walked through the whole movie... or was sleep walking. The two partners with no super strength or speed were beating vampires as easily as Blade. The major let down was when Blade and Dracula had their final battle. There was not much of a fight considering Dracula should have given him more of a fight than the previous villians. Overall, he should have stayed in bed and let someone else take the movie seriously. Oh, the constant jokes by the co-star got WAY OUT OF HAND!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Blade","review":"Don't wast your money, ESEPCAILLY if you are a Blade fan.

The best thing about the entire movie was the makeup. There were several corney jokes, which really take away from the movie in my opinion, a sad story line, and the fight scenes were just pitiful. They should have stopped with Blade 2, at least they had a great new type of vampire, but no, they had to go and ruin a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula ruined It","review":"Trust me, the actor playing him wasn't bad but they totally f-ed up the story and myths of dracula. I even wanted a demon looking monster but what i got was crap. I liked Van Helsings design better accually. At least he could fly. And Dracula did not look perfect considering he is supposed to be a vampiric god! And since when is Blade a more perfect vampire then Dracula as stated in the finale of the film. Forget that! Want a vampire movie? \\"Queen of the Damned\\", or even the anime classic \\"Vampire Hunter D\\". Much better and both movies have more kick a** hunters in them. D is the son of Dracula and Lestat f-ed a goddess! This movie sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"top ten things i didnt like about this movie","review":"10. nothing new here that the first two films didnt do better.9. the last time i saw that much Apple product placement, i was in my local Mac store8. ryan reynolds' one liners were completely and utterly unfunny7. the soundtrack sounds like it came right from a 13 year olds' ipod. which it probably did.6. i didnt quite understand how superhumanly strong vampires can beat on a chained up human for fifteen minutes and he ends up getting up and kicking their asses.5. they should have called the movie Blade 3: Blade's Friends.4. the special effects were neither special nor effective3. wesley snipes phones his part in. his acting is so crusty!2. all the characters were a mess. by the end of the film i was hoping everyone was going to die.1. Dracula looked like the lead singer from Creed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest of the bunch!!","review":"This was a painfull movie to watch! The Blade franchise runs its course with this thrid release and shows its a total mess. Wesley Snipes looks like he just wants this film to end with his performance. He seems almost boored! The storyline is weak and the dialogue is ugly to listen. The choreographed action scenes are fair. The biggest mistake was killing off the character played by Kris Kristofferson in order to bring in a younger audience. In the last 2 movies, he gave the movie class. The producers should have known that if it ain't broke, don't fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oooohh... Blade!","review":"After those words were uttered... I knew. I knew like you know a good melon when you hold it in your hands. Albeit this was a bad melon. That's right. This movie was bad. How bad? So bad, I'll never go to another night showing of a movie for quite sometime... call me the matinee man. Actually no, the moment the vampire gives the sun the proverbial \\"bird\\", I knew then and there that Blade had become a joke. The only upside to this movie, if there was one, was Ryan Renolds. His presence alone allowed me to sit and stay the length on this movie. It seemed the director tried too hard. Every scene with the bad guys had them entering in slow-motion with quasi-cool music with bass lines. How cool can it be if the main bad guy is Dracula? Dracula?! Ugh... So to reiterate and to sum up... How bad was Blade Trinity? So bad I think it gave me cancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I remembered","review":"I loved this movie when it came out.

It's just okay for me, especially next to the other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next Blade","review":"With the teaser being released quite a while back, one could only imagine what this new Blade movie had in store. It was well worth the wait though. Trinity has what all Blade fans could want from it, from the vampires to the weapons and new heroes. The new cast is amazing with Ryan Reynolds shining above the rest. WWE fans will be pleased with the appearance of Triple H who handles his role with ease. Wesley Snipes is his usual self, delivering a good performance. With a story taking you back to the first vampire and great action, fans of this genre of movie will be pleased.

Kris Kristoferson as usual is just great so... they kill him off right away. Jessica Biel was pretty bad though at least she gave you something to look at. But stuff int he story and the dialogue was just idiotic. \\"My name is Hannibal King. And this little hellion, is Abigale.\\" I mean Jesus it was just like a comic book that some idiot wrote. WWE wrestler HHH was also, you guessed it, AWFUL!The best part of it besides Kris Kristoferson was Wesley Snipes. He actually salvaged something out of it cause he is just such a badass and cool in these movies. The guy that played Dracula who is in the TV show Prison Break looked imposing at first but then came off more like somebody from a bath house in San Francisco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade Trinity","review":"If you like vampires and sci fi action violence you would love Blade TrinityThe story is about A vampire named Blade (Wesley Snipes) who is half vampire himself. In the movie Blade has to fight the ultimate vampire evil . . . Dracula. Blade has some help from two younger vampire slayers but they are not much help when it comes to fighting Dracula. Will Blade defeat Dracula? Find out in the action packed movie Blade Trinity.If you buy the dvd Blade Trinity there are some spectacular special features including deleted scenes, the unrated edition of Blade Trinity with ten extra minutes of vampires and action and much much more. I give this movie two thumbs up. There is great acting and wonderful use of emotion and violence. I recommend this movie to anyone older than 13 and not to children."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucked and not in a good way","review":"I wasn't all that crazy about the first Blade movie. I really loved the second Blade movie, but this one was a complete joke! It became less about Blade and more about Whistler's \\"sexy daughter\\". But even, that wasn't the problem.The dialogue was terrible, the acting wasn't all that either. But even THAT wasn't the problem.The plot was atrocious. First off, aren't vampires supposed to get stronger the older they are? So why is the first vampire running from Blade? Why do they seem matched in power? Dracula should have wiped the floor with Blade.Also, in the beginning when Whistler's daughter was setting a trap for the vampires by using the fake baby. Shouldn't the vampires have been able to tell it was a fake baby?Basically a lot of lame scenarios to try to pull this movie off. So not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the three, no doubt about that.","review":"This is easily the weakest of the three Blade movies.

I did not expect this sequence to be worst than the other two movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay comic movie","review":"Being a \\"comic geek\\" I considered this movie a must see. I enjoyed the 1st Blade movie and was hoping for the Blade story to be greatly expanded on in this triligy.This movie has added a lot of comic situations and one-liners to keep your interest as the basic fight scenes that you would expect in a \\"vampire\\" movie are not enough to make this a great movie, but the path has been set to let Blade go away and set the scene for more movies of this nature with \\"Daywalkers\\".All in all, an okay movie, but not one I would recommend to others looking for an action film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sit-throughable if you're action and/or vampire movie buff","review":"The third venture into Marvel's Blade movie is something less than the first two offerings. As an action movie it stands fine on it's own. Fine meaning that if you like action movies you'll watch it until the end. If you consider that the characters are continuing to take more of a backseat to the action in each movie then you'll understand my disappointment here. Add a star if you're not concerned that the actors phoned in their performances and the main villain comes across as dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth renting","review":"Don't spoil your last memories of the original Blade movie. This is a very sad close to the Blade series with some groan-worthy, cliche lines and forced performances -- by everyone. It tries to be funny, it tries to be edgy, but it just falls flat. Nothing new, imaginative or inventive to offer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"Where would I start. The plot was most likely written in a weekend. The acting is awful. The special effects marginal at best and very sparatic. Its incredibly boring and the introduction of several new characters completely ruined the pace of the flick. The 1st two Blades were excellent. I was incredibly disappointed in this disaster. The lame attempt at humor in this movie is laughable in itself. The jokes suck and the delivery is inappropriate. I couldn't wait for this mess to end. The directors and producers should be prosecuted for ruining a franchise that was built on two excellent prequels. This is by far one of the worst sequels I have ever seen. Some of these reviewers must be on the payroll of New Line Cinema or a family member of the director. Dont buy this junk. Rent it first and then thank me for not wasting your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fitting end to the trilogy...","review":"If you're like me you can't get enough of Blade. The third installment takes a departure from the previous two movies. Now there is a new group in place to support Blade. A contingency plan in case things went wrong. Blade is alone again and is reluctant to accept the help of these newcomers, but realizes it may be the only way to take care of business. Some of the wise cracks don't feel right early on in the film, but the action makes you forget that. I rate the movie a 4 out of a 5. Some of the dialog can get cheesy, but the story and action are top notch. I recommend this installment for any fan of the previous Blade movies. It doesn't disappoint as an end to the series. But really... do we know if this is the end? Snipes IS Blade. This man deserves so many more action roles where his fighting ability can shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade Trilogy Ending Deserves Better Than This !!","review":"This movie smacks of sub-par quality. Unlike its two predecessors which are far superior, Blade III is plagued with a poor script, an unqualified director (sorry, David Goyer is no director), and a storyline that sputters in closing out what would have been one of the best comicbook-to-film trilogies in the marketplace. Think Godfather III in the Godfather series and you'll know why to bypass this awful film. This movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the Blade character in the first two films. Without these attributes, the follow-on action and violence in the film (an artistic staple in the Blade franchise) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you'd expect. What you get is a convoluted story with no momentum and characters (including Snipes's Blade) who are all dressed up with no where to go. Rated or Unrated, avoid this DVD at all cost. It isn't worth the money or the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade 1 & 2 were the best...","review":"Yes, this movie fell off the shelf...Tries to be funny...Adding more characters just seemed to kill off Blades mystique...Makes me pretty upset that they had to ruin and end the franchise with this piece of crap work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Blade Yet!","review":"Wow! That's all i can say...Wow! THis movie was way higher than what i expected.

Some parts of it were, ok. But the writing was somewhat desperate and very predictable. Blade was good, Blade 2 was killer and Trinity, well, very disappointing. Goyer's directing was terrible, not to mention looked a little amateur at best. Look at the shot of Triple H running after them after they escape the police station, WHAT IS THAT???? That looked way too ridiculous. Of course, there was nothing wrong with Wesley Snipes' performance, even though the movie was sickening he did a great job, as well as Jessica Beal (did I just say that???). The extras are alright and if you're a hardcore Blade fan, buy it, if not, you won't like this film, Goyer needs to leave the directing to the professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell was this?","review":"This was a waste of an hour and a half of my life. I left at the last thirty minutes this movie sucked so bad. The story, Dracula, the first vampire, is gonna kill us all! OH NO! If only this guy was cool. They summon him to kill Blade even though the cops could have done it more easily than Dracula. But we also have a band of hobo's that have a motto of f%#k you, pretty amazing. They were bad actors. Along with Blade, he should have used his sword more often but nooo, he had to just use the stupid gun, which is fine except for the fact he kicked ass with the gun. There was no blood! Blood was rare for this, yet not so rare for the earlier ones.

I was blown away. For the first 30 mins, I was anchored to my chair. What amazing action sequences! I have never seen such crazy stunts. The sound effects were great. In my theater, you could feel each punch and crash of a car. The music was nice and loud. This is really not for you if you are easily offended by MTV-style editing and sound. I subtracted one star for the ending. It all seemed to finish too abruptly. Everyone in my party was sorta like, \\"huh?\\" Basically, if you liked numbers one and two, I highly recommend seeing this in a big noisy theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"was this the best storyline they could think of???????","review":"The first movie was awesome innovative and actioned packed.The second was luke warm but the third was terrible.The stroyline was toatally predictable boring and uninteresting.A good horror /action flick has got to have a strong story otherwise it's just wesly snipes on a routine vampire bashing job.Nothing really interesting happens....it was a total let down.And one more thing ----it was a bad action flick but a horrible comedy.(what was with all the jokes!!!!)---no further comment.buy the first movie it's the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to confuse teens even more","review":"This book was incredibly inaccurate - not only about Mormonism but also the Jehovah's Witnesses. Its use of insulting and denigrating language was in extremely bad taste. (Who can forget p.141, where it says, \\"That's the shot you need to kill the faith-eating bacteria of the cults.\\"?)There was little accuracy in this book.

Furthermore, the patronizing title of this book is insulting and assumes that evangelical youth are absolutely clueless about cults. While I agree with the authors that the doctrines of JWs and Mormons are false, I disagree with their presentation of the material. Don't waste your time purchasing this book - if you do you will be disappointed.

Why? Because it is the preferences and prejudices of our youth that to a great extent determines the kind of adult we will become. In some cases this is good (your parents' instruction in morality) in some cases this is bad (Hitler youth). This book has targeted the baser side of this equation. The way this book teaches you to think and react to those of a faith different from your own is quite similar to the way other prejudices are instilled in people. It is the easy path to dislike those different from ourselves. That's why the nation is divided into two ideologies that walk in lockstep. It is quite another to think for yourself. If your desire is the latter, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly is as ugly does.","review":"I *have* read this book, and it is nothing more than anti-Mormon propaganda written in a condescending style in an attempt to attract young people who can't see the ugliness for what it is.If you don't like Mormons and if you want to read something that will justify your own beliefs and if you don't mind the pain of watching an adult try to speak as he thinks a teenager would, this is the book for you.Everyone else should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Inaccurate!","review":"I know it states in the Bible in Luke 6:37- \\"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: These people should uplift others not put something down when you do not have the full story. They are just helping these religions and I know they appreciate it very much. Because others will investigate. Thank You for letting me give my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Student Pastor","review":"This book doesnt cut corners or try to sugar coat the truth. Mormons are NOT Christians, the Christ they claim to worship, is not the Christ of the Bible, it is the Christ thought up in the mind of J. Smith and further propogated by more lies to cover up the first. Mormons need to stop saying \\"That is not what we believe\\" and realize what the \\"church\\" itself teaches.This book shares the truth and I have used it in classes and educated many teens so that they can know the truth when an Elder comes by and uses all the same Christian words they are familiar with. Mormons claim Christians are going to hell and are apostate and yet they are trying to appear Christain. Amazing! I feel badly for Mormons becuase most of them are sincere and are lied to. This book exposes just the tip of the iceberg on the depths of deception this cult goes to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug and Insulting","review":"Mr. White should be a bit embarrassed by this thing. I don't expect that the inaccuracies and caricaturizing will bother him, but the smugness should.

The product, however, appears used. There is some kind of oxidation around the plugs. This would be bad enough, but it gets worse. The most irksome thing about the cable I received is that it causes the monitor to display a fuzzy double image unless there is a device attached to the second port at all times--horrible. Perhaps if they'd sent me the cable that is actually described and pictured here, it wouldn't have this problem, but I wouldn't know.

By this time in the story there seem to be too many characters to keep up with for me. Coupled with the news that Mr. Jordan passed away before completing the series made me put the book down before I finished it. I don't plan to read book 5.I would like to offer my condolences to the family of Robert Jordan. May God comfort you in your loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!","review":"By the end of this book, the only character I could still tolerate was Perrin. If the next book in this series doesn't pick up the pace and start delivering a decent plot, I'm done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I've read this book before, in the early 80s. It was written by David Eddings and it was titled, \\"Pawn of Prophecy.\\" It featured the young farmer of unknown parentage who sees a mysterious shadowy cloaked figure trailing him at times--but it's always gone. It has a blacksmith of virtue and oh-so-practical values who doesn't like to hurt people or be called \\"Lord.\\" It has a mysterious dark-haired, beautiful sorceress who is very imperious, allows no nonsense, and can often be found brushing her hair before bed. It also has an old storyteller who has more skills and knowledge than others would believe--he's more than he appears. Oh, and there's a connection between the main characters and wolves. Jordan has ripped off most of these elements in this book but FAILS to cite his source, which to me makes this plagarism."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE SERIES YET","review":"The Shadow Riising is the best book of (The Wheel of Time) series. It is the best because it goes more in depth about the Aiel and how they originated and there customs,another reason is how he goes more in depth with the forsaken and explaining just how strong Nynaeve really is goingtoe for toe with Moghedien. The other things are finding Mat can pseak the old tongue and command a battle even thow he denys it he will hopefully accept it, and how Perrin and Faile eventually get married and defend The Two Rivers. Finally the end Rand has finally found a teacher. Now finally he might be able to use his powers in a new way but the only we shall if Mr. Jordan shall write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply . . . . . .terrible.","review":"The writing is very corny, and gets worse and worse.

If your considering buying Shadow Rising then you most likely have read the first three.. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because at the end, it gets REALLY easy to loose who's who with all the new people running around with Rand al'Thor.. And alot more story setup for what I'm assuming is going to go down in the next book.. (I'm starting to see a trend of alot of build up with one book and then action in the next, this one was much more the first rather than the latter) How ever, it was worth every minute I spent with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good continuation of the Wheel of Time","review":"Wheel of Time, turn turn turn! Tell us the lesson that we should...The fourth book was quite good, particularly those parts involving Perrin and Faile. I won't get into major plot details, as many others have already beaten me to it. But I do recommend this title. There are some fairly major changes to the overall arc that would leave one confused without this book.My only major complaint is the start, which took far too long. There were definately some good parts of that, but it would have been nice to get out of the Stone well before page 240. But that's really a minor issue.The real question for Mr. Jordan is, will it ever end?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Robert Jordan really hits his stride in book four.

The first 200 pages were fine.But than the book deteriorates rapidly after that.Nyanaeve with her grumblings, Rand's non-stop quarelling with Moraine and Wise ones. A thousand pages & Rand is still not much nerarer to uniting the Aiel than before.The only part worth reading is Perrin in Two Rivers.While introducing the Aiel customs is new, this business of describing every Aiel, Ship captain & soldier is rediculous!I would strongly recommend skimming through the parts on Elayne & Nynaeve, but read in detail on Perrin & Min.Bye!^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest series ever!","review":"This is a must read book and series. I've read a lot of books and i have to say Robert Jordan is very good. He is very detailed and although he does seem to drag things out a bit to much, he has a great plot.

So it becomes more like reading a couple different novels put together.My favorite thing about this book is how wonderful of a story Perrin has. His whole arc is the most satisfying for this book. I shall keep this spoiler free but he excepts some change in his life that sends him down a path with destiny. He is starting to realize just what it means to be ta'veren.The only one that I had any trouble with was Rand. His story line isn't bad. I believe that Jordan was setting up for the long arc with Rand in this book. So that means good for the series but bad for this book.I am still enjoying this series four books in. The cast is always getting bigger but I don't feel lost at all. I love the Wheel of Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it some time","review":"For all of you who are just picking up this series, dont let all the negative reviews beat you down. Some of the readers need to remember that this is a GRAND story, with very far reaching effects into a rich world. Instead of seeing each book on it's own, look at them as an entire story, one that has got to have a middle that builds up the end. It just happens to be that this is one LONG story, and, with that in mind, you can understand its LONG middle! I am sure that none of the readers would want Bobby to end the story in one quick swoop. -Take as long as you need Bobby, we'll still be buying the books..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written.","review":"Robert Jordan never ceases to amaze me with his books.

In this pricing dispute with Amazon, Macmillan has claimed that the concern was about newly released books. This book has been in print for more than a decade. Any costs associated with producing this book we recouped a thousand fold before anyone ever thought of selling the ebook. Given that the cost to Macmillan of the ebook is essentially zero, Macmillan is now charging an unreasonable price for this ebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Rand please","review":"Still a great series so far but I am much less interested in Rand than any other charectors in the book.

Gave 4 stars because its still better than most out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to get through this twice and failed...","review":"I loved the first three books. I burned through them. From reading reviews of the later books, it all goes down hill eventually. For me, I thought this book lacked the excitement of the first three. As the post title indicates, I have tried to read it two times now and could not get past around page 200. Maybe I will try again, but, as a reviewer, I have to say that there is a lot of fantasy out there to read and this is too plodding to please the true adventure seeker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"....What....what happened","review":"Good Evening... oh wait, it's nine in the morning, how odd. I enjoyed immensly the first two Wheel of Time books finding them to be highly entertaining. The third became a little dull in the middle however recovered itself before the end. Two hundred pages into book four however led me to realise that Robert Jordon was an insane lunatic who apparantly had no concept of the word \\"brief\\". Make no mistakes i am a fan of fantasy in its better forms such as \\"The Lord od the Rings\\" and the like, however Robert Jordan seems to be paid by the word. The story spirals into a mess which by all accounts is going to take another eight books to complete. I found myself contemplating the ending after fifty pages such is the predictibility of this book.I am by no means discouraging others from reading the book. I can easily see it's appeal to a wide audience, however it did nothing for me or my dog...wait...oh dear. Robert Jordan claims another victim to his sickness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, but too spread out.","review":"Read this book for the parts on Perrin.

The complexity of these novels is astounding; its characters and their world seem so real. I recommend Wheel of Time as the greatest fantasy series of all time. TSR is better than TDR and the scenes describing the Aiel story and the Emmond's Field Battle are the best of the saga so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book I have ever read","review":"Jordan really makes me feel like I am right beside Rand al' Thor. 3000 years after the Dragon, Lews Therin Telamon or Lews Therin Kinslayer, died on the slopes of Dragonmount, the Dragon is Reborn. Rand al' Thor is the Dragon Reborn and in Robert Jordan's fourth book, the Shadow Rising, he will face hardships like none other.This story weaves peoples lives in a magnificent tapestry. The story shifts back and fourth between a number of people as they share the same problems and the problems of their friends. Rand al' Thor, Matrim Cathon, and Perrin Aybara are taveren, people that bend the pattern of an age around them. Rand is fighting against the Power and Mat is trying to help him while Perrin is trying to free their homeland from Children of the Light and Shadowspawn.Overall this books weaves the pattern of these three lives into a tapestry. They all face troubles that none but themselves can face. This book and series are among the best I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful series Mr. Jordan.","review":"The farther into the series you go the more the plot builds up. It is also increasingly harder to keep track of all the characters names, and customs. But I think the farther into the series you go the better the plot becomes. I only have one complaint - thiers a lot of detail sometimes it's is nessasary and sometimes it's not needed. I can hardly wait to read the next book of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"More top notch fiction/fantasy from Jordan","review":"A grand book.

While the books themselves are long (nearly 1000 pages) I just can't get enough. I have read all of the books that are currently out and cannot wait for the next one. The world spun by Jordan is rich and realistic. And there are strong female roles as well as the typical male roles. Truely a must read series.Tricia Shaffe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old","review":"I enjoyed the 1st book of the series, however, by the time I reached book four I could care less about most of the characters. In addition, I found myself interested in only a few of the many plots, and completely fed up with the writing style (every woman is folding their arms under their breasts, and every man's face, it seems, is \\"carved out of stone\\"). I awaited a likable female character, but only manipulative annoyances were introduced. I know this sounds like a cliche, but I honestly wanted some of the main characters to be killed off, although I got the impression that the author intended for me to like these characters. One last side note to those who read these reviews: I have found it helpful to skip the reviews that claim that the book in question was THE best or worst book ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, great series","review":"It's a great story. Jordan definitely has something here. His only flaw is writing every book as if new readers were jumping in in the middle of the series. He explains everything over again, wasting words. Other than that, it's wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great continuance in the series. This book had a good amount of action with Jordan's detailed descriptive style. Not a short book by any means but if you are enjoying the series then that shouldn't be a problem considering the lengths of the novels and the series itself. You also really get the chance to understand the Two Rivers people along with new lands and all that accompany them."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP NOW!","review":"The usual cast of interesting characters and a (relatively) fast moving plot generate enough action to maintain the reader's interest. The tale of the seige of Two Rivers with the intertwined love story of Perrin and Faile is very well done. There is even progress in some of the other threads in this bloated epic.Unfortunately, this is the last book in the series worth the time or money. Someone desperately needs to remind Mr. Jordan that he's not getting paid by the word. Of course, if he is it would explain a lot about the agonizingly slow and plodding nature of the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ain't what it used to be","review":"This is just a terrible book. That's too bad, because the first three were so good. Robert Jordan tries to put too much romance in this one, and it comes across as lame.

Moving from a home that had wonderful clean well water, the chlorine smell and taste was not acceptable.The faucet filter is easy to attach but changing the filters themselves can be a little difficult. Much pressure is built up behind the filter which makes taking the little cap off the front a chore sometimes. The only other complaint I have is that the filters do not last but a little over a month which makes them quite expensive to change regularly. Also, once the filter life is done, the water just trickles out the spout and runs down the back of the filter housing which makes it difficult to use.Other than the two above complaints, the filters work wonderfully well and completely remove the smell and taste of chlorine. I can usually find good deals on the filters through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first, but didn't last","review":"I agree with the two above reviews as far as they go, but I've had mine for a year now, and it now makes the weakest coffee on earth. At first, running it through the cleaning cycle solved the problem, but now nothing helps. I use twice the amount of coffee I used to use to get the same result. That's an expensive cup of coffee!!! I also run it through the cleaning cycle once a week (I only make coffee once a day, so that's excessive.) Not to mention the hassle of having to clean it so often. It takes an hour to run through the clean cycle, and then you have to make a full pot of hot water twice to clean the vinegar/cleaning solution out of the coffee maker. I just cleaned it yet again, made coffee, and it tastes like muddy water."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd pass on this one...","review":"Within a couple weeks of getting this coffee pot, we had an overflow incident. All over the counter. Then it would brew only half and stop. So I read the manual and did the clean cycle, even only after this short of period.

In 3 weeks time, using it 2 times a week, the second one started doing the exact same thing. I called and they said they would send me another one. I asked if they would like to see the old one to see what was wrong. They said no. I said am I the only one that has this problem. The \\"gentleman\\" stated that since he has worked for Mr. Coffee for 4 years that of course he has seen coffee pots leak. I felt he was being rude.I took the bottom off the maker and discovered that the cheap glue that they use to attach the hoses to a tube comes unglued and there fore causes it to come apart and leak.

We have the model with the stainless steel carafe, so that may be the difference--i don't know. The coffee is not that hot when it comes out of the machine, and the carafe does not keep the coffee hot at all. In fact, once i put cream in it, I have to put it in the microwave to heat it up.

The cookie jar lid doesn't go on firmly, but I think that is so your little one can get it off easily.And it's simple fun that will least for many years. I got this for my 2 year old. She'll play with the cookies. I already caught my 3 year old playing with my 7 year old - explaining what the numbers were on the back of the cookies.

In addition to tragedy, this stunning classic from Ancient Greece asks that age-old question, \\"who am I?\\" This version provides useful annotations for readers.

The animation is sharper and more complex and the story translates well to the screen. It's a bittersweet and depressing tale, but significant for all. Just like \\"Watership Down,\\" \\"Plague Dogs\\" is not a kid's movie. Although it might not be as viscerally graphic as \\"Watership Down\\" it's probably the more disturbing film with some of its themes, imagery, and implications. It is a very mature cartoon. If you liked the book you will be happy.MY COMPLAINT is that the full British cut seems to be unavailable in the United States. While this American edit does not cut out enough to screw up the storyline, it does throw off some of the character development and the pacing. There are so many small character moments that are lost and several scenes will feel slightly truncated...because they are. The film is still great, but I know it's even better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin Rosen has done it again!","review":"This person should really get his hands on more projects!

She was in amazing form and luckily the wobble of her latter years is not yet present. She sounds passionate and wild, like a proud princess in love. Her \\"O patria mia\\" is just lovely and the E-flat is thrilling. Del Monaco still sounded solid and golden in those years, that huge column of sound! When I heard him live he gave me chills!

Not so with this CD on works for the modest recorder. For starters, the instrument is simple, yet totally capable of producing great sounds, especially if you can get two or three fellow schmoes together to play alto, tenor and base recorders.

He impressed me enough to pick up this CD at the show. I honestly do not regret the decision at all. The music's smoothened traditionals and new music in the Appalachian vein. Interspersed with this are taped 'oral history' sound bites with Dirk's grandfather which are a lovely connection between the old music and the grandson's smoother treatment of it. The combination of song and reminiscence lends an openness to the recording that is reminiscent of being invited into Powell's living room for an evening of music.I can definitely see why Ms. Baez picked Powell as her sideman. The music here is well-orchestrated, harmony is tight, and the sound quality of the recording is very good. Well worth a listen and if you are a fan of folk or 'new-grass', I think you'll enjoy the CD.Rebecca Kyle, September 2009"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Wow.

In the end, Kit comes to peace with her mother's final departure.Binchy's novels are peaceful reads which focus on everyday trials predominantly set in Ireland with religion being in the midst of the turmoil.Catherine Jean Schoenbauer-Humphrey, author of When the Smoke Clears- How to Survive and Be Better Off With or Without Your Cheating Spouse"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've never read Binchy, start here","review":"This is my favorite of Binchy's novels, and I've read most of them.I had the pleasure of asking the author about this novel while I was at a book signing for \\"Scarlet Feather\\" a few winters ago. \\"The Glass Lake\\" was so sad, that I asked her if it made her sad to write it. She said that her intention when writing this book was to show the lengths to which people would go to have a loved one buried in hallowed ground. With that information, you can tell that this will not be an upbeat novel. If you are looking for a light read, I'd suggest \\"Evening Class\\" by the same author.If you are looking for a book that makes you feel as if you know the people and the landscape of somewhere that you've never been, read this book. Binchy takes her time in weaving a story, and lets her characters develop and change in the course of a novel. These characters will draw you in.

This book showed how one's actions effects peoples' lives including the person who committed the action. I could totally relate to both Lena and Kim. This is the first book I have read by Maeve Binchy, but if this is any indication of what she has to offer, it won't be the last.

Maeve Binchy has inticed her readers, or at least this one, to travel to this magic country one day.I liked the style with which she used...pinning a mother's romantic side versus her daughter's practical nature. These roles tend to be reversed in storytelling today.Anyone who has ever fantasied about running away from it all will find a friend in The Glass Lake. Lena Gray is the woman I wish I could be. She is gutsy without overdoing it. Binchy has made a charater that I could read about many times over.This book is for the romantic dreamer in us all.

I still don't get it.How many times did we need to hear that Helen married a man she really didn't love, or that Philip was in love with Kit but she did not return his feelings?Kit fell in love with Stevie, but I just don't believe that she would have still cared for him when she found that he had beat Louis so badly that he lost teeth.

I definately recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glass Lake Doesn't Disappoint","review":"Maeve Binchy remains one of the world's most beloved storytellers and with good reason. The Glass Lake is a rich novel that is driven by its endearing characters. Kit and Lena are the kinds of heroines you want to root for: flawed and hopeful, put upon yet able to find redemption when it matters most. Making the reader care about her characters is something Binchy does beautifully, and here is no exception. Like several of her other works - The Scarlet Feather, Quentins, Night of Moon and Stars - the writing is comfortable, if not a bit predictable, but still just as enjoyable. It's like visiting with an old friend: the reader is assured of a good time and a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This a wonderful story of how small towns are.

I loved it so much I felt compelled to read more of Binchy. This book is equally as good. It drew me in from the beginning and it made not want to put it down until the last page. Throughout the book Kit grows into a remarkable yound woman who stands true to her morals. The character of Helena starts off very mysterious, but in the end she is someone who you really feel sorry for. She escapes a comfortable life with little happiness and goes off with her first and only love- only to be betrayed in the end. The only part that I find disappointing (besides the somewhat rushed end) is that while Lena Gray aches to write to her daughter and see her grow- there is little mention of her son. I realize there is a connection between mother and daughter, but the fact that she hardly inquired about her growing son is a little disturbing. Nonetheless, a great read. I'm looking forward to reading another Maeve Binchy page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another pleasure...","review":"There's not a whole lot to say without giving away some aspect of this novel, other than to say that it was absolutely amazing.

I was captivated until the end then was totally disappointed and angry. I did not like the fast tie up, it felt like; Lets do this just to get the book finished. I would also have liked to know more about what Louis's pain was. What made him the way he was? I can understand Helen leaving all for love, and I can understand Kit forgiving, but I have a mixed sense of Louis. It was as if he were two people. I also like how she caught the moral essence and struggles of young men and women of that era. And how fast we can turn on someone, as in the case of Sister Madeleine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"This is still my favorite Binchy novel and I have read them all.

One day she decides to run away to England to be with her long-time lover. Through a series of misunderstandings, the family thinks she has drowned in the lake.

This is confusing for Russians listening to the speaker, who do not understand exactly what the anglophone is trying to say.2) For many of these words, recent borrowings from English exist, but the new word is generally not immediately as usable as the native Russian word.

The organization also makes it easy to understand the context of a word, which a bi-lingual dictionary doesn't always do.

And that's not saying much since he barely ever drops a hot line in the entire album.Production wise, it starts off very promising. When I first heard the album, I listened to it a lot...maybe too much. The beats get old very very very quickly, and the same goes for the entire album as a whole.If you are a Shady/Aftermath groupie and you'll buy anything with eminem's name on it, I suggest you borrow it and see if you change your opinion.

Other songs like \\"The Set Up\\" and \\"Oh!\\" are even destroyed by Trice's impossible-to-like rappin style. Even Eminem can't sav this guy from totally bombing. Don't waste your money, if you want sum Obie though, and are absolutely dyin to hav it, then jus buy D-12's Devils Night. You'll get Obie and a handful of rappers who can actually rap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album needs HELP!","review":"Obie did not have any good beats to rhyme over. I have heard him do better in the underground scene. Eminem gave him horrible beats. This album has no teeth!!! I definitely would not wake up to hear this album. Obie is a good lyricist but on this album his talents were not used. Shady records has just confirmed their first set of flops. 50 cent seems to be the only success out of the shady camp. Dre couldn't even save this album. I am rooting for him hoping for a better effort in the second album. The beef between Shady and Ja are getting old. The themes used in this album are not original. Hoes, guns, beer. Rap music needs to get more creative and stop recycling the same themes. This album is boring and Obie's rep will take a hit for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banking off Eminem's name","review":"The golden ticket giveaway from Shady Records should have been a dead give away. This C.D. is not as lame as D12's \\"Devil's Night\\" because it does have a few good songs. It's evident that Obie is more skilled than alot of people give him credit for lyrically but, he treads on familiar ground throughout the album. If every song seems familiar it's because they are. Beats from Dre or Eminem with carnival-sounding hooks, mediocre Ja Rule disses, somewhat believable gangsta-themed songs and featured guests including Fiddy, Nate Dogg on the hook and Em again. I think that Obie would have been better to get some creative freedom outside of Aftermath for this C.D. My suggestion is to pass on this album but, wait for Obie's next project and hope he can get away from Shady's shadow."},{"rating":"1","title":"you people are sheep","review":"First off, I am in the music industry, and am affiliated with people in this clique. I will remain anonymous to express my true thoughts. Some of the beats on this album are pretty ill, but Obie is a pretty half ass lyricist. In fact all of G Unit are pretty wack as far as writing good verses. The songs pump you up, and the beats are phat, but if we are talking about skill as an emcee, neither obie, or anybody in g unit (except maybe banks) has got skill. They all are half ass. You people probably havent been listening to rap for too long. Also Eminem comes up with some ok beats, but i'd say about one for every ten he makes is actually decent. The rest are boring and wack with no substance. Also siince you dont know Dr. Dre does not make beats. He has a team that does it for him, and then he picks em out and takes the credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Hot!!!!!","review":"1st off, I have to say that this is pretty hot for his 1st album. People say he's gttin all the hype because he signed with Em. If u hot u hot, it don't matter that he's signed with Em. Why wouldn't you want to be down with 1 one the hottest artist out there? (Why play with Barkley and the Suns when u could win with Jordan and the Bulls?)Shady/Aftermath has the game on lock. People had it out for Obie even before his album dropped. They try to compare him to Em and say he's wack like D-12. Obie has his own style. His flow is sick. He spittin that DETROIT FIRE. CHEERS to all tha haters.!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is pretty lame","review":"ok, the beats on almost every song are DOPE, which is why i gave it 2 stars. it's obvious that dre and everyone involved really wanted to help out obie by working hard on the beats and the cameo appearances... but for real, his lyrics are STUPID. they don't make sense. just listen to ANY of his songs and try to make sense of anything he says. he switches subjects every 3 words, and his money lines just aren't money. he doesn't even rhyme that well. if u want to buy something worth it, check out the new G Unit cd or search on google for West Buurbs (they haven't released a cd yet) the beats and eminem's verses are good, REAL good, but besides that, trash this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST NO SH*T","review":"i am SO excited, YOU definately get your money's worth on THIS ALBUM. Obie delivers the best of any CD i have EVER heard. I personaly have never found a cd in which i liked EVERY SONG, and literaly no sh*t i like every single song on this cd. If his lyric blastin talent wasn't enough on its own, his \\"guests\\" make this even better. This is one album that will keep the beats bumpin and the lyrics flowing in your head for A LONG TIME. I recommend this cd to 100% of everyone who even considers purchasing it, and even if you don't know of Obie Trice, but like rap or hip hop, you WILL like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"damn tight cd","review":"wow cranky reviewer has absolutely no clue what he is talking about. true a lot of people probably wouldn't know who obie was if it wasn't for eminem but u can't say he's not a good rapper. the beats r tight and the lyrics r tight. eminem tears it up. go and get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kangaroo should hang with Stupazino and the sauce.","review":"Anyway the album is good for your first and he is no gimmick for nothing by the way.

I purchased this cd only because it was cheap and Eminem was on it, so I didn't expect much. I'd heard a couple verses and thought Obie was dope... I even met the cat and he was cool as hell, so I figured I'd support, but I didn't think this CD would be anything I would continuously bump....I WAS WRONG.\\"Cheers\\" is one of the most impressive debuts by a new artist that I have ever heard. The beats, done mostly by Eminem, pound and the rhymes are ill. Obie is definitely a lyricist and he writes very compelling and ill stuff. The cameos are great. This LP features Eminem, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, D12, Busta Rhymes and Nate Dogg, with Eminem, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Fredwreck, and newcomer Emile on production...Emile is sick, definitely someone to look out for.Dope from front to back...Cop this LP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obie Trice At Last","review":"to tell the truth I've been waiting a long time for this cd to come out and it finally has!!this is the best cd that I've ever heard (besides D12)I gotta give credit to Em where credit is duecuz this is a really good cdMore than 5 stars truthfully"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut, another classic from the Shady camp.","review":"It seems to be the natural tendancy for me to compare this album to 50 Cent's \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\". Although 50's album is more fun, and more catchy Obie can actually tell a story in his rhymes rather than just blurting out random gangster phrases. The production on this album has got to ge the best ive heard in years. Eminem is gettiing better and better with each album he produces. All in all, great album, maybe not quite as good as 50's but still hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLID","review":"Obie Trice holds it down on this album.

Bumping it is great for \\"fight music.\\" Anything Eminem produces is flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying","review":"\\"Cheers\\" is one CD you should definitely buy. It's part gangsta--you can see that with the picture of Obie squeezing the pistol--but there's lighter hearted stuff too. \\"Got Some Teeth\\" is a great song, but the only problem I had was that there wasn't more like it--songs where Obie showcases his sense of humor. None of it is explosive, though that's not Obie's style, really--but I didn't need to use the skip track during this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"obie's watches from the background","review":"this album was not worth buying because obie didnt come off clever and creative with catchy themes. Eminem stills the spot light on \\"Lady\\" and has most listeners fastforwarding to 1:20 to when Em comes in. The spot light never gets back to being on Obie instead Busta Rhymes steals the spot light on the track he's on towards the end of the CD. Great beats and verses by EM busta nate dogg and 50. Obie just couldn't compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a CD worth buying","review":"I've listened to this whole CD over and over again, and it's incredible.

Eminem has done it again! He produced almost the whole album with the tightest beats and Obie just murders the tracks with crazy lyrics. And of course Dre lays some nasty beats too. My favorite cuts are \\"Sh*t Hits The Fan\\", produced by Dre with Eminem on the hook and \\"Hey Lady\\", a crazy beat layed by Eminem with Obie spittin' on it, and just to make it better, Eminem spits too. Then on the last track it's Eminem with D12 for the grand finale. Like Em says on \\"Everyone Dies One Day\\" SHADY RECORDS YOU BETTER BELIEVE THE HYPE IS REAL! No Doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"obie comes swinging","review":"i enjoy this cd, the production is incredible. evey song is pretty solid, and it is a good purchase. i dont care what anyone says, obie's style is unique and that contrasts the guest appearances perfectly. with great production, any an all-star cast, anybody's rhymes would make this a good cd, but obie fits into the woodwork perfectly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheers!","review":"This album is so much more than I expected! I wanted it cuz Em is producing most of it & Em can produce! Than I heard that \\"Got Some Teeth\\" Sh**. I think that song is Garbage. But if you like that song then you will love all the other songs. I have listened to this album from Track 1-18 2 times a day for over a week. Every song is good! Except for Got Some Teeth. But the beats are bangin, some sound different too. The Join timbaland did is wild, Lloyd, Em & 50 go off on one cut. CD is wild GET IT! If you dont want to get it cuz you dont like \\"Got Some Teeth\\" Get it anyways cuz the rest of the album is sooooo much better than that song. The hottest cuts is Tracks 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,12,14,17. I like all the other ones too, except that Got Some teeth! Damn, tha boy can rap too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obie doesn't live up to hype","review":"Obie is a mediocre lyricist, with a below average flow and delivery. The best joints on this album have NOTHING to do with him, but rather the guest appearing on the album. First mistake they made was making and releasing \\"Got some teeth\\". The song alianted his current fans. People saw right through the attempt to gain the TRL crowd and the single bombed. Despite MARKETING this album so strong they had NO buzz. So they then threw in a \\"Golden Ticket\\" to boost the sales and stop the album from FLOPING. But the winning ticket is to meet EMINEM not OBIE TRICE? The album has average to below average beats and brings nothing to the table as far as lyrical content. Which a rapper with personality and charisma could get by with.

I am sorry, this man cannot rap and should not rap! It is obvious that he is trying to be the next Big Boi or Andre 3000. It ain't gonna happen, Obie! You can't rap! And to make things a little worse, he is trying to be a hip-hop artist! Man, you gotta have the vocals like Outkast or Nelly. Obie would be better suited as a metal artist!

Actually, I would like to read a sequel to \\"How I Paid for College\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For All Ages","review":"I teach high school music and I found this book to by far, be the most hilarious work I have ever had the privilege to read. I felt the need to read passages to my friends with whom I was sharing a flight because I couldn't stop laughing out loud by the antics of Edward and his friends. Edward's narration was both witty and poignant, but most of all, it captured every nuance of the teenage mind and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for a movie version!","review":"Very very funny, the perfect audio book! I ended up wanting to be stuck in traffic so I could finish listening..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to laugh...BUY THIS BOOK !!!","review":"If you're looking for a light-hearted, rollickingly good read...this is the book. I never laughed out loud reading a book, but this had me doing that on the subway. Marc Acito's writing is a breath of fresh air. This is the type of book you will be telling all your friends about...like I am. If you haven't read this yet...Run, Don't walk, and get it. NOW !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, content weak.","review":"This book was well written but the content was nothing but trash. I read it because our son bought it for me for Christmas, because the title was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be the wrong audience. I thought it was really lame.","review":"I think if you are in High School and involved in the Drama department, you would love this book.I am a middle aged adult and thought it was really lame. The made up narrator is a very self centered melodramatic teen. His friends are the high school drama dorks. It is fiction. For the first half, I thought I was reading someone's actual account of the title. When the story got hard to believe, I learned that was because it was made up. I read it through to the end and I laughed out loud a couple times, but I struggled to get through. I didn't care what happened to the main character because his teen angst, self pity and self importance irritated me. The line \\"When they make a movie about my life....\\" appeared several times. I do not think he did anything in the book interesting enough to warrant a movie.The book is not terrible, just highly over rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems so real . . .","review":"I was a senior at university in 1983, which is the same year this book starts out. Like the main character, I was deeply conflicted about my sexuality and had suffered financial repercussions from my family when they learned that I seemed to swing both ways. This fiction resonates with believabilty, reality and clarity, and even mirrors some of my real experiences. This is a serious book embellished with wit and camp and enough cultural references to fell a deer. It was impossible for me to put down. Should be required,reading for gay men over the age of 40, because so many of us can relate to this rag-tag group of misfits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed this slice of life...","review":"Marc Acito has written a funny, bittersweet, but very true to life story of someone coming to terms with their life, sexuality, and future. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys a little escape or musical theatre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"if it were a movie it would take 37 viewings to catch all the laughs","review":"This is hands down one of the fastest, funniest book ever written.There were times when I laughed so hard, so often it made me dizzy!If you love offbeat/upbeat humor this is a natural for you.A coming of age book, featuring a brilliant albeit mismatched group of true blue friends. Including the families who damage them as only those who love you the most can. I would not recommend this for young readers, as it is quite bawdy and sometimes graphic. These characters are so vividly fleshed, you will be dreaming about them.Humor is definitely the cure for whatever ails us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Marc Acito's book How I paid for College starts off fine. However after reading half of it I simply get fed up. Marc's problem is that many characters \\"share the same voice\\"; many of the lines could have been said by almost anyone of the characters. My guess is that this is the author's own voice and that he lacks the skill to create individual plausable characters. This makes the book more boring than fun. The cover makes a reference to David Sedaris. I don't see the connection at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK EVER!","review":"This book is absolutely terrible. It is trying to be youth in revolt, and guess what. It isn't.They characters were unbelievable, the antics weren't funny and it is a good 6 hours of my life that I am never getting back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"The last few reviews sound rather similar, wouldn't you agree? And all written by folks who have never before written a review? Hmm. But anyway...I am currently reading this book, and it is quite enjoyable. I wish I could give it five stars, but wanted to stick it to whoever is behind this publicity charade.Funny, and well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pharmacology Resource for Nurses","review":"This is truly an excellent pharmacology resource for nurses. I believe this book surpasses the Nursing Drug Handbook published by Springhouse (which is also an excellent resource). What sets this guide apart from others is the comprehensiveness of the material. I found indications and side effects listed that I was unable to find in other drug guides, thus making this guide indispensible to nurses. I don't enter the clinical setting without hand-carrying this guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kya","review":"A very moving and tastefully filmed production. Glorious,rich color film. For some reason I only watch this movie when I am alone. To glean some understanding about what this film unfolds, the novel \\"Orlando\\", by Viginia Woolf, will not sufice. Read \\"Vita\\" by Victoria Glendinning (1983)to understand the film better. Of course, Vita Sakcville-West was enormously pleased with the novel \\"Orlando\\", but really didn\\"t understand it!! As a writer she was very popular, as compared to Viginia and her Bloomsbury set (at that time). \\"Orlando\\" is Virginia Woolf's ode to Vita (the child of aristocrats, who could not inherit her family's estate, since she was female, but who so adored the family homestead). Vita and Virginia were intimate friends, but Virgina's acute whimsy, or malice does poke fun at Orlando (the aristocracy). A light frolic from Virginia Woolf in love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The other reviewers must not be familiar with the actual book. It should have been renamed and properly titled as \\"based on Orlando by Virginia Woolf.\\" With each cliche liberty Potter took with the storyline my stomach churned a little more. The costumes are nice at least. My feeling is that this was an oportunity to create a masterpiece and they screwed the pooch. I would like to smack the director for Mrs. Woolf's honor if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Zen, very good.","review":"This movie is one of those that you must be in the proper mood for. The pace is slow, and there are often long pauses in the dialogue, filled by the haunting, wide eyes of Tilda Swinton. But if you are relaxed and open to this movie, it is a wonderful experience. It is beautifully photographed, and spiritually fulfilling. Loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Different, Dull and Spectacular","review":"ORLANDO is not the best movie I have seen, but it does have a small spice to it. Spectacular backgrounds, and sets lighten this semi-period piece up. This movie has some dull moments, and also goofy moments with Tilda Swinton looking at the camera, talking to the audience. The transformation from a man to a woman is un-discussed, making it alittle hard for the viewer to know why he or she did it. This movie was different, I will tell you that. Billy Zane's character (even though getting second most attention in advertising, and in the credits) is only on the screen for about ten minutes, has probably about 8 lines. I do not recomend this movie to be purchased, though if your a fan of such film noir -- DIG IN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imortal, fantastic story.","review":"Virginia Woolf is the greatest author of the 20th century for me.The perfect language, the capacity of her imagination and the power of her literature impressed me very much. Orlando is not from our world.She/he s from the fantastic planet which Virginia Woolf lived in.SHE/HE for just a person, what a fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book if you like, but film is a different medium.","review":"I find it continually annoying that people, and especially reviewers, make the cardinal error of comparing films with the books they are made from. Doing this is rather like comparing a poem about a tree to the tree itself. The tree is simply the inspiration. A poem is not meant to be a literal representation of its inspiration.Orlando The film is a separate entity from Orlando the book and should be viewed as such. In my humble opinion, if one sees this film with out bias or a prior notion of what it should be, one invariably sees it for the lovely jewel that it is; not without flaw but beautiful and engaging just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orlando","review":"The most aesthetically beautiful film, frame-to-frame, in memory. The color palette is scrumptuous, and the ultimate dessert of the senses. The story is co-relatively mind-taking, and a delight for all those who place no limits on human experience and imagined possibilities.Mattiene-Arienne Moustakas, DesignMattiene, Syracuse New York"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"I want back the two hours I spent watching this garabage... She did not even resemble a man nor did her acting. Billy Zane was also pretty wretched. Overall the movie was too light, never giving any of he characters depth. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orlando","review":"I was unable to watch the movie because the dvd didn't have the right region. I live in Norway. extremely irritating that the product I purchased and waited for to be shipped for over a month is worthless. Amazon should have sent me a dvd that I could have played in my region."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie, Bad Copy","review":"Orlando is a very good movie, visually stunning and well acted. The copy I received was plagued with dark spots, poor sound, and occasional freeze frames -- almost as if it was copied from a copyrighted original.The price was cheap (about $10.00 US); I gues you get what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"I saw this film (sadly) in a theater and only the fact that I was with friends kept me in the theater past the first 10 minutes. Pretentious crap. Lovely cinematography and a fair music score couldn't save pitiful performances, confused, pretentious (there's that word again) directing and silly script writing. Moronic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Orlando was a man and then an ageless woman who gave birth. It jumped about and was very confusing. I thought it quite rediculous and unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, entrancing movie - but inconsistent DVD version","review":"I was very happy to finally get a DVD copy of this movie! All the same story, historical flavor, scenes, music... and I still adore it.My problem is that the quality of the film is inconsistent through this version of the DVD: there are times when the quality is as bad or worse than my VHS tape! (and no, I don't mean the scene near the end where the little girl is using a video camera)Fortunately there are other times when the picture is very clear and lacking any apparent marks or detritus on the film stock itself.I think anyone interested in a new look at life and our relationship to where (and when) we are would be interested in this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book ever wirtten!!!","review":"Lael Littke is one of the greatest authors. I have read other books that are really good, but I really think that this book has beaten all of the other books I have read. This book is one of those books that you can't put down, its that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book!!!.. I remember my friend gave it to me in 6th grade and i still read it .. i am currently going into 9th grade. I was never bored while reading this book. And the whole situation with Janine's twin sister Lenore kept me intrigued till the very end and how the two of them share one body until that day Janine figures it out....... This story is a must read. I'd buy it if i were you!! Fabulous, just fabulous"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haunted Sister The Best Book","review":"The book \\"The Haunted Sister\\" was a great book. It had suspence and action at the same time. It was a book that I couldn't put down. When I first started to read it I thought it was going to be boring, but as I read more it got so interesting. You think one think in the beggining and at the end you will be amazed what happens. You would never guess what happens in it. It was mesmorizing and a geat book. This is a book you will never put down when you start it.The book is wirten so well you can put your self in the main characters point of veiw.

It's not gender specific either, so definitely could be worn by men or women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Somehow this product is not well known here as I think is not marketed well by the german manufacturer.I first bought this great product in Singapore when I was on a holiday as I ran out of my Gilette deodrant.I was astonished to see the quality and genteless and longivity as it stays 24h as stated.I wish these are available like in WalMart, K-Mart etc., someday as they are available only thru some online retailers like Amazon.com, Drugstore.com and a few others.Buy it if you see this product an you wil not be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice scent","review":"I liked the Fa bath gel, so when I saw that they had deodorant, I thought it was worth trying. My current brand works well, but I get a little tired of the scent. I had no idea how Caribbean Lemon compared with the Fa bath gel I was remembering, but it seemed like the closest one. As it turned out, I think it may be the same scent, and regardless, the deodorant has a fresh, refreshing scent, kind of lemony with a hint of pine. It has the usual antiperspirant ingredient (aluminum chlorohydrate), which makes it an effective deodorant and antiperspirant (which also helps if you are stung by a bee - just rub it on liberally)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Did not care for it. Very old fashioned and took too long to get into story. Very slow moving and by the time you want to find interest you forget what the story line is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"\\"I Stink\\" is a great, fun way for kindergarteners or pre-k kids to learn their letters.
