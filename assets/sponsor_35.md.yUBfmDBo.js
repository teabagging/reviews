I started him in electricity/electronics with some basic stuff, how it works, what is AC vs. DC, etc. Did a couple projects, made a lemon battery type thing. Then I started wanting to get a little more advanced and found this. We did ONE 'class' and then he spent the next 10 days building circuits out of the books on his own.

Thirty + years later, the modern incarnation of that product by Radioshack only left myself and my 10 year old frustrated, confused, and with non functional projects. Along came snap circuits, which changed it all for us. The lessons and projects are laid out very well, explain the purpose and concept in simple English for each project. My son completed 6 projects in 45 minutes, but more importantly, he was able to tell me why they worked, how they worked, and what he learned beyond snapping the pieces together. All components seem to be very heavy duty, and very well made, and appears to be made to offer many years of service. My only regrets are that I did not buy the blow molded case version, but the extra $40 for it seemed a bit steep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for a 9 year old girl - and she loves it!","review":"So many fun options for creative play.

It comes complete with several manuals to work along with. If you have a Lego lover; this is perfect - the pieces snap together easily and have clear, easy to follow directions. It is simple enough for DS to follow the directions on his own but it is more fun to work with a buddy or Daddy. One thing I would recommend is that you purchase a few AA batteries.

It was THE HIT of the Christmas presents. He has built and rebuilt. It does suck batteries so I recommend the AC adapter solder separately. Worth it. The product is very durable for snapping and unsnapping. My biggest gripe is the horribly cheap box it comes in. It is so flimsy and doesn't hold the pieces in their compartments well. We've gotten around it by leaving it open and using the cover to double as a second box to give it some strength. Looking into the optional carry case if it continues to be a favorite.

She initially found it frustrating because she didn't really understand the drawings and she is too impulsive to sit down and read the project description or instructions before diving in. But once we walked her through a couple of projects and she understood how to identify the parts and how to read the drawings, she was building stuff, taking it apart, and building another project, happily, all day long. She loves it! My main concern is that most of the parts are made mostly of plastic.

He often says, \\"We're not uh, uh, uh, going to cover this because, uh, uh, we did in our, uh, previous episode.\\" The other problem is that it is a very odd form of Salsa. He doesn't use the the standard 1-2-3, 5-6-7. He also will do something rediculous like bending over and turning in circles.

I bought the Bostich Premium 3/8 staples to go with it. You can staple as few pages as you like although the staple is a heavier gauge so stapling anything less than 10 pages makes the staple disproportionally thick compared to the paper. With the 3/8 staples the most pages you can do is about 55. I am sure if you had longer staples it would easily do more pages than that. The leverage of the handle makes this easy to use. I have a very petite woman who works in my office, under 100 lbs, and she has no problem stapling 50 pages.With the solid metal construction, I would imagine we will be using this stapler for many years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"NG","review":"Either the stapler is terrible or the bostich staples need to be redesigned to go through 1/2 inch of papper without crushing the staples."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS BOOK","review":"Most serious historians/epigraphers/archaeologists would NOT reccommend this book to ANYone, much less to an impressionable undergraduate.

The pills are almost impossible to separate without breaking them. I am disappointed in the product.

The book has lots of white space, and some obvious things aren't there (like a floor plan or before and after photos) that would have really brought some life to the text. The narrative is somewhat choppy, with brief mentions of some aspects of the project but no real explanation. I've had several smaller-scale remodeling projects done in my home and found most of the \\"tips\\" listed pretty obvious.

I did find that if I use Swingline brand staples that it doesn't jam and blank staple nearly as often, but the one I had before which was the exact same model worked fine with any kind of staple.

Great sound quality, answering machine a plus (haven't used yet) didn't mind caller ID voice - actually wait to hear it if not near phone. Also like that phones stand upright so you can see who is calling and easily pick up (no more leaning over the phone to read Caller ID).

The only thing they don't do is let you rename the handsets (instead of 1, 2, 3, etc. my Siemens are Upstairs, Downstairs, Kitchen, Bedroom) making it great for the intercom function.Also the Siemens use regular rechargeable AA batteries, the Panasonic requires a special battery pack.Both systems have no antenna sticking up at all, which makes them more durable when they get dropped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra cordless handset for Panasonic system","review":"Product sets up easily, integrates perfectly into existing Panasonic system.

In the first-third books we see Harry growing up and finding his voice. He was always strong but now we start to see how strong he actually it. This strength is tested in book 4 with the death of a classmate, and even more so in book 5 with the death of someone close to him. We start to see Harry take an interest in girls, mature in his magic and we actually start to see that the trio's friendship isn't infallible. Granted, their friendship is strong but now we get to experience Ron and Hermione's differing points of view from Harry's. Now they are no longer an individual group, but a group of individuals.

Evil villian the hero miracoulsy overcomes against all odds? Check and check.And let's say someone writes about a main character who isn't good hearted, like pieces by Eion Colfer, Jonathon Stoud, Garth Nix or someone like that? Apperently it's not suitably for children.So stop saying everyone's cashing in on J.K.

Half the story serves no purpose whatsoever; it is merely the author's own sick indulgence. I actually hoped that the entire plot would turn out to have some meaning or provide an explanation for these apparently unnecessary scenes. The other shortcomings of this book are trivial in comparison. Among the most distracting features of the book is the extremely juvenile dialogue. It is understandable that the author would attempt to contrast the children's emotionally immaturity with their advanced intellect, but instead the children come across as intellectually dumb and dumber emotionally. Try something original like Robert Stanek's The Kingdoms and the Elves or In the Service of Dragons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love Harry Potter but I lost all my books.

The book itself is very polished and professional, and the only disagreement I might make with its contents is that the author chooses to go with an interpretation that the Anglo-Saxons believed in 9 worlds rather than 7, despite plain literary evidence to the contrary, without really spelling out a cogent case for why he makes this assumption. (Although in fairness he does *acknowledge* the problem, so it's certainly not a deal-killer for me.)

Like similar products, it was very easy to set up. Within a few months I noticed that one speaker or another would occasionally fail when starting a record side. I used to be able to fix this by jiggling the L and R connectors on the back. It wasn't a big deal, I could live with it. More recently, in order to get it to work again, I've had to disconnect the power supply and reconnect it. It seems to solve the problem, but I can't really say I'm satisfied with this product. Now it happens every time I start an album side, which equals a lot of unplugging and re-plugging. I got what I paid for, a few months of use. Time to upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Hooks directly up between my record player and my new receiver that couldn't recognize the analog input.Plugged ande played.

There are silly expensive phono pres out there, so I figured I'd start here since this is generally positively reviewed, and at $22, it's more or less disposable.It doesn't introduce hum to my system, which is nice. The sound is entirely pleasant, could even be called lively. There's a reasonable amount of gain and the bottom end is nice and full. What I'd like is a more defined soundstage and maybe some top-end detail, but I'd be a fool to expect it at this price point. Speaking objectively, ignoring the price, this preamp is just fine but nothing exceptional. At its price, it's probably a screaming bargain, but that doesn't stop me from wanting a bit more.For el cheapo HiFi types like me, it might be smarter to start with the ART DJ phono pre, which is about twice as expensive but may be legitimately very good based on reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the price","review":"The phono stage went down on my Dynaco preamp the other day.

And it's only heard without the vinyl playing. Who listens to music at Max volume? LOL!! If you did you would only hear the hum between tracks, that is, if you knew what you were listening for.

In the very beginning of the book, the reader is shown Helikaon caring side. Only to see the side of a cruel cold hearted man.

Perhaps that was a good thing. While reading I could feel elements of his proficiency in fantasy but it remained a strong work of historical fiction.That said, it lured me in slowly. I was not immediately taken with the tale or its characters. But as I perservered I became entranced with the story and eventually found it very difficult to put down.It is a solid reimagining of the events surrounding and particularly leading up to the famous battle for Troy and focusses largely on one major character Helikaon/Aneas of Dardania - and what a character he is.For anyone interested in a good historical fiction read, the bronze age or Ancient Greek History and the Trojan saga in particular this is a worthy addition to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous--far and away his best book/series","review":"Well-written, brutal, with larger-than-life characters and non-stop action--what more could you want?

There is a surprise about halfway through the book, after which events speed up considerably and the book becomes an utterly riveting page-turner. It took me several weeks to read the first novel in this trilogy, but I sped through LOTS in about eight hours. Although a summary is provided for the first novel in Dart-Thornton's trilogy, The Ill-Made Mute, it is probably preferable that interested parties read that book first.As in The Ill-Made Mute, Dart-Thornton gives her archaic thesaurus full reign, creating unusually rich descriptions of the characters' surroundings with unusually obscure words. This might be a problem for some readers. I kept a pen and notepad with the book to note down unfamiliar words, but not everyone wants to be tutored during a compelling read, and might find the novel's broad vocabulary distracting.I am writing this review in support of a book I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can wait for the 3rd book","review":"I read this series when it first came out and wish I had stopped at book 1. The writing style is agonizing to read. The story and concept is excellent but the writing style drags on and on. I've never read a romance novel but I expect it would sound like many parts of this book. I read the whole series and unfortunately each one gets to be more and more like a romance novel. Reading this series was somewhat tolerable as you can just skip over pages and pages of the descriptive text and not miss a thing. It's really ashame because there was so much potential here and I really wanted to like this series.

It feels like it's going to fall apart when I get on it -- and mind you, I'm a 101lb female! You can TELL it's the cheap version as you use it, which isn't pleasant. Not to mention, there isn't any elliptical action -- it's a straight forward and back sliding motion, so it's a very uncomfortably stiff walking sensation and therefore I don't feel like I'm burning that much or sweating at all or doing any real workout, even after 30 minutes.

I've seen a lot of complaints about how using satelite radios in this manner gives poor results. I'll admit, there is a drop-off in quality, but it's usually un-noticable unless I get too close to a radio station broadcasting on or close to where I have my XM radio set to. Using it as a portable gives mixed results. If you expect to jog or carry it and listen to live XM broadcasts, you may be disappointed. Since it has the ability to record 5 hours of programming, I usually switch to that mode when I'm carrying it outside or when I take it to the gym.

This gate is almost made of ALL PLASTIC, inside and out. The plastic pieces that keep the spring loaded thing wound-up inside malfunctioned. We had to take the whole thing apart, it took us over an hour to fix it. If the gate was made out of a harder, stronger plastic, and had METAL pieces inside to keep it working well, it would be an awesome gate. It is good idea, and it is nice to have it out of the way when it is rolled up.

We had this gate properly installed at the top of our stairs by our contractor. We've been using the gate for a few months (since he started crawling) and had the same problems others mentioned (i.e., the button is not easy to maneuver and it is definitely not a one-handed operation). In addition, the gate would occasionally retract unevenly (the top would be out of line with the bottom) and the mesh looks like it is stretched out at the top. Don't rely on this product for your child's safety at the top of the stairs (I've reported the incident to the CPSC)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique...

Expect some customization if the mounting sufaces aren't flat and uniform.Unfortunately, the device no longer automatically retracts after less than 1 year. Attempts to contact the manufacturer so far have been ignored. This device failed when it wasn't even in use. Don't expect high reliability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent gate for top of steps","review":"We have an older raised ranch style house with wrought iron railings on the stairs. The opening for the stairs is also much wider than most so this was one of the few gates that would fit. This gate is also in a high traffic area so we're constantly opening and closing it. We've had it for more than a year and have been very pleased with it.It took us a few tries to get used to opening and closing it but now we're pros. You can open it silently which is good once the baby is in bed.I would recommend this for anyone because the gate doesn't swing out, requies only one hand, is wider than many and completely retracts when it is not needed. It also works good with a variety of stair railing configurations (we bought the spindle/wrought iron adapter kit)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this gate!","review":"I bought two of these.

I purchased with a couple Badger propellant cans, and the adapter that came with the set didn't fit the cans. So after purchasing a Badger adapter to fit the cans, I discovered the hose is garbage. It's cheap rubber and the end caps pop off once the air starts flowing, leaving you with a broken hose. I replaced the hose with a Badger brand one (now effectively spending more money on replacement parts than the kit itself) and air still leaks out of the gun.

If you need to define smaller lines (down to about 1/4 inch) you can set the nozzle to be smaller and just get the brush closer to the material. It is not hard to hold or direct, and is not difficult to clean with airbrush cleaner liquid and a simple pipe cleaner.

Students have to learn unit circle values beginning in 4.2, but the tricks for memorizing these values are withheld until 4.4.

The battleship admirals would say that it was sunk by battleship gunfire. The Bismark was steaming in circles due to damage from aircraft launched torpedos. The lesson to be learned is that aircraft carriers seem to be the naval vessil that can inflict the most damage. Large battleships are vulnerable to attack from the air by aircraft and guided missiles. If there was a hero, it was the observer in the Catalina PBY that tracked the Bismark down and the pilot that hit the Bismark's rudder. The movie does not illustrate this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, though a bit of a stereotype.","review":"The movie accurately depicts Operation \\"Exercise Rhine\\", and the British reaction to it. Exciting, and very entertaining, though sterotyping the German Fleet Commander (Gunter Lutjens) as a fanatical nazi was very inaccurate, and to me, the most dissapointing aspect of an otherwise accurate account. Admiral Lutjens was a person who did not care for the Nazis or Adolf Hitler, but loved Germany and the Kriegsmarine. On the other hand, the depiction of the Bismarck's Captain (Ernst Lindemann) as a conscientous, dedicated career officer was very accurate.The models were well done and the combat scenes were also well portrayed. Well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"passes the five year old boy test with flying colors","review":"I defer to my learned fellow reviewers for details and observations on this film. My little boy enjoyed watching this over and over, and he even recreated the naval battle with toys. By contrast, one viewing of Midway (1976) was enough for him. Sink the Bismarck has enough action, and enough suspenseful dialog in between, to hold attention. The acting is understated but believable, and the naval warfare effects are good enough. I did have to explain the difference between 'movie Germans' and the real ones--the German Navy was hardly a Nazi organization, but that context didn't take away my little one's wonder and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable","review":"Sink the Bismark was made shortly after the actual events took place. Considering the financial shortages the British film industry confronted in those days, Sink the Bismark constitutes a remarcable accomplishment. The actual account of how the great ship was sunk is both exiting and well portrayed using real war footage, and the sript is both well written and plausible, considering the times when the fim was shot. played by actors who are both well known and talented. A must see for World War film II buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the best side of British Character","review":"In addition to the historical aspect, I have always enjoyed the study of the British character in its best aspects in this film, the 'stiff upper lip'. Particularly at the moment the HQ staff learns that HMS Hood is destroyed, without question with essentially all hands, one sees the great personal restraint that is so admired in the British. Also, the lower classes (enlisted) are always very respectful of the upper classes (officers) and vice versa.To see the worst aspects of the British character well portrayed in a movie, I suggest Muntiny on the Bounty with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sea Battle","review":"This is one of the best WWII movies out there. The British command center stages the chase dramatically and the action at sea on the ships is engrossing. This does a great job of following the crews of the allied and the German ships involved in the sinking of the Bismarck. The cast, sets, and music are all first class. With the recent release of the James Cameron documentary on the discovery of the Bismarck we may see a remake by him of this movie sometime in the near future. I have a VHS copy of this original movie and I have pre-ordered the DVD that is coming out 5/20/03."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hunt for the Bismarck, what a week it was!","review":"A stirring, action-packed war movie. Recent releases like 'The Triumph and the Glory' (the novel) and 'Memphis Belle' (not that recent, I guess, but you get my drift) display much of the traditional war story-telling style of this classic. If you like old-fashioned war dramas this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly true story","review":"Exaggerated account of the battle for morale. The Bismark was not the mightiest battleship of WWII - Japan's Musashi and Yamato were. And the Hood was not the mightiest warship in the British navy - it was a lightly armored \\"fast battleship\\" or otherwise called a \\"battle cruiser.\\" This type of ship was always blowing up, even in the first world war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done depiction of classic WWII Naval battle","review":"This film depicts the classic WWII battle between the Nazi's premiere vessel, the Bismarck, and the British Navy. Although Naval military history movies are not usually my favorites, I did enjoy this one. It has a lot to offer viewers.The plot is pretty straight forward. The Germans have launched the Bismarck out into the open seas to wreak havoc on the Allies. The command comes down to sink it, at all costs. Luckily, the Bristish navy was up to the task.The director uses real life footage during numerous scenes which adds a nice element of realism. The story also does a nice job of demonstrating the dedication required of the leaders who faced this difficult task. It is well balanced with the human element of loss and sacrifice.If you like vintage WWII films, then you will enjoy this film. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best naval movie ever!","review":"By far the best naval battle movie ever produced. When I was in grade school I wrote a book report on the Bismark and have been interested in it ever since. The movie is not on television that much and all I can remember is seeing it once. I have been looking for it for over seven years now. I had found it on E-Bay but used copies were selling for over thirty dollars. I then found Amazon.com and was surprised to find a new tape for a lot less money. The time of shipping was excellent and I am very pleased with the movie.

This is a great match for Andre fans as well. Piper is also seen teaming with frequent partner Cowboy Bob Orton against Jimmy Snuka and the Tonga Kid.Perhaps one of the real highlights is Piper declaring himself as the person most capable of interviewing himself. What follows is a split screen of Piper interviewing Piper. It is classic Roddy Piper.This tape is vintage Roddy Piper. It is when Roddy was at his rowdiest.

Nothing new here, same old footage, same old boring narration, but still worth seeing. Seeing how it was in that summer of 1947, does my soul good. Back when the only real democracy existed in a Brooklyn ball park, Ebbets Field, a micro-cosm of Democracy. Immigrants in the seats, Italians, Jews, Irish, Blacks and Hispanic, trying to assimilate to America, and those same ethic groups on the field as a team playing for their fans and for each other. No two players illustrate this better than Pee Wee and Jackie. This stuff is the poetry of the game, the \\"life\\" metaphor played out before our eyes. I'm not one to get too corny, but their story is almost like a morality tale, I get a little \\"misty\\" watching it, and it DOES make me feel proud to be a kid from Brooklyn, proud to be a baseball fan and proud to be an American. --- Lou Russo"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIKE TO GET TO KNOW SPANKY & OUR GANG","review":"One Christmas Day a couple of years back I was listening to local radio when the LIKE TO GET TO KNOW YOU single came on - first time I had heard it on radio for years.

The only solo instrument here is the harp since Little Buddy Thomas keeps it simple and holds a solid backing either with chords or bass lines.Really a great album for anybody who wishes to re-live the Maxwell St. days or who just wants know what they sounded like. The first time through it seems simple and rudimentary but it gets better with every re-play. The thing to pick up on here is Big John Wrencher's great harmonica phrasing, rather than the general simplicity of his playing.

In this regard and this regard only network tv is much better.Not only have they decided to call episodes that air after a 10 month hiatus the same season, but they've also decided to sell the season in 2 parts. In what universe does this make sense? First off HBO is notorious for ripping off customers with insanely high dvd set prices, now they've decided to split one season into 2 ridiculous prices. Entourage is easily my favorite television program. I think Ari Gold and Johnny Drama are the freshist and funniest characters on tv in more than a decade. It's just a shame that HBO has such a lack of respect for fans of their programs.

Each season is incredible, espically this one. Its a comedy/drama show on the life of the entotourage of a famous actor. Each actor and actress in the show do a great job, but the best is the hilarious agent Jeremy Piven aka Ari. This show may be hillarious but it also informs you on the fun and the hardships of the life of an actor and his entourage.

These break easily (we ordered two sets, a medium and a maxi -- one had a glass broken out-of-the-box, and the other had one broken less than a week after we opened them). Tempered glass also breaks into small, safe pieces, and shatters as a whole. These break into large pieces (I can't tell if they're any less dull, but one of my housemates claims they are), and they do not shatter as a whole (the entire base was left on the one we broke)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Optimal size and shape","review":"Just right size and shape.

Most importantly: if you are buying this card to listen to your music files in simulated 7.1/5.1 by connecting it via the optical (S/PDIF) out to your receiver - STOP!

I feel freedom and relief by understanding where to focus my energy. There is a different environment in our home;one of more joy, peace and a sense of excitement. It is amazing and wonderful to see my kids responding to our new environment with such promise!

My best guess is that it has a high level of salt or something that made my dog incredibly thirsty and caused him to drink huge quantities of water. We gave it to him for about 5 days - the second day, he had an accident in the house. Thought it was a fluke, but that night, he woke us up whining to go outside where his water is - drank the whole bowl, and then peed for what seemed like 2 minutes. Then I found another puddle by the family room door. He'd gone during the night, then again around 5:00 and then went again when we let him out for breakfast around 7:00. This happened three nights in a row before we switched him back to his old food. 3 days back on the old food and no more restlessness during the night and no more accidents. This isn't a fluke - it was the food that caused this. Just be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movie","review":"During almost all the scenes, the two women get caught.

However, Dole apparently joined 10th Mountain in Feb. 1945 and didn't undergo the training in the Colorado Rockies that most of this film is focused on (http://www.life.com/Life/lifebooks/military/intro.html). That might be why the movie didn't interview him -- only talking with either the filmmakers or Dole himself will settle the question.Anyhow, about the movie -- it's good enough, I suppose. The use of a harmonica during some of the narration is hokey, but tolerable. I wish there was more discussion of how all that training specifically came in handy; I wish there were more war stories here period. Otherwise the film just comes across as a bunch of guys having fun until late in the war, while other soldiers are fighting and dying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bal tog flamenco skirt","review":"I bought this skirt for flamenco dancing and sent it back.

I must say that I enjoyed many of the interviews in the book and the colourful characters that emerge, but found this volume to be quite disappointing in the balance. It was rushed in its display of the modern ideas, even given that it was written in 1995, and seemed to give too much credence to current understanding as a sure thing rather than the hazy and incomplete picture it actually is. The book was fine in covering the origin theories but stumbled when considering the cosmological future, the writing about which should have been omitted. The sequence and flow of the interviews also seemed rather poorly organised. I did enjoy some of the questions posed about the formation of galaxies and the so-called Great Wall, however-- quite intriguing indeed.

Yet this book cannot be categorized as history revisionism since most of what has been written is true yet one sided."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap way to make movies.","review":"This movie is a mixture of two different films and neither of them is any good. Klimovsky edited his 1970\`s film El Hombre que Vino del Odio and merged it with a new film directed by Al Adamson which is filled with violence and nudity but not enough length to rate it as a feature film. So both directors try to seel us these separate stories as a brand new one but the lack of continuity makes evident this is not an original release. Mean Mother\`s only attraction is the presence of Luciana Paluzzi who saves this boring picture in the few scenes she appears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two parts don't make a whole.","review":"\\"Mean Mother\\" is actually two films in one. Infamously awful director Al Adamson once again took a foreign film and then shot some new footage to combine with it.The old movie was an Italian film with a cast made up entirely of white people. Adamson decided to somehow make it into a blaxploitation/Vietnam Veteran film. One of the stars, \\"Clifton Brown\\", was in reality a somewhat popular recording artist at the time named Dobie Gray.Anyway, the film is an unmitigated disaster. As you can imagine, the tone of the film is wildly uneven and the acting \\"talent\\" is undeniably bad. Why this was released on DVD is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG so bad","review":"I read the reviews, I saw the warnings, even the plot summary was a pretty good indicator that this movie would be nothing but bad but I still watched it. My biggest problem with watching a bad movie, is watching a bad movie that could have been good but the writing and/or casting ruined it. This is one of them. I only watched this movie cause Kiefer Sutherland is in it but he is just a terrible fit for the character. I think he was to young to grasp a character like that, or maybe he missed the mark on purpose... Either way this movie missed the mark. There are so many things that didn't make sence or choices that could have been changed that would have made the movie worth watching.I do not recomend this movie unless you are a Kiefer completist, and even then i'd say don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Excellent crime movie, great plot twists and kiefer knows how to play a psycho really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Collection","review":"This is a very good collection, especially for only a few dollars.

Never have I seen such a \\"we are great\\" hammer to the head attitude in a documentary before. The political bias is OVERPOWERING as well. This dvd actually did the opposite of what I'm sure the creators had in mind. This overview of DC comics history leaves me cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth A Look","review":"I checked this out from my local public library the other night and was pleasantly suprised at how candid and un-infomercialish (well, until the last 10 minutes or so) it was, particularly considering it was generated by the Time Warner monolith. The format is about what you'd expect - interviews with various comic book giants (Neil Gaiman, Mark Waid, Neal Adams, Denny O'Neil, etc.), archival footage/photos of same, clips from various films and TV shows featuring DC characters, photos of comics covers and art, and so forth. Not much to write home to Mom about, but if this life-long comic book geek and trivia nut learned a thing or two from it, you almost certainly will, too. Worth a look if you can watch it on the cheap (or, better yet, for free), although I certainly wouldn't pay full retail for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"May Smudge a Few Details, But it Gets the Big Picture Right","review":"As a self-serving look at the history of just one of the two major publishers in the comic industry, it shouldn't come as much surprise to hear that a few small liberties are taken with this short history lesson. The broader picture rings true, though, and the producers of this documentary clearly took great pains to ask the right questions of the right people. Long-term fans will be pleased to see appropriate representatives from every significant moment in the company's history in living color, though some of the more embattled personalities such as Alan Moore and Frank Miller only appear via ancient promotional videos. Fresh geeks who don't already know the story will see their horizons broadened by some of the pains and issues DC has confronted and endured over the years, while more seasoned readers will enjoy the refresher course and possibly even learn a thing or two themselves. Worth watching once, at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"Had a chance to see this screened at NY Comic Con. About 90 Minutes long and just really fantastic for any DC fan.

My chief memory is working late at night on skid row in downtown LA wondering if the security guard would really come to our aid if something happened (and also wondering about what, exactly, the producer of this film was using to keep him so hyped up late into the night).I saw if recently on television and was amazed that it was worse than I thought it would be. So, break out some popcorn and invite the friends over for this none to subtle reworking of Starman meets Hercules (well, the guy kinda looks like he should be in one of those bad Italian movies from the 50's and early 60's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The video lies when it says \\"Fishburne\\" is in this film","review":"Neither Lawrence Fishburne, nor any other Fishburne is actually in this film. The lead black actor is named Reggie De Morton. The film was originally released in the late 1980s as \\"Alien Warrior\\" with the correct actors listed on the video jacket, but then when it was re-released in the mid 1990s the distributors put a picture of Reggie De Morton on the cover along with catch phrases which hinted that Lawrence Fishburne was a part of the film. It seems they figured that all black people looked alike, and apparently Amazon.Com has fallen for the con so much so that they now spread this false advertisement as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 100 comedy spoofs","review":"Side splittingly funny in its deadly earnestness, it is Plan 9 from Outer Space meets Brother from Another Planet.

I can hear Appice and Bain's influence over this material on songs like Long Way Back From Hell and One Good Reason. I think that some of the songs here are a little bit like Dio even though West sounds nothing like RJD. West's performance here is very good as is the guitar work by Young and Cavazo. This release has gotten little to no publicity and that's a pitty because it is well worth the money considering how little new music is out there in the hard rock world that is worth buying. On a side note, the artwork is terrible but I guess it's about as good as the names Frozen Summer and 3 Legged Dogg (lol)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really touching movie","review":"This was a really touching \\"first\\" love story.

However, that does not take away from the story (which is enjoyable) or the lead actors (who are attractive and do an excellent job in their roles).

Living in SF the idea of an Asian family dynamic appealed to me. The mother was the best thing in the movie, no wait, the grandmother didn't say much and was possible the actor in the movie- just out of default.

Under One Roof has none of the qualities that makes a movie, not only a hit, but at least interesting enough to watch all the way through. I had to force myself awake through endless minutes of idiocy where I just thought- what is the big deal. It seems to me that the movie focused on how the love between two mean was so hidden for the danger it would impose on the two of them. Honostly, how long does it take for two gay men who attracted to each other and to realize the attraction. Apparantly it takes the never ending length of the movie. Perhaps it should be titled \\"The Tale Under One Roof That Never Ends\\". My recommendation is to save your money and buy something else. If you are looking for a type of move that identifies impossible attractions then I recommend The Trip, or Maurice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a nightmare!!!","review":"This must be one of teh worst movies I have ever seen!

The acting is horrible, the lighting is horrible...well, it is a low budget offering. But this is about as low as one can get.The movie does have some redeeming qualities: the casting of the two leads is o.k. Not great, but o.k. The casting of the best friend of the Chinese Boy (I think the character's name was Tony) was horrendous. Where did they find this guy? I can't believe anyone would touch him with a ten foot pole. He gave me the creeps...yet he had so many affairs in this film...something that was totally unbelievable to me. I give this film two stars instead of one because of the believability of the two main leads. But the script, the supporting cast and all the production values are simply terrible. This movie was a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another movie...quickly...don't even think about this","review":"The story line was bad. The acting was worse.

I really wonder if those actors and actresses were found on the street to make this movie !?! The story wasn't that good either and every other scene is kind of awkwardly put together. If you like to see a movie with bad acting and a bad story but to see a few scenes of full nudity(even an elect penis in one scene,they could have had real sex scenes if they wanted to show this much nudity),this one is for you but don't expect anything more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different from what I expected","review":"I brought this CD after listening to David Hobson's \\"French and Italian Arias\\". This album has a very unique sound, it can't be defined as pop or classical. It was a bit strange at first but it definitely grows on you. There are haunting melodies in \\"One Passing Moment\\" and a simple but beautiful piece \\"Inside This Room\\".

It showcases a different David Hobson, not the operatic one. But, if you listen and listen again, you will hear a voice that can do many things in addition to singing opera. It grows on you the more you listen and sometimes the voice is otherworldly. While I look forward to David's new opera aria album (PLU321178), I will contrast this album with his earlier La Boheme and the new one to absorb the full rich range of capabilities. I would love to hear him sing a duet with la Diva Brightman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectations clash with reality","review":"I loved David Hobson in Baz Luhrman's \\"La Boheme\\" and so looked forward to other offerings from him. Knowning that his background included musical theater, I hoped that this album would include some of that genre. Opera or musical theater - I would be happy with either one. Instead we get something that is neither. The CD is controlled by the composer - it's not meant to showcase Mr. Hobson, and it doesn't. His voice is deliberately kept pure (largely sans vibrato), which, in the absence of any real tune, translates to a boring vocal line. The orchestrations are lovely, and the choir is wonderful. It's in an ethnic style, sounding vaguely African (Indonesian?) to someone who knows little of either style.If I were familiar with the composer's style I could appreciate it more. As it is, the CD is not what I wanted it to be - a showcase for the singer.

Webb -- formerly an illustrator/graphic artist -- has designed chapters on motivation, materials, setup, color and values, techniques, composition, design, all illustrated by examples painted by other top painters as well as himself. This is accompanied by pithy, appropriate one-liners quoted from philosophers, artists -- whoever his incredible memory finds the most apt. He encourages painters to experiment, take risks -- after learning the necessary first. As a watercolor instructor, and author of a book on outdoor landscape painting in watercolor, I recommend Frank Webb's two books, Nita Leland's book on color, and David Lewis' \\"Watercolour Painting Techniques.\\" That's all you need for starters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable - Black and Decker machine chews up whole spool in minutes","review":"Bought a large spool thinking it would last a long time in a Black and Decker GH1000 machine.

I replaced the string with some other brand and it worked well. Seems to be this particular string and not the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"The instructions told me to run through a container of water to clean the system before first use. It stopped percolating leaving much of the water in the basket. I could smell burning rubber and figure something was not right. Also as of then I could not close the filter basket thing. Great. I'm going to give this back and get something else. I expected more from Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"On the second day the little spokes that hold on the lid broke. We decided we could live with that. Then things got worse. There was no way to ever pour coffee or water from the carafe without spilling. We poured over the sink. But what sent me to Macy's yesterday to get a new coffee maker was the on-off switch. We frequently found it on when we hadn't intended. It was too easily bumped when working in the kitchen. The machine started the other evening 45 minutes after my husband had filled the tank with water, but while the carafe was still in the dishwasher. By the time we heard the last gurgles from the other room there was hot water all over the kitchen counter. The on-off switch had been sitting in a half-way possition. I must admit that the coffee was good. We thought we were being very frugal getting a good deal, but not in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"The #1 Rated Consumer Reports Braun KF400's flimsy plastic parts can not hold up under 2 washes on an ordinary cycle in a dishwasher (and no mention by Braun that the product is NOT dishwasher safe). The dispenser became malformed after the first wash under minimal heat, and the clip-on part of the pitcher's top broke off. The second washing destroyed the dispenser altogether as a vital plastic piece completely broke off, disabling the machine from working altogether! I threw the the machine out after only using it a dozen times and lost my money. If you purchase this coffeemaker be prepared to have permanent coffee stains, residue and odors on the product, for it is impossible to completely clean this effectively outside of the dishwasher. Total Crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"design flaws","review":"While it makes OK coffee, there are two major problems with this coffeemaker. First, the pot doesn't pour properly. As far as we can figure out, there's no way to pour coffee from it without at least some of it spilling and missing your mug. Second, if the pot isn't placed exactly right in the coffeemaker for brewing, the coffee doesn't flow down into the pot. We've always noticed it before disaster struck, but I imagine if you walked away without noticing you'd have a pretty big mess when the coffee overflowed the cone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best coffeemaker I've ever owned!","review":"I have paid alot more for coffeemakers that have not been nearly as good as this one.

I would buy this again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"a best buy","review":"I just replaced my last Braun Aromaster Coffeemaker after 16 years.

Enjoy a great pot of coffee for half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, but I miss the auto shut off","review":"Bought this based on the Consumer Reports review. It makes fine coffee very efficiently (quickly and using a minimum of grounds). I sort of expected it to have an automatic shut off, though, which is probably unreasonable for a $20 unit. Next time I'd probably spend a bit more for that feature, particularly since I've already left this one on once while at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Filter Basket Broke","review":"I used this product only once, and now I can't close the filter basket anymore. Well, I can, but I have to stick my finger under the basket to flip up the mechanism that holds it in place. The system is just cheap plastic, which is why all the little parts at the bottom of the basket don't work like they should.I'm returning this product today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid Coffee","review":"I bought the Braun based on past reviews, but I didn't remember anybody commenting on the tepid coffee or the coffee filter holder that kept swinging out whenever you removed the coffee pot from the warmer. I eventually bought a Mr. Coffee that serves hot coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold coffee anyone?","review":"You get what you pay for. I would never recommend this to any serious coffee drinker. I received this as a gift-- not a good coffee machine at all! The water temp was very low (optimal brewing temp should be 190-200F) resulting in a lukewarm cup of coffee. It also took forever for the burner to reach a decent holding temperature. The brewer did not have good water dispersment. Another negative is that it took a very long time to brew a pot. I ended up giving this coffee machine away. The only thing good about this machine was the optional mesh filter...which I have to admit was very cool and worked great. If your're a serious coffee drinker, please spend the money on a Bunn (I have the A-10 model...works great!). Don't cheap out on a plastic Krups/Braun/Mr.Coffee-- they are just not powerful enough to make a decent brew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes great coffee","review":"Yes, it seems a bit cheaply made, but it makes great coffee!

I can't stress the superb coffee it makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Aromaster","review":"This is a simple, small, good-looking coffee maker.

One more quirk is that if the flexible rubber tube ever becomes detached from the water diverter at the top...you will have hot water all over your counter. It took me awhile to figure out how to fix it. Stretch the tube as high as you can...tilt the top cover...reattach the tube to the connector...then angle the corner peice down back on the top. Some engineer found the absolute cheapest way to construct a really good coffee maker. It is worth the price the price but quirky is exactly the right word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money.","review":"This coffeemaker works great, it makes and keeps the coffee hot, and it makes it quickly, which is a lot more than I can say for the more expensive ones I replaced with this one. This is the first coffeemaker I've found that I can pour a whole carafe-full without coffee dripping down the front of the carafe. I like this machine and I recommend it. For the money, you can't beat this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker","review":"This coffee maker is awesome. Makes coffee quickly and it tastes great. I use Melita Filters with Don Francisco French Roast. I like that it does not have an off timer because I don't have to reset it from turning off. The filters fit fine - don't need to cut - put them in and dump your grinds. Works fine. I'm replacing this one with a $2000 Miele built-in - I hope the coffee tastes as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting coffee!","review":"I have had my Braun coffeemaker for only one week, but have nothing but good things to say about it. When I tasted my first cup of coffee, I was delighted! It makes great tasting coffee!

The reviews were VERY helpful to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to","review":"We have been using this coffee maker since it arrived a week ago. Super fast shipping. I love ordering from amazon.And the coffee maker is fast and easy to use. Nothing fancy but we didn't need fancy. It makes 4-10 cups of cofee real fast.The product seems flimsy but I'm not the kind to go around throwing around my stuff so it doesn't bother me. Let's hope it lasts a while. We had to throw our expensive coffeemaker by another maker after 2 weeks of owning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee @ a Great Price","review":"In this case, simple construction, very few parts, and an inexpensive price equal Consistently VERY GOOD coffee.The only downside on this coffee maker is that it is a bit on the fragile side. My first one lasted about a year: the plastic mechanisim that stops the coffee flow when removing the carafe broke. Also, the filter basket door on my first one frequently took an extra push to fully close. Nevertheless, great coffee time after time is more than worth the few trials.After 4-5 weeks this one is working fine and the coffee is even better than the first one. Gotta stop here and get my coffee!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but one flaw","review":"Great price at Amazon, and great coffeemaker.

I bought one for home and liked it so much I bought one for my office. It is simple and easy to use. Coffee brews quick. I can get a cup before it finishes without a mess and it makes great coffee.

The cone shaped filter allows the water to steep a bit longer in the basket than conventional coffee makers. This allows me to enlarge the size of the coffee bean grind to reduce bitterness, yet brew full flavored coffee. The only problem I've had with this unit is the brew pause feature doesn't work, but then again I want the entire pot to brew before I pour any coffee so that the flavor is consistant between pots of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn thing just stinks","review":"This is my second Braun, since my research said they're good for the price. I am not \\"Godzilla\\" as another reviewer wrote, saying that the parts are not so delicate and that you'd have to \\"be Godzilla to break the Braun.\\" This is the second to stop pausing when I remove the carafe. Mornings are tough enough, but when coffee pours onto a hot plate and covers my entire kitchn counter, it's a horrendous mess. The swinging basket slides open whenever it feels like it, which stops brewing, yet all the pieces are in place. I do not recommend this version of Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee not hot enough","review":"I purchased this coffee pot the first time back in 1998, and loved it. When it had to be replaced last month, I figured why tamper with a good thing, and got another one. The second one has been disappointing. Unlike the orignal coffee maker, the coffee in the new one doesn't stay hot on the burner after it's been brewed. As a result, you're left with a pretty mediocre cup of coffee and coffee pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful coffeemaker","review":"I bought this on the recommendation from Consumer ReportsIt was number one ranked.But I disagree with their findings because this coffee pot wasfragile and broke after a week of use.

For a temporary, beginner or work machine this is excellent.Makes a good cup of coffee but lacks an accurate thermostat for the warming plate and the coffee does become stale quickly. Not a problem if you use the coffee fairly quickly, as in a work setting, etc.The only other problem with the machine is the quality of components. If the plastic was any thinner it would be transparent, but other than that the workmanship is good for a maker in this price range (cheap). Sure beats the cost of a pod maker and the pods which I had used previously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Braun's Usual Quality","review":"I have had a number of Braun coffee makers. This is the first unit that was not up to Braun's typically high standards. The unit is lighter weight and not as well designed compared to Braun units I have previously owned. One of the prongs that hold the lid on broke after a few months normal use and it is awkward to get the carafe centered over the heating plate - the carafe wants to slide off to one side. I normally love Braun products, but would not recommend this one other than for occassional use - such as at a beach or mountain house where it doesn't have to meet the rigors of every day use."},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves her coffiee maker","review":"I purchased this coffee maker for a friend and she just love it.

I saw the good review about the KF400 in Consumers Reports and its low price, so I bought it. We were disappointed right from the get-go. The carafe feels cheap and not at all substantial. The pause-while-pouring feature never worked. Worst of all, after about 3 days, the hinged basket that holds the filter and coffee somehow got deformed so it would never snap shut. We discovered that problem when the basket sprang open while brewing and spewed coffee all over the counter. Thereafter, we had to hold it closed with a rubber band for it to work, which didn't look that attractive. I relegated the unit to the cellar and just bought a Cuisinart DCC-1200. It was $65 at Kohl's after sales and a $10 rebate, and so far it's working great. With the Braun KF400, unfortunately, I think you get what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"This product began self destructing almost as soon as it was out of the box. The plastic is thin and flimsy. The little knobs that hold the lid on the pot broke within the first two weeks of use. The brew basket does not seat into place very well and frequently is out of place just enough that the autodrip feature stops the dripping causing all the water to stay in the brew basket. The coffee itself is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bought, it's going back","review":"It might make a good cup of coffee but mine never made it that far.It came made of quite flimsy plastic. The plastic parts, especially around the swing out filter, don't align anywhere near properly, and the swing out filter doesn't quite lock into place. So it's going back to the store today. Which is a shame because I'm dying for a good cup of joe!Pretty sure I am going to spend the extra money and get a sturdier model that looks better and works well, the Cuisinart DCC-1200."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book by a superb writer","review":"In this book we follow in the footsteps and the thoughts of a man who experiences the worst: his (firts-time) lover dies in his arms and leaves him in a house he does not know with a two-year-old.

I was surprised how little nudity is in it since it's played up as being such a sexy film. Since that's got to be the reason a lot of people watch it, why in the world did the producers not have some of the sexy babes who are in it romp around topless or totally in the buff through most of the film??? If you buy it to see such titillation, you'll find yourself mostly waiting for a few brief flashes every now and then. I think the overall low production values, such as the poor acting, also work against it being much erotic.

Also everything was supposed to be 1/2\\", 5/8\\" and 3/4\\", but the 1/2\\" stuff was actually 13mm.

Sometimes, it picks up some telephone calls from the neighbours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"These headphones have a constant hiss, even when fully charged. The sound cuts out every few minutes for no reason, and the silence lasts for a few minutes too. Since there is \\"automatic\\" tuning, then there is no way to adjust the tuning to get a better, or any, signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality product","review":"Followed the instructions to setup the headphone and started to charge the battery for couples of hours. Then, connected to my CD player immediately, no sound at all. Followed the instruction to switch it off and on, still not working.

Hopefully, this was a particular instance and no problem for other units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately there was good reason for low price closeout","review":"I bought these headphones at less than half the normal price, so at least the loss was not a great problem. They are essentially a badly designed or high failure rate product that puts a blemish on JVC. Sometimes they work for a while, but not for long.

The JVC headphones are junk. Having experienced the same problems of hissing, not working beyond 10', etc. The final straw concerning this product is the fact I can't find a replacement battery. I thought originally the battery might have been the problem.

The headphones would NOT TURN ON, even after charging the battery for 72-hours. It was totally defective. One reviewer, who has had the \\"100\\" model for ten years wondered why JVC quality has diminished. I can tell them that it is because this \\"Japanese\\" product is now being manufactured in China, and there IS NO QUALITY CONTROL done any more...just solder it together and hope it works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever hopeless item","review":"I purchased this worst product due to brand name JVC.

I took my dogs into the vets for a routine appointment and asked about flea meds. The vet gave me a topical application... needless to say it didn't work because I was only able to treat the fleas on the animal. I had a friend suggested DeFlea. I love it, not only are you treating the dog but the sofa, carpet, dog bed, car... everything. Within a few days my dogs were done gnawing on themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-toxic is a lie!!! THi almost poisoned my foster cat.","review":"If I could give less than one star, I would. Natural Chemistry De-flea spray for cats says it is natural and safe for cats, but after following the directions, a foster cat had to be taken to the Vet for an allergic reaction, costing over $200. The vet said this is a common occurrence with so called \\"natural\\" flea sprays, yet there is NOT a warning anywhere on the bottle. It even claims to be safe for \\"all cats over 12 weeks,\\" it is Non-toxic, \\"safe\\" (that's total crap). I had sprayed the cat at about 10pm, following the directions on the bottle and by 10 am the next morning I had to rush her to the vet because she wasn't responsive, wouldn't eat or drink anything, she was laying outside of her bed with her tongue sticking out a bit.

After reading the label and thinking this was a godsend since I cannot bathe my cats I was excited to use it and be happy that they would finally be at ease. That was not the case.After applying both my cats started vomiting and shaking. They both stopped eating for over 3 days and I ended up trying to bathe each of them to get the stuff off. I ended up spending over $500 at the vet getting them checked out to see if they were okay and why they wouldn't eat.Ever since I've used this stuff they've not been the same. Buzz my biggest boy now constantly shakes and Dixon still has problems eating. This stuff is a nightmare and should be banned from the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use caution!","review":"I used this product on 16 week old kittens and it kills the fleas but it made the kittens sick. I don't think I'd recommend this product because there are no exact measurements on how much or how little to use. It's better to just use frontline or somethin that doesn't go all over your pet so that there is an accurate dose and so they can't lick/ingest it directly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, it does not work well","review":"I used this on 1 dog and 3 cats due to a bad flea problem and wanting to avoid harsh chemicals. It did not work. We sprayed tha pets and through the house and are still facing a huge flea problem.The spray made the pets sick and also us. Some fleas did die, but not enough to make a worthwhile difference. Our older dog and cat had additional problems for a few days as they reacted to the spray.I also read the reviews while doing research and only saw one bad review, so I thought it would work. Due to the poor performance I wrote this review to help others to make their decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made cat sick! Scary!","review":"This was advertised to me as natural and safe to use on my cats. The instructions actually say to \\"Spray the entire animal...spray until entire coat is damp.\\" I gave my cat one spritz to try it. As soon as she licked herself (like every wet cat will do) she began instantly foaming at the mouth to a pretty extreme extent. It was pretty scary. Even after she calmed down, another lick made it start right back up. I had to quickly run her into the shower to wash this stuff out of her coat. The instructions say not to apply to the pet's nose or mouth, but when it also says \\"spray until entire coat is damp\\" of course the cat will lick itself. Scary stuff. It may be fine for their bedding and everything else, but I won't ever spray this directly on my cats again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use this product for cats!","review":"As others indicated, this product can have negative consequences for cats. I have two, and I thought this sounded like an ideal solution instead of the powder I have always used. I sprayed a little of it on my cats and worked it in around their necks. I did NOT do the full body treatment...thank goodness!One of the cats was fine, but the other did what cats do - she worked hard to lick it off. Unfortunately, it did not agree with her. She became lethargic for several days and even lost her voice for almost a week. I cringe to think of what would have happened to her if I had sprayed her entire body. She still will not go near her previous hidey-spots that I sprayed, which I think says it all.I will not have this product in my house again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like VOMIT!!!","review":"Disgusting smell!! Now my cat and hands smell like vomit! I also bought the De Flea shampoo. It too has the same odor but not as strong. As to whether or not it works in spite of the smell.... No, not really unless you comb out the fleas with a flea comb then spray the spray directly on them while over a sink where you can wash them down the drain immediately afterwards..... At least that's the only way it's worked for us so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fleas are gone but I am not sure if it was because of this product","review":"I used advantage for my cat after not using it for a while. They were in our beds and i used this to try to get them out after changing the sheets. I don't like the fact that they tell you not to use it for humans but you can use it for pets. May be it's a law suit thing but I was looking for one i could use on my bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"We bought this product because our dog was infested with fleas, and we still had to wait to give him Frontline for this month. We sprayed his whole body and I massaged it in as recommended. Well, it didn't work. The next day he was an infested as before. And I think he had some sort of allergic reaction to it: the skin on his testicles was peeling off. Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both of my cats foamed at the mouth!!!","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, our poor little cats began foaming at the mouth intensely almost immediately after they licked themselves (One is about 8 months old, the other about 4 years old). It is very concerning that the product instructions indicate that it is best to completely saturate your animal, yet almost instantly our animals had a severe reaction. After about 5 minutes they were fine and their behavior never changed, but it was extremely frightening to see them with white foam all over their mouths. Do not spray this product on your pets!!! It does kill adult fleas on contact (so I suppose if you want to spray your furniture or carpet then it might be ok-although it still makes me weary to have it in my home after this incident). Keep your babies safe and do not spray this product on them or anywhere near them!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"leaves pet feeling greasy, doesn't last long","review":"This product left my dog's fur feeling thick and greasy.

Not as strong as the othertwo films. The majority of it is Fatty hitting on various girls in the park, but thereis a cool, surreal, self reflective moment at the end, when Fatty sees newsreelfootage of his amorous attempts projected at the local movie house, as hiswife sits next to him.\`Number, Please?'

This book is helping me move from married to divorced. The story brings the reader painfully, achingly along with the protagonist, as all of her potential (vibrant physical health, powerful intellect, passion) is slowly killed off. Lacking any socially-approved way to leave her stultifying life, she slowly withers, while the reader witnesses it. Painful, yes, but inspirational as well.

Unfortunately both broke after a year in exactly the same way. The black plastic gear that engages the blades cracked, and in both cases it broke on while blending either bag ice or most recently, frozen bananas. Considering that these ingredients are not that hard to blend, I am greatly disappointed.If you buy a Cuisinart, it's because you demand quality.

First off, it's extremely loud. If you intend to use it, get earplugs. I'm not kidding either. It's so loud I honestly believe it could damage your hearing if you run it for extended periods of time.The blender works okay I suppose, but the food processor using the S blade chops very poorly in my experience. Food just gets stuck along the sides and I constantly have to stop and push it back down with a spoon. It seems to have been getting worse over time so I don't know if it's breaking or what. (*edit* It did break a few months after I wrote this)I can honestly say the last food processor I had which was $30 from Walmart chopped much better and was much quieter. This one is so loud and works so poorly I hate using it. There are a lot better machines out there so I'd recommend passing on this one and reading reviews for other machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Unsuited for Smoothies","review":"Although this blender came highly recommended by Consumer Reports, I have been very disappointed by this unit's lack of durability, after giving it more than a fair chance: I have owned a total of 3 of these blenders (2 with the food processor attachment, one without). Two of the units were store bought and one was a factory replacement. I have used the machine to make smoothies 2-6 times a week and to accasionally puree soup. The motor failed on two of the units and the black plastic rotor on the base of the glass jar disintegrated on the third unit within 1-2 years of moderate use. If making smoothies is something you enjoy, then this is probably not a blender you should consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelled like it was about to catch on fire...","review":"Dear Friends in Cooking,After two uses it smelled like a model train set on overload.

All of my friends and family hate this product and beg me not to use the food processor part because of the noise. This is my second one and they have both been the same. Customer service has told me twice that this is just the way the product is. Why would they put it on the market? In terms of processing and blending it works fine. It is not very durable - I've had two plastic pieces break off with just normal use.

But for this album ,it is very bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor production, great music!!","review":"I loved the songs on this cd after the first listen. The interchange between Male and Female vocals keeps the material fresh and keeps any one song from becoming too extreme in either direction. The only thing that detracts from an otherwise great experience is the poor production/recording on this cd. A lot of times vocals are overshadowed by the music and at other times the clarity of guitars and drums suffer. Regardless, there is not one bad song on this cd and there is enough variety in tempo and mood to keep your attention throughout. I really liked the first track....... Great band with incredible potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I have to say, even in their early albums, this band was quite enjoyable. They deserve a lot of credit on this album, they are trying their absolute hardest to try to be unstood in their songs. This was still during the day, when they were still trying to adapt to singing the English Language, i think the best effort was My Wings. Overall, any Lacuna Coil fan will love this, great effort, great songs. I can honestly say, that even if you understand them what they are saying or don't, you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless and mediocre","review":"I thought this was good, after all their first Ep is quite cool. Big mistake! \\"In a reverie\\" is painfully dumb! Most of it is mediocre heavy rock that tries to emulate the contrast between clean female and gruff male vocals which other bands did successfully, but Lacuna Coil fails miserably in doing so. This album lacks excitement, originality, good riffs, and decent lyrics.Stay away from it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!","review":"I don't know what the hell some of these people are talking about.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this crap and pick up Evanescece instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pause before greatness","review":"On their first full-length release, following their self-titled debut EP, Lacuna Coil are poised on the verge of greatness. The CD's opening track \\"Circle\\" is a masterpiece and hints at what is yet to come from this Italian powerhouse in the future. The rest of the tracks are perfectly adequate, but don't really propel the band beyond what they showed us on their debut EP. The songs are well-crafted and highly listenable, and Cristina Scabbia continues to be the best voice in rock today. Other standout tracks are \\"Stately Lover\\" and \\"To Myself I Turned.\\" With this first full-length effort, Lacuna Coil deliver a quality release while only hinting at the heights to which they would soar on their subsequent releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing Music","review":"Lacuna Coil is incredible. You really have to hear them to believe them. Frontwoman Cristina Scabbia has a beautiful and melodic voice that seems to do the impossible. Her voice is much better than Amy Lee's (Evanescence). Every song on this album is excellent but standouts include Cold, Stately Lover, and the best song Lacuna Coil has made to date, To Myself I Turned. They combine heavy rock with melodic themes brilliantly. The male backup, Andrea Ferro sounds a lot like James Hetfield and complements Scabbia well. There really is no comparison to Lacuna Coil. Evanescence is probably the closest band I can think of. Other people compare them to The Gathering but they are too techno to see a similarity besides a female singer. If you like Evanescence I would strongly reccomend In A Reverie. It won't leave your CD Player for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This is a good story about reading.

The masters used for copying these shows showed their age in some episodes as well.It's clear that subtitles were done by different people, and, frankly, some of them weren't any good. Subtitles on specialty shows, like medicine and, presumably, law, can be hit-or-miss, and many of these are a miss. Good captioners/subtitlers exist for these, and some are here. Another, however, is terrible and simply invents things when he or she doesn't understand the dialogue.

More action, the new fire engine arrives this season, more humor, as the show went on it seems there was less soapish drama in the hospital and more action with the fire crew. Dont wait, go ahead and pick this up! Hopefully season 4 doesnt take as long...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Show is GREAT, but the DVD is not","review":"The episodes were very good, but the quality of the picture and sound, while not nearly as bad as season 4's, were not as good as seasons 1&2. I had to return this set, because disc 3 was defective, and would not even play. Amazon was good and quick getting a replacement sent. I hope season 5 will be a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality TV","review":"I have always prefered older TV series & movies - they just do not make this kind of quality anymore (everything today is about sex, drugs, and death).

A must for any true Emergency! fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD release of a great show","review":"This is a great set for a few reasons. First, the discs are single sided, unlike season 1. The episodes in the third season are more interesting and exciting than seasons 1 and 2. This season also starts the tradition of a really big fire at the end of the show. The only down side of this set is that there are a few episodes where it seems like the producers of the DVD had to use TV distribution re-run prints, so there are a few episodes where the picture is not as clear and the sound is not quite as good, with the re-run introduction. The majority of the episodes have beautiful picture quality and sound. I am too young to remember this show when it first came on, but I really became hooked on it when TV LAND ran the show back in 99/2000. If you like the show you really should collect all the DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"LATE ORDER BECAUSE IT WASNT PROCESSED IN A TIMELY MATTER","review":"YEP THIS ORDER GOING TO BE LATE I SHOULD GET A DISCOUNT FOR IT NOT BEING PROCESSED FAST ENOUGH IN A TIMELY MATTER LIKE OTHER TIMES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emergency","review":"If you watched this program as a child you will enjoy the 3rd season.

And the FM capability has so far defeated me.I'm not a technology maven but I'm not exactly incompetent either.

The backseat cupholders in the Grand Caravan (2006) are totally useless, and were constantly falling apart (they are attached to the side of the seat) and drinks were spilling everywhere. With this, drinks stay in place, it's great for trash (I line it with a plastic grocery bag), and the plastic bin holds a box of decorative tissues perfectly. We live in a rural area, and it does not slide or tip when going over rough roads. The height is good for even a very short person to be able to reach the drinks, trash and tissues.

It's better than Blade Trinity where Snipes was reduced almost to a side kick and a few steps up from the messy Unstoppable and dreadful The Marksman. If you liked Drop Zone, Money Train, Murder At 1600 then you should have no problem enjoying 7 Seconds. It's a good thriller with Snipes in top form with some good action sequences and 3 nice martial arts fight scenes by Snipes. I can't understand all the negitivity for this movie.

Man, it was so hard to get through this movie. Like, most of the reviews have said, the beginning part was alright but after that it just took a nose dive. I really wanted to turn this movie off in the middle cause I just couldn't take it but I was able to get through it (with a little fast forwarding). The acting was just so bad and the story was pointless. So, whatever you do please don't watch this movie...believe me, you'll thank me in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TO GOOD","review":"This movie was about as bad a movie as Snipes has ever made. Like the other review the beginning takes off nicely, but the flim begins to out think itself with lots of twists and turns.

The C++ code presented here is some of the worst I have ever seen. The earlier chapters actually try to be a crashcourse C++. I got the distinct feeling in later chapters that the author's full knowledge of this wonderful language are unfortunately contained therein.The detail level of this book is saddeningly low. Being 112 pages (194 in my edition) this is hardly a surprise anymore.Long story short, if you want to see someone write bad but well documented code for a simple compiler, by all means buy this.

McCallum writes about a season with the Phoenix Suns, and takes us through their playoff run.

Bill Clinton's role in this saga is shown to be his life-long love affair with himself ; an egomaniacal menage-a-une, with total disregard for those around him.Christopher Anderson's book \\"Bill & Hillary - The Marriage\\" is an education in just how sordid, unconscionable and dishonest the political process, and those who seek office, can be.

This book is also for those who just like to make up stuff about the Clinton's. I hate meatloaf, but I hate this book even more. I'm sure he's a good man, but I wonder why in the world he would use so many sources that have been previously paid to tell their story and not disclose that information in his book - he gladly disclosed lies, but he doesn't disclose that his sources were paid, that's just wrong in my book, wrong I say, wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a tree.

Mr. Anderson's sources are questionable at best. For example, his primary source to prove Hillary's alleged affair with Vince Foster is a former Arkansas State Trooper who was part of the the Troopergate article in the American Spectator.Save your money.

Breathless allegations of \\"truth!\\" by Clinton-haters not withstanding, when you READ this \\"book\\" it's clear the most salacious rumor is just that -- unconfirmed, unsourced, sometimes unbelievable.

It's too bad people feel compelled to buy this book just because it rips on the Clintons - hello, folks he doesn't use sources that are credible. Let me say that again, he doesn't use sources that are credible, that means we cannot believe what he says.

While this book gives some insight into the Washington presidential clique, it virtually runs down the President and Hillary. I rather buy me books that the President has read, because it shows me more about who he really is in the sense of his desires and personality.

Our country is unlikely to see such an individual again for a very long time; good thing, too.Unfortunately this book only serves to make the enemies of \\"Bill & Hill\\" more smug (with good cause, I admit...) while leaving the rest of us to scratch our heads about these two.Go figure..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???","review":"This book is a joke.

This book is another example of their outrage at actually losing the White House, and in two consecutive elections at that.The well-funded Demonization of Bill and Hillary started in earnest in 1988, and continues to this late date. This particular literary pustule is just appalling, and so are the standards by which this mishmash of evil-minded fantasy was slapped together.

First, the book is fast and loose in terms of journalistic standards. Second, however, is that, based upon what we do know, much of it rings true. The real question, and one that objective people will answer yes, is \\"Do you think, based upon what we do know, that the Clintons are capable of this kind of behavior?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmm...","review":"The best way to read this book is to ponder what the American people should know about their politicians before they elect them to the highest offices. Those who dismiss this book as rumor overlook the extent to which so much which had been dismissed was corroborated over the past year.Would Clinton have been elected if Anderson had written this book in 1992? My suggestion, the answer is clearly no. To what extent should the press vette candidates before they're elected? If the New York Times had published this material before the New Hampshire primaries they would have been accused of attack dog politics, and yet better that than what the country went through last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and Shocking...","review":"I could not put the book down, it is both reviling andshocking.

That sums it up. Anderson makes wild outrageous claims and then has the nerve not to name the source of his claims. He writes that Governor Clinton, while attending an engagement party seduced the bride in front of her fiance, broke up the engagement and then made her believe he was going to marry her and divorce Hillary. According to whom? Andersen claims that two weeks after the impeachment trial, Clinton had a secret service agent approach a young woman and ask her back to his room for a drink, again who is the source. ANDERSEN CANNOT EVEN GET THE NAME OF THE FAMOUS INTERN CORRECT - IT'S NOT LEWINKSY BUT LEWINSKY!

I have unfortunately seen first hand how reporters can put words in people's mouths and call it journalism. What's more, even if this book were an exact recounting of the truth, the point is, there is simply no need for the public to know what goes on in the President's bedroom.

Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have been rumored to have questionable personal lives since Bill was the Arkansas governor. While this has certainly been proven true, \\"Bill and Hillary\\" acts in the same fashion as \\"Year of the Rat\\" by Triplett and Timperlake in that it pulls all the punches and makes connections and assumptions that are iffy at best. While there is no doubt both Bill and Hillary Clinton have been proven to be not- so- faithful to their wedding vows, the idea that Bill engaged in cocaine use and street- side sex with a prostitute could not be based on anything more than hearsay. The accusations are certainly interesting, but much of them seem to be no more than sleazy yellow journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christopher Andersen writes a very negative unreliable book.","review":"I think we need to ask Christopher Andersen a lot of questions about his sources for the context of this book.

They may not be role models but they are not above or below the law. Andersen uses sources that have been discredited time and time again. We simply cannot trust him.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clip-Job Chris","review":"I could not believe the poor way in which Andersen cites his sources. Unlike real, professonal authors who list each source one by one in each chapter, he lumps sources and chapters together. Sadly, increased competition has pushed many journalists to sacrifice accuracy for speed. The book has several key spelling errors, it lacks original reporting, and the primitive chapter notes, lead me to believe that this book was rushed to print.

Every paragraph is peppered with metaphors; one begins to realize that Ms. Houston's sentences cannot stand on their own and that she cannot convey a thought without using a comparison coming straight out of left field. Apparently she is also a born-again Christian since characters in one chapter begin quoting scripture. Subliminal sermonizing? Is it, perhaps, an attempt to follow in the footsteps of the \\"Left Behind\\" crew? Don't waste your time and money.

Armageddon at Defcon 1 would have made a good movie, or an even better comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea with poor technical development","review":"Reading the previous reviews for this book overcame my initial reservations at paying full price for this book. To my disappointment, the reviews did not accurately portray this books worth. While I found that the idea behind the story is a good one, I found the level of technical development lacking. While not everyone writes to the level of detail that Tom Clancy has made famous, authors writing in this arena should at least strive to research their subject matter and provide at least some technical background. I understand this is a work of fiction. I cannot understand however the use of terms such as \\"The President of the CIA\\". This is just one of many silly statements found in the book that could have been better portrayed. Was this book edited before it went to print?? I believe a good editor could have caught many of the writing problems in this book. Overall, I think it was a story with great potential that was sold short by a lack of development."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK idea but horrible execution","review":"This was quite possibly the most poorly-written book I've ever read.

Apart from the fact that the average teen (incidentally, I'm 19 myself) is somewhat radical and extreme today, God Himself wants Christians to be either hot or cold (read: extreme), and to Him, the lukewarm Christian is a disgusting taste! (Read Revelation 3:15-16!) Also, one must realize that while Mr. Clark may have had a successful and pure dating relationship, he was also well out of his teens when he wrote this book. Joshua Harris was only barely out of his teens upon writing his book-- he was more aware of the difficulties that face teens today. I do not claim to know everything. But I know that this book can be a danger to teens if they do not read God's Word for themselves first so that they can hear directly from Him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid","review":"This seems to be more like a response to the popular \\"I Kissed Dating Goodbye by Joshua Harris.\\" It seems as if the author is very defensive that dating is okay, well no one's saying that dating is a sin. I believe dating is best applied when both people are actually looking to get married in the end.I also heard Mr. Clark on a radio broadcast program a long time ago, and he sounded very defensive about his book and his beliefs. Its as if he believes that he has to be right. Get over it. At the same time I don't understand \\"Joshua Harris's book, Boy Meets Girl.\\"I've heard both sides of the argument, to date or not to date. To court or not to court, I just think that dating/courting is the same, it just depends how you do it, and what your focus is behind it.I don't think dating/courting is bad, just as long as you don't play games with people's heart, and in my opinion dating is the purpose of finding a spouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Gave Dating a Chance is helpful and I love it","review":"This book is very good from various perspectives. One of the greatest things about this book was that I really felt like the author wasn't just sitting around writing something from some psychological standpoint. I felt like the book was being written to me. The things he talked about were all issues I've struggled with in dating. I wish I had have read this book sooner. The book talked a lot about knowing how to respect the person you are dating, and how to respect the guidelines you set in your relationship. I've heard lots of people come and talk about purity and their opinions on dating, but unlike all the people who have talked to me about dating this book explained why. I'd recommend this book to any teenager to read before they start dating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer in Bad mood?","review":"Must have been something he ate, or something, cause this book is a direct attack on Joshua Harris' I Kissed Dating Goodbye. Not only is it unpleasing in God's eyes, it's just plain rude. His basic ideas are almost identical to what Joshua Harris says, but Jeramy insists that his view is the right view and Joshua is completely wrong. He may have said the right things, but he needs to change his attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Writen With Bad Intentions","review":"Mr. Clark wrote his book with bad intentions. As he states he wrote his book because too many people were opting for non-dating route. While other books were written out of love and concern for the readers well being and spiritual walk, Mr. Clark's book was only interested in defending his point and putting an end to a legalistic view of dating and living. As a good friend once said, \\"Too many people are worried about being legalistic and not worried enough about sin. I choose to kiss Mr. Clark's book goodbye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This is absolutely ridiculous that someone would write a book as a direct assault on another's work. Much less one who names themself a Christian. If you don't like what someone has to say about a subject then ignore it... don't write a stinking book about it.No wonder the world would rather go to hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Old is New Again","review":"This book by Jeramy Clark gives excellent insight into the proper procedures one needs to take before pursuing a dating relationship. He gives a young and fresh view of traditional values by using his own experiences to personalize the message. This enables the reader to relate more deeply to the concepts discussed, since they are on a more tangible level. In these days of moral relativism this book makes responsibility and standards appear much more attractive to the reader, by contemporizing timeless truths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"As I was looking for a good book to offer to my girls back at my home church, my college roommate handed me this book. I started reading with a relatively open mind and discovered that not only was this book something every teenage boy or girl should read when they want their romantic lives to line up with the Lord's will, but that I also was able to find meaning in much of the content. Granted, I don't agree with all of Mr. Clark's conclusions, but the principles of this book are strong and the message is clear. Rather than throwing this book at teenagers, I would recommend reading it with them and having genuine discussions, or pairing it with other books on such subject matter. However... highly enjoyed and highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for all young Christians who want to Date Godly","review":"This book gives a great Biblical perspective on the confusing issue of dating as a Christian. There are so many different opinions on the subject, that it's almost confusing. But this book is different. It offers sensible, biblical advice for dating as a Christian. I would recommend this to all teenagers who \\"think\\" they are ready to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda pathetic","review":"I didn't read the whole book because I was so turned off. It's obviously just a slap at Josh Harris' book, and kinda unnecessary. Dating itself is not a sin, as Josh Harris says--but the attitudes sure can be! This book is just a way to excuse sinful behavior, and perhaps soothe ruffled feathers. Let's think of what is BEST for our lives, not just okay. Is dating God's best?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but no cigar...","review":"Jeramy Clark obviously took alot of time to write this book, but not quite enough to think about what he was saying. He is trying very hard to justify something that is not what God wants. As Joshua Harris says, dating is like going to a fast food restaurant- it won't kill you, but why would you go there when there is something far better. Mr. Clark is trying to take something that is second best, gloss it over with faulty ideas, throwing in his own story to make it appear like it always works, and go. No matter how you say it, whether in words or actions, dating still leaves you with a scarred and tattered heart. Thats not what I want to present the man that God has chosen for me. I urge you to reconsider this book- don't give dating a chance. Its not worth your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Out- Great Read","review":"I loved this book very much.

It provides the humidity required for my bedroom and must be refilled daily to top off its two gal. capacity. I wasn't getting enough moisture in the air in my living room, so when I saw the unit advertised, very reasonably, I ordered another. I clean it out once a week with some white vinegar while the unit is still warm and put it right back into service. It does make a definite difference in reducing heating costs as the 40% or higher level of water vapor in the air feels less chilly. You can't be lazy about the maintenance. It does need attention, but it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only desktop humidifier worth spending less than 500$ on","review":"works and keeps on working. nothing to clean besides the tanks. don't waste your money on the \\"giant sponge\\" style humidifiers. the GF-220 is truly the only humidifier worth spending less than $500 on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very noisy, poor output","review":"Constant gurgling, boiling sounds.

And, as advertised, it has delivered on all those fronts. The only problem is that the output is so weak that it has a minimal effect on the humidity in a very small room. After running it for several hours, it could only get the RH in my room up from 30-32 to 35-36 percent. I could probably do the same with spray bottle. When I hold my hand over a humidifier, I want *some* water to condense on it.Maybe it's just mine, but I couldn't in good faith recommend this to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuasive work on the development of the LDS church.","review":"The book focuses on the development of the Mormon church from its small beginnings to the 10.5 million members it has today. Her arugement is that Mormonism is a new religious tradition in the sense that it grew outside of the mainstream Protestantism of America in the 1830's. She argues that although it has aspects of Old Testament Judaism and New Testament Christianity the Mormon church should be considered another Religious tradition that is developing into a world religion. Overall the book is persuasive, but I found some of the logic or proofs strained and hard to follow. It is favorable towards the church and does tend to gloss over the controversial parts of the LDS faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best options for a general reader","review":"Jan Shipps offers a very good overview of Mormonism for the general reader and for the nonspecialist. Shipps, though not a Mormon herself, is regarded both within and without the LDS Church as one of the foremost experts on Mormonism. This work presents a sympathetic outsider's perspective on the Church, while also attempting to \\"locate\\" Mormonism on the spectrum of American religiosity. Shipps's conclusion is that while the question of whether Mormonism is Christian is a convoluted one, it is possible to see in the Church an institution that is both an outgrowth of Christianity and different enough from traditional Christianity to be seen as a \\"new religion.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipps fails to address controversial aspects of LDS church","review":"I found this book to be a generally accurate account of Mormonism by a non-mormon apologist.

You can tell Faye never studied how to properly write a book, and the segways, if present, are insufficient BUT she did catch my interest and more than any of that, I cared about Faye and cared about what happened to her.

The author mentions that her Soviet Partisan unit was subjected to a German helicopter attack in 1944. The Germans did not have any helicopters in WWII, and neither did any other country. They did have ground attack airplanes, but the book describes a helicopter attack. There is either a credibility problem with this account, or some type of translation/linguistic error. The publisher should have caught this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoir has historical anachronism about aircraft","review":"This memoir describes a German helicopter attack on the author's Soviet Partisan unit in 1944. This sounds unlikely, as the Germans had produced only 39 of the experimental 8-passenger Fa 223 (1942), the only helicopter they made that carried a machine gun. Few survived; Allied bombers destroyed the factory. The Germans had ground attack airplanes, but a helicopter attack is unlikely. Helicopters were developed to their full military potential after WWII. Was this a linguistic error or faulty memory by the author?

If one is to follow Ridenour's logic, being a good Christian means affirming that \\"our\\" God is not \\"their\\" God, that modern science is dubious, and that a layman's survey of the bible is sufficient preparation for spiritual independence. Ignoring modern critical scholarship of the bible (but emphasizing inconsistencies in non-Christian texts), \\"So What's The Difference\\" teaches that religious exploration is for clever people like Ridenour but not for those who really want to reflect on the nature of God, salvation and religious observance. That this book should be on any bookshelf is a tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased, innacurate, and condescending","review":"The author seems to think that he can pass judgement any way he pleases without even offering accurate information.

He wanted to know the differences between our faiths. It helped him come to the decision that he needed to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It is not indepth, but it just touches the surface of many of the world's religions and is written with a Christian perspective. Someone who is not opened to believing in Jesus Christ as the Son of God may have a hard time accepting the truths in this book. It is a great witnessing tool for the Christian to have available in their own libraries to give to individuals who are on the verge of believing. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Comparative Study","review":"I'll yield to the substantial reviews of those who've already posted, and I'll simply reaffirm that this book is a good book for the Christian preparing for evangelism.

Chapters are given titles like \\"The Serpent's Old Lie in an Updated Package\\" and \\"Eleven More Viewpoints That Undermine, Challenge, or Attack Biblical Christianity.\\" Instead of just explaining the differences in world religions like the title suggests, the author explains why Christianity is better then each world religion.If you are a Biblical Christian and want affirmation on why your religion is superior, then this is the book for you.

Arguelles shows how art has manifested this split, culminating in the sterility of modern art today.He calls for the reconciliation of male and female in order to restore cosmic harmony.The true artist can plant the vision-seed that will take us forward.The scope of Arguelles' vision is fantastic.This book has real answers that show the way out of our dying civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little different take on Electronic / Pop /80s","review":"At first glance and listen, Annie is one of those artists that indie lovers may pass over. That should not be the case. I first heard Annie on KEXP, which is one of the most progressive modern music stations in the US. Annie's sound reminds me of the Tom Tom Club and Human League, Abba, Madonna, and some of the 80's girl groups. What keeps me listening besides the great voice and vocal delivery is the production. The electronic dance beat layering done by the producers is great. This CD will make some great jams whether you are listening alone, at the backyard BBQ, or in the club. Annie should have wide appeal from both the indie crowd and the mainstream pop set. That's a tight-walk that is not easy to maneuver, but Annie pulls it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie - Anniemal","review":"Well, perhaps it might not seem like a compliment to call Annie's debut ANNIEMAL the best pop record of 2005, but it's true nonetheless -- it's a delightly pop confection from start to end. I defy anyone not to be charmed by the bubblegum grrl-power of \\"Chewing Gum.\\" The disco-funk of \\"Me Plus One\\" shows sharp production from Richard X, whose updating of 80s sounds has brought him acclaim. Royksopp also lend their production assistance to the club-ready \\"Heartbeat.\\" For those in a more romantic mood, \\"No Easy Love\\" deftly avoids the R&B cliches. The catchy \\"Greatest Hit,\\" despite its finger-snapping qualities, is a little bittersweet, considering that Erot, Annie's boyfriend, died not long after producing it.

This audio version allowed me to listen to the book while I was reading it and when I couldn't read it (in the car and when exercising). That was an added bonus. The book is not an easy read. Piper is a theologian and a deep thinker. Seeing it, hearing it, working through the study questions, all helped make this an exceptional experience. I was studying it (a chapter a week) with a group of guys and am not sure I would have been able to keep up or have had the same depth of experience if I hadn't have also had the audio version.

His passion and understanding that we are to find our greatest pleasure in God is so rich.

Piper could have said many things in a fraction of the words. I felt like I had to read three to four pages in order to understand an idea that shouldn't have exceeded a paragraph.This book had a lot of good things in it, it just takes a long time to get the meat out of it.

But I found it dry and boring. The footnotes were distracting and I just wasn't getting where he was going with the material. I found myself not wanting to pick it up to read it but feeling obligated to since it was given to me for review. Finally I just decided life is too short and there are too many other books out there for me to read to waste my time with one that just wasn't grabbing my attention.

The concept isn't new (see the Westminster Confession) but is well worth remembering. We are supposed to enjoy being christians and to take joy in what God likes.The problem with Desiring God is that it is not well written. There are several problems. First, Piper seems to have transcribed sermons and turned them into chapters. This never reads well. Second, there are many awkward similies/illustrations that distract rather than illuminate. Third, Piper runs out of topic fairly early in each chapter, but the chapters chug onward anyway. Finally, the phrase \\"Christian Hedonist\\" appears so frequently that I began to wonder if he had trademarked it and was coming out with a line of clothing.An editor could have helped immeasurably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This book will challenge your thinking and change the way you view God, the church and other things that grow mundane in the normal Christian life.

For someone who has gotten really tired of multi-part stories this story is a breath of fresh air.On to the actual book. This story features three main characters, four if you count Dace.

I took it to Verizon, as I thought it was a new battery, and therefore something was wrong with my phone and they informed me that not only was the battery warped, but the sticker that lets you know if there is water damgae was taken off. DON'T BUY THIS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE ! ! !","review":"Amazon's Cell Phone Department is selling used accessories for your cell phone. So if you're hoping to get a new battery because yours is wearing thin, good luck. Take my advice. If you do order cell phone accessories from Amazom, call the Cell Phone Department directly. Tell the sales person exactly what you want. A new battery will have no markings on the brass connectors. Tell the sales person, that if you feel the product has been used or tampered with in any way, you'll send it back. Sales should tell you they'll make a note on your order.The second battery I received was in better shape than the first,but it was still used. Good luck again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I got a great deal but the battery was previously used!","review":"I was shocked when I opened the package to see that the battery looked like it had been sitting in the bottom of someone's purse for a year. It was dirty, with sticky little spots all over it. When I put it in my phone, it only had a 50% charge. I was desperate for a new battery because mine would not hold a charge at all, but there was no way I was going to settle for this used and dirty battery.I was really disappointed with Amazon on this purchase. They should not be selling used merchandise that is advertised as new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I purchased this battery after reading both the positive and negative reviews. Some are happy with the battery, and others are not. I'm one of those who are unhappy with the purchase. The performance of the battery was about the same as my old battery or even worse. I ordered it through the seller with the highest feedback rating so shipping was fast, but unfortunately the product was not good. It's silly to worry about the performance of the battery which is supposed to be new. My battery died in 10 minutes or so with the purchased battery when I talked on the phone. I went to a local VerizonWireless store and purchased a new one, and it's great.

The contacts on all of them showed much heavier use than my old batteries. I did not even bother to open any of the bags, and sent a request for an RGA via e-mail to the OEM shop. To their credit, they did issue the RGA without question, and I did finally receive credit in a few weeks. It cost me six bucks to send them back via USPS.

The curious thing is that after the second incident, I checked for the item on Amazon and could find no reference whatsoever, when previously they had listed several vendors. I suspect they delisted the item after so many poor customer reviews. The advertised low prices for these batteries turned out to be a scam; if you're interested in a reliable, long-life battery just go to the cell phone store and pay the price, as stiff as it might seem.

Only had it 3 1/2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"After this pump arrived I deflated one of my tires down to 9psi as I do for running in sand. While reinflating the tire back to 50psi the housing around the fuse began smoking. After a closer look I noticed that no only was it smoking but the wires running into the fuse were melting. It looks great and is packaged well but unfortunately the cable is not of the proper gauge to handle the amperage required by the pump. Also, the fuse should burn out long before the cable begins melting. Huge design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught FIRE.","review":"I was extremely impressed with the compressor when I bought it. I used it twice and was very happy. On the third use, I noticed a strange smell. I then realized that the part of the power cord where the fuse is (where it's supposed to blow the fuse instead of allowing an electrical problem) was on fire. Fortunately the problem happened in my driveway, not out on the trail. Being stranded by bad equipment is the WORST.The cord is melted through and unless I find a way to take the unit apart to replace the cord, the compressor is completely useless.Very disappointing.

Each part of the bag is a bit tight. The first time I went to use the compressor, it was for my trailer wheels which were loaded.

I had to go to a service station to get the air pressure up, using one of those automated $1.00 /3 minutes compressors. Disappointing.

First used it this past July (after airing down when stuck deep in the sand south of San Felipe) I got one tire (265/75/17) filled to 75psi and the unit's fuse blew. Replaced it but blew fuse again after filling second tire. Borrowed one last fuse from my truck fuse box and aired up a third tire and fuse blew again. Had to limp back to town with one tire at 25psi. I should mention that it was very HOT and in the middle of the day at our campsite on the Sea of Cortez, 100 degrees or so, but I did let the unit cool down after 12-15 minutes of use per the manual. Otherwise, the unit worked well on my stock E-rated tires.

In forty minutes this thing would melt to the ground from heat. Now it is totally useless to me. I have sent two emails to Q Industries, the company that represents this junk, from their own website and I have made two phone calls to them and left voice mails both times and I still haven't heard ANYTHING from them.

I do have 2 gripes about the product though. 1st is that you have to screw the hose onto the tire to fill it up and secondly the air filter case is cheap plastic. If the air filter threads were made of metal and you got the option of 2 ways to connect to the tire to fill up (one screw on and one that you just hold in place) I would give this product a 5 star rating.

The pump ran great for the first time I used it, however that was the only time it ran... The relay in the unit burnt up which rendered the switch useless.

At first I felt I needed one that plugged into the cigarette lighter, but then I found that the only ones that would not blow the fuse, weren't very powerful. I decided on the MV50 SuperFlow. Yeah, you have to clip it to your battery, but at least I know I'm not going to blow a fuse. It has it's own fuse in the power line, with spare incase you do blow it.

I changed the fuse, moved the clamps around... nothing worked. I have also emailed the company in the past with no response.

When I go off road I air them down to about 17 psi. The big deal is getting them back up to the road pressure of 45psi. The MV50 does this without overheating and relatively fast. Four tires from 17-45 takes about 20 minutes. That's pretty good considering the amount of volume need to do this. I also aired up a friends trailer tire from 25 psi to 70 psi. That only took a few minutes. I have had several 12V Air Compressors before the MV50 and they all overheated and died. The MV50 is a true bargain that lives up to what it says it can do without overheating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheice of Pit","review":"This thing inflated one half of a tire and then stopped blowing air.

I usually use a jumper pack to power the pump. It does get hot, but it keeps going.After a few years, the yellow plastic coil hose basically disintegrated.

There's so much too this game .Its is one of the cutest games I have ever seen and has beautiful graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive Family Fun","review":"I am 22 years old, I liked Animal Crossing, although I got bored with it, and if anyone who has played it knows, I always changed the time because I got impatient. I had a Wii for awhile and I loved playing the game \\"The Sims\\" but recently got rid of my Wii, so I got this game hoping that it would be similar. I really love this game!I love that its not too hard to get achievements, it doesn't discourage you. Time goes by soo fast, I have found myself playing this game for 5 hours straight. My boyfriend (who is 28, and in law school) will be on the computer and I see him staring at the screen while I am playing, and asking me about the different pinatas, and about my garden. I also love the freedom it gives you - its your garden to do whatever you want with it. Sure, you want to have a couple pinata houses, and stuff for them, but other then that its all you.Gotta go play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is and is not a kiddy game","review":"I was a little concerned this would be too young but when it arrived, my kids weren't home so I tried it myself. At first my fears were realized, as it has a very young feel to it, but once I started working on my garden I really enjoyed it and played for hours. My kids arrived home and soon each had created their own garden. They will play for ages. The graphics are very good and the effects - like a drop of water on the camera lens are really cute. There is skill in keeping a good garden, free of pests and the kids learn they have to work to attract exotic pinatas to their garden. I gave it a 4 because I am now a little bored with it myself and for a 5 it would have to keep me entertained too [smile] but since the kids still love it, it is well worth the $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of Fun","review":"This is one of my all time favorite games!

Really repetitive, and I know people have said that it's better than animal crossing because Animal crossing was so repetitive, but at least there was strategy and a storyline. This is more like.. plant stuff, get your pinatas to hook up, build a house, plant stuff, get your pinatas to hook up, build a house.I really want to like it, and I really hope I'm missing something and it's going to miraculously get better as I go along but I don't know how much more I can take."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is awesome!","review":"Viva Pinata is so cool!

I sure loved it on Christmas morning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid, unique game everyone should try.","review":"Though it may seem like a kiddy game, everyone with an Xbox 360 should try this game.

Overall, the game is fun and looks great, but does get repetitive after awhile, much like any game for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuous enjoyment for the family","review":"All of my family members love this game, it offers a continuing environment of change and entertainment. Even company that comes over seem to want to try it out and end up loving it too. We also sit and watch each other expand our green thumbs in Viva Pinata as well.There is lots do do in this game, and learning involved as well. Because you have to consider chocolate coins as your currency math is involved. As well as many other aspects of learning it is simply fun. Try it out.We highly reccommend this game to all families.

I even said if it was 2 player it would be the best game ever. The one thing that made me stop playing was... well nothing really. Yea the doctor got stuck on nothing and all my Pinatas died and I quit playing the game. Another one also got stuck and it died and it could not be removed so I would have had a dead pinata there for the rest of the game. I would have been really good but no. My sister also had this stuck problem too. It ruined the game it would have been 5 stars.

Interiors like these are for the most part unliveable, both because they are very limited in elements (60's or industrial, and some ethnics and florals) and unpractical.

But much to my surprise and chagrin, there is very little of Bonhoeffer in the book. Each day begins with a tiny snippet of Bonhoeffer's writing, followed by considerably more content from the compiler, Charles Ringma. Many days, the book includes literally only one sentence from Bonhoeffer. Though Ringma's thoughts were fine, they did not challenge and provoke me as Bonhoeffer does. And I didn't buy this book to hear from Charles Ringma. I wanted to hear from Dietrich Bonhoeffer. So, after a few months, I put down the book and do not plan to finish it. If you're looking for a substantive daily devotional from the pen of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, you'll have to keep looking, as his place in this one is far too limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"brief yet compelling","review":"I'm currently reading the biography, 'Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy' by Eric Metaxas (a great read) and have enjoyed Bonhoeffer's writing for some time. I spotted this devotional title a few months ago and purchased it to use along with daily Bible reading. It is a wonderful book. It's perfect for those days that are so full of daily duties that they leave little room for reflective reading. Though each daily portion is short, the combination of insights from both authors is thought provoking and powerful. As another reviewer stated, I'm often amazed at how pertinent to certain situations in my life these readings have been. If you are a fan of Bonhoeffer and enjoy being able to read this type of devotional book, I highly recommend it. This will give you a desire to learn more about this gifted man, and to delve deeper into his wonderful writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seize the Day (with Dietrich Bonhoeffer)","review":"Bonhoeffer is one of my heroes. His own life story is remarkable and a testament to what one person can do in the world with faith and words. This is a very small devotional book. There is a quote from one of his books on each page and then a paragraph embellishing it by the author/editor. I would think it would drive one to want to read more of what Bonhoeffer wrote and to read his life story if one wasn't familiar with him. It's a nice addition to my daily devotional reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Horror Film of All Time","review":"I was wondering through my watch instantly Netflix and this was in my Recommadations for you and I watched this and I was in disbelief how bad this film was. In the first two minutes this film seemed like it sucked. By the info on Netflix it seemed like a rip off of The Thing in the woods. I gave this a try because I am a big fan of The Thing rip offs as I am a big fan of Proteus(1995) and Leviathan(1989). I can go off how bad this film is but I can go on for hours. Just the way the demon changes body by just touching them on the arm which is ridiculous.The acting is plain bad and the way the movie begins it is just bad. I found it a miracle that they did not release this on DVD so nobody can waste their money on this piece of trash.Avoid, Avoid, what ever you do Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"Netflix put this as an almost 5 star taste preference for me based on other reviews I'd made. Unlike the other reviewers I did not turn off the movie, but watched the whole thing thinking that it had to get better. There was no development of the storyline. Acting was terrible. The movie was terrible. On second thought I don't even know that there actually was a storyline to follow other than \\"hey let's go into the woods to get drugs\\". The people were from LA, I think they could probably find the drugs they wanted there and avoided this 1 hour and 22 minute waste of film.

It is very uncommon for all the reviews to agree completely, as is the case about this movie.I am doing something unprecedented and not watching this one.

I'm disappointed because the lesson plans are for the very young. I teach 2nd through 6th graders computer skills and I find almost all of these projects too easy/young for the students. This is probably best for Kingergarten through 2nd grade only. Also, almost all of the projects require drawing software or Kid Pix. I only found about 6 projects that didn't use drawing software and 2 required greeting card software and 1 required calendar creating software. There were only about 2 that used word processing, and they were very simple. There isn't a variety of \\"everyday\\" programs used like I've seen in other Teacher Created books.

We are using it to this day, but since we use thicker paper, we can only feed about 10 pages at a time. If you don't keep a hand on the pages, the small centered roller usually pulls the paper in at an angle and makes a bad fold. Sometimes it pulls multiple pages in and jams. About a year and a half ago the rubber roller started to spin freely, which made the machine unable to pull paper in from the tray. My fix was to epoxy the roller to the metal bar. This machine is a piece of junk and we are currently looking to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desktop disappointment","review":"We are a dental business that has owned this paper folder since August of 2006. We have never been able to feed more than 10 sheets at a time (unlike the advertised 50) and most of the ones we do send through get wrinkled or do not get folded properly. Also, the tray to catch the papers just tosses them on the floor and they end up in bunches not separated. When I called tech support for the product I was told it wasn't designed to catch the papers and keep them in the tray (what do they think we want to do with them???). Even on the phone with tech support I it did not work properly and I was told it is just finicky."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work properly","review":"bought this for a mailing of apx 1000 pieces... it seems to fold the first 7-8 sheets of a stack correctly, but then starts to jam up and folds the other sheets incorrectly, somewhat crooked. i can't rely on loading 8 sheets at a time, so i'm going to be returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of folding!","review":"For the price, it is a good machine.

I like it and you will too if you like a bit of a challenge. I will see about posting a video on assembly. that should help since the instruction got ate by the dog where ever this is manufactured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except for the order","review":"Despite reading all the negative reviews, I decided to purchase this unit. I am pleased to report that it works great. As others mentioned, it needs to be properly adjusted! Using 28lbs paper I have absolutely no issues with folding, creasing, etc and I can feed many pages at a time.The only issue I have encountered is that it makes a mess in the output tray. I wouldn't even bother to mention it, but ideally my mailing needs to remain in order to facilitate stuffing the envelopes.

Does she beg for juice from her favorite flower?\\" All of these excuses to put off settling down for the night will probably sound familiar to many young ones.Renee Graef, the illustrator of over 50 children's books, artfully depicts the loving interplay between small desert animals and their parents when night falls. The illustrations are full-page, both colorful and tranquil enough to close a few small eyes.- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice story, but essentially copied","review":"My kids and I enjoy reading this book before bedtime. It's a soothing story that teaches them what they shouldn't do when Papa and Mama tell them it's time for bed, concluding with what they should do.

Three things struck me immediately. I love the bedtime story itself. It is perfectly soothing as all bedtime stories should be, yet it carries with it a subtle but vital message simultaneously celebrating individual differences. Second, the art is utterly charming and just as lovely and gentlly evocative as works by past masters such as Thatcher Hurd and Abe Birnbaum, especially the cover that incorporates all the characters in one glorious panorama. Finally, BEDTIME IN THE SOUTHWEST will be great for inquisitive and gifted little ones who will want to find nonfiction books and ask their parents questions about the individual species such as the quail and the roadrunner or the coyote and their particular traits that are featured in the goodnight scenarios.

There's some decent Uschi action in Below the Belt, too, but it happens early in the film. The rest of Below the Belt is OK, but it doesn't have the charm of The Godson, in my opinion.There's also an extra that shows Uschi Digard about as up close and personal as you could hope for set to cha cha music, if the movies don't satisfy your appetite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Lies","review":"I have a very similar cultural background to the author's. I also came from Japan twenty some years ago as a high school student. I feel a certain amount of empathy toward her because of my bicultural/bilingual background, but I really don't like the way she describes Japanese culture. It's too stereotypical and generalized. If you want to know anything about Japan, I would recommend \\"Turning Japanese\\" by David Mura. Although he is the third generation Japanese American, his views on Japan are fairer and contrary to Mori,he is very honest to himself.(I don't find Mori being honest when she claims she doesn't know how to write in Japanese after going through Japanese educational system for twelve years...which school did she attend in Japan? She lost her credibility just by saying this!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"the half-empty glass","review":"\\"Polite Lies\\" wanders back and forth between kvetching and bellyaching. Complaints stain nearly every page. When Kyoko Mori was married, she objected to people asking about the color of her living room. She explains that she and her husband wanted to do as little decorating as possible. Then on the next page she is complaining about \\"our mismatched furniture\\" and \\"how bad our furniture was\\". A full review could provide endless examples of grouchiness expressed in well-turned phrases.Mori's insistence on painting herself as a malcontent overwhelms her otherwise valuable insights as a resident and traveler in two cultures. And when Mori offers comments on literature, the book seems to begin breathing fresh air.Mori writes that as a child she was a picky eater. The tragedy is that this habit expanded until it drove nearly every aspect of her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an old story to me.","review":"I am 24years old Japanese. This book was pretty interesting to me when I saw it at the bookstore by accident because I moved to california from Japan a couple of years ago.While I was reading the book, I was kinda confused because almost everything what she wrote about Japanese culture seemed like old stuff to me. I don't want people who read this book to believe everything. In my opinion, she exaggerated the fact too much(I'm not saying about her family, but Japanese culture).She hasn't live in Japan for twenty years, so she doesn't know well what's going on in Japan NOW. People and Culture have changed a lot. She wrote the old facts about Japanese culture as if those are going on right now. She just lived in old Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very negative generalization of Japanese","review":"Expressing a personal viewpoint based on her own negative experience is OK in her book. She is entitled to do that. But she should not generalize that the Japanese are this way and that way, unless she conducted a thorough study. I couldn't feel any warmth from her as a person, to be honest. I just feel sorry for her that one can hate where he/she comes from this much. This reflects her personality and not the Japanese. I don't think this book has anything to do with \\"being a woman caught between cultures.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-crafted, but nonsense hate speech","review":"Although some of the metaphors she presented were impressive, I was really annoyed by the wrongly described Japanese culture by her. Because of the tragic events in her life in Japan, she can never observe the culture of her native country fairly. Since she hates lies, as she persistently repeats, the events and the people in the book must have been true. But I want to tell all the American readers that they were true only to this unfortunate woman. All she writes is from the tiny society she used to be in twenty+ years ago. She seems to be a rational person, but I wonder why she easily generalizes about Japan from her own personal experiences. It is unfair to criticize Japanese toward American audience, who rarely has ideas about it, except the stereotypes. As she ran away from Japan, she still doesn't confront her origin. The whole book is like a dog whining. I'm deeply sorry that she wasted her talent to write such a piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, a bit angry at Japan in the beginning.","review":"A book that should be read by every business person that ever has dealings with Japan and Japanese. The book (at least in the beginning) gives an accurate description of the pyrimid like quality of the Japanese language and Japanese customs. It conveys a sense of the Japanese high regard for formalities and their need to be addressed by title and rank. It is as if they are from another century. The book is actually an autobiography of Ms. Mori's life. I got the feeling she has a very hard side to her. Anyway, great book especially its conveyance of the Japanese culture to the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed","review":"I think the major flaw in Ms. Mori's book is that she is writing about a Japanese society that she is no longer part of. Imagine the gall of an American writer, who lived abroad for 20 years, trying to tell us all about American society.She makes statments that assume that Japan has remained frozen in time since she left.She also climbs a slippery slope. It is not that she is comparing apples to oranges, she is comparing apples still on the tree to 20 year old rotten oranges."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get past her negativity","review":"I just read the title at the library and picked it up, thinking it would be interesting to get her perspective. I grew up in the midwest and am now living in Japan. However, after reading the first chapter and the first page of the second chapter, I couldn't go on. She comes across as a strongly negative person who can find something to complain about everyone and everything. As other reviewers said, it's clear she hasn't gotten over her mother's death and distant relationships in childhood. With all the other books out there, I didn't want to waste time reading about one woman's baggage disguised as cultural commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japan exposed","review":"As a half-Japanese raised in the Midwest by an old-fashioned Japanese mother born and raised near Tokyo, I could really relate to much of this book. Mori's personal story and her eye-opening revelations of traditional Japanese culture vs general American culture are fascinating, however she did lose me a bit in her comparisons with the Midwest which I did not fully buy into. Others may argue that Mori discloses the \\"old\\" Japan, but there are plenty of books out there trying to teach Americans how to negotiate the Japanese social terrain which is extremely complex and still quite traditional and conservative. Mori is an unusually independent and practical woman, so much so that she discovers marriage even to a good man who gives her space is too constricting. It seems her own childhood experiences have thrust her into the extreme. I hope she finds happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"The extinct Japanese observed by a Lady Rip Van Winkle","review":"The cover design well matches the text.Very stereotypical. The Japanese,especially women, appear in the book have almost died out. It is extremely difficult to find a young lady who is a ribbon or lace wearer. The teenage magazines are full of sex, sex, sex. The ideal woman is a quiet wife?? Only the most conservative man's dream. The housewives no more stay at the dark kitchen, instead go out for the \\"gourmet tour\\" or study at those culture centers. The left behind is a poor husband. The Japanese society has changed a lot since the author left for the US. It is no wonder to find the context rather out-of-date, although I do admit the following sentence:\\"The system works well for people who feel no desire to rebel\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An English mystery without any gore","review":"If you like Miss Marple you will enjoy this mystery .Dorothy Martin is an almost 70 year old American who has married a retired British police constable.In this book, she gets involved with a very strict fundamentalist church.

Why can't people just accept him for what he was; a colorful character with a brilliant philosophical outlook on life. Much can be gained by reading his views, but to make a religion out of it is the greatest trick he ever pulled off."},{"rating":"1","title":"&#65533;secret life&#65533; lacks secret spark","review":"To my disappointment, I did not find this book all that exciting. I muddled through it at a snail's pace. There isn't really any material presented here that is shocking or invigorating or interesting for that matter.

With it's more thorough deliniation of Satanic creed \\"The Secret Life...\\" gives it's readers a deeper understanding of not only the the religion, but why it was created and why it's so necessary in today's society.Anton LaVey was a dangerous thinker, and few books dare to tred as close to him as this highly detailed biography.

Having been influenced by Anton LaVey's teachings for years now,I think this book is a good tribute to the man and his usually-misunderstood work.

Blanche Barton wrote an entertaining piece of factoid in this book--trouble is, most of it ain't necessarily so. The real Lavey (Levey) has been deflated by revelations from his own daughter Zeena, and confirmed by a variety of sources.

Naipaul speaks at length about growing up in Trinidad, and of the people he encounters. He speaks about his education. He also speaks about his father's short stories. Reading this book gives one a good sense of what led Naipaul to his first novels, as well as what led him to his later ones. The somewhat puzzling ending wraps up the writer's pessimism re: the future of the novel, which I found disingenuous. It's both unconvincing and the ultimate ingratitude to the form that won him the Nobel Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are others that work better","review":"There are other peelers that work better...especially the part that is supposed to make the initial cuts into the skin.

MONTANA was one of Errol Flynn's last Hollywood films. He would make his last Western for Warner Bros. that same year ROCKY MOUNTAIN, based on a little known Civil War incident and one of my favorite Flynn films. In MONTANA Flynn is a sheepman who invades cattle country in Montana controlled by cattle ranchers Alexis Smith and Douglas Kennedy. Under Ray Enright's direction and under James R. Webb, Borden Chase and Charles O'Neal's scripting it has a feel of the empire building era that was prevalent in numerous Westerns. Flynn is smooth as usual but the film's greatest asset is the colour Cinematography by Karl Freund (Academy Award Winner for THE GOOD EARTH). Composer David Buttolph (THE HORSE SOLDIERS) provided the score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Montana with Errol Flynn","review":"Flynn is good as sheepherder in confrontation with cattle ranchers in the old West.

The book had a surprisingly good human element to it what with the examination of how the narrator's ability to stop time, and his activities during said time, affect himself and his relationships with others. He delves into the characters seemingly repressed sexuality in his fantasies and his escapades during his \\"time-freezes\\" without dipping into total sleaze and crappy \\"porno\\" writing (except when it was supposed to be written that way, a la the narrators \\"porn\\" story he recounts).

He does this in two ways. First, Baker's linguistic pyrotechnics make it difficult to remember at certain points that one is reading what most conservatives would consider smut.Secondly, at the end of a selfish and antihumanist plot, the ending is both humanistically poignant and stylistically magnificent. The loss of Fermata powers come at the only moment of true human contact, at the only point where love enters and lust departs. As for the the stylistic magnificence, I will leave that for the reader to discover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Idea Wasted, Forget About It","review":"The other 1-star reviewers are right: this book is a HUGE disappointment. I got both so bored and disgusted, I couldn't even finish it. The idea of being able to stop time is wonderful and exciting, but this author does absolutely nothing with it but masturbate. On top of it, it's very sexist, even though he tries to argue that he really isn't all that bad. He is. What a sick mind!

Thank-you Nicholson Baker for writing so literary a piece of erotica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, but it's very good pornography","review":"Baker has taken a popular adolescent fantasy and given it a first rate treatment.

Perhaps the most gratifying thing about the novel is its eagerness to mix the highbrow (technique, language), and the lowbrow (pornographic subject matter), herein resembling Nabokov's Lolita. The Fermata is a tour de force of comic execution, displaying a rare shrewdness and tenderness. Baker's use of language is simply astonishing: the musicality of his prose is particularly delightful. A hugely gifted stylist, Baker is a writer who has an almost magical ability--he enchants and charms like no other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"Any male conscious of his daydreams realizes that he has many fleeting erotic desires, harmless save for stigmaticism and inpracticality of fulfillment.

The ethics and value of aesthetic fulfilment are explored in a very entertaining and comprehensive manner in this novel. It makes for an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I bought this book based on the recommendations and reviews I read at Amazon. A first for me. I thought the central idea of someone being able to stop time was fascinating, and I thought the focus on sex was inevitable, and potentially amusing, so I bought it.Big mistake. The author displays an enviable vocabulary, and rather a lot about his sexual predilictions. In my opinion the central idea is completely wasted on this narcissistic and aimless novel. I didn't care about the central character, and after reading 2/3 of the book, I lost hope that anything interesting was going to happen.I think the author has talent, certain passages reminded me of Iain banks, but he needs to be more selfless and disciplined in plot development to produce a novel to capture my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unabashedly honest about everyones imagination","review":"I have read and reread this.

I also had had a bad experience with camp, and it was reassuring to know I wasn't the only one who would rather be at home reading a book than in a camp full of snotty girls who were always mean to me.

While trying to settle in, Kate and Kammy's father sent Kammy to Camp Arrowhead where she faced many challenges such as bad food, finding distant bathrooms, and a very mean camper. Realistic fiction is my favorite genre, especially when the main character's life is filled with drama and struggle.

It also assumes the reader has not made up her mind about the benefits of staying at home with children and needs to be convinced.The author finally gets into vague tips on saving money and working at home, but nothing unique.

I am surprised I even managed to make this much out as it is so badly written little sense can be made from every single page.No plot or story really kicked in at all. If you have read the 'When Will You Rage' book you will be able to understand how good short stories with likeable characters work. None of that is present here. It's simply an absolute mess. I was considering reading the rest of the books in this series but now I will really have to reconsider if this is the going to be the typical standard.If you like this franchise then read 'The Silver Crown' or 'Breathe Deeply' for cool Rage stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Realistic Look at Capitalism","review":"Craig Gay takes a look at modern capitalism from a Christian perspective in Cash Values.

It also has a very wide grip handle with a soft, non-slip covering. This desktop punch is quite sturdy, which was a surprise given the relatively low price. There is a slide lock on the lever handle so the handle isn't sticking up that makes it much easier to store on the shelves of my desktop hutch. Finally, it has consistently punched holes through all of my papers, unlike some of my previous hole punches that required me to repunch some of the papers due to the cut not going all the way through the first time.I am very happy with this purchase and definitely recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great punch","review":"This was purchased as a replacement for a similar item that had been used for several years and many piles of paper. I could have just replaced one of the die assemblies that was having some difficulties, but purchasing a whole new punch was only slightly more expensive than just buying a replacment die.

No big issue, and at least I cannot lose it I suppose.In short... essential accessory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever wished you hadn't spent your money...","review":"The resaon I purchased this sport case is because it was an Apple product. My thoughts were that is I was going to dive into the ipod experience I should invest in a quality case to protect it. I'm sure that most people would think the way I do. I read the reviews and felt that even though it was a little pricey I would go ahead. This product is not a good one for the price. Mine broke, specifically, the plastic slider on the side that locks the shuffle in. I know what your thinking... she abused the product but I swear I did not. I loathe returning things but, darn it, this is ridiculous. Avoid this one and go for something less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for what it is....","review":"One of the bad things about the Shuffle is that you really have to spend the extra money for some kind of case to protect the fragile instrument. However, this sport case is NOT the answer! The price is so high compared to other similar products that do the job just as well. I ended up getting a really nice red silicone case from a store in CA, and at under half the cost of one of these sport cases. Apple tends to make their money on the accessories that go with the products, not the products themselves. Before you spend your hard earned money on this, you should look around in stores and on the Net for other deals on better products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, protected but a little heavier","review":"The Ipod shuffle becomes protected, looks very nice and all people do look at it because of the orange finishing of strap and case.

Please note: Apple WILL NOT stand behind their warranty when purchased from Amazon (or any third party reseller).The case gets 2 stars because it had merits.

The lid is not a \\"flip-up\\" like most, it screws on, which I guess is nice if you are walking around with a coffeepot in your hands, but who does that.

Nothing at all about this film is shocking or disturbing; remotely comical perhaps, but certainly not worthy of having a reputation. The acting and the dialog was some of the worst I have ever seen.

The replacement unit was a refurbished unit which seemed to have some damage on the bottom. But it worked fine, until it failed almost exactly one year later, too late to be covered under the warranty!I liked the looks of the unit, and the digital readout is a real boon--if nothing else, it helps to tell you when the unit stops working. :-)But I don't think the headache, and the hours I spent on the phone, are worth it.

The sound from these guys is pretty decent, especially for the price.

Sounds like a mini-explosion. 2) There is a continous low level \\"hum\\" that is perfectly annoying, especially if no music is playing. I've done lots of testing and it has nothing to do with my computer or soundcard as both issues exist if the computer is turned off or even if the X-120's are in a completely different room and not plugged into any audio device. It's too bad, because the sound is otherwise pretty good. I'm returning these and buying JBL Creature II's instead.

However, regardless of the volume setting, there is a residual hum which only stops when you turn off the power.

If you watch this expecting a fancy Hollywood movie, or even a well made plot - sure, you will be disappointed as other reveiwers have made quite clear.BUT!! Fans of Cradle of Filth will obviously see this just because Dani Filth is in it (I'll admit thats the only reason I heard of it). But also if you just want to watch mindless mayhem with no remorse, this along with the Guinea Pig Series are about the best recent choices to see.The movie plays out in kind of a \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" way. There are four short unassociated stories that form the movie.So if you want to see Dani Filth in a movie, If you want to see alot of mindless violence, or just something different - I would certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire","review":"I used to work at Blockbuster video and rented this based purely upon the fact it was a horror film and it had a pretty funky cover. The movie is the least scary horror film I've ever seen, the filming is utterly apalling, the acting dire and the effects more pitiful than a student film. What about the plot? What bloody plot? It's a series of random stories that they tried to splatter with as much gore as possible. And not even convincing gore.The two computer generated effects used in the film look ... there's absolutely no suspense. I even had to fast forward through a fair wack of it. I've noticed people on here saying the effects were excellent... what film were you watching? Take that scene where the car shoots across the road, it looks like the introduction to Eurotrash. And there's a really awful looking puppet in there.This is seriously, the ONLY film I have ever recommended someone not to rent throughout my time working as a video store clerk.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle of Junk!","review":"I'm a big fan of horror movies and there isn't much I haven't seen. But folks this movie is absolutely horrible. This movie has no point,no plot and just plain bad acting from start to finish. It is about 2 hours long I turned this garbage off in less than an hour. The cheap attempt at a gore fest is just awful to the point of not even being funny anymore. This movie is not scary,the gore is ridiculously stupid and these wannabe actors will make you sick with the terrible attempt at acting they do in this. I like COF and Dani Filth but he should stick to his day job. I have seen really bad B movies called horror but this out does them all. Don't waste money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No where near worth the price. Should be, like, $5 on DVD!","review":"OK, I don't hate Cradle of Filth, so I thought it would be cool to see Dani Filth in a horror movie. I knew it would be cheesy! That was no surprise. The story line had some potential, but the movie was executed so incredibly poor that the movie is just rubbish. Sorry lads, better luck next time. Dani wasn't even that bad, the movie was just terrible. Some of the actors were laughable in their performance! However, the girls are all really hot and have nice....FEATURES, I'll say! ^_^ Also, the DVD might actually be (somewhat) worth buying if it was priced at, say, $5?! Anyway, hopefully Dani will choose a better movie to be in, if he ever does one again. Apologies to all those who want this movie to be good (I know I did), but \\"sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes, well....it eats you!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Dani can act...","review":"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much out of this film, but I got it just because it featured Count Filth as an actor, and I knew that at least would be entertaining in itself. Well, Dani should do more horror films. He's good at killing people, and as you'll see in one part, eating cat innards (take that, ASPCA!!!). It's lots of blood and guts, and the storyline takes some time to make sense of, but if you're a fan of Cradle of Filth or you love bloody movies, then you should watch this. The snuff addict is really funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick 'N Twisted","review":"Cradle of Fear is a movie of its own. It may not be shot on film but the movie itself makes up for it. Alex spat down a great story that has plenty of twists and turns followed by huge blasts of crimson and body parts. The movie basically is told by the sick and metally twisted Kemper, a child murderer and eater (You can see him in Cradle Of Filth's \\"Her Ghost In The Fog\\" video) and how he uses his demonic friend the Man (Non-Other than Dani Davey/Filth himself) to get back on those related to and those who acturally had him incarcirated to a padded room in a huge insane asylum. Chopped full of gore and skin to satisfy even those who crave old 80s horror films."},{"rating":"2","title":"for cof die hard fans","review":"several things about this movie...if you are not a die hard cof, fan there's a good chance you wont like this.

There is nothing in there any one would want to know, even for the beginner.If you are looking for practical rituals in sex magick, there is none in this book.Almost all are fills with ripped off pictures and drawings from other books. The rest are quotes and excerpts from other writers.About 30 pages list movies and books deal with sex in occults(mostly from the 70s). And there are about 100 pages lists about the old superstitions. Examples: superstition about Sunshine, superstition about Teeth and Toes, superstition about Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on....All pointless, and HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH SEX.I buy and collect new age/occult/magic books.

The book contains several photos of beautiful outfits, with no details on how to make them or even where to buy the pattern! Not worth the money or the effort to read, in my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice pictures, no instruction","review":"This book was nice to look at, but aside from some accessories, there were no instructions other than to use a favorite pattern.

I'm a fan of made for tv 70's scary movies, and love movies that have things that go bump in the night, or hauntings, or scary old houses. This movie was basically more psychological, and not scary at all. The so-called surprise ending was not developed enough to make sense. The directing was poor, and all in all, I'm so frustrated that I spent money on this film. It's priced at only 4.99 now, so that may be worth it, if the shipping is free. It's cheaper than renting it, but you'll probobly never want to watch it again, so why own it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"another music teacher","review":"I agree with the reviewer that said that these DVD are great for elementary music classes.

It keeps the students attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than One Star","review":"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I love sci-fi and have been a fan of Henriksen from Aliens and through projects like Millenium. When I saw this on sale for $5, I picked it up - expecting a bargain. I have to honestly say I would have felt bad getting it for free. Definately a B-movie, but that doesn't necessarily guarantee a bad movie. Horrible plot with a script to match, over the top acting, especially from the two \\"gunners\\". Just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEND IN THE WHITEYS!","review":"ANTIBODY is definitely a mediocre ripoff of FANTASTIC VOYAGE, and what merits it has rests purely on some minor individual achievements. First, William Zabka, long known villain of all his movies, dons a German accent, and plays a good guy who actually saves the day! Lance Henricksen also plays a good guy, but one who seems desperately in need of Geritol. And poor Robin Givens looks like a snow cone with that hairdo, and looks like she was in need of Ex-Lax.The effects are pretty dismal, and although it maintained my interest, it's certainly not a film I would recommend you buy, but might rent when you're in the mood for a trip through the body!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent me!","review":"An awful European remake of the classic \\"Fantastic Voyage\\". The story has been modernized to a terrorist with a nuclear bomb detonator implanted in his head instead of a cold war era scientist with top-secret information, but otherwise the story is the same. The acting by Lance Henriksen and Robin Givens is good, the rest of the cast just don't come across as believable. The special effects are reasonably good CGI. Although the giant skin mite swimming through the bloodstream is just a bit too far out there for me.My suggestion is to rent Antibody and Fantastic Voyage and do a double feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will sell for free :-)","review":"My trail of bad movies continues with this sucker! I can challenge the director that I can do better CGI than what they cobbled together for this movie.

This book scared the pants off of me, and kept us on our path of interest and discovery. While the methods described are well researched and planned, they seem only appropriate for extreme cases and difficult children. The repeated practicing is belittling and demoralizing for children and unnecessary if your child is truely ready and given no indication of learning difficulties. Bribery and candy play as much a role in this method as the parents, encouragement and the child's self-esteem. Children aren't expected to learn to walk, talk, eat with siverware or anything else in one day, why toilet training?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book 15 years ago!!!","review":"I read this book 15 years ago and trained my two daughters, one of which has special needs.

I was looking forward to trying this method, but I absolutely will not use this method. \\"Bad\\"? Give me a break!(By the way - the book was written in 1974). I wish I had known that before I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately worth reading!","review":"It took more than a day, but, the method worked better than anything else that we tried. Our daughter, who is now 2 years old, had to be toilet trained fully in order to get into pre-school. We ran out and bought this book as the start date came closer. After a few weeks she was trained - as in - no training pants, no pull ups, goes herself without help from any adult. While it wasn't quite this miracle cure that the book's cover said it would be... I am certain that it was what made the difference in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I swear this set us back a year in potty training. at the time it didn't seem too much but now.... don't bother, they will let you know when they are ready. and it takes more than a day.

As far as he was concerned, there was no reason to use the potty - it was just a bother. As far as I was concerned, I had to get him potty trained so he could start preschool. Plus changing him was eating up valuable family time.Then I came across this book. This wonderful book. By taking the child's perspective into account, the author provides step by step instructions that leverages a child's natural motivations and learning styles. AND IT WORKS!! Not only does it work, but my child and I both loved every second of it. He, my child, still talks about the practice runs and how much fun he had with all the aspects of the program.Anyone that believes in the Montessori Method will absolutely LOVE the author's approach to potty training."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for me!","review":"I bought this based on the number of positive reviews. After reading the book several times, I was prepared to make the attempt.My son and I spent 3 hours in the bathroom working, and at the end, he was essentially potty trained! We tought the doll how to use the potty, we practiced and eventually had success. He was definitely ready for the attempt. He has had several accidents, but each time was upset that he had not made it to the bathroom in time. Him, not me.The book itself is trapped in the 80's - based on the mother doing the training (I'm the dad), but if you can overlook the writing style, you will glean some good points, and a system.I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I decided if I was going to tackle potty training I might as well tackle it in a day. It seemed to work for my 3 year old boy. I didn't do the potty doll though. I just worked with him. The first day was the loooongest day of my life. However the second day went smooth and I was amazed that he had actually gotten it!

Then you make the poor kid spend a whole day, or longer, just focusing on using the toilet, and cleaning up his/her own \\"accidents\\". I have a four year old and a two and a half year old who are both exclusively using the toilet (even through naps and night) and I never used a method like this one!

I felt it was very demeaning to him, all the practice runs to the potty just wore him out and frustrated him. And I felt horrible for putting him through it.

I tried it several times and felt like I was a failure and my child (who was well over 2 yrs.) was incapable of being potty trained. What a joke!! I waited another 6 months, and he did it by himself! BY HIMSELF! A week or so after that he no longer needed pull ups at night! Since then he has had a total of 5 accidents (daytime AND nighttime accidents combined) in over a year.

I am a stay at home Mom who has time to encourage toilet training and do not need to rush my child. I also feel that there is no reason to scold a child for wetting his/her pants while they are learning to use the toilet....that doesn't seem to be a great self-esteem builder. Learning to use the toilet should be a positive experience and accidents should be looked upon as such....accidents. I also was disappointed that nowhere in the training did the author stress the importance of washing the childs' hands after using the potty. That is just as important for a child to practice and perform as the act of going itself.

I was motivated and organized and very ready with a second child on the way. At the end of the second day I ended up with a very frustrated, unhappy, confused toddler who was strung out from all of the treats that they recommend giving them! This was my sister in law's experience as well. My son is a really easy kid, and when we did get him trained it was in a matter of a few days, and with no problems- and we used none of their methods. Other mothers I have talked to have had the same results as I have.

My 2 year old is stubborn, and has a short attention span ( like 2 year olds do). Started at 9am, and she hand it down before 1pm. She went straight from diapers to undressing, using the potty, wiping, and even empties it into the toilet. It's like magic. It is so great to see her so happy and proud of herself.

I tried other books and methods which were very vague. What I loved about this book are its step-by-step instructions that REALLY WORKED! Although it took more than one day, by day three, we were taking day trips and were having NO accidents in the car (though a few at home).I recommended this book to my best friend and sister for their kids. They waited until their children were 3 and had even more success with no accidents at all. There's a lot of prep work and you have to be a shut-in for a couple of days, but it's well worth it.

My mother used it with me & my sister in the 70's! She gave it to me with the doll for my sons 2nd birthday. I read it & did it a couple of days later. He had severe autism & still did it by 4pm that day. I potty trained my next child & she was 22months. Just recently I potty trained my 3rd child, 20months old & she did it without a hitch. Nothing cuter than seeing a baby running for the potty, pulling down her pants, going, emptying it herself & flushing. My only obligation after the first day of potty bootcamp is to jump up & down & give her a treat for her hard work.The first day is hard work, but well worth it & no negative standing around or shame involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for 3 year old boy","review":"I heard from several women that this worked for their girls so I tried it. It was a disaster for my son. He was too stressed by the focused attention, too focused on the treats and actually enjoyed the practice sessions that he was not suppose to enjoy. The four hours (the amount of time it was suppose to take him to learn) went like this: two hours of not peeing at all, one hour having two accidents and one hour of peeing (3 drops) every 30 seconds on the potty. After his nap, he never went again in the potty. He also would not poop for two days when he normally goes at least three times a day. The next day I put him back in diapers and he finally pooped in the evening and it obviously hurt him. The book makes it all too simple and doesn't address possible problems like stool witholding which happens to kids often. I read the book twice and know I did it right but it was not for us.

To try to learn a new method! The part that actually talks about this \\"less than a day\\" method took less than 2 minutes to read and in scant detail. I just think that if this is the method you want to advertise (and also want to advertise how easy it is the way they do) than you should probably clearly outline the steps in a specific chapter.

I don't agree with shaming a child who is struggling with potty-training. There are other suggestions in the book, like sitting your child on the potty for long periods of time, but when that doesn't work, you're supposed to tell your child that he is disgusting for having accidents.

Rehearsing 10 times what the child is supposed to do when she has an accident, after every accident?

She played with the potty doll they recommend you buy ,so the child can teach the doll then learn themselves. She told the doll to go potty, but wouldn't go herself, even after drinking all kinds of liquids and with hours of encouragement.

The potty baby was just another baby to her. She held herself the whole time she was on the potty and cried for a diaper.. She fit all the milestones and such but this didnt work for her.

If not, find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"HM, well OK","review":"Hm, I was definitely disappointed. This book is not well written. You have to make maticulous notes if you are going to catch the important stuff at all. Also it doesn't take into account the difference in babies personalities. It just lumps the difficult ones as \\"stubborn\\" and tells you to work on the stubborness first if that is the case with yours. Which is a very narrow view. My Hannah isn't stubborn, but her personality makes it so that she is tooooo interested in the rest of the world to worry about pooping in a potty even if we spend all day working on it. She enjoyed sitting on the potty from time to time, but had to get up every two seconds.... anyway they would probably just say she isn't ready yet, and maybe that is true. But hey they said that someone who wants to can potty train a 21 month old or was it less than that, can if they only follow these principles. Well good luck!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have found on potty training","review":"I used this book when my son was 2 1/2.I found it very helpful and it was true to it's title.

For teaching the mechanics to a younger (20 month or so) child, it might work. For my 3 1/2 yr old, it was a dismal failure. The mechanics were not the problem - he just didn't want to go. Still doesn't. This probably made it worse. We hadn't pressured him before but we tried to do the 10 \\"positive practices\\" after each accident. It was NOT positive. It was horrible and took 2 HRS to do the 10 practices because he was dragging his feet. I wish I'd never heard of this book. I don't think he had negative associations with the potty before but he sure does now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staying dry is not worth it.","review":"This book probably does work for many children; however, I would not recommend this book to anyone due to the chance that their child will respond as mine did. My two year old daughter met all of the milestones outlined in the book. For a couple months, she would occasionally use the potty. Since she seemed ready and I had heard that this book worked, I decided to give it a try. I followed the instructions exactly. While the idea of using a doll was helpful and fun, the rest of the book was downright destructive. The book tells to reward a child for staying dry. As instructed, I gave her salty foods and several drinks. She stayed dry but \\"held it\\" for 5 or 6 hours -- until she was running around the house in pain. Months later, my daughter is still so focused on staying dry that she will hold it until it hurts. Staying dry is not worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trained two sons 24 years ago","review":"I used this book for my two sons over 24 years ago and now that I have a grandson I was so happy to find it again.

At almost two and a half, my son was showing every sign of being ready to train. I bought the book and poured lots of time and effort arranging the training day. The training went great. According to the book, he was successfully trained by 1 p.m. after starting at 8 a.m. He had used the potty seven times... six without having to be reminded. We added toys, went to different rooms, resumed normal life. All was great until he went down for his nap at 2 p.m. and woke up and had four accidents. It is the next day, and he still hasn't used the potty. Please don't put a whole lot of time and effort into this method. It was very disappointing and stressful for me and my toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a sensitive child","review":"Having heard that this technique is good, I tried it with my daughter at the recommended age. Although I was LESS stern than the book recommends, the process upset her enough to have created phobias that she didn't have before. When she has an accident now--or even if she spills a drink on her clothes or gets her shoes wet at the playground--she freaks out. She also took to withholding her poop for days at a time, I think (based on other clues, too) because she was worried about having an accident. She just wanted to avoid pooping altogether. The withholding started to create medical problems for her. We're back on track now pooping in diapers, but I would recommend to anyone with a sensitive child to use a very gentle potty training method. The method in this book, while excellent for many children, is not for everyone. For our child, many months after we used this technique (and then dropped it for a gentler approach), we are still reaping the negative consequences of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use this approach","review":"Someone gave me this book and I really could not believe that people use this. The suggestions on how to deal with accidents are demeaning to children and may have dangerous consequences with sensitive children. This book advocates walking your child in wet clothes back and forth from the potty ten times and telling them how other people will be upset if they have an accident. It says to yell \\"No\\" if your child starts to wet himeself and show extreme disapproval. As you can see from some of the other reviews, some children have become traumatized from this approach, and I would never use it with my daughter who is already fearful of the potty and very upset by accidents. There are many other ways to train your child without punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

This book would make any child revert back to pull-ups or worse diapers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty Boot Camp","review":"This book gave totally unrealistic expectations about how long it takes to potty train a child. It makes you feel that if your child does not get it in the four hours or less they say most children get it in you are inadequate. My child is 2 and 1/2 and did not respond well to the methods used in this book. The constant pressure that this book suggests to use made her less willing to use the potty than before we started this training. If you want to put your child through high intensity \\"potty boot camp\\" than this is the book for you, but I would not recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor book : (","review":"I have a 3 year old son who is learning to potty train. I started reading the book toilet training in less then a day and am very disappointed. The author comres training a toddler to go on the potty to teaching \\"profoundly retarted adult\\". I feel this book is very outdated not only on potty training but also techniques in training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"The copywrite date is 1974 and this says alot about the book. I am an early childhood educator and can tell you that this does not align with current theories. It emphasises punishments for accidents and requires you stay in the kitchen with the child for the entire day pumping him/her full of liquids. I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this extremely outdated book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of baloney!","review":"This book is horrible. People should not teach their children to be ashamed of their bodies and its natural functions. Telling your child they are dirty and bad or clean and therefore good...talk about developing a Freudian complex! These methods are completely out-dated. I am shocked that it is still in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was easy to read but the method didn't work for us","review":"I found this book easy to read, and even had fun preparing for our \\"potty party.\\" My son met the criteria and I followed the rules to the letter, but we had absolutely zero success. Months later, my otherwise advanced son is still in diapers.Although the book is easy to read, it is terribly outdated. Giving toddlers candy and soda as treats is no longer acceptable (we don't even do juice unless it's diluted!) and the social structures described barely exist anymore. (Homemaker mothers with nothing better to do, detached fathers, close-knit neighbors and the like.) Further, the idea that children are not to be spanked or yelled at is presented as novel, and the main reward for proper toileting is lots of physcial attention. At least in my household, this is already the norm (as it was in my parents' home). Finally, it addresses pooping as an afterthought, and that didn't work well for us. A lovely method in theory, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't for us","review":"This training wasn't really for us. I know it's worked for others, but not us. Sure, if you have all the time in the world, it may work, but not for us busy parents. When you're kids are ready to be potty trained, they're ready. I waited to fully train my oldest at 3 and she got it right away. Of course, there were a few accidents, but that's expected. A trick to night time training is to stop giving fluids at least 2 hours prior to bedtime and make sure they go potty before you tuck them in at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great For Our Family!","review":"I think this method was the best! By afternoon nap, my daughter had it down. It's been 6 months and she hasn't ever had an accident while out somewhere (she has had a few at nighttime and at home while playing outside though --nothing to be upset about, though).I appreciate how no-nonsense and clear the instructions are. It seemed like a lot of the other methods around would have confused my daughter. Can't wait 'til the time comes to train our son!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Potty-Training-Hunter","review":"I have a 2 1/2 year old boy. I felt this book made potty- training easy. However, I wish it would have gone more into potty training at naptime and through the night.

My mother used the book and its concepts to potty train all 6 of her kids and I have used it with great results for my 2 children. The book is a little redundant and long winded but the overall concept is great. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated pocket book","review":"First written in 1977 and then updated in 1989, this grocery store type paperback lives on because of it's promise to achieve training in \\"less than a day.\\" It is based on a plan that was used to train mentally challenged adults and was then adapted to be used on children. The methods reflect the time and manner in which they came about and are not suited for today's children or today's families. In addition, the promise of having training completed in one day's time is sure to set children and parents up for frustration and failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only took 6 hours!","review":"This book was the reason why I was able to potty train my 2 1/2 year old son by 1pm (only 2 accidents after that and both were at night within a few weeks of training and on days where my had an incredibly active day which exhausted him). The technique makes perfect sense and just worked. The basic methodology is that A) you reward being dry, not using the potty B) you don't ever let them relapse by using diapers or pull-ups and C) when they have an accident they cannot do what they were doing when they had the accident for the rest of the day.Everyone I know that has used this book was successful in potty training in less than a day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"Toilet Training in Less Than A DayWe had high hopes for the book. My daughter and I both read it in one Friday afternoon in the hopes of potty training my three year old grandson the next day. She worked with him all day on Saturday and I tried on Sunday. I don't know if our little diaper-wearer is just that stubborn or if the book is just all wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snookered by Rhetoric and High Hopes","review":"This book yielded nothing but tears for three days with my sweet 2yo son. The book was so convincing that I was sure it would work given enough time. Basically, you pump them up with fluids, reward with candy for dry pants, and shame with \\"fun\\" practice excercises for accidents.After three days of sugar-coated torture (for both us us) he went on to wear diapers for another year. Since then, two other children have learned to use the toilet with much less involvement from me (another son at 2.5yrs. and a daughter at 2yrs.)The only good idea I got from this book was to focus on dryness, not accidents. And, it was pretty cheap, so I didn't loose much money (just my son's self respect), hence the second star."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S A MIRACLE!! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED!","review":"I bought this book with quite a bit of hesitation and skepticism. I had tried to potty train our three year old in the past, but he had no problem wearing his diapers. But, preschool starts next month and all students have to be potty trained. I bought this book without much hope of it working, actually, but several of my friends knew people who had been successful with it. IT WORKED IN FOUR HOURS! If you follow the steps in the book exactly, you will be amazed. After four hours, my son was going to the potty on his own, without even telling us first. I can't believe it was this easy after all the times we tried. I'm sending the authors a big fat kiss . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for us! I highly recommend it!","review":"I had attempted to potty train (PT) my 2 1/2 yo daughter 6 weeks prior, but I always had to remind her to go, and she started having such extreme tantrums that started to seep into all parts of her life. I put PT on hold. I came across this book, tried it, and it totally worked! After only 1 1/2 hours she was trained! It's day 5 and only 3 accidents. She goes without be reminding her to (a miracle!), and no tantrums!My only complaint about the book is that there are so many steps and verbiage you are supposed to use that I had to read it at least 3 times to feel confident that I had it all down before starting. I wish they had a simple cheat sheet. Other than that, this book is worth its weight in gold if your child is ready to potty train!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Helpful Book","review":"Although my 23 month old daughter did not potty train in less than a day, I can say the book was very useful. My daughter had a stubborness problem that had to be overcome before I could use the books's techniques properly. However, instead of costantly butting heads over her stubborness, I improvised. I used a few of the books techniques that my daughter was willing to do and used them over and over. After just a few weeks she supprised me by coming and telling me she had used the potty all by herself and so far she has used it for the past three days in a row. I would recommend using this book as a guide even if your child does not completely pass the readiness tests that are in this book. It has some of the best strategies for potty training I have heard so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"This book first came out in 1974. I used the method for three children, 2 girls and a boy. It worked! Then 15 years later I had another girl and could not find or remember the name of the book, but still remembered the method. It still works! Try it! I plan on purchasing more copies for my grandchildren!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toilet Training in Less than a Day","review":"It really does work!

It is so old the approaches used are outdated and no longer recommended by professionals. I admit the title grabbed me and I fell for it. I wasn't thinking. Nothing I teach my daughter happens in a day, I don't know why I thought potty training would be different! I knew before even trying it that it would be more like How Many Temper Tantrums Can You Cause in One Day...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all kids are alike","review":"I had heard this book raved about, and when potty training time came about, I figured I had to have it. What I found I really needed to have was a good understanding of my daughter - not this book, which seems to assume that all children are the same and that all children learn the same. I found it condescending and pushy at times, and sometimes its instructions made me downright uncomfortable. If you are preparing to potty train, I would recommend a few potty training books for kids featuring your child's favorite characters - they will have much more impact on your child (along with your nurturing and understanding) than the instructions in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of good advice","review":"I believe two of the most frustrating parts of toilet training are dealing with accidents and dealing with the child's resistence. The book gives advice on \\"standard\\" responses to both of these situations. For example, the book clearly stated how the trainer should respond to an accident. It allows me to be very consistent with my 2 year and 2 months old daughter.My daughter was very agreeable to the toilet training process, so I decided to give this training method a try. She had already been peeing in the potty, so the only leaning step was to go to the potty by herself, without my prompting. She archived the book's standard of \\"potty trained\\" within a day, but it took the next 4 weeks to for her to become more or less accident free. We are still not out of the woods yet (still have accidents once every 2 or 3 days). So even though the initial training worked for us, it does not always mean that the child will be accident free from then on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works GREAT for Boys AND Girls!","review":"I read this book and toilet trained my son when he was 2 1/2 in 2008 and then a few years later (2011), my daughter, when she was 2 1/2. I won't say the training is easy, it is a tough few hours for the parent, but if you can get through it and stick it out, it DEFINITELY WORKS!!!! My son and daughter BOTH knew how to go to the potty correctly the afternoon of the training day. They both had one or two accidents here and there the first week afterwards, but never anything like the horror stories you hear about potty-training going on for months and months. After the first week, they were good to go and haven't had one accident since! It is truly amazing to me that it worked so well, but it did, on both a boy and a girl. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work in a Day","review":"While it had some ideas, I think kids will do it if they are ready, and won't if they aren't. I tried all the steps with 2 different children and neither really took to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had me and my daugher both in tears","review":"I tried this method with my daughter when she was 25 months old. One hour into it, both of us were in tears. Frustrated and disappointed, I bought three other toilet training books and read each front to back. It certainly helped me to get other perspectives on the issue versus the \\"hard core\\" approach taken in this book. In our second attempt, I took bits and pieces from each book and, pretty much \\"winging it\\", had my daughter trained in less than one day. Being a busy girl, it was EXTREMELY difficult for her to focus on just the activity of toilet training for the time period called for in this book. I certainly used some of the ideas presented but, in hindsight, it was too harsh a method to have worked for my child. You CAN train your child in a day or less without using this method. My second daughter is now ready for toilet training and we will not be using this method."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be too much pressure","review":"I tried this book's method with my son and he seemed to regress from the point he was before I read the book. I was very upbeat and positive about the whole thing, however it seemed to be too much pressure for him. I did not use this method with my daughter and she learned to use the potty within a week compared to a year for my son. Maybe it works for some children. Just be sure to take cues from your child. If he or she seems to be tired of the process at any time please stop and try later! Every child will eventually use the potty. BE PATIENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked like a charm!","review":"This book is wonderful! I trained my 2 1/2 year old boy in 4 hours! And he has had no accidents for 6 days now.The key is that your child has the bladder control to be trained. I tried this about 6 months ago with him and he didn't have the bladder control then.I highly recommend the method used in this book.

Read it aghast. First it gives awful examples of parents who physically punish, yell, berate, humiliate, coerce, and otherwise emotionally abuse their children when they fail at potty training. Then it purports to present a \\"new\\" enlightened method. Fine. I was ready for it. But a key component of this method is to shame your child when they have an accident, and to model this shaming behavior for your child. There is even an illustration of a little girl wagging a disapproving finger at her dolly. I really hope that people aren't following this aspect of the plan. Children don't deserve to be shamed and scolded for accidents and mistakes. I read passages aloud to my husband and he was just horrified. We didn't want to give it away or resell it; we deliberated for a couple of seconds and threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my first two-about to do it a third time.","review":"Seventeen years ago for my first son. Fourteen years ago for my daughter. Both times the method worked perfectly and I am about to do it again for my second son.

The unsuccessful one did not follow the script, particularly about 100% concentration."},{"rating":"1","title":"My child has issues now due to this book","review":"I know a lot of people including my parents and SIL swear by the book Toilet Training in a Day but I believe the methods have given my child low self esteem in regards to wearing underpants. I tried training this summer using the instructions outlined in that book, one of which is making the child feel bad about having wet pants by saying things such as \\"I don't like wet pants.\\" After a full day of this I realized this wasn't the method for us and backed off until now, 5 months later, but the result is I have a fully potty-trained child who is nervous about wearing underpants."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you get any resistance, I say quit right away","review":"I tried this method several years ago -- now I am back here reviewing its contents simply because I am taking a class on \\"shame\\" and am going to write up an analysis of this technique and how it employs shaming tactics to work. If the child is basically ready, that is not a big deal, but if the child is not ready, I think it can be quite traumatic and really cause problems down the road -- especially if that is the method that parents use to obtain compliance from their kids on other matters. In my case, my daughter really didn't get it the first day, and on the second day I had a strong feeling that to continue would really undermine the trust and love completely. So I stopped and dropped entire matter completely. After about six months I started in again gradually. She was completely potty trained by age 3, without the trauma, so I think that was the right call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do this to your child!","review":"Every child develops at a different pace, and there is no one proven simplistic method for learning anything, let alone potty training. There were some good points made by the author,(ie: the doll that wets-if you can find one) but all in all what this book boiled down to was shaming and humiliating your child. As parents, we often feel inadequate if we can't teach our child a skill on our own. Potty training is a learning process for both parent and child. Trust your instincts and know your child. Be patient, not intimidating and openly disappointed. Your child wants to please you, and loves your praise. He or she will embrace the experience when they are ready. You can choose to psychologicaly torment them them into compliance in a 48 hour period, or practice patience and understanding. Which in the long run I'm sure will have better results. I found asking other parents about their experiences was more beneficial than this book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this book","review":"This book doesn't even deserve one star -- don't buy it. I threw it in the trash because the training theory is outdated and rigid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authors are living in a dream world!","review":"I'd like to buy a one-way ticket to the fantasy world these authors are living in. I find it highly unlikely that 98% (they claim) of all children can be potty-trained in 4 hours or less. I tried this technique on my 2 1/2 year old daughter and the whole process became a constant power struggle with lots of frustration and no real results after almost 2 weeks. Sure it may work for some kids who are particularly cooperative and responsive, but if your toddler is like mine (very bright but independent, strong-willed, likes to do things on her own) I think you will be disappointed in this very aggressive approach. You're better off asking some real parents their approaches to potty training and see what works for your child. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are children. Not animals!","review":"If I could give this book zero stars, I would! I did not listen to my intuition, and we tried this method. I just hope we have not permanently scarred our son! The process that it tells you to do when they have an accident is unbelievable and cruel. We are on day 3 of potty training, and we have had some success, but only after we threw away this book and started treating him like a 3 year old boy instead of an animal. If it means that we have to wait a while to say he is potty trained, that's fine. I would recommend \\"Potty Training for Dummies\\" instead. I was a dummy for trying this methed, but never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for some.....but not for ours!","review":"The training went quite well for the first two hours. Our 2 year-old son was able to learn to pull down his pants, sit on the potty, pull them back up and empty the potty in the big toilet. He did have a couple of accidents during this time, but handled the \\"accident training sessions\\" quite well. He even managed to successfully expel a couple drops of urine during a few occasions, but never fully emptied his bladder when he sat on the potty. Instead, he chose to \\"fully\\" pee when he was elsewhere resulting in very wet pants. Things became very traumatic for him later in the day when for some unknown reason he began to be very hesitant to sit on the potty to the point of crying hysterically when asked to sit. We're not sure why this happened. All of the specific directions outlined in the book were followed meticulously, but to no avail. We'll be trying another method in a few weeks when our son has recuperated from this \\"training\\" method."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 times successful","review":"I am the mom of 7 children, 6 boys and a girl. I purchased this book when my now 27 year old son was two and never looked back. All of my children responded well. It does take concentrated effort by the parent for the first day, and within a week we were always 95% accident free. It is important to not skip steps and to maintain a positive but determined attitude. I saw other mom's who spent hours waiting in the bathroom for the big event to happen only to have an accident happen as soon as the child was off the potty.

This is the first of his three novels. While characters repeat across the novels, each book has a separate protagonist. The story here is a conventional one--an innocent man is suspected of a crime; as the police try to find him, he tries to find the guilty man. While the story is conventional, Robotham's execution is anything but. The writing is expert, the plotting compelling, the setting nicely realized. While the ground is, ultimately, littered with bodies, the action is principally psychological. The protagonist is a psychologist, surrounded by sick patients, some of whom have become victims. While the protagonist runs up and down the English and Welsh landscape, the action is largely within his mind and heart and Robotham's depiction of the tumult and turmoil there is extremely impressive. I predict that Robotham will become a household-name writer. He deserves to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic thriller","review":"i picked this book up on spec while looking for something else.it is the best thriller i have read in ages. i could not put itdown and read it in one sitting. it had a truly complex plot with great characters and a very sympathetic hero. i only wishalfred hitchcock was still alive to make a movie of this book. only he would have the skill to translate this onto the screen. if you loved cracker and rebus this is the book for you! the ending will blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A C- Thriller","review":"I listened to the Books on Tape edition of \\"Suspect,\\" which I checked out from my library.

Bush and his administration. Is it unreasonable of me to have been put off by Robothan's political commentaries? After all the man is Australian and his experience as a ghost writer and fledgling thriller writer would seem to leave him ill-equipped to comment on United States politics. Worse, the book is a muddle and not terribly exciting.If you can get the book from your public library, especially on CD so you can listen to it while driving or preparing a meal, I marginally recommend it, but if you would have to spend money for it, look elsewhere.

I was a little bit suspicious of some of the feedback, as I always am when I look for products to buy on Amazon or anywhere else. Needless to say, I wnet ahead and bought this ball along with one of the Denise Austin Powerbelts that I had seen on the Today Show. My order was delivered to my door in two days, even though I had purchased ground shipping. What a surprise! I have to say, the products do what they are suppose to do and you can't beat the price.

I noticed other customers had similar sizing problems with these. & as stated by others, YES, the pump is useless. the one attachment that screws in either breaks right away or keeps falling out. & there's no way to adequately fill the ball with enough air since it starts leaking from the pump device itself once you get it closer to being filled & the pressure of the air forces it back to the pump. I'm giving this ball away... hoping someone ALOT shorter than 5'7\\" can get some use out of it. The material the ball is made of seems durable, so if you're looking to buy this one, get a size up & invest in a decent pump. The 65cm ball would probably work best for someone less than 5'6\\" tall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body Trends 55cm exercise ball with pump","review":"The pump supplied with the ball was next to useless. The plastic valve supplied to pump up the ball was designed to screw into the pump. I was never able to get the connection tight - the valve just kept turning in the pump. The pump delivered very little air with each pump stroke, and my arms were exhausted before I could get the ball pumped up. Once the ball was partly inflated air leaked out of the top of the pump, and it was necessary to pump very fast in order to get more air into the ball. I managed to borrow a better pump from a friend and was able to inflate the ball further. However, I was never able to inflaate the ball to 55 cm. The fully inflated ball was much smaller than at least three other exercise balls claiming to be 55 cm. I would not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"acceptable","review":"This ball does its job. The only complaint I have is that you have to keep adding air. It doesn't stay tight. I use it daily so maybe it is normal wear and tear for these balls. It has stood up to my three-year old son who gives it a run for its money. That says a lot for me. I would say this is a good value for both ball and pump. I have even used my pump for other things.

When the watch arrived, I was very impressed with how beautiful it was. However, I was unable to wear the watch because it was HUGE on me. It slid half-way to my elbow. In order to wear it, I had to take it to a jeweler to have it resized. I don't believe that I have overly small wrists, and I know I don't have small arms! This watch band is very large and since it is a linked band, you have no choice but to take it to a jeweler.

The British fleet went on strike with expected results. The time frame is post French Revolution and into the Napoleonic era. Life in the fleet was grim to say the least. Starvation diets, floggings, impressed seamen, constant warfare, men kept aboard ships for years without ever getting ashore, rarely paid. Excellent period piece that ties the mutiny into the larger world scene. I had read various books referencing the Nore Mutiny but had never found what it was all about until this book. It is available used from various sources but somewhat hard to find and is not formatted for Kindle at this point.

I attached the handle, poured some mixed gas in the tank and it started after the 3rd pull. I tried running a hand grinder but that was a little too much amps. I tried a 1.15A Dremel tool which it handled no problem. Then I tried a 6Amp Black & Decker drill and that was no problem either, although I could hear the generator load down a little. The manual recommends not exceeding 300Watts for the first 3-4 hours, so I am just going to burn through a tank of gas before really trying anything more. Overall I think this will be a great camping generator which is what I bought it for. I would recommend this for camping or low amperage devices. BTW, it really not that loud compared to my Brigss & Straton 6300 Watt generator or even as loud as my 2cycle gas powered weed wacker! I think it is easy on the ears considering its a 2cycle engine.

Unfortunately, this is no better. It seems organised only to provide an outlet for notes on some arcane aspects of French anthropology. Certainly, the sections dealing with American and English anthropologists have been covered elsewhere, and better. I can't see the justification for buying this book and certainly not for the high price, when the level seems aimed at undergraduates, who will get a banal and very standard view of the history of the discipline that can be found in any introductory textbook.

Boy, was I wrong! What an awful movie! And frankly Elijah didn't do well in it because he didn't fit in! Surrounded by dirty, bitter, foul-mouthed losers, he could not quite find his niche. Further more, the storyline is ridiculous. At times it seemed that dialogue was being invented...which actually would be an easy undertaking by depositing a particular four-lettered verb between each and every syllable. If you like Elijah as I do, skip this movie. Buy the much more superior \\"All I Want\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diamond in the Rough","review":"An very good film, but not for everyone. It has a slow and deliberate pace with very little action. It's all about the story and the mood, not special effects. The acting and casting was excellent, with the exception of Elijah Wood. While he does a good job acting, I think he was miscast in his role. The musical score is fantastic as is the directing and cinematography. It all helps to set the mood.The only place where Ash Wednesday falls short is in the lack of depth to the story. Burns did a good job with it, but would have been well advised to enlist the aid of a co-writer. I can't help but feel the story was lacking a certain ingredient that would have really brought it alive.Ash Wednesday could have been a masterpiece but the storyline doesn't quite make it.That said, Ash Wednesday is very good and I highly recommend it. Most films you pick will not be as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edward Burns and Elijah Wood fans would like this.","review":"I'm an Elijah fan, so I went out and rented this movie as soon as I found out about it. The plot is pretty interesting, but is drowned out by the movie's overabundant shots of Edward Burns walking dramatically down the street to the movie's redundant soundtrack. I must admit that Burns does a pretty convincing job in his character, although I'm not really sure if that is attributed to his acting or because he may actually be like that, since the last Burns movie I saw was ages ago. Rosario Dawson gives a pretty good performance in this movie, as does Elijah Wood. The only complaint I have about Elijah's performance is that he lacks the tough New York accent that Burns (who plays his brother) has throughout the movie. I'm not sure that if they grew up together, why Burns' character has an accent and Wood's does not. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unengaging,","review":"When I read the synopsis on hbo one night and saw that it would be on shortly, I was more than looking forward to seeing it. I'm a huge fan of good cinema and of everything Irish. Almost immediately into the film it was clear it was a let down. Two medicore performances from the main characters heavily contributed to this. Just not belivable. At some points I felt like I was watching a novice scene being played out in an acting school. Wood really stunk and was actually annoying, and Burn's nonchalant approach might have been to nonchalant. Lackluster performances aside I kinda liked the story Idea. I think the movie could have had some potential, given it was handed over to some writers/directors with a little more potential than Burns. The high point of the movie may be it's cinematogrophy.

This was the case with another 20/20 DVD that I bought from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"good starter","review":"The book could use a bit more detail in the instructions. If you've seen his show(s), or had some art instruction, you'll have a better understanding of the technique and what he's talking about & be fine. Someone starting from scratch may have a few questions, but will be able to figure it out or contact Jerry on his web site. Photos are clear. The paintings he's demonstrating in the book are chosen from TV or DVD's/videos he has available. I'd suggest buying the books & DVD's together as they are a great compliment to each other. Jerry is an accomplished artist and a wonderful teacher. There's always something to learn from him and he's always willing to share the tricks of the trade to help make his students better artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of an attaboy for the author than good info for the new artist","review":"I was looking for a book that demonstrated BASICS on painting techniques such as palette selection, brush loading and stroke techniques. All he showed or described were single photos and one short paragraph on the topics I wanted. This was certainly not sufficient to launch me confidently into the area of landscape art. Painting and drawing skills are acquired by practice, and no book will make you an instant success, but the book was boldly listed as BASICS and one would think that it should thoroughly demonstrate or describe very basic methods and techniques. This book was a big disappointment. The topics and techniques discussed are repeated in other Yerry Yarnell books. That makes it seem that his series is just a cut and paste reprint of a basic framework where he substitutes landscapes in one book with sea and water in another. I won't buy another Yarnell book. There are others that cover what I need much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"For new painters and experienced artists!","review":"I have painted and been an art teacher for more than 20 years. Of all of the teachers I had in high school and in college, Jerry Yarnell is the most comprehensive teacher I have ever experienced in print. Some explanations are short, but clearly written. Painting instructions are very clear and concise. Understanding the \\"why\\" of a particular technique is very, very important,and Jerry explains well. The number of fine art techniques taught by Jerry Yarnell in his various books is just astounding! While in college, I studied the Masters, and marveled at their abilities. Now, with Jerry's analysis and explanations, I not only understand why artists of the Hudson River school (for example), used a more impressionistic approach to distant land forms and clouds, but now I know HOW to create that atmospheric perspective myself! I am using Jerry Yarnell's techniques in my painting classes, and getting award-winning results with my students! Awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Any Experience Level","review":"I've painted on and off for several years. Until yesterday, my mom had never picked up a paintbrush in her life. We put this book in between us and neither one of us had any trouble following the instruction.Jerry Yarnell uses acrylic paints but we use oils and still found this book to be very helpful. He guides you step-by-step in everything from sketching your scene onto the canvas to adding the last highlight. He even tells you what paints to mix, brushes to get and strokes to use.The pictures in this book are incredible and you can paint houses, snow, landscape...even cows! I've truly found this book to be more useful than the professional painting class I'm currently in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter book. Step by Step","review":"Yarnell makes it easy. He covers everything including materials and terminology.

It was that gripping.I'm a big horror fan, but I'm not specifically interested in vampires. I'll read a vampire book by an author that interests me. Garton is just fantastic, so horror fans should read his books regardless of what they're about. I recommend \\"Live Girls\\", \\"The Loveliest Dead\\", and \\"Darklings\\" for starters.Don't read \\"Night Life\\" before \\"Live Girls.\\" Also, don't read them back-to-back.

The heavy duty version seems essentially worthless. The medium duty is perfectly nice and works well. The difference in design seems to be that the medium duty is all metal construction, while the so-called heavy duty version has steel blades, but everything else is plastic, and may deform enough when you meet any significant resistance so as to screw up the blade alignment, which is of course critical on a by-pass cutter.

Too many subplots to advance the backstories of each of her stock characters, and too much manipulation of the reader by jumping back and forth in time so that significant clues are not revealed too early, result in a book not up to her previous standards. Moreover, her depiction of English cultural idiosyncracies is beginning to be formulaic rather than charming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest so far","review":"This is by far the weakest volume in the series; George seems to have completely lost her way with the main characters in the series, and there is virtually nothing of any interest here. The musican protagonist (Gideon) is hopeless, and as for his family, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"A fan of many of Elizabeth George's books, this one was disappointing and scattered. The time shifts were confusing; and at the end little was resolved including the motive for the other killings. The theory proposed is weak and not easily believed. There are much better E.G. books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Puzzle To Memory","review":"I have read and enjoyed the previous works in this series. The characters are complex and story lines held my interest and attention. I found this newest entry a challenge. I was nearly finished when I discovered that the plot moved back and forth in time. It was very hard to get a handle on the story. I also did not find any of the characters sympathetic. Finishing it was a let-down. It felt like a lot of work for a little pay-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"Normally I am an enthusiastic fan of Ms. George, but this book is confusing and full of whining, one note characters. Of course a mystery novel must contain some unpleasant characters, since the reader has to believe them capable of murder, but they don't have to go on grating on the nerves for hundreds of pages.Long before I finished this book I was hoping for a mass murderer to come along and wipe out the entire mopey cast.I can only hope that Ms. George will return to her usual fine form in her next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rate it zero if that were an option","review":"I am extremely angry that I paid money for this poorly written, confusing, much too long assemblage of miscellany. I have complained before and will again about how badly Havers routinely gets treated, about the author's misogyny, her bizarre adoration for some very shallow upperclass characters she created, and her attitude toward Americans. This time I can add her open and cruel hate for fat characters--in the first scene, a character gets run over because she is too fat to run out of the way of a car. Give me a break. All of that I could forgive because once upon a time, George wrote a good story. No more. it was impossible to be interested in the main characters of the mystery, the myster was confusing and seemed to have so many red herrings that it signaled a lack of control of the narrative on the writer's part. I will not be buying George's books any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great author; Bad mystery","review":"I love Elizabeth George and look forward to every new installment in this series. Unfortunately, this book disappointed me. I don't mind that the usual suspects, Havers, Lynley, Simon and Deborah, are sidelined. I understand that the author might be becoming bored with their stories, and I feel that we readers could use a break from them. Lynley, in particular, is becoming too sanctimonious and hard to take in large doses. For me, the primary problem is the mystery. It was very unlikely in the first place and you can drive a Mack truck through the holes in the plot. You could be forgiven for finishing the book and still not really understanding whodunit and why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"I've enjoyed all of the previous Lynley/Havers books, but was greatly disappointed with this one. First of all, it is about twice as long as it needs to be. The plot meanders all over the place, with too many loose threads and contradictions. The basic characters, with the exception of Winston, don't show us anything new and are hardly part of the story. The writing on the other hand is pure George, a pleasure to read, except for the growing disappointment and frustration as the plot frays apart.A good job of editing could have turned this into a worthy book. As it is now, I am sorry I wasted so much time on such a frustrating venture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceptive","review":"This was a pretty good story, except for the fact that it really wasn't about Lynley/Havers, but about a musical prodigy. Lynley and Barbara are peripheral characters. This is very disapointing for the followers of this series and rather deceptive on the author's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to earlier books","review":"IF this were the 1st book for Elizabeth George, then one could cut her some slack and assume she would improve. As the 11th in the Lynley/Havers series it is disappointing. The plot meanders too far away from the main series characters, treating them quite superficially. The other, quite annoying tendency, is the repetition of Catholic imagery, guilt, blah blah. If Elizabeth George wants to write religious books (which she does in her off-season from Lynley/Havers), then keep the heavy handed Catholic stuff to the other literary works. Overall........after waiting a year for a new novel from George, this was very disappointing and an indication the series is sliding downhill rapidly."},{"rating":"1","title":"So booring, and so sad she's dropped this far","review":"I'm a George fan. I've read all her prior books in the series and loved them. But this one has bogged down in flipping back and forth between viewpoints that may be taking us somewhere eventually, but not soon. She's tried a technique of story telling that got out of hand; a good editor would have made her cut 200 pages. It's been laying on my shelf 3/4ths done for two weeks, and may well stay there since other reviewers say that the ending doesn't resolve what happened.Sigh. She needs a break. Then she needs to think about the series, and a coherent story, and how to tell that story, and if she is capable of telling it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"700 pages of a book in a series defined by Barbara Havers and Lynley and we get a story about Gideon and the murder of his sister 20 or so years earlier. Gosh, was the editor on vacation? A red pen was clearly needed in this book. While I can understand EG trying a new twist on writing, she should have started with a whole new set of characters instead of polluting her great series of Havers and company. I missed Barbara's mussings. They were needed. Also, the mystery was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"was the editor missing too?","review":"I waited 2 years for the next book in the Havers/Lynley series and what do I get? Simply an overlong, awful boring, simplistic book without the characters that made Elizabeth George's books so fun to read. The interaction between Barbara and Lynley is usually priceless. Lynley's feelings of guilty re. St. James are getting a little dated at this point. The story of Gidon was, well, boring. It went on way too long. Libby, Gideon's sort of weird American girlfriend and the ending were overdown. It was just not interesting. It was easily figured out early on. And EG seemed to incorporate story lines that went no where. What was the point? I wanted to put this one down several times, but did not due to the fact I kept hoping it would get interesting. It does not. I had no issue with Winston getting more play, but the core of her stories - Barbara and Lynley - are what keep readers coming back for more. This really was the story of Gideon, not a Havers/Lynley mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"E. G. Is No Traitor","review":"What a delight! Lynley & Havers are back and doing well! But there is more in-depth analysis of the main character's mind than we've seen in previous E. G. novels.Although one can solve the mystery before Lynley does, the book keeps one reading.

I'd read anything she saw fit to put Barbara Havers in. I thought this one was a great read, not too long for me - I read it in a couple of days. But I guessed the culprit early on, and since I rarely guess (or particularly want to), I was slightly disappointed because of that! I both loved and hated the ambiguous ending, as well. Very clever to keep us guessing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in Elizabeth George's latest book","review":"When I began reading \\"A Traitor to Memory\\" I was so disgusted with the sexual descriptions I could not believe this was Elizabeth George. I put the book down, but later thought I would stick with it to see if it improved any. I did finish reading the long book, ploughing through Gideon's boring one-sided sessions with Dr.Rose, only to be rewarded with the stupid ending.There was too much from Gideon, his sex-crazed friend Libby, and his father Richard and not enough from Inspector Lynley and Barbara Havers.I hope that George will go back to her roots with Lynley and Havers, and skip all that sex. We didn't need it before, and we don't need it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk, talk, talk","review":"I started reading this series because I was interested in the five main characters. Instead, I am finding that in the past few books, the author isn't featuring them as strongly as she had in her earlier novels. She is now writing very uninteresting, talky storylines which portray too many boring people. What happened to Lynley, Helen, Simon, Deborah and Havers? They seem to be thrown into the chapters as an afterthought. I think their interwoven relationships were more enjoyable to read about than the other characters in this long-winded novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Life","review":"I've read and enjoyed other Elizabeth George mysteries and I like the smart but pathetic and hopelessly unfashionable detective Barbara Havers. However, after struggling through the interminable interior monologue of a 3-year old violin player that opens this book, I thought: why in the world am I reading an over-stuffed mystery novel that is 700 pages long? Don't I have something better to do with my time? Well, I do -- I'll read a biography of Jesse James who was at least a real person and a criminal of some note.Take this review as a protest against 700 page mystery novels. A mystery should be brief and tight -- capable of being read and enjoyed in a day or two.Smallchief"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad editing.","review":"I join the ranks of reviewers who are ardent George fans, but were disappointed by this book. While the story line may not be up to the high level we normally expect from Elizabeth George, the main problem is the editing. One example - the timeshifted tracks of Gideon's diary and the rest of the story is definitely confusing, but our confusion is exacerbated when the dates don't add up.

Yet she was apparently at the fateful concert on 13th July.Did the people at Bantam read the book at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed an Editor","review":"I love Ms. George's books. Her mystery's with Lynley and Havers and Co. on the case, with an in-depth look at their lives outside of policing, are terrific. This book was just a mess. 700 pages? Only the bible could be that long and get away with it. Too many story lines, i.e. lesbian lover, cyber sex, past family relations, changed names, adultery, and it really all goes no where. Gideon and his doctor's sessions were about 1/2 of the book and was totally unnecessary. I found myself skimming and if it was not for the hope that it would get better, I would have put it down and forgotten it. I hope that Ms. George's next story comes out before 2 years and includes the cast we love. I do wonder, however, if Winston and that gal get together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trifle heavy on the gimmicks","review":"Elizabeth George is one of my favorite mystery novelists, and it may be that as a result I'm being rather more generous than I might be-- I certainly think that _A Traitor to Memory_ is the weakest of her work to date, but that's not so terrible given how uniformly strong her work generally is.This mystery, which begins with a strange hit and run killing, takes us through the mind (and journal) of a violin prodigy, into the history of some of the familiar characters, and explores the idea of children and the past.Strong points: complex and well-realized characters, generally high quality of the writingWeak points: confusing time flipping and lame endingI, at least, enjoyed the read despite the flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Read or Not to Read","review":"Ms. George has always had a tendency to \\"drop the ball\\" when it comes to the denouement of her mystery.

This one has exhausted me! I have always enjoyed reading and rereading Elizabeth George's novels, and I waited anxiously for \\"A Traitor to Memory\\" to be published. I have been both bored and disappointed by this novel. I wanted to know how she had advanced the lives of the characters that people her stories: Havers, Lynley, Helen, St. James, Deborah, and Winston. Each is intriguing in his or her own way. However, they and the unfolding of their lives were obscured by the narcissistic demands of the central character, violinist Gideon Davies, his Victorian father, his maniac grandfather, and the hollow women who took to the shadows in the madhouse of Gideon's childhood. I look forward to Ms. George's next book. In the meantime, I think I'll spend my Christmas holidays enjoying her earlier works again."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Usatisfactory Ending","review":"The ending of the book was most unsatisfying for me.

What happens to Webberly and his wife? What happens to Richard? What happens to Wolf? For such a complicated book I was very surprised at its ending.

The Lynley and Havers team doesn't play such a significant role in the book. It is rather based on a lot of monologues by Gideon Davies, a famous violinist.Gideons memory - or lack of it - is indeed the key to the mystery presented in the book: A 20 year drowning-accident of his younger sister, a german au pair girl, the protective love from his father and estrangement from his mother.The book is thorough but prolonged. 662 pages to solve the mystery which turns out to be rather simple. The many monologues makes the story heavy without a certain amount of action. I've rated the book 4 stars. It has the genuine qualities that all novels of Elizabeth George have and it is a good book indeed.

It is a terrible disappointment--it is very long with a tedious plot--with much first person dialogue of the main character in a journal for his psychiatrist. There is very little new with my favorites--Barbara Havers and Inspector Lynley--and it is the development of these characters that have made the series so successful. There were no other interesting or likable characters in the story to keep your interest. The ending is so unsatisfying I forgot I finished it and thought there was more.If you liked George's earlier novels, you won't miss anything if you skip this one. I hope her future novels return to her winning formula of character development and tight plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much gratuitous sex","review":"I have enjoyed Elizabeth George's mysteries in the past even though they don't compare to the likes of Ruth Rundell or P.D. James - but this one was not good. It was choppy and substituted grapic and gratuitious sexual scenes and language for a seamless plot and quality of characterization. After I read the last sentence, I thought - \\"who cares\\" and felt like I had wasted my time reading a potboiler."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I was very disappointed in \\"A Traitor to Memory.\\" I loved EG's previous books, but I thought this one featured very long and long-winded soliloquies from a repellant and boring man who was responding to an old fashioned Freudian psychiatrist. The book is based on the extremely dubious premise that in general people tend to forget very traumatic events, something recently shown to be highly quesitonable, and surely against commonsense also. I should say that I put the book down one-third of the way through; perhaps it got better, but by then I had guessed too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort.","review":"This is a death-defying mystery (before it is over, you will want to shoot someone). The flashbacks are o.k., but the timeline of events simply is way too confusing. The novel is far too long, with really little suspense. Not enough of Lynley and Havers to make a difference. And the main characters are not very compelling. After this novel by Elizabeth George, it will be a long time before I pick up another of her mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Read","review":"I am reading all of the Inspector Lynley books in order and think I have enjoyed this one the most! I couldn't wait to get to the end and find out \\"whodunnit\\"! The characters were interesting and different and moving between the past and present was well managed. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys thrillers and the Inspetor Lynley series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intricate tapestry","review":"I am always astounded on how intricate the web is that Elizabeth George weaves. You are drawn in from the very beginning but you have no idea where it can be leading until well into the book. The characters are entrancingly flawed and different and I always feel like I feel after a good meal with extraordinarily good wine - happy, calm, fulfilled. I love the totally juxtapositioned characters of Inspector Lynley and Barbara Havers and felt that their characters as portrayed in the television series capture them to perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"back to havers, lynley and the crew","review":"I had a feeling from the beginning how this book was going to end. There were few twists and turns in an exceedingly long novel. Can we go back to basics? Mysteries with the detectives we know and love uncovering the truth as the main storyline. Did not like this book and gave it a two only because one is reserved for those I put down and do not finish. And the only reason I finished it was to assure myself that I did indeed have it figured out right from the start. If you are big fan of Elizabeth George and feel you must read this book, be forewarned, this is not the usual Lynley/Havers storyline.

I fought halfway through the book - disjointed plot; way too many characters; endless, boring letters to the main character's psychiatrist; constant backtracking; 800 pages; and on, and on. My reader boredom grew faster than the plot, and I put the book in the recycle bin. I didn't want to leave it in circulation to bore someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gab, Gab, Gab!","review":"First of all, like most books this one started off slow, but not just slow, ungodly slow. I think the overall point in this book was to make it just as long as possible! For 1000+ pages, there is about 5% content, the rest is 2 detectives not coming up with anything. You could seriously read the first 50 pages and last 10 and wash out the rest of the 900. It's to say the least FRUSTRATING. You keep thinking it's going to get juicy, but it just sits there and people keep TALKING. The worst of all, the ending is just horrid. Smart girl that wrote the book, likes to show off her fancy vocabulary, but Please do yourself a favor and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing, annoying read","review":"This was my first Elizabeth George book, and likely my last. With so many layers, it was a slow and often confusing read. I don't believe I have ever read a book that left the reader with so little hope. I don't require a happy ending, not in this genre, but I felt completely frustrated. Having invested what felt like weeks reading, only to have ends of plot lines left dangling and nearly every character destroyed in one way or another seemed a bit much (not that I'd really had much reason to actually CARE about most of the characters). Call me naive, but I can't remember feeling so peeved by an ending. I feel the author simply overextended herself here. Sometimes too much is just way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's A Plod. Surely Elizabeth George's Next Will Be Better.","review":"I cannot elaborate any better or further than the previous reviewers of A Traitor To Memory. Having read and enjoyed previous novels in the Lynley-Havers series, I entertained lofty expectations of this latest book by Elizabeth George. However, it required a supremely concerted effort to grind through the ponderous text, plough on through the cumbersome plot, and endure the maximum insult delivered in the conclusion of this tepid tome.Back to P.D. James and beloved Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine for the holidays. I would advise fans to do likewise. Spend your precious reading time enjoying the masters of the genre or cozy up with a few of Sue Grafton's mysteries and your Christmas will be merry and bright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly...a perfect title","review":"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. After waiting two years for the next installment in the Lynley/Havers saga, I feel betrayed. This book reads more like a stand alone than part of Ms. George's excellent series. It was as if Lynley and Havers were afterthoughts and really didn't have much to do with the story. At over 700 pages, the book tends to wander, be repetitive, drag and, in total, was not a pleasant reading experience. Perhaps if the book had been written as a stand alone and was at least 300 pages shorter, it might have worked.I read an interview with Elizabeth George where she discussed how she wrote this book in a different style. I can only believe that Ms. George was trying to write a psychological thriller. While I respect her desire to spread her wings, my advice is to leave this genre of writing to Minette Walters, Barbara Vine or Nicci French. None of these authors were able to write the wonderful series that Elizabeth George created ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with negative reviews...","review":"I agree with pretty much everything others have said. I am beginning to really become involved with our main characters, and this book barely featured them and lost my interest at page 100.It has all been said: the book is too long, the ending is head-scratching and disjointed, and where are our Lynley and Havers shining through?I don't usually like to skip books in a series, but recommend skipping this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, challenging book.","review":"This is the first book I've read by Elizabeth George. I'm impressed by her ability to write from so many points of view in such an effortless manner. The book is great, very atmospheric, and written with a quiet sense of urgency. The characters are so refreshingly flawed, without being contrived, which seems to me to be more and more of a rareity. I haven't enjoyed a book so much in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVIEWS TELL A TALE !","review":"At last count, 67 reviews of \\"Traitor\\" were negative, 48 were positive and 38 'waffled' -- so WHY were 2 positive reviews designated as \\"SPOTLIGHT\\"?

They have long been fictional favorites so why drown them in an encyclopedia-length saga peopled with unappealing bit players? Their secrets, possibly rising from some dark celllar of the author's past, are played out in excruciating tedium.Inevitably there will be inferior manuscripts published because the authors are \\"established\\" (aka \\"income-producers\\"), or they are celebrities.

It was so different from the rest of the series (although I love those, too). I was captured from the first and read the book in two days. The main focus was not on the two detectives, which was refreshing. The reader knows all about those characters already, and with this book they learn more about the villains of the piece. Some may find the format a little confusing, but by paying close attention, all the questions are answered. The ending was the best....I love a mystery that lasts all day ......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"George's absolute best. Though I adored Lynley et al. for years, they had, for me, gotten old and tired by the last outing, and while I'm still fond of them, I was glad that they took a back seat in this one to some fascinating, complex, and beautifully developed characters, particularly Gideon Davies. True, there are flaws in the plot -- I won't give them away; they're fairly obvious -- but on the whole I found myself living in the world of these characters and unable to tear myself away from them and the horror of their past. I read P.D.

The plot was hopelessly transparent, and if George had not used the flashback/flashforward technique it would have been even worse. I am glad I read the book but only because I would hate to be lost on the small bits of information of the usual main characters' lives. Hopefully we will get to see more of them in the next book.

With \\"A Traitor to Memory\\", though, she went too far. About a third of the way into this mammoth tome it seemed like she was treading water -- the same characters were acting out the same scenes, again and again. Usually George juggles all her characters expertly, carefully revealing their secrets and connections to keep the reader hooked. This time they all seemed to spin about at random, with readability further complicated by the flashbacks and the different points of view. I applaud George for attempting something this complex, but next time keep the poor reader in mind! On the plus side, there are some fascinating, expertly drawn characters, but it's all too much. Where was the editor on this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"I truly enjoy reading Ms. George's books, but definitely not this one.

I admire Ms. George's writing. Having said that, this book is, quite simply, tedious. There is far, far too much time devoted to Gideon's stream-of-consciousness rambling directed at his analyst. I found myself skipping over many pages of these segments of the book. Not your best effort, Ms. George!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An EG fan but more editing please","review":"Although EG is one of my favorite writers this book was a big disappointment. Lynley/Havers are two of the most credible characters in mystery and for that reason the rather small and supportive roles that they had in this story was one of its biggest drawbacks - any avid EG fan would have expected the unexpected but sad to say that the culprit with means, motive and opportunity were obvious in the first third of the book. The biggest disappointment was the ending. However, I look forward to the further development of Lynley/Havers characters in the next EG book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another outstanding entry in a fine series","review":"This is a non-stop page turner from one of the best mystery writers around. I especially enjoyed the way Elizabeth George uses a major character's diary to show the process of psychoanalytically oriented therapy and the psychological changes he went through as his repressions began to unravel. If you like great writing and psychological insights, I highly recommend this book. This is a series with very interesting continuing characters, so if you enjoy this one, give yourself a real treat and read the series in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"It's hard to believe the same woman who wrote previous Lynley/Havers stories wrote this book. Lynley and Havers hardly appear, and when they do their personalities are sadly absent. Ditto Helen, Deborah and St. James. The dialogue seems not quite right in places (if you are violently ill with morning sickness you're not likely to be chatty), and around page 600 the chronology of events becomes rather garbled. I found the time-jumping confusing, distracting and not effective. Still haven't quite figured it out.Don't buy this book! Wait till it comes to the library, and then read it if you feel you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort","review":"A very disappointing effort from a usually dependable writer. At least half the book is occupied by the ramblings of the violinist Gideon Davies, which does little to create tension and makes Lynley and Havers almost cameo figures in a series in which they usually star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traitor to Memory","review":"This book was too long and the cutting back and forth between Gideon's view and the rest was tedious beyond words. The timeline was hard to follow, as was the plot. I've read most of George's mysteries and think her early books were the best. And where were the publisher's editors? One of them needed to cast a critical eye on George's writing and rein her in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrayed By A Favorite Author","review":"Elizabeth George is among my favorite authors and I ordered the book immediately upon being informed that it would be available. What a disappointment to have a book filled with uninteresting, in fact repugnant characters, overly graphic references to the cybersex culture and a frenetic leaping back and forth in time, place and perspective. I didn't like any of these people enough to try to keep track of them and skipped long sections hoping something would grab my attention. It didn't.The real mystery is who wrote this book? It is so unlike Ms George in every way that I have to wonder if SHE were the one murdered and someone is writing in her place."},{"rating":"1","title":"A doorstopper","review":"I really should give this 2.5 stars-- George's skill at unraveling the mystery is balanced out by the book's bloatedness.I've enjoyed this series in the past, but my problem with this book is that I simply didn't like any of these people. The violinist, the father, the pregnant girlfriend, the voyeur old bookshop owner. Too many characters are 2-d , given only a crass character trait for development. Also, George refuses to be kind to Havers, her own heroine, whose fashion faux pas are played for low comedy. That said, the key revelations are planted with great subtlety and skill.

I learned about entomology and fly fishing separately and was confused when I tried to connect the names of fishing flies with the actual insects. Not only does this book give you background on what the artificial flies are trying to mimic but Cutter gives you fish behavior to help you understand what you should be doing with your fly when you put it in the water. Knowing what the insects do and how the fish respond is invaluable to learning how to be successful catching fish. Plus, Cutter has some great stories and experiences to share about how he learned his tricks. You have to set up an aquarium or get in the water yourself.

I phoned customer service, and found them very knowledgeable and competent - a very stark contrast to the buffoons at Netgear.

Internet connection only came after two or three reboots. And here's the rub, the vaunted work-through-walls signal people associate with this brand couldn't even register at full strength when I was sitting 2 feet away from it on my laptop. I took my laptop downstairs and the signal dropped to 24Mb/s (down from 48 when I was 2 feet away).I returned this router the next day and got myself another D-Link, DI-524.

I've spent hours on the phone with the polite but incompetent support people, reset everything, restored a previous version of the firmware, all for nought. Netgear's final solution was to suggest that I return the router to the store - but it's past the store's exchange period. I wrote them of this, CC'd the CEO (Patrick Lo) and have received no response at all.

You have to write them an email for products older than 90 days, and they only reply you by email. After tried several email back and forth by weeks, my problem was still not solved.

Not to mention b/w the three calls placed, I couldn't understand one of the techs. They all seemed foreign and really struggled with the english language. All in all my experience with NetGeart was not very favorable. -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Hardware","review":"I own the MR814v2 802.11b router. That is a very stable product, so I figured since I had a WG311 wireless card in my desktop I'd buy another Netgear router for 802.11g. Many of the reviews here were favorable, so I bought on the basis of that.This product is simply not stable, at least for me. It has to be rebooted constantly. For sure it cannot hold a wireless connection more than 24 hours. I upgraded to the latest firmware, which at the time of writing is 4.1.11. No help whatsoever. I checked on-line, and sure enough many many people have reported similar problems with it (broadbandreports.com). I tried disabling the 108Mb features, but that also didn't help.So in the end, I'm just returning it after a frustrating weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still too many stars","review":"I don't think I could possibly rate this router low enough to reflect my disgust for this product. This is my second of these pieces of trash and I've had enough. I have been fighting with dropped connections with these things for years and never bothered to look up solutions until now. Within the past few days, this router has been dropping connections on the order of every 2-5 minutes. Enough was enough. I logged on to Amazon to shop for a new router, and lo and behold, I find a ton of 1-star reviews of the very router I'm using and hundreds of references to a known technical issue with this particular model. Do yourself a favor - buy a Linksys router and never look back. If Netgear is that lackadaisical about solving issues with their product, they don't deserve your business. Any company that quite obviously doesn't care about their customers won't get another penny from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Once in a while","review":"When this unit works it works well. The problem is it constantly needs to be unplugged and plugged in as it drops the internet connection about twice a day. I have version 3 and the latest firmware.I can't believe Netgear hasn't fixed this problem yet or has taken this defective product off the market. Maybe there needs to be a class action law suit to wake them up?Not happy with this product at all and will not buy Netgear products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Will Eventually Fail on You","review":"I have to say that at first this product was amazing, and it worked very well. However, because of the firmware upgrades and possible overheating, the product has now been rendered usesless to me. I may still be able to return it (shipping paid by me) for a new product, but I almost don't even want to deal with the problem anymore, since I know the next one will eventually have a problem. I replaced this with Belkin's Mimo G+ router, and I am happy to say it works beautifully, has a much better range, and has a lifetime warranty. Think before you buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad product all around","review":"I bought this because I got a good deal on it at a local store. However, after setting it up and not being able to get the router to work without frequent drop outs requiring a reboot, I went online to check reviews. I was amazed to find that nearly everyone here has had the exact same experience as me. This product must be faulty in its basic design.In terms of the wireless card for my laptop that goes with it, I couldn't even get it to work. After a very frusterating few days, I returned the product and bought a lynksys and it set up like a dream. Flawless so far (only 2 days but still eons better than the netgear product).I would absolutely avoid this product like the plague!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this Product","review":"I bought this Netgear router bundled with a USB adaptor at Costco. It was very easy to set up and worked great for about 15 minutes. Then both my desktop and laptop lost connection to the internet. FYI, I have an Dell XPS laptop and a Dell Dimension desktop running Windows XP, with a Motorola Surfboard modem and Adelphia internet. I can stay connected about 10 minutes at a time, then I lose my connection and have to reboot my computer. What a pain! This is going back to the store tomorrow.I suggest that if you are looking for a reliable router, that you avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangs frequently on XP","review":"Easy to install but frustrating disconnects.

The instructions was very clear and not too many steps. The signal strength is very strong where the router is actually hidden behind a wooden shelf and 1200 sqft condo has perfect connection through out. I'm usually a linksys fan, but wanted to try something new since this looks a lot nicer (less techie). I highly recommend this router to anyone.My general comment is that the administration website that comes with this router, linksys router, etc... all still suck. Hopefully, some day these company can spend the extra 10k to make these administrative interfaces a lot nicer looking and more user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk","review":"It set up well and work well for a brief period of time.

Although I haven't fully tested the \\"Super\\" mode, the standard \\"g\\" works flawlessly. Superior range over linksys (40% better speed performance compared to Linksys). As for setup, it's a breeze. There isn't much in the way of manuals, but the software tutorial is a snap. 64 or 128 bit encryption and you can select MAC addresses to really put forth effort to prevent hackers from gaining access, or simply to prevent a \\"leech\\" from stealing your wireless connection. In light of the upcoming days of streaming music and video around the house, this puppy does it and does it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Received it today, unhooked my Netgear RP114 and replaced it with the new WGT624. Setup was easy, but it would never talk to the DSL modem. No lights blinking. Tried different Cat5 cables, nada. Called Netgear tech support and had a hard time understanding the broken english. Could never get anyone to assist me. It's obviously defective so I'll be returning this product tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Support Services","review":"I bought it 23months ago from Amazon. Just recently it started failing to connect with the modem. I called support, after a long delay, the rep came online and wouldn't speak to me before I registered. The call center was clearly overseas and the registration process was quite difficult due to language barriers. After a painful registration process I was then told that he couldn't help me because it was out of warranty...nice. I was given two options: Pay Netgear $32 for a total of 13 minutes of tech support or somehow get online w/out my router and email tech support. Needless to say, the UI on the website was unbearable. Netgear buyer beware YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"This product doesn't work. Period. It doesn't support the advertised speed.

Don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super-quick installation, great performance, great upgrade!!","review":"I bought this router as an upgrade to a Linksys 802.11b router, which wasn't working well with a newly-purchased Dell laptop [Inspiron 8600 w/ a Dell TrueMobile 1300 WiFi card]...I will tell you all that from the moment I opened the box, it barely took 8 minutes to remove the Linksys, hook up the NetGear, fire up the PC & cable modem, and run through the setup instructions. The Netgear router auto-configured the cable modem settings during the setup; it was a breeze!!!Dell laptop owners, take note. This router works great with the TrueMobile 1300 b/g WiFi card!!!

This particular model failed after just 4 months of use. In my opinion, Netgear products are simply inferior to just about any other brand on the market. If you want consistent, reliable, and long lasting wireless hardware, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work With other Netgear Products","review":"Don't waste good money on a thoroughly mediocre product no better than a super-cheap Fry's special.It definitely does not work well as a network bridge with other Netgear devices. This was the only reason I bought it and spent too much time fiddling with it as Netgear specifies.Routing doesn't work despite the provided options. I don't know what routing as presented is supposed to do, but setting up a route to another subnet on the same switch does absolutely nothing.WPA works, but some of the other wireless options break the connection attempts on a Mac or Linux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk - resets CONSTANTLY - Poor range","review":"This product should be recalled.I had a Netgear 802.11b that had good range, and worked flawlessly for a year and a half.

This translates to a range of less than 50' in open space, and 15' in my home.To top it off, I can't maintain a connection for more than 30 minutes with the device and the router on the same desk.

They provided a free installation service by professionals. The pro worked two solid hours trying to install the wireless system. The hangup was the router repeatedly shut down my modem. The modem is an RCA unit provided by Time Warner cable. Maybe there is a problem with this modem but it worked fine with a Netgear 11 Mbps router. This problem still existed after the pro downloaded and installed the latest firmware updates from the Netgear website. I had to return the router and card.

I anticipated some interference from the phone, but this is ridiculous.After spending over an hour on the phone with Netgear tech support dealing with someone I could not understand for the thick accent and who was clearly reading from a script, I boxed up over $300.00 of equipment and returned it for a refund.I am extremely happy with my D-Link ethernet router and hard wired network!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like frequent router reboots & dropped connections...","review":"then this router is for you.

If you plan on using the wireless connectivity you better leave the router where you can get to it easily as you will be rebooting it frequently.If you google up WGT624 and CRASH you will see what I mean. Also note that the amazon ratings show more one star reviews than all the good review combined.

You have to download a patch for XP in order to use WPA2. I give the router five stars because it's relatively inexpensive & provides excellent signal strength in both OS's.

This is true for Netgear PC Card with Super G as well as other Wi-Fi vendors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty nice product!","review":"I am a big fan of Netgear products. This one is a nice product as well. It has just been released so it is still just a little \\"buggy.\\"First the good things .... it is pretty much plug and play. The only extra thing I had to do is configure the wireless so I would have the tightest security. Seems pretty fast in 108 mbps mode.Now the bad things. Out of the box, it would not support RAS. I had to download and apply a firmware patch before I could work from home with it. And it is pretty slow whenever you apply any configuration changes - once you hit APPLY, it sits there for close to 30 seconds before the change is complete. I'm used to the prosafe line where it is almost immediate.But still, you can't beat the features for such a low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow to deal with","review":"The so-called easy setup wasn't particularly easy. I had many issues trying to get an internet connection, setup continued to fail for about 10 times. After going through the steps on the 11th time we managed to get setup to complete successfully (using DHCP). After setup I needed to reboot the computer to get my connection back.The very big issue was the speed degradation over my wired connection. It's like the bad ole days of dialup. It's going back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE...DO NOT BUY IT... 3 ROUTER & NO SOLUTION","review":"I have gone through 3 same routers.

Ever 2 to 4 hours, the unit goes through this rebooting process that cannot be stopped. There is no issue listed on the Netgear website, and Netgear has yet to respond to my inquiry, but do a Google search for \\"WGT624 unit reboots\\" and you will see what I mean.It is best to avoid this product and choose something else. Is is suspected that the \\"Atheros\\" chip is to blame, whatever that means! I guess find a wireless router that does not use an \\"Atheros\\" chip."},{"rating":"1","title":"UPDATE: It gets worse","review":"After countless hours of trying to make this useless product work, Netgear offered to replace it - if I gave them my credit card number, which they claimed would not be charged unless I failed to send back the defective router. Given the gross incompetence of their customer service, I'd rather eat the loss than risk them having my CC number on file. Their attitude was extremely condescending - like they were doing me a great favor by waving the shipping charges for the replacement. Speaking to a supervisor didn't help either - she had an even snootier attitude than the rep. Do yourself a favor - if after all this you still buy a Netgear product, and it doesn't work, bring it back for a refund immediately - trying to get these Netgear idiots to understand customer service or support is like trying to get good sushi at Mcdonalds - impossible. I paid dearly for trying to make the router work, instead of just getting a refund while I could. Don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies Lies Lies","review":"Forget 108 !!

If you try to set up a secure wireless network, the DHCP does not even work. In order for it to function, even partially, the wireless network has to be completely open and unsecure. Even then it will only work for anywhere between 30 minutes and one hour. Afterwards you have to unplug the router and plug it back in to get it going again.I'm not sure if I simply purchased a bad router, but I'm not the only one that has complained about this. I wouldn't recommend spending the money on something that may or may not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This unit is for SUCK!","review":"So far I have had nothing but trouble with this router. It will randomly drop the PPPoE connection. You can go to many different web pages & then all of sudden, it will time out. Connection gets dropped & you have to try & reconnect. Most of the time this does not work & you will have to unplug the unit for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Once powered back up, sometimes it will reconnect on it's own but most of the time you have to make it connect manually by logging in through web interface. Netgear Tech Support is useless & the forums just have a bunch of worthless posts from kids that cant download their pron through a BitTorrent client because they can't figure out port forwarding.I always had good luck with Netgear in the past, but I am done after this unit.

It overheats and crashes. It constantly reboots and loses connections. The latest firmware upgrade has destroyed thousands of people's routers, leaving them to try to return them to the company which accepts no responsibility for destroying your equipment. Netgear has outsourced all development and tech support to India, and it really shows in this product. I strongly urge you to buy an 802.11g router from any other manufacturer except Netgear.

Howver, they seem to be yet another company who's quality has been destroyed by outsourcing.I bought this modem for its new security features, but it lasted only 5 or 6 months before it failed. I believe it failed after I updated the bios with the built-in upgrade wizard. It now is not able to establish an IP connection with my cable modem.I tried installing an old version of the router bios, but this has not helped. I know the configuration settings are correct - I tried every combination that should work.Netgear customer support will not honor their warranty because they claim upgrading to their new bios is a \\"configuration\\" problem, not a hardware problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for awhile, then crashes","review":"I unfortunately have to give this a single star for effort, its stylish look, and its low cost. The unit worked fine for about two days, then the wireless network started to intermittently disconnect. Now, on its fourth day, its firmware was upgraded in hopes of alleviating the intermittent problems, and it now entirely refused to work and continues blinking the Test light.I should have researched this product before purchasing it; a quick check on Netgear's forums reveals that this product has a whole host of problems (such as overheating and, again, sporadic shutdowns that require rebooting).The installation disc also requires Windows and Internet Explorer, which I wish was clearly stated on the box. I have no idea why it needs Windows since other routers (such as D-Link's) simply requires any web browser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this router....","review":"..unless you have 5 minutes to spare waiting for your gmail page to open up.The setup time for this router was annoyingly long in comparison to other wireless networks I have set up for friends and family, but I endured the process in the hopes that the 108Mbps would \\"push\\" signal a bit harder in my concrete condo (although I knew going in that my network card was only 54Mbps).What I've found is that my network speed is dwarfed by all of the other networks I have set up when I link to them. I can even be in the same room as my netgear router and the speed does not improve. My machine isn't the problem, my spatial relationship to the router isn't the problem...that only leaves one item left as the culprit.My office and several of my friends run off Linksys routers (a Microsoft friend said that all the techy's at MS recommend Linksys routers) and they work great.I'm ordering my Linksys right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm a beginner for networking, and I barely had problems","review":"We just got a DSL connection going from bellsouth, and my parents wanted to network thruout the house, so they asked me to research routers. I read CNET and amazon reviews and ultimately that this is the most simplest, most secure, basic, long range router for us. When we got it, setup was a breeze (without encryption of course). I had to get on the phone with Netgear (now I am hearing indian accents everywhere), and finally after 3 hours, we activated encryption. Then there were issues with the configuration, and IP address, etc. But ultimately after about 3 weeks, everything evened out and now there are no problems. Range is excellent, even poolside. the design is so smooth and aesthetic. Gave it 4 stars mainly because of support, and security."},{"rating":"2","title":"if security is your thing","review":"then this is the router to go with. I have no problem with it, however that doesn't mean you won't. Seems that it comes with pretty good support though from what others say. It's a faster router than most, if your PC is fast enough to tell the difference. In most reviews, be it magazine or otherwise, everyone has good thing to say about it. for novice, setting up all the security may be troublesome. referred by WhoSave.com, just checked it out, it's a great price for this great router.

Neatgear has to work this out and release a new firmware upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random Reboot","review":"I wish I had read reviews on this product before I purchased one. It does have an excellent range and it is fast ( when it works ), but it tends to reboot itself very often, especially if it is under heavy usage. My first guess was that it was over-heating, so I placed a large fan next to it overnight while I downloaded a few gigs worth of files, but with a room temperature of 65F and a 10\\" Fan blowing at it at full speed the wonder Netgear still managed to reboot itself several times over the course of 4 hours. In my honest opinion Netgear should stop selling this item until they fix the problem. I have been working on computers for over 15 years and I have worked as a technician for over 8 years. I'm not blowing smoke, save yourself the trouble and buy a linksys.F------ for the product. Worse router ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for basic use only","review":"This device worked well as long as I kept all the default settings, which is the way most home users will use it. However once I customized the router settings to interoperate with my in-home LAN, it became extremely unreliable. It would drop connections and refuse to re-establish them until the router was restarted, it would refuse remote management, and it would sometimes mysteriously alter its own settings. I used to rely on Netgear as a safe brand to purchase and rely on, but sadly the last two products I've bought from them have turned out to be throw-aways."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!","review":"They just say that is my internet provider problem when clearly it is not. Impossible to tell NETGEAR supporters that it isn't because they are INCOMPETENT in computers and can barely speak any English. It's like trying to get a monkey to help you with computer issues. When the 90 days ran out, then they said I had to pay for the PRIMIUM support service. MAYBE NOW I COULD GET 2 MONKEYS TO HELP ME AT ABOUT $50 PER 10 MINUTES.

When we had to reinstall the computer, though, the router never worked again. We tried using the setup CD, but it was useless.

I would not suggest this product to anyone......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeatedly Drops Signal","review":"Setup went smoothly but this router's performance was subpar. It regularly dropped the signal, requiring me to routinely reboot my computer. My rating reflects that fact that the replacement purchased is far superior...no dropped signal, even after starting up from the sleep mode.I read several negative reviews posted, but since there were a few positive ones, I made this risky purchase.

Since that time the router has been replaced by Netgear 3 times as it was defective and has stopped working again. The first time it stopped working, I spent several hours on the phone with a tech support rep that I could barely understand before he would agree that the unit was defective. The second and third times it stopped working, I needed to correspond with tech support via email unless I wanted to pay a $75 fee because the unit was over 90 days. Both times it took 6 weeks of emails back and forth before they would agree that the unit was defective. In each instance I needed to ship the router back at my cost before they would consider shipping out the replacement. Four defective routers in less than 18 months is crazy, not to mention I've had about 5 months of lost usuage during that time.

To make matters worse the router resets every 2-3 hours for some unknown reason. If you own one now, check the routers logs to see the reinitialization. I returned mine to Amazon.com.

Perfect for the sims who dread cleaning.Electric Guitar- They sound dreadful at first, but with a little practice your sims play great music.Sliding Glass Door- Ok, its not that special, but its really cool looking.

About 50% of the new features and hazards don't exist in real life (like the grim reaper) but oh well. Those features that make the game more fun.WARNING: This game is rated T. It's rated T for a lot of reasons. One thing is that it's very intense at points. The burglar's music may scare little kids. There are deaths in fires and drowning.

I know I will be buying the expanson pack right away.-Sims fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sims: Livin' Large and Livin' Better!!!!","review":"I didn't think that it was possible to make The Sims any better then it already was, but with the release of Livin' Large, I was proven wrong! This expansion pack has made the game 100% better then it was (if you can believe that!) and even more fun to play. Not only are there tons of new items, new scenerios and new decorating styles, but now there are FOUR new neighborhoods, to give you a total of 50 houses you can build! The possibilities are endless! Trust me, if you loved the original Sims, you will ADORE Livin' Large!!! I have been an avid lover of the Sims games (Sim City 1, 2000 and 3000, Sim Tower, Sim Farm, etc...) for many years, and now I am anxiously awaiting the release of Sim Town!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Livin' It Up","review":"Livin' Large wasn't bad, but I worship it compared to Vacation as it's got variety. Livin' Large has new items concentrated in the different ways of construction of a house. Lots of new doors, windows, wall textures and roofs are added as well as decoration items to go with the theme. I use the medieval theme a lot! It even includes the Love Bed, abduction of Sims are now possible through frequent use of the telescope, and Grim Reapers appear to decide the fate of your close-to-dead Sim who you can only save by beating it to a game of Stone-Papper-Scissors (cute).Livin' Large definately enhances the game, and it's absence would affect the game greatly unlike some other expansion packs I could mention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't commit a Crime........Buy the Expansion!!!!!!","review":"O.K.,so you like \\"The Sims\\". But there we some problems.....right??? Like not enough different types of lights, or just not enough space in the neighborhood. But this awesome expansion pack gives you 125 new objects (27 lights total....hehehe)and 4 more neiborhoods. Very Cool. This expansion also gives your sims the choise of 5 new jobs:musician, slacker, hacker, journalist, and Paranormal. Finally, this expansion pack includes more skins for more variety. In other words, just get the game.....trust me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Needs Reality?","review":"If you thought the original Sims was addicting, get ready for rehab: this add-on will have you at the computer for hours. I had gotten a little bored with the objects in the original and was ready for more options on decorating, jobs, etc. Livin' Large has all that and more.Want to live in a gothic, gloomy castle with candelabras, stone floors and walls, and suits of armor? You can get that here. Want a crazy, wacky pink house, with the tackiest furniture you can imagine and a big vibrating bed? Here it is. Just want some different things to decorate and amuse yourself with, like a chemistry set, a mini voodoo doll, a head floating in a jar, new paintings for the wall? It's all here, and much, much more.If you own the Sims already, this is a must have. If you are planning on buying the Sims, fork out a little more money and get this as well. I'm helplessly hooked. You will be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Livin' Large Just a tune up for SimsVille","review":"When Sim City was originally released in 1991, it changed the way we looked at computer games. When Sim City 2000 came out in 1994, we were astonished by it's beauty and complexity. When 'The Sims' crashed into the Number 1 spot of 1999 and stayed there through most of 2000, you just knew you had to get it. Now, Livin' Large expands on the concept of 'The Human Zoo' and makes the game even more fun and complex. With up to 5 neighborhoods to build, and dozens of new objects, walls, and floor to build with (real people don't spend all day downloading objects that don't work from fan sites ) I doubt you'll need to buy another game until the promise of SimsVille is fulfilled. Complete with all of the updates, you can fly and never land. I highly recommend the companion Prima hint book if you hadn't planned on getting it. It's worth the price just for the humor and cheat codes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one great game","review":"This has got to be one of the best games I have played in a long time. Sure, I don't stay up till 3:00am playing it, but I do stay on all afternoon. My Sims have done almost anything. I love the cheats, a nisesaty if u want all the cool stuff. The Grim Reaper is the BOMB man!! I saved a guy three times, and then I just let him die. The annoying thing is if you kill off all the people and move a new family in, that family will mourn for the people they didn't even know!! But a good game, very addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sims Livin Large","review":"I love Sims Livin Large. It's a great game but i find distracting that the weather can't change. I like the fact that they put new outfits and bodys in. And the new items to buy for your Sims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but Kinda Weird...","review":"There are some things that I liked about this expansion pack, and then there are many things that I did not care for. I DID like being able to have the new jobs, more lots, and some of the objects. The things I did NOT like are the weird objects, wallpaper, floors, and the list goes on. I actualy ended up selling this expansion pack to one of my friends, and he kinda likes it. If you want an awsome expansion pack, then you should get House Party. House Party has some things from Livin' Large that I liked, such as the the jobs and lots. I think that Livin' Large is an expansion pack for the Sim player that likes to make weird families, but if you want normal families like I do get House Party."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch","review":"I have all the sims games so far(including hot date) and this one hit an alltime low. many people thought that this game was better than house party but what they did not consider is the truth. This game was deffinitly better than house party if it had WORKED!!! This game made lots of problems for many people. My version did not even work until house party was instaled. this is the only expantion pack that caused so many problems for people. So if you really want to buy this game make sure that you keep the box and every thing because you have a 50-50 chance of this game not working"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game ever","review":"This game is THE best game in the world. It has endless play. I got this game as a christmas present after opening presents I went up to the computer to try it this was at 9:00 next thing I knew it was 3:00 in the afternoon. I was so facinated by the graphics and realism of this game. They can do just about anything you can do.Thisgame is rated Mature but I think it should be rated Everyone cuz I think everyone should play this game. I highly recomend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game in the Whole World!!","review":"The Sims is the best game that I've ever played and if I thought that was fun, I hadn't tried The Sims Livin Large. It was awesome! I made the best house! I recomend it to ANYBODY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like all of the game but...","review":"I know that I didn't really brought this game, I kinda rent it from my friend('caus' I had no money in the pocket) and, though I usually turn every game off in like 1 hour, this game was the only game that made me do this for more then 60 hour. Not only this, but all of the other packs. I love all of those things...The only probablem is that, they shouldn't sell the booklet seperately. The CD's are like $30, and why not have the booklet with the pack? I know that doing this is easy but, why not have one with it? I just hope that maxis would pay attention to what I mean.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great add on to The Sims!","review":"Great add on!Comes with more than 125 new ites, including a Magic Lamp, crystal ball, chemistry set and a love bed, witch lets you \\"play\\" in bed.It also comes with aboust 15 new skins, new jobs including Musician, Slacker, Paranormal, Journalism, and Hacker. Also included are four new neighbourhoods, although only a couple new houses, so you have to build your own houses.I deffinately recomend it, if you enjoyed The Sims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sims pack is a must","review":"the Sims is a great game, and you'll have hours of addictive fun. It seems like they think of everything! The livin' large expansion pack offers you better features and new items. If you end up getting addicted to The Sims, the expansion pack would be a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fun in a little box.","review":"The Sims Livin' Large expansion pack gives you many new object to interact with. New additions such as the cleaning robot make your Sim's life that much more opulant. If you're looking for more fun things for your Sims to interact with, i suggest you try the House Party expansion instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Livin Larger","review":"This was the better of the two expansions (livin large and house party). This not only updates your current version of sims it adds tons of new skins, objects (including the love bed), and even a robot. This is a great way to update the boring old sims to a new excinig one. Also works great to get HOT DATE with this too."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for Windows 95/98","review":"I am extremeley disappointed with this game because it will NOT run on Windows 2000 or higher. If you have Windows 95/98, this looks like it could be a really great game. I was really looking forward to playing it. But I spent 2 weeks dealing with techsupport at Electronic Arts and Microsoft, and can't get it to run. I wish EA would stop making their games only compatible with Win 95/98. They said it MIGHT run on XP, but I'm not about to go buy it just to play a game. Don't get any of the other expansion packs either if you have windows 2000, apparently NONE of them are compatible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dunno...","review":"I dunno. This game will be very good with the expantion but i'm not sure it's very appropiate for anybody below 11 or 12. Since it also has sex, violence, and all that other stuff, just in a non egaurated way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Sim game yet!","review":"The Sims didn't have engough. House Party was boring after 5 parties. Vacation was... useless. But Livin' Large has items I still use today! Now when your Sims die, you can plead to the Grim Reaper to keep them alive! There are potions that can make you fall in love, and genies that can set your house on FIRE! Make gnomes and launch rockets. Buy this game. It's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have an awesome cheat code for the Sims....beware!","review":"Love the add-on but was taken aback when I could no longer use my awesome cheat codes to obtain more financial support for my Sims, etc. I truly enjoy the new characters, Sim skins, etc. I also noticed that some of the employment opportunties earned less money than in the original Sims game. I am disappointed that the Sims never seem to get a day off and also have cockroaches showing up, even in the cleanest houses. Definitely purchase this, if you don't mind not being able to use the cheat codes for the original game. Sooner or later, they'll come out with new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly good horror/mystery","review":"I picked this book up at a warehouse bookstore for 2 dollars, so I wasn't expecting much. It surprised me by pulling me into the story quickly, and keeping up my interest in the central mystery for most of the book. Overall, a good, if slightly gruesome, way to spend a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pioneer Karaoke is the best","review":"I own several Karaoke DVD's. This is another disc from the Pioneer collection. Pioneer as the best videos and the best music that are on DVD. The only problem is they stopped making the DVD's before DVD caught on. If you have ever been to a karaoke club these are generally the same videos used there. However the ones in the clubs are usually on Laser Disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"see no. 3","review":"I wish I could review it but I could not even get started.

Bradfield for ruining the plot of this book by revealing what happens at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"A-hem. I know I'm the voice of dissent, but I hated this book and thought it was most likely to be written by someone in a flouridly psychotic state. Skip it. It's not worth the work it takes to read it. On second thought, it's great if you need an alternative to Ambien."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God this was a bad book.","review":"The producers of Lost owe me $10.36. This was a horrible book. FIRST OFF, the FOREWARD spoils the ending. Just HOW stupid is that? You have a book with a(n admittedly transparent) twist at the end and they tell you what that twist is in the foreward??? Sheer brilliance.The book is tedious, dry and something like \\"boring,\\" - but with less excitement. If you want to read about bicycles and boxes within boxes in archaic mid 19th Century Irish-English (or maybe Scottish-English) then this is for you. It is even worse than Tess of the d'Urbervilles. That should give you some reference.Seriously, I'm kidding around a little here, but this is a horrible book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Weird for Words","review":"Obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people. I am not one of them. Perhaps it's because I don't care for science fiction. I found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche. If, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you a Lost fan?","review":"Then read this book because it will give you hints to as what is going on in the series. If you are not a fan, this is a good book about a man, his bike, policemen, a world that can grant any wish, and of course...murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written yet confusing","review":"I'm not sure what to make of this book. It's like Dante's Inferno meets Alice In Wonderland. It is exceptionally well written and imaginative, but I frequently had trouble getting through it. After a while the footnotes (making reference to a fictional philosopher with outrageous theories) get old and you REALLY have to be in a mood to read them, because you have to pay attention to understand and otherwise they will lose you. And, unfortunately, the ending is predictable. But on the whole it is an interesting reading experience, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Weird for My Taste","review":"Too bizare for my taste and way out of my literary league.

For the 1940's it was well ahead of its time, and unpublished for 27 years because of this. Not recommended for those expecting an easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flann O'Brien","review":"Flann O'Brien was a great comedic and surrealist writer. This book is a wonderful, short and hilarious read. Don't expect anything less than confusingly surreal imagery and sick humor. One of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd, enjoyable, and a must for LOST fans","review":"I've seen other reviews that are referring to this as a comedy. I really don't see that, more that it's just odd, and in some cases just downright peculiar. The narrative style does get a bit rambling in places, but fits within the context of the book.I picked up this copy as it was one of the books that were shown within LOST and I wanted some further insight as to why it was there. For those LOST fans, it is a must read both for how it relates to the story, and just because you can gain perspective on Desmond Hume, who was the one who introduced it to us within the story. Only at the very end, as with LOST, do you realize just what is going on and why, though I enjoyed the ending of this book much more than the finale of LOST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cindy Freeman (Seegirlgo.com) Lost Book Club","review":"There is an interesting similarity between the narrator of The Third Policeman (who has no name by the way) and die hard Lost fans. The way in which the narrator studies the works of the fictional philosopher De Selby by not only reading every work he ever published, but every commentary ever published about his works, is similar to the way many Lost fans study the show. The narrator, I'll call him Joe, the name he gives his soul, even goes so far as to learn French and German in order to study commentaries in other languages. Lucky for me English is the native language of Lost (or is it?). Joe, is searching for a 'black box'. To tell you more would be to give away the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern classic - and funny as well!","review":"I had heard about this book in different circles, often in arty conversations, and on TV litarary discussions. Often called a dificult book to have written, and to pidgeon-hole, having a genre of its own. I can honnestly say that it is the best novel I've ever read. I remember nearly drowning in my bath tub when I read the passage where the hero, insults his soul (Joe) and joe threatends to leave him..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kafka meets Monty Python in this guided tour of hell.","review":"Though not as well known as Joyce, Yeats, Wilde, Shaw, or Beckett, Flann O' Brien is a major figure in Irish literature. \\"The Third Policeman\\" is a good introduction to his work - if you enjoy it, try \\"At Swim Two Birds\\" and \\"The Poor Mouth\\" as well.Take a murderer, a bicycle, a highly idiosyncratic Irish police station, then imagine how Kafka and Monty Python might use these elements as ingredients in a Groundhog Day plot, and you get perhaps the funniest depiction of Hell in all of literature. You'll certainly never read anything quite like this book again.Prepare to laugh until it hurts. This is a very funny book.4.5 stars and a strong recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning!","review":"Let me just say this... don't read the Forward before you read the book.

For what it's worth, the author has a real knack for painting a picture, but absurdist fiction is just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating, comical allegory .... but beware","review":"It took me two readings to appreciate the remarkably imaginative and multi-layered writing of this book. On first reading, I was too caught up in a sense of dread, waiting for the hammer to fall on \\"our hero.\\" Now I realize he isn't a hero at all, just a narrator to whom seemingly incomprehensible experiences, conversations, and landscapes appear, which more or less come into focus by the end of the book. The comical and absurd nature of much of this is what makes the book an enjoyable, thoughtful experience, but it took a second reading for me to appreciate it.My one caveat is that please, please, do not read or take seriously the hyper-modernist introduction by Denis Donoghue. He is focused on symbolism and a humorless Northrup Frye-type analysis, and so misled me that it took another try to appreciate all the human comedy of this book. The phrase \\"refusal of human warmth\\" at the end of his piece should have given it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Losties","review":"Quite peculiar book. Definite must-read for anyone watching Lost leading into season 6. You will see reminders and direct images from seasons 2 and 3 of Lost, and there is a major tie-in to season's 5 finale to be found here. Perhaps you may find some enlightenment on Ben's \\"magic box\\" or Jacob's cabin...As a standalone, it's still an interesting read with great plot twists. Worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Health Care Financing","review":"Anybody that is concerned about the rising costs of health care in America should read this book. As a physician, I am disappointed at the lack of leadership in medicine as well as among the politicians.We are sending the current bills for health care to our children.

Tech's got skills, but he is not displaying his talents. Homeboy needs something else to rap about, besides that devil stuff is weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give it 2 stars because it's different...","review":"Tech N9ne hates the mainstream, but he sure goes out of his way to be a part of it. He's nothing spectacular, his beats are typical hip-hop junk, and his lyrics are dumb. Why would he brag about first having sex at the age of five? Maybe to a complete loser, that's respectable, but not to anyone with any type of basic human decency. This is ordinary, unimaginative rap, and while he goes fast sometimes, he basically sounds like Mystikal with a hint of harmony. Nothing evil about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"tech-9 is hella wack","review":"Im not going to say much but tech is wack. His lyrics don't make any sence and sound like a bunch of jibber jabber. His ideas are wack. His lyrics make about as much sence as the name of this album. In my opinion he is not proffesional quality. He's been rapping along time, 10yrs and needs to give up and get a day job somewhere. That's the truth! but to make a long story short, hes got a lot of people messed up listen to his wierd nonsence rapping, for instance trying to rap a whole song backwards(like people are going to sit back and try to flip all his words around and figure out what he saying). I dont' know how to characterize his rap because I don't think it has a place in the game. If U want to Here real MIDWEST rappers from K.C look up RICH DA FACTOR and BIG HAM. CAN I JUST GIVE HIM 0 STARS?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"this cd was already a classic when it was first released, but w/ addition to these 3 new tight ... cuts it makes the album even better, it's just too bad I already had the original anghellic, so i pretty much paid 15 bucks for 3 songs, but since tech n9ne is hands down the best lyricist ever it was worth it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply unbelievable","review":"Just as it says above, Tech is simply unbelievable. His flow and lyrics are unprecedented in the rap world. On Anghellic, Tech delves into his personal life and the struggles within it, as well as his thoughts on the world, and everybody from any walk of life can relate to the subject matter of this album. Bottom line, if you want to hear some rap with some heart put into it, give Anghellic a listen, but if you like the mindless \\"bling, bling, rollin' on 20's\\" stuff, then this is probably too deep for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I think Tech's cd AngeHellic is a great cd, i had the pleasure of meeting Tech and i think he is one of the most down to earth people i have ever met. I had the chance to hang out with him and listen to practically allof his music. His music means alot to him, and to me. He raps about things he knows and that's what i like the most, he tells it how it is. I hope to own a copy of all of his cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot!","review":"First off i wanna say that at first i wasn't feeling this album at all... i'm from the east coast so i'm used to hearing east coast rap but when i heard this album here... i was like what the f is going on. so i didn't think twice bout listening to it. well i got around to listening to it again.. than again and again after that and it is absolutely tight as hell. his rhymes and the beats just all stuck together. his songs get stuck in your head and for the whole day ya can't get it out unless you listen to it. i'd defintely recommend yall get this because it doesn't get any better than this.listen to da TECH N9NE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"let me set something strait","review":"....This is one of the most bangin albums I have ever heard, its defenately the best i heard in 2001. This album is so damn wild!!! Every track is bangin. The production is very nice and his lyrics just add hype to this album. Its kinda hard to compare this to any other rapper because Tech9ne is so unique. If you ever heard him from Yukmouth's Thug Lord album you know he tears up the mic.

NOT WORTH A DIME, or a PENNY for that matter! Don't even download this, if its FREE!I was given this cd and now i know why!

This sounds like it could have been a pretty good album. The production quality is horrible. It sounds like they are singing from inside a coffee can, inside a phone booth. The songs sound like they would be okay if the quality of the recording was better. I have other stuff that is much older than this album that has stellar production quality and A-1 sound quality, so I don't know what the problem was. Before this was released, they should have listened to it and then fired their technician and then redone the whole thing from scratch. I was very disappointed with this. I could not even stand to listen to it, it actually hurt my ears. I felt sorry for the band, that this was what their creation was turned into."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"The wife of account holder speaking here. :) My sleeping problem is over!

There is a 3lb weight limit and that is generally sufficient for whatever you want to use the hook for. However, I initially got these to use to hang pictures with in an apartment, and for that purpose they didn't work very well because of the design of the product because many times once I hung the picture on the hook you could see part of the white showing above the top of the picture frame. Other than that I recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far good item","review":"This has been a good item to use so far for holding up light things. I am still concerned to have anything heavier than a couple pounds, as I fear it will fall down. It's not very attractive but very practicakl, good to hang up a swifter or light broom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy product","review":"I've tried these 3M Command Hooks and don't like them. I'm not exactly sure why I don't like them, but I don't like how they work. Applying them is clumsy, and removing them is less than smooth. They don't work well, and the process is not satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utilitarian...Great for the right job","review":"Style-wise, these \\"designer\\" hooks look very utilitarian. However, they stay put as long as one does not tempt fate with too heavy a job. I use them strictly for light-duty hanging of non-fragile items where a standard through the wall/door hook would not work. Within the limits of the design and intended use, they do a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"As with most Command hooks I've used these were very easy to \\"install\\" and very dependable.I've had these on the back of the bathroom door to hold towels and they are fantastic. The hook is deep enough to hold bath towels. They are extremely sturdy too.I love that they can be easily removed without damaging the surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me - on a smooth surface","review":"The hook worked well and is holding an item that is just under 3 pounds. The removal is easy; it took me a little while to figure out the instructions but once I did, it worked.The only issue I had was not being able to mount the hook on a textured wall. To work properly I found the surface has to be smooth with full contact.If this the type of hook you need, I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"3M is definitely one of my favorite \\"Go To\\" brands since they have always been very reliable and their products are usually of excellent quality. They are easily removable to avoid damage to your walls and do hold up very well. Although I couldn't get one of my hooks to stay up with just the weight of a thin bath robe on it...I think it was more of it not wanting to stick to the high gloss painted door. I stuck it back up after rubbing alcohol in the spot I wanted to hang it back on so we will see if it holds. Otherwise 3M hooks are very good and I would buy more but they are not attractive by any means since it is made of cheap white plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great handy easy to use wall hooks","review":"Great simple to attach, and no messy ripped holes in the walls or doors when you decide you need to remove them. Two hooks come in a pack, very reasonably priced. Easy stick on, just clean the area with alcohol, let it dry, then press the adhesive strip onto the back of the hook, then remove the paper cover over the adhesive, then press the hook onto the area chosen, and then pull up the hook against the surface, and then back down again, and it's done, you can use it in one hour's time.

They are really neat . These come in different weight capacities and stick on and come off the wall easily. But I must warn you to stay well within the specified weight limits or your frames or whatever it is you hang on them will come falling down. Which can be rather dangerous. Experienced it once and almost chipped off a gorgeous glass painting for tipping slightly over the weight limit.. All in all a good investment to protect your walls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for anything in the house.. almost","review":"So my wife and i have used these since they came out, all over the house. And for the first time on actually FAILED. we couldnt believe it.So we ve used em in the kitchen for a pot or two inside a cabinet, out of site and to hang the grill utensils on.In laundry room for cat litter scoop.These things will stick on wood, plastic, metal, etc..The one place it failed was the tub. We have a one piece fitter bath/shower tub. We had a shower caddy, not too heavy, a shampoo bottle, 2 conditioner bottles, and a baby shower mini tub on the caddy. The hook was on for well over a year and one day it all came crashing down shattering the cap of the shampoo and made a mess.I think maybe the slick surface of the fitter tub, + weight, + humidity let the adhesive just give out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"You need good quality hooks to hang stuff and does not leave marks on the wall; this does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"love these things!!","review":"If you enjoy decorating for each holiday this is the product for you.

Don't plan on using them anyplace where you have to look at them! They appear cheap and flimsy (although they aren't actually cheap) and they are not as useful as the word \\"medium\\" implies - think a hat or a washcloth, rather than a purse, and definitely not a wet bathtowel.

So, I have used these on painted walls, painted wood, your basic laminated-type fiberboard cabinets and doors, wood cabinets, and glass...and all worked well except the glass, which left a bit of sticky residue. Otherwise they went up easily, stayed stuck, and came off easily after months of use.When removing these, I had one or two tab pieces snap off (see uploaded photo) but there was usually still enough to grab to pull it off the wall. I also learned that you really need to keep a hand on the piece that's stuck to the wall as you're stretching the adhesive, otherwise you'll get cracked in the knuckles when it suddenly pops off the wall.The biggest challenge is remembering where you put the extra sticky tabs so you can reuse the hooks after you take them down...but that's not the fault of the hanger. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little extras","review":"I was skeptical about the durablity of these hooks. To start I have them in my bathroom on the tile. It's a no brainer to attach them to the wall when following the easy set up instructions. I was worried between the kids and it being on the surface of tile that they would be down in a week. They have withstood the kids torturing them with wet towels, bathing suits and toys with strings, as well as the items being yanked off the hook. I'm anxious to see how easy they come off, but I'm no ready to move them. I'm looking forward to purchasing more for other little odds & ends.So I moved a hook from my tile. Simple. Didn't leave a smudge. I put it in my shower to hold my showet caddy on the rear wall. It's large size chrome caddy holing 3 large bottles of shampoo, 4 bars of soap, razors, sponges, face cleanser and two hanging bottles of body wash!!

I found the shape is ok for hanging anything with a string or loop, and the pair work well for displaying some of the random knickknacks I bring back from my travels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well enough - not \\"designer\\" though, just plastic","review":"I have textured walls with many valleys and peaks and generally speaking the Command Adhesive products have a bit of a hard time hanging on since they can't get a great grip unless I happen to find a singular smooth surface. However with these medium hooks the piece of adhesive is pretty large so they have a little more to \\"grab on to\\". I don't really use them to hang anything very heavy - just as curtain rope hooks. I'm not sure why these are called \\"designer\\" though, unlike the metal hooks, these are simple white plastic. They are a nice beveled shape though, I suppose that's why they can charge an extra few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great 3M product","review":"I received these hooks from the Amazon Vine program with a specific use in mind. I wanted to hang my daughters' two heavy Lands' End backpacks in their bedrooms, but didn't want to put holes in the wall, if possible. I fastened these hooks to the inside of their closet doors (which is slick and shiny) and they fastened just fine. The packaging says to leave them for 8 hours before hanging anything on them, which I did, and then hung my girls' backpacks. The hooks are holding them up just great and don't show any signs of pulling off the wall. I am very pleased with how easy these were to attach and use - much thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy installation, limited strength","review":"I put one of these hooks up in the guestbath intending for it to hold a bathrobe. It wasn't quite strong enough to hold a traditional adult size terrycloth robe - within a couple of minutes the entire hook just sort of slipped off the door and to the floor. GRRRRR...... So I put the second one up in the kitchen where it's currently holding 3 lightweight pot holders. The directions say to clean the area for the hook with rubbing alcohol and I imagine there is a specific reason for this, but if you don't have any alcohol handy, Purell will work as well. The package also states that each hook will hold up to 3lbs and I feel certain that probably wishful thinking. I will say this though - the second one in the kitchen has stayed up for several days now with no failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient, easy to use, does the job!","review":"These are perfect hooks to use if you want to be able to hang something without having to drill a hole in the wall and install a permanent hook. Instead of using screws or nails, these hooks attach by using an adhesive. You simply stick them on the wall - that's it, no tools required. I'd recommend waiting a few hours or even a day before actually hanging something from them, to give the adhesive sufficient time to bond (if you live in a dry climate, you may not need a full day, but still better safe than sorry). The best thing about these hooks is how easy they are to remove - you simply pull the tab and off they come. If there's a little residue left afterwards, it's easy to wipe away, and your wall will look as good as new afterwards. Make sure to get the right size, depending on what you want to hang from it (weight etc.). I definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"I would like to hug whoever invented these.

I can say nothing bad about these and I believe every household should have about 10.

Cannot use near heat source (such as near cook stove) as can lose adhesion above 105 degrees.

I prefer Gettysburg to Antietam because it is so much easier to control effectively a smaller number of troops. Antietam has more detailed uniforms, but I don't think that was really neccesary. Antietam also changes and extends the type of cannon you can use in the battle. Another good improvement is the firing damage arrows. These can tell you if a certain posiion is unholdable. Both games work quite well on ME or 95, but you really need to have a fast computer. A good improvement would be the ability to improve your unit's weapons. I think that for 15 dollars, this game is a good buy. However, I think that if I did it all over again, I would just buy Gettysburg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, hope to see future advanced release","review":"* The game's control lets you focus on the strategy, not keyboad typing or mouse moving.

With the typical rear baskets that hang down from the rack you have a low center of gravity and that's good but when you carry a heavy load in this type of basket sitting up high atop your rack you better be fit and have a very good sense of balance because it can easily throw you off balance. Once I get rolling it's okay but I have my saddle up too high to keep my feet on the ground when starting and that moment there when I'm pushing off to get started and up into my saddle I have to work hard to stay balanced and I believe it's because of the load being up high.

I don't know what happened to Edwin's songwriting capabilities, and to his penchant for creating catchy and memorable melodies...but this album has no memorable songs, except for maybe \\"Hearts Fall,\\" which like \\"I'll Be\\" could be the theme for just about any romantic comedy produced in the last 5 years.

John Schneider was the only good acting that I could see. It was a shame that the message was so good, but didn't come off well. The \\"bad guy\\" character was a charade and \\"too\\" phoney \\"bad\\". There wasn't any realness to most of the characters. The fact that they chose a woman to be the \\"good\\" mayor bothered me. Good and godly male leaders is what we need in this world (of course, that's just my personal feeling that I would have liked to have seen in the movie).On a side note, I watched a movie called \\"Radio\\" that caught the realness and godliness of living for others. It is a shame that It wasn't advertised with a Christian name such as this one, because that it is definitely what was happening in that movie. I highly recommend that movie if you want to see Christ-like living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair.","review":"The movie was a little slow on the slow side at times, but a good message after all.

I was so excited for this movie, but it didn't even follow 1/2 of the storyline of the book. Sometimes movies are good - just different - despite the fact that they strayed from the book, but this one destroyed itself. It should have just stuck with the storyline and it maybe could have survived. The changes that they made totally destroyed the story, making it almost unbearable to watch. If the storyline was good I could have put up with the horrible acting, but there was nothing good about this movie. I am giving my copy to goodwill, and would not recommend this to anyone!!

Real life situations would be more impressive than the pseudo down-and-out characters they try to portray. Everyone is one-dimensional and a high schooler could write better.

They aren't all that common anyway, so you would think they would be standard, but they're not. This replacement is slightly taller than the thin walled one that came with the brewer, resulting in it being difficult to place under the filter housing. It's annoying.Which is why they have now bought the license rights to sell a Keurig with their name on it.

I found the trick is to keep the lid open when pouring. This seems to provide enough air to make the coffee come out smoothly. I got the idea because I emailed the vendor complaining and he called me back and remarked that most 4-cup carafes made nowadays have this problem--one of engineering--and it has to do with not enough air coming into the carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"fragile, handle with care","review":"this carafe is so prone to breaking even without dropping. the plastic top breaks easily and when i cleaned the carafe with a dish brush, it cracked and a big hole was left in the glass. it is now in the garbage. a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a replacement...","review":"This is an exact replacement for the original so no issues with fit, etc. However, the lid is loose on the decanter and pops out easily.

To my mind, it is functionally not compatible with the 4 cup machine like it should be - this is really a 5 cup decanter (you can see this because when you click on the picture you can see the 4 cup mark and the fact that the glass extends well above this line). While it technically does fit if you shove it under the machine and jerk it out again, you really shouldn't do that with a) glass and b) hot liquids. I regularly have to replace my decanter because the glass just doesn't last as long as the original machine, but I'll never buy this one again, I'll buy one that is actually 4 cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story Of Will Rogers (Narrated By Bob Hope)","review":"The perfect combination with the great Bob Hope telling the story of the fabulous Will Rogers.

This game plays and feels like a real soccer match would, the commentary, while somewhat repetitive, is still an improvement over the previous two games. Also, the difficulty level is challenging but not impossible, another improvement over the previous two games.

If you don't have a 3D accelerator card installed, then the graphics in the game are just pathetic.

Overall, I am really sorry about my money that I spent on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is ridiculous","review":"I don't know what EA Sports are doing. I have played 97 to 2001 of the FIFA series, and I found some interesting things. Indeed, the graphics are improving, but the game play are worsening. There is no way to call this a good simulation game. Do you expect the golie to fly around and make impossible moves? Do you expect a player to spin 3 times in a row to avoid tackles? Do you expect each player to use overhead kick that easily? EA Sport has insulted every single soccer player, and the world of soccer. If FIFA 2002 were going to be similar of worse than 2001, I think EA Sports should stop right away. EA Sports deserves no right to develop soccer games."},{"rating":"2","title":"best football game out there","review":"I was watching a football match on TV... on wait, it's just the new fifa game... they made the pitch bigger, they added the linesman... on each side :), the players look like their respective real life counterparts (and move like them as well), the stadiums (not many though) look stunning, they brought back the great commentators back... good lord people, even if you're not a gamer, get yourself this game, so when they're showing golf on ESPN, just load this game up and watch some football!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"This game is great.

Otherwise it has gotten worse: The game is slow, if you pass the ball it goes in slow motion and stops after just a few yards. The teams are not complete: Portugal is simply not there despite the fact that they played extremely well this year. European championships are a simple playoff. No groups to qualify for the next round, ...In my opinion, a typical game that was created by people who might know a lot about graphics, but have never touched a soccer ball in their lives.It's a pitty, because you could make this game a lot of fun with some minimal work.

The reviews told of an erotic tale of a couple with marital problems. I found it quite disturbing. Not because of the abundance of nudity and sexuality.

I suggest to anyone who has suffered the same trauma as the wife in this film, to not see it, because YOU will most likely end up needing therapy!

You can't cure borderline disorder by srewing the brains out of your patient (or even your wife). You can't understand much of anything about the disorder by watching the movie either. The worst thing that the movie does is provide false hope for an easy fix. The most optimistic therapists for borderline disorder state that it takes 3-7 years of dedicated therapy for someone suffering from the disorder to make a significant recovery.The one thing that is relatively realistic is the confused reaction of the husband, who really can't figure out which way is up to save his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This COULD'VE BEEN really good!

These stick right on the window, so I have gotten some unbelievable pictures of the little guys. Unfortunately, Droll Yankees has radically changed the design. The new feeder only has three parts (not counting the suction mechanism) compared to ten parts on the old feeder. Therefore, it is much cheaper for them to manufacture while keeping the price the same. I have four of the old feeders and one of the new ones on one window. The birds won't touch the new feeder unless the others are all empty and they are desperate. They have a difficult time perching on the new rim, where they have no trouble perching on the old one. I think the new design must have been tested on the smaller east coast hummingbirds - the larger Anna's can't perch on it well at all. Very, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks Leaks Leaks","review":"I was so excited to find this feeder...filled it, attached to my window, and within an hour all the liquid had leaked out.

Just reach out the adjacent window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love to see the hummers up close and great customer support","review":"I have several of these feeders and love them. So do the hummingbirds. I have not had leaking, but the suction cups eventually wear out and need to be replaced. I do try to fill below the half-way point seam (but usually go higher) and if you fill above the ports gravity will win out and nectar will leak. One bracket broke when the suction cups did not hold, but I have been using it like that for several years and it holds just fine.I just had a red squirrel attack one of the feeders and he destroyed the flower ports (removed by him to drink the nectar). I am not remotely interested in replacing the feeder with another brand. I am very happy with these feeders. I think they are well made, well worth the money, and they looks great.Update:I searched the Droll Yankee website for replacement ports, but could not find them. I e-mailed the company and they are sending me free replacements. Very good customer support."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASY to fill!!","review":"My family are all avid bird watchers.

Now I begin it at breakfast, but find myself picking it up again and again during the day. Its portability is a big plus. Another big plus is the cost difference.

They promised to credit me for the ruined papers but that never happened either. After my calls to the hotline (expect 10 to 15 minutes waits) my coupons were picked out of my Sunday paper.

An excellent self-teaching resource for intermediate to advanced students and practitioners of Java programming, Java Reflection In Action is packed from cover to cover with examples, flowcharts, sample code, and more, all effectively designed to facilitate instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction, flimsy second part","review":"First of all: this is a GREAT INTRODUCTION to Reflection, definite MUST READ for any Java developer who did not use Reflection before.Overall: I would recommend buying after I've read the book.Now, a less glorious side... This book is OLD. It is based on Java 1.4 and Java 5 was only in works when it was published, so annotations and generics are not really covered: they are mentioned as \\"well... let's wait until it gets finalized and then Reflection would be likely expanded to cover these topics\\"...The second part of the book (starting from \\"code generation\\") is perceived by me as a collection on hacks which authors put into this book just to make up the volume...Anyway: book is definitely worth reading :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for every Java Programmer","review":"This book gives a complete overview of the reflection concepts and its use in Java. Nowadays reflection is a topic that every programmers have to cope with but few of them really understand what are its potentiality.This book helps in this direction it doesn't only cover the canonical aspects of reflection in Java such as the API and the programming but also some critical aspects usually neglected by the other books on the same topic such as the performance issues and code generation. It also explores the dynamic aspect of reflection in Java presenting in a good and interesting way the Proxy classes.Moreover the book is really well written and I have appreciated the George's example that follows us all along the book, I find the explaination by example the better way to teach new concepts. So if you are looking for a book that explain you the magic of Java reflection this book is the book that you have to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful performance, excellent DTS mastering!","review":"Classical music has been the most frequently applied genre of music for surround sound recording. This is all good and dandy, but in my experience, I've been disappointed at how many recordings use the rear channels for little more than mimicking large hall reverb.... Not here! This gem of a Stereo-CD / DTS combo is proof of what surround mixing can do for classical masterpieces. From the Waltz of the Flowers to the Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies, you can really hear and feel the difference of being truly immersed in the middle of the orchestra as it plays.Fortunately, not only is the surround sound great, but the performance is wonderful as well. You will not be disappointed by this disc, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary!!!","review":"Like Daizy, I also felt that I needed to understand what really happened in Lebanon and how the civil war affected the lives of so many innocent Lebanese. Unlike Daizy who was around when the war broke out, I wasn't. I began to hear about Lebanon through the news on television and my father reading the Arabic newspaper in the late 80's, early 90's. It is now, in 1999 that I have a clearer view of what happened to Lebanon and to the Lebanese people. I would like to congratulate Daizy for making this film and encourage all young Australian-Lebanese (even around the world) who want to know more about Lebanon to watch this film. Don't get me wrong, this film doesn't give you all the answers you are looking for but you are given a new perspective about Lebanon and the civil war, through the eyes of a young Australian Lebanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Story","review":"Jane Candia Coleman has become one of my favorite authors. She knows what she is writing about and she seems to understand the times so well. This is a wonderful book that describes Pearl's life and struggles.

I could not put it down and recommend it to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"very weak attempt","review":"This is probably the weakest of the surviving Murnau films; after watching this one, its very evident as to why he didn't try comedies again. Lots of characters, very difficult to keep track of who is who and who is supposed to be doing what. And what was supposed to be funny in most cases just wasn't. Fortunately its a very short film at less than 80 minutes; by that time you will be ready for the film to end. The only extra on the dvd is a commentary, obviously Kino didn't want to put a lot of money into this one. If you are looking for an introduction to Murnau's films, don't try this one first, but instead watch his classics such as Nosferatu, Faust, or The Last Laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks appropriate with almost anything","review":"This watch has a good, solid look to it, is very comfortable, and works with everything except very dressy evening wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost, confusing piece of film","review":"I purchased this based on the amazing reviews...I should have asked around a bit more. I think this suffers from that 'art house' group who think that anything that is 'out there' or simply different means it is better.My family (wife, 12 and 7 year olds) absolutely hated me for making them suffer through this, and in fact it has become a running joke whenever I pick a film \\"not another Mirrormask is it dad?\\"The film was interesting looking, and if that was the only aim, it was a successes. Other than that it is confusing, bizarre, at times even painful film of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Henson rolls over in his grave","review":"This film was incredibly painful to watch. Someone needs to look up the word \\"pace\\" and read it to director Dave McKean. I was expecting a real cutting edge film here and if you are expecting the same, you will be let down. I subtracted a star for the lousy directing, one for shabby editing, one for a story line that doesn't quite know where it wants to go and one for the lack of acting ability, particularly in our 'heroine.' (her smirk really got on my nerves). I highly doubt that Jim Henson, were he alive, would've had anything to do with this horrific waste of time....I also doubt that most pre-teens will find this film engaging. It may be a bit too dark and/or over the heads of children.Was this even in the theaters for more than a couple of weeks? No?? Now THAT makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The packaging was broken","review":"The disk hub had been torn off and the dvd was full of marks.

I loved Neil Gaiman'sAnansi Boys, but it doesn't look like he was too involved with Mirrormask.All of the characters, including the lead, are annoying. This combined with terrible special effects gave me no reason to watch any more. This film is obviously geared toward kids, which is fine by me, but it's a shame that it looks like such little effort was put into it. Neil Gaiman's writing deserves so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment","review":"I bought this dvd because I am a fan of Neil Gaiman and also because of the good reviews from people here on Amazon. With much anticipation, my hubby and I put the kids to bed early and sat down to watch it. After about an hour of the movie we were looking at each other wondering how it could have gotten such good reviews! Now, keep in mind that I have all of Neil Gaiman's books and I rather enjoy them...but this movie was so boring!!! I am sad that I spent the money on buying it instead of renting it first. I HIGHLY recommend renting it before purchasing so you can make your own judgement. As for me...well, this dvd is NOT going to stay in our collection of dvd's, as it will not be watched again! The Neverwhere movie, though poorly budgeted, was MUCH better...the story iis wonderful even if the movie itself was cheaply made. I recommend that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New World","review":"Not since The City of Lost Children has such a wonderful surreal masterpiece been produced. The movie follows Helena a 13 year old girl whos family owns a circus. Helena and her mother have a disagreement and gets sick. Later in the movie Helena falls into a dream world of mystery and illusions.Like The City of Lost Children the movie follows its own visuals and its own logic. Also like the other movie it feels like a whole new world with it's own new world. You can't fight or try to figure out the movie you just have to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A visual feast!","review":"If you enjoy state of the art graphics you will find this film interesting. The story is predictible with psichological contents we have already touched or heard of,but art direction is so much worth to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastical experience: MirrorMask","review":"This is one video that will delight you every time you watch it. It's a visual delight and makes you want to join a circus, become an artist, a puppeteer and follow your dreams into the next realm. Has all the emotional elements of ensuring viewers' entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and riveting... what just went on?","review":"This is not, in any way, shape, form, or mirror, a \\"normal\\" movie. It is an explosion of creative energy in acting, costumes, set design, and animation. This is the first movie I've seen where I would suggest that every person that watches this movie ends up with a unique perspective of what they just saw. This movie is about relationships, desires, wishes, concerns, friendships, art, perspectives, and villians.The most similar movie I can think of, in terms of how it makes you FEEL, is Fantasia, and it is not even that close to Mirrormask. How about Narnia meets Fantasia in the land of The Dark Crystal? My suggestion, for those of you who liked Mirrormask, is to now see Spirited Away, directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Like Fantasia, and Spirited Away, you will see and feel something different every time you see these movies.Did I like it? I think my skin is still tingling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woah","review":"Woah. That was the only word I can use to describe this movie. It was really amazing, and just... amazing. The images were incredible, and the world was so surreal. I happened to stumble upon this movie in Blockbuster, and upon reading the back cover I grabbed it and went to check it out. I'm glad I did. It's a good movie for teenagers, because it shows a moody teen growing up into a young woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful","review":"I remember when I heard that Henson productions was coming out with something else I got a little worried. How could they follow up Labyrinth? The Dark Crystal? The Storyteller? Not to worry. While this film doesn't resemble those other films, it is unique and captivating. They manage to create another new world. It's based on the art of Dave McKean and I was worried about that as well as his print stuff is incredible but I didn't know how it would work in 3-D. It works great. I felt like I was watching something *new*. I highly recommed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"visually amazing, lacking everywhere else","review":"i too waited a couple of years to see this film arrive in the USA, and wanted to love this film so very much. i've always loved Dave and Niel's work in the past, and i expected this to be no less wonderful. sadly, i left feeling empty. while the efforts and the visuals were worth a rental, the storyline took Mirrormask to the edge of what could have been a hugely successful masterpiece and dumbed it down. it is too scary and dark for young kids, too wierd for tweens, too childish for adults. with more defined dialog and a coherant plot, the film could have been a classic for all ages. this just seems like a spoiled rotten little kid dressed up for the fancy ball with no one to take them there. i for one, am greatly disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great movie to watch with the whole family. Fantastically creative and excitingly imaginative! I loved it just as much as my kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I don't know if I should have read the book first, or if this movie just was not my cup of tea. I fell asleep trying to watch this movie. Needless to say, it didn't keep my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered!!!","review":"I ordered this directly from Amazon, not a private seller.When I got the DVD, the snap to hold the disc was broken, so the DVD had been rattling around in its case throughout shipment, and was covered with scratches. I decided to try and see if it was still viewable, so we gave it a try. The movie played fine, IN ITALIAN!!! Its an English film, they are very clearly speaking english, but apparently Amazon is not quite as concerned with what internationally released version you get. I will be returning this immediately. Thanks for absolutely nothing, and for waisting my shipping money, Amazon.Oh, and the film was interesting but odd. Im sure I couldve followed it more without subtitles and in its original language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henson co. produces trash now","review":"unbearable. This film has a Weak plot and tries to compensate with aesthetics and eclecticism. Jim's daughters produce trash. Under their watch, and with more releases like this, the Henson co. will never be relevant again. it's a shame really."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad trip","review":"Had I been in Haight-Ashbury during the '60s, I probably would have described this film as a bad trip....mostly unpleasant and not entertaining in the least. Today this is what passes for art, but only amongst the artist's peers and relatives, as the majority of people will just consider this to be a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, pretentious","review":"If a movie hasn't captured my interest within 15 minutes, it's toast. After 15 minutes of viewing this turkey I had only a fuzzy notion of what the story was about, none of the characters were engaging in the slightest, but I had been bombarded with heavily overdone visual effects. I shut it down. Save yourself 15 minutes of disappointment and just pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I practice ping pong in the nude in the mirror every day","review":"Oh boy. I just don't get the foreign angle to most stories. They just keep going and going and going. Just when you think it's over, bam! something else comes up. At the end I always feel like saying \\"What just happend?\\"Also, the boy/girl love connection is a bit off. The girl seems way too young for the male love interest. I guess we're supposed to believe 10 years passed by without the girl maturing AT ALL. I guess it could happen like it did in Star Wars except it still wasn't convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feast For The Eyes","review":"One of the best fantasy, special effects films I've ever seen. Surrealism that totally engrossed me. I'd call it a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it before you buy it.","review":"This movie was so terrible that I really don't know where to begin. I'm giving it a 2 because the artwork and music were really interesting, but the plot was hard to follow and very bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 pounds of story in a 20-pound box, or a special-effects demo reel?","review":"DO NOT expect the epic quests of \\"Dark Crystal\\" or \\"Labyrinth.\\" If you weren't told that this came from the same people, you would never guess it.Visually stunning, 45 minutes after pressing Play I was still waiting for the story to start getting interesting. By an hour in, I had given up and was wondering who to give it to. Someone who will appreciate the incredible imagery but not notice the minor little detail that this movie is BOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRING!!!!!There are some excellent sequences, but it seems that the film was done in the \\"Now What Oddball Idea Can We Put Here?\\" school of cinema. It is disjointed and maundering, and proof that it is possible for a film to be TOO much like real dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"Boring. Stupid. Confusing. I give it points for some great special effects... but it still didn't work for me. Maybe if I had read the story it was based on it would have been better. Unless you like artsy films... go watch something else, Potter, Narnia, the new Wonka... a bunch of bad 80's music videos even. You really don't need to watch this. Go outside instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good....But Really Isnt","review":"In a few words, I wasn't really crazy about it. I remember seeing the book for it in a bookstore some time ago and thinking that this movie was going to be dark and really cool and it was dark indeed, but sadly the plot was very boring. the cg environments were very cool to look at but the characters were not. Movies like the dark crystal, never ending story and labrynth are comparable to this in genre and all had a plot, a mood and an objective storyline. This was just random eye candy. I'm giving this one 2 stars, because it looks really nice and the cinematography was well done. Visually, the movie is nice to look at and the soundtrack is decent also, but the anticlimatic plot and storyline are rather disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Visual","review":"I GIVE FIVE STARS!!! NOT ONE! MY MISTAKE!!!I can't help but say that I loved this movie! It was extremely visual and unique. I've seen nothing like this ever before! All I can say is you either hate it or like it. What irritates me is people saying that it was too boring or they couldn't follow it. My 9 year-old cousin understood it and the next day bought the DVD. I just think people aren't open-minded anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Visuals, but Overall Dull Story. 19 out of 100.","review":"The visuals kept my interest only long enough to find out that the story was dull.

Acting. How good was the acting?4 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?2 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace.

Is this movie a must buy/purchase?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't finish it","review":"Being a fan of Neil Gaiman's writing, and a lover of fantasy movies, I had high expectations for this film. I thought the asthetic was beautiful, but the plot was flimsy and the dialogue uninteresting. It was beginning to feel like a chore to watch it and I gave up before it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaimen+McKean= Crazy delicious","review":"The best advice I can give is not to imbibe in any mind altering chemicals before viewing this film, it is a mind altering chemical in and of itself.Brilliant surreal imagery, a stand up cast and a spin on classic storylines, everything you can expect from Neil Gaimen.If you grew up on films like The Dark Crystal, The Labyrinth, The Never Ending Story, Krull, Legend, or any of those amazing 80's dark fantasy movies, this film is for you.If you read Sandman, Neverwhere, American Gods, Stardust or anything by Gaimen, this film is also for you.If you want to try something radically different, then again, this movie is for you.Otherwise, turn away, fold your hands peasant, this is not for you.PS- really, love the cast, can't wait to see more from Jason Berry and Stephanie Leonidas"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Charmless and ineffective experiment by illustrator Dave McKean and vastly overrated Douglas Adams clone Neil Gaiman. Who is this film for? What is it about? One is never sure. It just goes on and on, toying listlessly with commonly misconcieved 'fairy-tale' elements in ways that have been done better elsewhere, running in circles until it runs out of tropes and abruptly ends. The characters are flat, the writing self conscious and empty and the visuals eye-tiringingly cheesy and monotonous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Henson Studios at their best","review":"Despite being written and produced by the studio after the death of Jim Henson, this movie is still great. Creepy, interesting, visually fantastic - following in the footsteps of Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. Critics have given mixed reviews, but all agree that the visuals are praiseworthy, even if not all are interested in the teenage angst of the protagonist. Watch worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a magnificent movie-- for those who are fans of Jim Henson (ie Labyrinth, Dark Crystal) you will not be disappointed. The visual effects are dazzling, and much more up-to-date than other classic Henson films. The only reason I suggest a little hesitation to viewers is that the plot is not so one-tracked as the others. Although you will be drawn in by this movie, it doesn't suggest in the first ten minutes or so what the plot is about; if that doesn't deter your interest, then 100% I say go for it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore this movie!","review":"Okay, first of all, yes the imagery and graphics are fantastic. All of them. Amazingly imaginative and just a little bit creepy in a whimsical sort of way.Second, I notice that most of my fellow reviewers have knocked off points for this movie because the characters and the story line are rather two-dimensional. To them I have this to say: Of course they are; this is a fairytale world. Fairy tale characters and plotlines are two-dimensional and have been done a million times before--and this is WHY we love them.So, reader, if you are looking for an amazingly complicated film full of deep insights, do not see this movie. If you want a beautiful fairy tale world something between Alice in Wonderland and The Nightmare Before Christmas: WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This a savvy look at a young woman's everyday struggle with life, lipstick & lame men.

The editing was terrible, with many wrong words and misspellings. I have to say the editing was on a par with the story itself. Not good. I think this writer was trying for a Brigette Jones' Diary take-off, but it falls totally flat.

The sound effect, on the other hand, is not as great. Madden's comments, as always, are pretty lame most of the time. It doesn't have those exciting stadium announcements as in NCAA Football 2001. Gameplay-wise, it is VERY similar to Madden 2000. There are not that many choices for formations in the playbook.

The gameplay is TERRIBLE! Blockers break their blocks WAY too early, quarterbacks (even the better ones) consistently overthrow or underthrow recievers, and when the ball DOES get near a reciever, they either drop it or change their route right at the last second and miss it. There are a hundred other problems, but I'll just make this short and to-the-point: don't buy it. It's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"As usual, the Madden football sucks. Everything about this game is bad.

The gameplay is much like last years. I see that some of the other reviews are posted by people who haven't even played the game. Something bothers me, it's very hard to beat the AI, they (AI) abuse the pass. Even the TB Bucks use pass playes some 80% of the time.

Running is tough, passing is mediocre and player control is confusing. The rosters are not up to date. Bottom line; the \\"bells and whistles\\" don't make up for the lack of a decent game.

Unfortunately, the recording is spoiled by the unnecessary manmade sounds of someone rowing a boat---recorded from inside the boat with its hollow echoing sound---so that the calm and natural lake sounds are interrupted by the bumping and sliding of aluminum oars and the sound of disturbed water, and lastly, the sound of the oarsman coming to dock and clumping away from the microphone.

That is where this book will come in handy. Great and renowned solo's monopolize the book.

Simple little things were changed for no good reason and without very good explanation: Why would Angela marry Plum? And therefore, why would he have anything to do with the Westing case?

A fine addition to Karajan's Sibelius recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired and Mired","review":"This recording introduced me to Sibelius and left me underwhelmed. The performance is so sluggish that I wasn't inspired to seek out more music by the composer. The Swan of Tuonela is lush and lovely, but Tapiola drags on at a leaden pace. Valse Triste sounds more like Armchair Depression. It was enlightening when I gotEugene Ormandy Conducts 20th Century Classicsto hear the work conducted as an actual waltz.

What it doesn't have is any of Heinlein's fascinating, provocative ideas or his genuine wit. In spite of their many flaws, Heinlein's books somehow work; this one doesn't. It reads like a first draft of a so-so idea that wasn't plotted or outlined beforehand: classic sloppy writing. And incidentally, I'm tired of authors writing brilliant \\"child\\" characters that are really just little adults. A child can be convincingly brilliant--Orson Scott Card anyone?

I have used both side by side.The 9 LED version is $4.99. The 21 LED version is $9.99.Both I and my father in law vastly prefer the 9 LED version. They use the same power (3 AAAs). A brief lesson about electronics: If you take a power source, and hook 9 LEDs up to it, and then you take the same power source and hook up 21 LEDs, the 9 LEDs will be brighter. The power gets \\"watered down\\" between the 21 LEDs. While there might be technically the same amount of light, it is far less concentrated on the 21 LED light and each LED is dimmer.Anyway, I won't return it, and the unit works fine.

When he is given a manidatory leave, he finds out the love of his life (who disappeared 19 years ago), has passed away, and he must travel to Japan for the reading of the will. From the moment he hits the airport, the action and the plot twists start. The supporting cast is great, and his old special ops friend provides wondeful comic relief.

A lot of people didn't care for it because they believed it to be rather hokey, to me that's what made it great. Watch it in French with English subtitles or you lose the feel of the film. Michele Muller and Ryoko Hirosue boast great cameos, but Jean Reno showed why he is one of my favorites in Hollywood these days. His role as Hubert in a dilapidated combination of rogue cop and gentleman bring's the viewer back to why \\"Leon\\" was such a fine film, Reno's acting.

I loved it!The way Hubert(Jean Reno)handled the gangsters was very funny,especially when he grabbed the golf club!WHOO!I really liked Ryoko the best.Her character's clothes were pretty outrageous,I must say,but not so much so when I compare them to what some of my friends wear!All that being said,This was a great movie and I like it alot.My advice:Rent it,watch it,and,hopefully,you'll love it just like I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film","review":"Good French film, good actors.

Unfortunately I misread or was misled into buying a version that I think will only play in Europe. It certainly won't play in the USA. I'll throw it in with a relative's Xmas gift as a bonus. Maybe they'll get some use out of it. I certainly won't. Too bad. It's a rather sweet take on the genre if I remember correctly.

Very easy to read and a real step by step book. Vol 1 teaches you the rule, Vol 2 teaches you basic skill and Vol 3 explain actual game and little tricks. I didn't read vol 4. The only thing that stop me from giving this series 5 star is: It will cost you more than $40 to buy all three books and you only need to spend arround $15 on other good beginner books such as \\"Lessons in Fundamentals of Go\\" and \\"The Magic of GO\\". If money is not a problem, it is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps \\"Go for Dummies\\" would be a better title.","review":"After reading Kageyama's \\"Fundamentals...\\" I was a little disappointed with this series. I read volumes II and III and was surprised at how little substance there was: big pictures, big text, and lots of distracting doodles. Volume III talks about 7 deadly sins of go, yet I couldn't find them. Most of the book was devoted to reviewing a few games that took place between high-level players. Although this series might be great for the extreme novice, I'm disappointed that they stretched this material out into so many volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I will post this to the first four books of the series, which I bought all at once.I was hoping this series, as popular as it seems to be, would be the Go equivalent of Yasser Seirawan's \\"Play Winning Chess,\\" but this series has nothing in comparison. I agree with other reviews that describe the books' lack of depth. There is actually so little information presented in the first four volumes, that they might as well be combined into one book for the same price as one of the books. There are also glaring typographical errors throughout every copy.Don't let the glossy covers fool you, in my opinion, this book series is nothing but a money grab. (Half of this book is analysis of arbitrarily chosen games, a great way to fill up pages! a lousy way to teach a beginner how to play Go)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for this tape....","review":"Although I do love Richard Simmon's workouts (with the exception of the Sweatin to the Oldies and the Dance Blastoff series), this one did not appeal to me. Although, I realize some of this is due to my taste in a workout, the workout does not seem structured enough for me. At times, they wander around and seem to \\"wing it\\". I'm not a \\"wing it\\" type person; I have to know what I am doing at all times of the exercise or I get discouraged. While this may be right up your alley, I did not care for it. If you are like me, and like a more structured workout, I did like Richard Simmon's Blast Off, Broadway Blast Off, Tone & Sweat (uses toning cords), Tone Up On Broadway (uses Chest/Arm stretching cords),Tonin Uptown (uses Richard Simmon's Tonin cords), Tonin Downtown (uses Tonin cords), Blast & Tone (uses weights, light pair and heavier pair), and Love To Stretch (uses Simmons Stretchin' Strap)."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY SLOW SHUTTER SPEED","review":"This is the worst camera I ever owned.

This is considered the first \\"splatterpunk\\" novel by many critics. It is the first novel to mix vampires and rock music (Anne Rice's version came out a year later). It holds up very well after 21 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"For strong-hearted horror readers only","review":"This book has a horror that is really hard to digest.

Novalogic has proposed plans to place a $5/month fee to stop cheaters from playing on Novalogics new server, NovaWorld2. I would gladly pay that small amount per month to have so much fun which I have already enjoyed in DF1 and DF2. About the Demo, it runs smooth on my p3 500, 32meg 3d card at 800X600, both on the large desert fields and inside the vast and highly detailed Pyramid (not a difference in frame-rate on my computer, major plus).

The graphics are just plain stupid (The FPS gun models are soooo GAY), but the terrain and evironment are pretty cool. Online play is good, but the stupid FPS gun models make it so GAY!!

Keep the Faith: If you play them, they will be made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good game - Company with out support","review":"DF Land Warrior did fix the DF graphics problems, looks good. My concern is the terrible or non-existing support from Novalogic. They will not answer any question and if they finally do, their answer is not going to help you. They like to sell and forget about customer.I have tried over years to get support from them but this is an eternal problem with out fix. They simply DON'T CARE, not even if you have bought them DF1, DF2, F22, Comanche, Comanche II and ComancheGold.My recommendation: It's O.K. to buy for a person who doesn't care about support. BUT, if you want to buy a Novalogic product with support, then, !!FORGET ABOUT IT - RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!Joe"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game lacks the essence of FPS","review":"Well what can i say this game is not worth your time. I mean come on, 1 shot to the computer and his dead. I even shot his foot and his dead. The AI is not so good, for example I was running toward the computer and he passed right in front of me and then turned back to get his shot, takes him long enough to shoot. Overall, this game is not worth a cent. I recommend not to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks better than the first 2, but beware of all the cheats","review":"Delta Force 1 was a great game, but there were so many cheaters that it couldn't be played online unless you didn't mind invisible players who couldn't be killed knifing you.Delta Force 2 was just as bad for cheating and it runs horibly on any machine due to it's graphics engine.Delta Force 3 fixes all the graphics engine issues, but Novalogic has not, in the last ten years, addressed the fact that cheaters have ruined the last two games.Any other game, the developers follow it up and issue patches to stop cheats. Not Novalogic. If you want to know just how bad they treat their customers, just write them an email saying you own one of thier products and that you aren't happy with it for some reason. *IF* they respond, it will be rude."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how we like it","review":"DF1 was good, DF2 was crap, DF3 Land Warrior is killer! This game has all the weapons you ever wanted to use and you can even drop them and pick up the weapons from your enemies. The 3D-graphics have improved, but what happened to the characters in 3rd person? They look silly. A serious flaw is the enemy AI. When I set the level to \\"hard\\" they kept staring at me like I had no pants on. Even when I stood 2 feet away from them. This allowed me to finish all 22 campaign levels in a day. Bummer.

After one year of use, I'm going to get a more powerful one."},{"rating":"1","title":"his","review":"I used to have another Fellowes shredder that worked well, so I thought this model would be just as good. This jammed ALOT... in addition, this is suppoed to shut off automatically if no paper is being fed in. Instead this would drone on and on despite no paper feed. This would still happen even if the bin was empty.Lesson: spend the money on a decent printer. Or if the average 100$ is too much, spend less on an assumed-to-be-crappy brand. This was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good shredder","review":"This shredder has always been slow and I have to oil it constantly. I have had it a little over a year and it is constantly jamming to the point where 2 people have to sit down with something sharp and try to dislodge the pieces. This is after feeding in 1 sheet at a time and only using it a few times a month. I don't recommend this shredder to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Jammer","review":"The reason I used the title Slow Jammer is because this shredder not only does it shred slowly, but it also jams often. It really gets on my nerves every time I have to unjam this thing. I do not recommend it at all. I think that people are better off buying a strip shredder it's faster and cheaper at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic gears finally broke, good riddance","review":"I had this shredder for several years. It was cheap, but I wasted a lot of time feeding it 2-3 sheets at a time and emptying it after every couple of dozen sheets. I was never so happy when this shredder's internal plastic gears finally broke (now I can buy a REAL shredder). The bin was tiny, so it would fill up quickly and start to pull the clippings back into the blades and jam up, and then I had to flip it over and push down the shreddings and pull clumps of paper bits out of the blades. It made a mess on the carpet when lifting the top off to empty the bin, and paper dust flew into to air when putting the top back on. The only useful part of this shredder is the little grey waste-basket that I'm left with after putting the cutting head in the garbage (where it belongs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"looks good but it doesn't fly anywhere near as well as it looks. a shame as expectations were high, avoid"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose wings make this a losing proposition","review":"The wings on this plane are seated in plastic sleeves on either side of the fuselage.

Like the tropics from which she came, the book is full of vibrant illustrations. The story is put into simple terms for young readers or a teacher or parent to read. Since the illustrations are so vibrant and bold children will be enthralled by the unique features of the art work. Each biographical page is bilingual for reading in Spanish or English or both. The book describes her early family life in Cuba, her departure after the revolution, her musical group Sonora Mantacera, meeting her musician husband,her associations with other salsa greats like Tito Puente and Willie Colon, her relocation to Miami and the various honors and recognitions she achieved. This is a great little book for primary and middle school libraries as well as community libraries. Students whoose first language is Spanish can benefit from the bilingual book through middle school years. This is a fun book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting to children","review":"This seems like a book that would only be appreciated by adults. I can see it being used as a teaching tool for children in the classroom or as a resource for children when writing a book report, but not as leisure reading. The book also seems to have a bit of an identity crisis: Is it a poetry book? Is it non-fiction? Is it biography? At times the language is lovely and poetic and at other times it is not lyrical. I also found a few grammatical problems with the Spanish. I wanted to like this book especially since it was recently recognized, and as an adult reader there are things I did like, but I don't see how it would appeal to children."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a fun read but Phillips gets annoying after awhile","review":"This is a good snapshot of his life but I did get tired of his constant references to his liaisons with all those women he claims to have slept with.The early bits are good, in fact all of his descriptions about the early folk scene, the LA scene in the mid 60s, they are all interesting but when he goes off into the 70s, it degenerates into endless descriptions of some crap rock opera thing he composed, and briefly compelling but ultimately tedious accounts of his drug addiction and the effects on him and others....yawn......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, no.","review":"I like my rock bios as much as the next guy, but this one was torture.

Got this book a few weeks ago and it wasn't anything like I thought it would be. The group was only together a few years and this tells the story of his whole life. Other then the years where the group was together the rest of the book lacks a lot, unless you like to hear about drug use. Seems like 75% of the book centers around drug use and in great detail. Maybe it was my mistake to think that the book would be more about the group. Seems like he talked more about his 3rd wife more then Michelle who was in the group with him. Just not enough about the group. When Mama Cass dies he mentions the whole thing on 1 page and that's it then right back to his drug use stories. He gets into more detail about every drug he used more then every song he sang.

However, if you do not have a convenient port on the front of your computer, then this product is perfect. It is very well made and works exceptionally well. In addition, it just plain looks cool sitting in the corner of your desk (especially for Mac users where it complements all of the new Apple hardware especially well). I have the new G5 iMac and just got tired of fishing around behind the display to plug it in. In addition, the USB ports on the back of the iMac seem very tight, whereas the Shuffle slides right into this dock with a reassuring click.

Some are clearly better than others. Some are classics. Some are pretty bad. Wilson knows of what he speaks, and I have found his reflections in this book and his ideas to be worthy of practice/ consideration/ emulation and use. He divides the week up into do-able sections with a different daily purpose and places the sermon out in four pages--each page with its own emphasis or direction. Like a master guide pointing out the obvious as one walks through the same stretch of woods for the thousandth time, I noticed, under Wilson's direction, things that I either had taken for granted, or had not paid attention to before-- I did what he said and my preaching improved. I found his remarks cogent, useful, right on the mark, and encouraging. This is one of the better books on preaching recently published and worth your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unquestionably the best sermon preparation tool available","review":"The author has uncovered the most profound method of preparing sermons.

I've shared this with several other pastors. They concur with my opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"a decent start...","review":"My biggest problem with this book is that it imposes a hermeneutic on the Bible that isn't always good--it forces you to look for trouble or grace in a text which may not legitimately include it.

Furthermore, I sincerely value authenticity from the pulpit and I found this to be difficult when using this method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Horror","review":"I bought this film because of a review I read. The review said \\"An American Werewolf in London\\" + \\"Dog Soldiers\\" / \\"From Dusk Till Dawn.\\" But that was a complete a total lie. The main promise was pretty good, but it was worked horribly. This film has horrible actors, NO special effects, and Is just a horrible excuss of a horror movie. And there is so much nudity and sex, that if I ran a video store i would have put this film in the adult section. NOT THE HORROR.

Jaime Bergman who was the chick cop killed in the hospital played on Son Of The Beach and is also David Boreanaz's, Tv's Angel, wife. Nudity is a bundle in this and the mindnumbing laughable special effects with the person computerized transforming doesnt help it. It's a junk pile to begin with.

It is wretched. It was recommended to me by the clerk at my local video store, who promised me it had \\"the best transformation effects ever!\\" She was so wrong, I wish there was a way I could successfully sue her to get my two bucks back. I think she meant to say \\"worst\\" f/x ever. And the rest of the movie follows suit. Half the \\"plot\\" of the movie only exists to present one nudity-laden scene after another. This is insulting.

The three actors defy all logic by being so good with given so little. As for the dancing babes on the rooftop, why is it that lesbianism is now such a dominant element in so many horror movies. It served no purpose in the film and the switch backs with this ridiculous scene and the murder of one of their friends was so long, I felt like I was in prison with an incommutable sentence.

I watch just about every werewolf film I can find looking for a quality lycanthrope movie. This film isn't one of them. I was encouraged by the positive reviews on this page to rent this movie and was highly disappointed.The film is full of long, dry spells of poor dialog delivered by mediocre actors. The werewolf itself is a man in an unconvincing, rubbery suit augmented by some video game quality CGI work. If you still must see it, rent it before you shell out the money on buying it. (It's much easier to waste $3 instead of $24.)For some great werewolf action check out An American Werewolf in London, Ginger Snaps, or Dog Soldiers. Any of these films are far superior.Oh yeah, the only reason I gave this movie two stars is for the large amount of gratuitous nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for somthing more.","review":"For entertainment value I would give this movie a \\"D minus\\". I watched the producers, writer and actors comentaries and I would beg to differ with almost everything they said. I bought this movie because it was inexpensive, recommended and purported to have world class nudity. I would agree that the girls featured were probably the most attractive thing about this project. But, the first time writer would be well advised to not put this effort on his resume.. for any of a number of reasons.. The acting was at least O.K. but, nothing exemplary to brag about.... and, again, bad plot lines and dialogue are difficult to overcome.I did not \\" hate\\" this film, but, I would not recommend it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I bought this movie because of it's previous rating.

However, I must comment on the poor use of the computer graphics during the transformation scenes. I thought I was watching a poor television ad. It surprises me that they allowed these scenes to tarnish the whole film. Where was the editor? The acting on the other hand needed a lot of improvement, and what I don't like with horror movies these days is that everyone is trying to be smart during scenes which should be either scary or life threatening to the character at that point. The little smart one liners don't work in every situation.I must commend the team for at least trying to do some good in making a contribution to the werewolf genre and we know making such a feature with a limited budget is Hard Work, but please, if you can't use good CGI, leave it alone.My favorite scenes were the van escape and oh yes, the roof top photo shoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst werewolf movie ever!","review":"Bad acting , low-budget (and I mean low!)special effects,and a plot that seems to be just an excuse to film nude scenes. The characters are uninteresting and one dimensional. If you feel that you have to subject yourself to this kind of torture I recommend you rent it first and save a few bucks.

Give oscars to the cast from Plan 9 from Outer Space and attack of the Killer Tomatoes compared with the performances in this piece of celluloid trash. No..it's not even good enough to be in the same category as trash. Let's see what else, oh yeah a plot? Nope, none to speak of here. The sex and nudity is the only reason I even finished it.

The velcro fastener runs the length of the pad and secures to the strap quite well.

If you're looking for padding to make a strap more comfortable, this might work for you. But if you're looking for something that will grip your shoulder and prevent (or at least discourage) the strap from sliding off, this fails totally. Otherwise, I've always liked Timbuk2's messenger bags. Was I foolish to expect that a product called \\"Griptex\\" would stick to my shoulder? For my needs it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nor very grippy and too stiff","review":"This pad is slightly more grippy than the stock Timbuk2 shoulder pad. It is at its best with a heavy load as the extra weight will cause it to mold to your shoulder. Without a heavy load it's too stiff and sits on top of your shoulder, causing light loads to dig in. A good design compromise would be to cut the foam into small sections so it will warp around the shoulder with both light and heavy loads. So I remove it when my bag is fairly light.1/18/20013 Update: Most of the grippy texture wore smooth after a few months of moderate use, making it as slippery as the stock pad. You might want to consider a Manhattan Portage or Crumpler shoulder pad. Both have more durable grip surfaces and are designed better. I deducted a couple stars since this pad is not very durable or grippy. The Timbuk2 bags are great but the shoulder pads need to go back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make the bag any better","review":"Bought one, but doesn't make the bag any more comfortable.

I don't carry the bag cross body. In hand you wouldn't think the Griptex would work any better, but on the shoulder it works great. No slipping at all.

American McGee's Alice is a brand new story of \\"Alice In Wonderland\\". When Alice was a little girl, her house cought fire and she was put in a mental hospital so she wouldn't kill herself. (Because her parents died in the fire.) She somehow falls through a wormhole into Wonderland. She is greeted by the white rabbit, who has changed alot, along with the chesher cat. Somthing has gone terribaly wrong. Somehow, Wonderland has become all evel. It is up to Alice (you) to journey through the lands and defeat the red queen. This game is rated \\"M\\" for mature users. This game is a violent thriller and has you leaning on the edge of your chair. I highly recomend this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves better than 5 stars.","review":"If you're looking for a challenging adventure with an adult sense of humor try American McGee's Alice. The graphics are great. I think the soundtrack alone is worth the price. In fact it's available on CD. And there's plenty of replayability and the game play is quick to learn. But what really sets this fantastic game apart is its bizarre setting and demented storyline. In this Wonderland madness is real, the gore is audible and the killing can get fast and furious. There's only a handful of weapons to choose from which are earned as you go along so moving and strategy play an important part in your survival. In other words, you can't always just stand back and blast away. In fact, the main weapon is a butcher knife. Lots of hacking!...Note: There is now a movie in planning based on this game to be directed by Wes (Nightmare on Elm Street) Craven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected, but still a very fun game","review":"The graphics are great - except when you get too \\"close up.\\" Movement is easy, although walking, running, jumping, climbing,etc. are done with the keyboard (or joystick). The mouse is only used for using weapons. The storyline itself is pretty cool, and the character actors realistic. I had a bit of a problem with the install - it had to do with OpenGL - but the game includes a (beta version) install to fix any problems with your video card. Although the game is different from what I expected, I'd still recommend it. It's rated \\"M\\" for mature, and rightly so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty film for young adults in the real world","review":"This film is good for a giggle. Not a classic, but something to pull down off the shelf when you're after a laugh. Quite abstract and off beat with some of it's jokes it makes for an intelligent comedy (rare for the college comedy genre films such as 'American Pie').Young adults facing the question of \\"What comes next in life\\" should relate quite well to the films main character played nicely by the talented actor Ben Affleck before he made it big.If you're after a witty (sometimes bitter) comedy this is for you.Fans of punk rock will love the soundtrack, especially the Vandals song \\"It's A Fact\\".If any of the above sounds interesting to you, do yourself a favour and check out this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie with a great cast","review":"good look at the disfunctional fraternity brothers, the house includes Ben Affleck(Paycheck, Dogma), Sam Rockwell(Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, Charlies Angels), Vien Hong(Gleaming The Cube and City Of Industry), French Stewart(tv's 3rd Rock From The Sun and Stargate) and Vinnie DeRamus.

I went to a small college and while I was there my friends and I discovered Glory Daze. This movie perfectly captures the life of a small college. We thought so and it kind of became our anthem. The film follows the lives of a group of housemates as the inevitable graduation approaches in a few days. Then they will go their separate ways. Through the course of this movie one funny thing after another happens. They have a party, they talk about life and love, graduate, and break stuff. Like I said this movie is sentemental to me and most people I show it to that do not come from similar perspective are disappointed. I would recommend it to people who went to small colleges or die hard Affleck fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"MTV Shallow","review":"Slick like a MTV video, rap pulsating in the background, punkypost-grunge set and clothing, Glory Daze amuses, but it's shallow,clich��d amusement.

Cool huh? OK, my senior year wasn't much different back in 69, just more drugs, but what did we learn? For most kids, we didn't learn awhole lot.

What Ruefle does here is to white out most of the words on the page, leaving just enough to give an intelligible image here, an interesting twist of action there.

Furthermore, from my little bit of playing the game the emphasis seems to be more on developing your creature than anything else. I have to admit having to keep an ever vigilant eye on the creature kind of irritated me and took away from the overall game experience. All and all I was not as impressed with the game play as I was with the concept and quickly grew tired of this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Yes, the graphics are good. Yes, the AI is amazing. But no, the game is not worth the money. Why? Because the game is filled with bugs of varying degrees of severity. Some mearly slow game time down, causing you to repeat things in order to make them work. Others are disabling, such as the \\"creature curse bug,\\" and cause gameplay to stop altogether.I can see how this was \\"a labor of love,\\" as it is a very ambitious product. However, like many ambitious goals, this game falls far short of its ideal.These bugs would not be as much of a problem if the manufacturers were more supportive of their customers. At this date, more than two months after release, there are no downloadable patches to fix ANY of these bugs, even the major ones. Also, several items described in the users manual are not present yet... no, your villiagers cannot play soccer, despite what the box says. Miracle dispensers do not yet work...I could go on and on, but the basic message is this:Buyer Beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Poor Execution","review":"This game admirably breaks from a lot of the god games inspired by Sim City and Civilization. Unfortunately the game designers tried to do far too much with the way the player interfaces with the game universe, gave inadequate in game tutorials and made the manual almost entirely useless. After many hours of gameplay I couldn't figure out how to build a sustained civilization without giving it constant attention. I would like to say more, but I just wanted to register my frustration with this game and hopefully dissuade others from buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & White - Game of extremes","review":"Black - terrible user interface. Want to turn right? Then press the left arrow key... Want to look up? Then press the down arrow key. Geez!! What were they thinkin'? Some things are time independent, but a lot of the puzzles have to be done in the right order or they fail. If you make mistakes training your animal, then later on you are stuck with starting all over. No real story to speak of... still you must follow the puzzle line to make much progress... It is more a puzzle game (ala Myst) rather than a simulation (ala Sim City).White - Good graphics. Reasonable sound. Good tutorial. Okay manual.Added puzzle - it took me over a day to get the game to run on my Matrox G200 video card. Hint: The latest driver is the wrong driver. The unified driver is the right driver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"When I first got this game I was impressed by the excellent graphics and what I thought was inteligent AI. After about three day I realized something. I hated this game. I also realized that the people who created this game lied for the most part in their adds. They say you have complete control over this island. If complete control meens lifting up a few rocks and trees then they are right. While the creature AI is good it is no were near as advanced as it is made out to be. The creature already knows everything it needs, it just needs to see you do it first for it to be unlocked. There is no way to actually teach it to do anything new that the designers havnt already thought up. The game play is slow without any real reward. Save your money on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"It's not a terrible game, but the micromanagement can make you want to smash the computer.

What it comes down to is that the villagers are too stupid to take care of themselves, which makes it impossible to create a self-sustaining village. Therefore you have to spend enourmous amounts of time telling the villagers to do basic things like chop down trees, harvest grain, and reproduce. That's right. They won't reproduce unless you tell them to, which means that you must constantly match boys and girls together to keep the village from dying out. This distracts you from doing fun and interesting things, like training your creature to seek out and destroy the enemy. After 50+ hours playing this game and still feeling like I was getting nowhere, I gave up in frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge disappointment","review":"this could have been a really excellent game. it was so full of bugs though, it was unbearable. not only does it take 5 minutes to start up, but then it freezes all the time! and now when i try to load my games, the game starts over at the beginning. the customer support was awful as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Regrets...","review":"What exactly is the requirement of this game???

When it says game saved, and 20 min. later when the game crashed, you will never be able to load to the point where it AUTO-SAVED! Instead, you'll have to start everything over...

Read it, then skip purchasing this game. I was very excited about getting it after reading/believing the hype. The creature and its \\"leashes\\" drove me insane, and detracted from the small amount of entertainment I had begun having from solving the puzzles in the game. Maneuvering is (IMHO) counter-intuitive, especially which way the POV revolves based on the sliding of the mouse. And the forced tutorial is mind-numbing. The only worse \\"forced\\" passage in a game is the part of NOLF where you have to ask the fat industrialist all of those inane questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, fizzles quickly","review":"At first glance, Blacka and White looks like the everything-killer. The graphics and sound will crash your jaw through the floor. Creature interaction is wonderfully entertaining and challenging. The story is good and the interface is ingenious.Unfortunately, this all wears off after about 3 hours. You will soon discover that the game simply isn't fun. You are forced to manage your whiny villagers endlessly and unless you train your creature just right, you will be picking up after it's obnoxious little self for the majority of the time.All in all; a great start trips on it's own AI-encoded toe and falls crashing to the ground"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Overhyped, underdeveloped.

I have no idea what it's like to play because at about 10 minutes into it, everything froze and it had to be reinstalled. The patches were no help.

I'll never buy another game designed by this company.What a shame...it could have been fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Osiris may be wrong on this one....","review":"I read Osiris' review about needing the 90MB patch, that is incorrect. That is a patch for the non-English game if people still want to here and see English language. Being from Canada, I guess he would need that. Sorry Osiris, but game companies expect that if you live in Canada and buy the game there, you will PROBABLY speak the local language, not the game's natural English. I admit that that is a huge patch, especially if you own a modem, but at least it was made available to you. I have yet to play the game, which is why I didn't rate it high. However, I ordered it a few days ago, and should get to play it around January. I will write another review about it then. I am fairly sure I will give it a high rating then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool graphs","review":"I like it, but is difficult to dominate \\"the mouse\\".

I washed a few cars to get the money to buy the game, and on the day I bought it, I was saddened when the game didn't work! It installed properly, but after the startup screen, the whole computer screen went white! I could still hear the music in the background, but nothing else worked. I went online to try and find a remedy to my problem, and I learned that Black and White doesn't work on the Windows XP home edition. So I took it back. I'm just so disappointed. I'm sure it's a good game, but I may never find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading info about system requirements","review":"I got this game when it first came out and was really looking forward to it. And I wish I could tell you how great it was. Or even how bad it was. However, I can't because even though I have Windows 98, this game wouldn't even load up. I called EA's customer support and they told me that there was nothing they could do. Since I had already opened the game (as I had planned on keeping it), I was out $50 for nothing but a blank screen.Moral? Make double sure that your system will run a game before you buy it. And even then, you're sometimes not out of the woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does for Civilization what Dungeon Siege does for Diablo 2","review":"Graphically this game is pretty good it was maid in 2001 so it is not going to have the greatest graphics. But for the type of game it is they are good. The premise is you are a god and you determine how a town and they're culture will develop. You can be a good god and tend to they're every need or you can be a bad god and torture and kill them for fun. You also get a creature to raise to be good or evil. Good and he will help you're town bad and he will help destoy it. I played this game for 4 hours then I realized that was the training section. So needless to say this game will take along time to beat. I have played for 15 hours or so now and have barely started. This is a good game for people that like RPG's, Strategy games, and Simulation games. Why did I give it a 4 this game is not for everyone. It does not have a lot of action. When you're creature fights with other creatures it is not like Mortal Kombat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The game Black and White has some good ideas, such as being God and being able to control what was going on, but it did not meet up to the expectations. I find it really difficult to get the hang of the mouse controls, and at times it is extremely frustrating. I agree with one of the other comments made, you are following a story. You never are really in control! I find this game disappointing and I suggest looking else where for a game in which you want control."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sure this game is fun but...","review":"Ok, I read the reviews here and on game sites for this game. It sounds like fun, but my god could it be any harder to play? I gave up on this game due to its overly hard to use interface and overly annoying tutorial!I am they type of gamer that likes to get to the action not watch 20 minutes of video about the game. Of course the first time I ran the game it crashed luckly I am running Windows XP so I didn't need to reboot.To do simple things in this game it takes great skill and the learning curve is a pain. Having to remember where eveything is, becuase damned if I can fine a small map to show important things like Age of Empires has.The concept of the game is really cool, however attempting to play it well that is another story all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relieved to see it isn't just me!","review":"I was excited about B&W; in concept, and started out with great intentions of enjoying it. It is beautiful! However, I quickly learned that my creature was obsessed with its own [bathroom] habits . . . that I really hated my obnoxious \\"good\\" creature . . . that the wood'n'food were more arbitrary than not . . . and that it is almost impossible to get some of what are supposed to be simple puzzles (the early ones) to stay solved.I'm disappointed and don't recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most expensive coaster I've ever bought","review":"Well, the game came out around the same time as Tribes 2 and Tribes 2 has tons of patches out already and so far Black and White has none.

You have to question the common sense of the people behind this game -- my copy was shipped without the essential CD identification code necessary to install the program. After hours investigating online FAQs and making expensive long distance calls to technical support, I discovered that the game assumes you will be connected to the Internet and that, if you are not, a line must be added to the program shortcut just to get the program to run. And I don't have the space here to talk about the game's arthritic speed.In short, the chief fun behind this game will be ripping the box and documentation it came with into shreds and then burning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a good game","review":"I've been playing PC games for over ten years, and have overcome countless problems to get them to work..... but I've never encountered anything as frustrating as this game!

Unless they are being hurt by another god, the villagers should have been smart enough to fend for themselves.Black and White is not all bad.

The game takes a huge amount of time in loading and saving and has a nasty habit of crashing on saves, corrupting your save files. These are just a few of the many and varied bugs within the game. All this is further aggrevated by the appalling support provided by Lionhead in their failure to provide a patch or to communicate honestly with those who have provided their support by purchasing the game.

You can create the village and supply the villagers with resources- or (as I did) have a competition with your friends to see how many houses you can knock down with a single thrown rock. The possibilities for villager interaction as well as the highly sophisticated creature AI are extensive and not to be tossed aside.

I haven't been able to play more than 15 minutes without my system crashing. I've tried the patches, my drivers are up to date and all other games play without incident. There's only one file/solution left to try with these two games and that's using my stand-by file: file 13 aka as \\"the trash recepticle\\".

What is the point of game that is supposed to be interesting and entertaining if you get frustrated just trying to interact with the user interface? Also, my PC has P3 733 MHz processor, 384 Megs of RAM and an Nvidia TNT M64 video card and my PC had trouble handling it.On the other hand, I really like the music and the concept. I just wish it had been executed better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great, but...","review":"This game could have been awesome. The graphics are cool and playing with the the creature is fun. But Village management is a freakin' nightmare. Talk about micromanagement. I spent more than 3/4 of my time taking care of whining villagers getting food and wood. Very distracting and aggravating when I'd have rather played with the creature. Especially frustrating is the way the campaign messes with the creature. This takes away the only good part of the game and left me spending my time doing more village management. Ahhh!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game need Good computer thought","review":"The game play is so good. the game is addictive. but the only reson i could not give it 5 is because if you don't have a good computer it will not work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfying","review":"The game has an incredible look and feel to it. However, gameplay is repetitive and becomes boring rather quickly. There are only five levels to complete, and while each level has its own challenges and quests, there is not enough action and most of the challenges are too easy. Additionally, there are \\"bugs\\" in the program and some promised features are not activated. I have been unable to complete the game because of the \\"Land 5 Creature Curse\\" bug. (For more information about these problems you can check the bulletin boards at www.bwgames.com. A patch has been promised by early June, but it seems too little too late.) I would not recommend this game other than as a curiosity. It has been overhyped and does not deliver enough bang for the buck. If you think you want to buy this game WAIT FOR THE PATCH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"I purchased Black and White on the advice of a friend and was told about the fun aspects of training a pet. After playing for several hours I can honestly say I was underwhelmed.While the game's graphics were good, and I had fun for about an hour playing around with my pet and the world, there was little to keep my interest. I quickly moved onto other games and forget that I had purchased Black and White. For me, there was little substance and little to get me \\"hooked\\".While I do not deny that there is a market for games like Black and White, I do believe that this market demands more challenging and compelling products.If you make it past an hour, tasks become tedious, lifeless and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya like it ya don't","review":"Well when I first played this game I thougt the graphics looked amazing. It has great potential and it has many pros and cons.The pros of this game are:Great graphics/ Good sound/ A fun game to play/ Good online gaming/The cons of this game are:Takes ages to teach villagers and creatures/ Complicated controls/ Takes really long to get levels done/Overall I very much liked this game and would definitely recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype Hype Hype","review":"This game has been over-hyped. It is boring, repetitive, cumbersome and uninvolving.Basically the game is a very very simple resource management game (imagine The Settlers for 6 year olds) with a stupid (but nicely animiated) creature waddling around in it.It is also excessively slow when loading or saving - though the much reported patch may address this. You also cannot turn off the annoying cute god/devil characters, and have to go through the long-winded tutorial if you need to restart the game.What the people who have given this dross 4-5 stars have been playing I do not know. I regret buying the hype and buying the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, bad implementation, terrible support","review":"The concept of the game is good. The replayability of it is non-existant though. You _HAVE_ to go through the tutorial whether it is the first time you are playing the game or not. You have to listen to the stupid advisor's prattle about how to move.The support is aweful. I called lionhead yesterday and they told me that there was nothing I could do about getting a refund. They have delayed the patch so many times that it has been more than 14 days since I purchased the game, so my retail outlet won't take it back. The excuses that they have used time and time again for delaying the patch have been pathetic. Our developers are at E3. Some Dutch players won't be able to play over the internet. We have to QA it.....I will never buy another product from LionHead studios."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outright horrible game","review":"The graphics are jerky, the interface bites and is slow, and it was one heck of a pain to get installed.

Save your money and buy Sigma by Microsoft when it comes out in May."},{"rating":"1","title":"A game isn't much fun when you can't get it to work","review":"Before purchasing Black and White, I read several reviews of mixed opinions. Some people loved it, while others hated it. Most of the negative reviews seemed to be from people with lower end machines, so I figured that with my Athlon 1.3, 512 MB memory, 64 MB video card, I wouldn't have a problem. Wrong!I've NEVER had so many problems with any software application before. It locks up on launch. It locks up in the middle of the game. It locks when the sun's out. When it's cloudy. Get the picture? The game simply doesn't run well.Go read reviews on Lionhead's website, and you'll see many of the same comments. To date, no officially supported patches are available, but you can download a \\"developers version\\". It's as buggy as the original release.My advice: stay away from this game unless you're willing to drive yourself mad trying to get it to run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work Right","review":"The game doesn't work very well, it seems to be VERY glitchy. On my computer it crashes a lot to where I have to reboot my computer alot. On my friends computer, it crashes, and he can't use sound or it freezes right away.

It seems really fun, and it probably is, if you can play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooring","review":"After playing the first couple of hours, I started to like the game. Then I got addicted. But the game got very repetitive. I felt like just doing the same thing over and over again. And especially when the stupid creature gets captured again it just isn't fun anymore. Its the same stuff over and over again and it just takes long.I found myself addicted: I felt like I HAD to play. But I found no joy in playing it. It was the same stuff over and over again. And then there were those annoying characters that sing or do other annoying things. And then you find out THEY JUST WONT DIE.Damn this game is annoying.Finally I got myself to uninstall. Damn that was a relief! Now I can play other games again.. games that are actually fun! I really felt like I was relieved of a huge burden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Blacker","review":"Somewhere between 3 and 5 years in the making, Black & White disappoints and irritates on so many different levels that it's hard to know where to start. The non-intuitive control system takes hours of getting used to, and even then is clumsy and unresponsive. The graphics are not on a par with such recent titles as Giants or Sacrifice, the landscape morphs and warps as you move around it and the villagers, well, the less said about them and their unfeasibly large feet the better. The sub-plots are supposed to be humourous but are merely twee, as are the good and bad advisors. Much has been made in the gaming press of the creature AI and it may well be the best ever in a computer game, but the game itself, which should surely be the most important part, is sadly lacking. This may well be selling swiftly, but will be returned to retail outlets just as fast by all but the most persevering of gamers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a nasty habit of DELETING YOUR GAME!!!","review":"I have been playing Black & White off and on for about two years. I'll start playing about three or four months after I stopped and wonder why I didn't finish it. Simple. Its impossible to beat. Why? IT DELETES YOUR GAME!

This retaliation spawned from the B&W (Black & White) Message Boards and into Amazon.com because of a post by one who will go unnamed.Anyway, props to Lionhead for making the greatest game of our time. Let me put it this way--YOU ARE GOD. You are worshipped by villagers, you own a Creature, make miracles and all sorts of Godly stuff. This game also takes contacts from you address book and puts them in the game. Similarly, it has an e-mail system and an option that downloads your closest city's weather and puts it in-game. Oh yeah, and you can be Good or Evil.Just buy it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Poor Execution","review":"After nearly 2 years of development you would think they could have worked the bugs out before shipping. But alas, it never works that way. The game is buggy, not unplayable but definitly still in the beta phase. And to make matters worse THERE IS NO PATCH. Oh they keep saying one is coming but every time the posted date for it comes around they post that it will be anywhere from 4 more days to 2 or 3 more weeks. I didn't buy the game when it first released for just that reason. The first time i checked bwgame.com the patch was supposed to be out may 21st. Now (June 4th) they just posted that it would be another 2 or 3 weeks. This is not acceptable, Lionhead doesn't deserve this bad review but EA does, sorry Peter Molyneux."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice coaster until the patch comes out.","review":"I would not recommend this game.

The sounds were the first thing to annoy me. \\"We need food\\", \\"we need wood\\", \\"we need offspring\\" \\"we need, we need, we need\\" Next thing I knew, I was filled with the sudden urge to destroy my own towns out of plain boredom, and annoyance. Grabbing every person I saw whimpering and whining about what they didn't have, and throwing them off the horizon became the only fun that I had with this game (that fun only lasted 5 minutes). The micro-management was boring and a waste of my time. I gave this game away to a nephew, and just swallowed the loss of my 40.00. Don't make the same mistake.

This must be some real great marketing department, as what you are getting for you money is a highly bug infested beta of two combined companies where customer support is on the very rock bottom of things-to-do-list. If you would like to save yourself worries and trouble (and money) wait about half a year then buy it for half prive and by then some patches should be available for this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Slow","review":"I've had this game for a few months now. At first I loved it. Learning about each individual element of the game (e.g., the miracles, the creature, the villagers, the islands, the opposing gods) was fun and promised for exciting gameplay. Unfortunately, knitting all of the elements together into a comprehensive whole is one area where Black & White needs work. For instance, in order to accomplish anything, you are forced to \\"increase your influence\\"--that is, you cannot interact directly with any area of the island that is not under your influence. To gain influence, you have to demonstrate to the neighboring villagers that you are a powerful god by tossing rocks, trees, people, fireballs, whatever over their heads so they fear and/or are amazed by you. This becomes very tedious. It takes ages to gain the influence you need and the process to gain it is not very fun.Alas, I wanted so much to love this game, but it's just too repetitive and slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment for a time","review":"While Black & White contains some entertainment value, it becomes tedious after awhile. It starts out fun, but too much of your time is gradually wasted with micro-management for your worshipers. The AI creatures are very cool however, they really do learn and are able of performing some neat tricks. However again too much time is spent teaching them basic actions that should have been a lot easier (2 hours of potty training is not really fun). Additionally the game is too short if you want it to be. You can blaze through the included scenarios fairly quickly if you put your mind to it. While playing with the creatures is indeed fun, the game bogs down too much in micro-management details, that should have been dumped in favor of more fun gameplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Graphics! A little boring after a while, tho.","review":"This Game is absolutely wonderful. I love that I get to play God, and that I get to raise a creature, and that I can pick whether or not I'm good or bad! The only reason I give it a 4/5 is because after a while, it gets a little boring trying to influence village after village. It needs a little more action! Over all though, I've had this game for a while, and I still play it....a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many Hours Wasted","review":"Black & White, you'll either love it or hate it, there'll be no grays about it. All the cool graphics only serve to tax your computer and slow down the game. The game is fun for the first couple of levels. But once the novelty wears off, the game becomes aggravating. The game tries to be everything for everyone, but that never works. I could have done without the stupid, impossible-to-control animal god, made worst with the awkward mouse movements. I want to be God, not some pokemon trainer. For a superior god simulation game, get Tropico. The gameplay of Tropican villagers are far more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy it!","review":"This game even with a patch not only still has many bugs, but once you install the patch many if not all could not run the game.

In my opinion, the game is just too slow in developing. Your \\"Creature\\" is a child-like being that you train to be either good or evil, which becomes an extension of you. Good concept, but very tiring after awhile. The game becomes too centered on feeding your people, giving them wood to build, keeping your \\"creature\\" in line- over and over, again and again.

I give it two stars for graphics and sound but thats about it. 0 stars for storyline and replay-ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped- NOT fun","review":"This game is NOT fun. The interface is awkward. It is too tedious to move the creature around. I am surprised that all the game sites gave this game a (very) good review.

I probably won't play it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a year to spend... do something else!","review":"This game takes a long time. A VERY long time. For example, each time you start a new game, you MUST go through a tutorial that if you speed through it will take you no less than 45 minutes. Teaching your pet will take longer and your pet will at any given moment learn a trick that you had no intention of it learning. If you were to have two games, one for a good pet and one for a bad one. IT would take you two hours at least of straight playing to get to the 2nd level.

Well, its my 3rd day in a row and my creature still cannot defeat an ogre. The combat control is ridiculous. When you try to load a saved game before combat, it doesn't even restore the creature's health values meaning, the save game feature is useless.Peter M. designed a great interface and the idea is good, but the game itself is horrendous. In fact, its gotten so frustrating that the CD had actually been thrown across the room at a high velocity.

The game gets very repitive and playing with your creatures isn't all that fun because you can't really make them do a whole lot. It is cool to watch them do there own things. Another problem with the game is that is gets really repititive after awhile. Converting new tribes to advance in the game gets boring after awhile, especially since it take awhile for each one, meanwhile, your followers are never happy and you always have to keep helping them, making the process even longer.The pros to this game is that is has very different game play than any game I have played and the graphics are top grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggh, boring...","review":"Black & White in theory sounds like a really fun game and for some I guess it is. I found the game so tedius, repititious and devoid of fun that I never even bothered to finish the first level. The idea of the creature is interesting and the AI on it is impressive but that in itself could not hold the game together. The controls are awful. It is interesting that the developers spent so much time on the \\"feel\\" of the game and making it so it was like no other that it seems that they didn't stop to think at the cumbersomeness an impracticality of the vast array of controls. Another factor to this game is that if you are going to stick it out and play the entire thing you will definately need time for it takes for what seems an eternity to complete some of the tasks of the game.

I love the gameplay, the creature, the miracles, the creature (yep, it's an important one), etc.But, i (and many with me) disagree with the way we are treated. The game is buggy, crashes a lot, you do not want to enter land 5 and your creature forgets miracles. Lionhead and EA refuse to give any information on a patch, and when they do (they gave us a release date), they do not keep their promises. This is why i rate this game bad.

You do this by giving bad harvests, mudslides and forest fires if they don't worship you and a good harvest, lots of fish, and plenty of cows if they do. You also have this pet. You can choose what to teach the pet, for example, to break dance, if you play your cards right. Your pet will battle other God's pets if you get the other God's powers. It's pretty fun, but it's hard to get the camera were you want it, which is a big problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Hot","review":"This game is a downright sorry excuse for a game. The graphics are great, but the game play is just plain lousy. You spend most of your time watching over your villagers because they can't do anything for themselves.

The person who thought this up was very creative. (...) However, once you get in the game you will encounter a plethera of annoying bugs. Some of these are invisible creatures that won't move, creature won't eat or learn, creature won't interact with objects, missing sheep for sheep quest, etc. So you go download patch 1.10 and install it. Then when you try to run black and white it will start to run but the game never makes it far enough to start. It just freezes. So you use the EAsy program to report the problem (...) and that program locks up your system. Congratulations, you have just wasted (...) your hard earned money on a (...) buggy game.

The problem was playing this piece of junk. The game has it fun points like that fact you can smack around your creature. I did this alot because the [stupid] thing doesn't do what it is suppose to. It is very hard to move around and it was driving me crazy, everytime you race to get someone the screen gets in the way. I do not recommend this game, good idea bad planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spend a little more time!","review":"Black and White DOES have replayability, contrary to what other people said. It takes a little more time for the creature to learn actions than people with ADHD have attention span, which many of these people seem to have. A little time is all tnat is needed.

This game has some very serious bugs that prevented me from progressing in the game past level 3. Once I got to the third level, my game started crashing everytime I tried to save. This is a known problem with the game and the worst part is Lionhead/EA support. They waited 2 months to say there was a patch on the way and then twice failed to post the patch on the promised date. It has been more than 2 months now since the release and they still haven't release the patch, and without the patch I can't even play the game I paid fifty bucks for! What a waste..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"Great concept. I'll give it that. But if you want a game so bug ridden you can't even finish it then buy Black and White. They have offered no tech support what-so-ever. The patch has been delay 3 time now and they always have horrible excuses about why it's delayed. First time some ISP in norway or Sweden couldnt connect after the game is patched.

I've had the game for two months and it becomes more frustrating by the minute. Lionhead/EA have been working on a patch (allegedly) and has delayed it twice now citing issues that pertain to about 1% of the player base.

Lots of crashs to desktop while saving, which means you get to start the game again and endure the tutorials. After four or five times this gets rather annoying. Lionhead and EA have been slow in providing a game patch and have given only usless technical help. It is a shame that a fun game can be ruined by the very people who create it. Well, they did get their money from the sale of the game. Is this all they care about? Maybe they should start to worry about future sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but disappointing","review":"I bought Black and White mostly because of the hype, and was intriqued by the gameplay. Unfortunately the many technical problems with the game and lack of support from the developer have made the game unplayable after only a couple of weeks.

I stongly recommend holding off on buying this game until a new version is released that has the bug fixes and missing features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, but Somewhat Tedious","review":"Molyneux's achievement is truly remarkable. No one has done these sorts of things in video games before. During the first two weeks that I owned it, I was continually discovering new features and nuances of the game play. The graphics are brilliant and colorful, the world is rich and subtle, and the characters are hilarious. You can think of this game as a combination of \\"The Sims\\" and a real-time strategy game. Likewise, it has all the features that made \\"Creatures\\" fun, without all of the headaches of micro-management. While this game is both beautiful and exhilarating, it should be said that it is time consuming and sometimes exhausting. Some evenings I found myself not wanting to play because it was \\"too much commitment\\".

It is sad that Gene Clark, a songwriter who could bring real pathos to a song, was never truly given the opportunities or promotion to shine in the group or as a solo artist.

His review was that it worked fine for him. Since I am in the DC area I thought it may work for me here in Suitland. While it did pickup a few stations it missed MOST of the local DC stations like 7 and 9. If you live in this area and want to watch off-the-air TV then get a good roof top antenna for VHF/UHF. I found out that the HDMI broadcasts are on the same frequency bands as the \\"regular\\" tv. Now that you know, hopefully you won't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but read fine print","review":"I'm satisfied with this product. I have it in the attic with a Phillips 24db amplifier (12db per channel).

I can pick up the stations in Cleveland and Toledo and 1 station in Detroit.So that's all great.Here is what else you need to know:This antenna is NOT multi-directional. Do not be decieved by that. I have to point it at Cleveland or at Toledo to pick up the stations in each locale (or at Detroit to pick up the one station). The instructions say: \\"Make sure elements (bowties) are facing transmitting towers.\\"The instructions also tell you: \\"Attic Installations will cut 40%-50% of your signal strength.\\" I do not know if I am making up for that by using the amplifier or if I would receive even better signal if I could mount it outside on the roof."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DB4 lives up to its reputation","review":"Antennas Direct DB4 Multi Directional HDTV AntennaI am pleased with both the quality and the performance of the DB4 antenna.I am picking up 36 channels ( 1 in vhf range and 35 in the uhf range) including several channels I did not expect to be able to receive.

Before receiving this antenna I purchased an amplified GE indoor antenna that was supposed to be for HDTV. It received several channels well though others not so well and if you move the antenna's position it requires rescanning. I then hooked up the DB4 outside on the roof and aimed it in the direction of most of our broadcasts. It picked up some additional stations that the GE antenna did not but conversely it lost some stations that the GE picked up. I was not happy about this since the channels lost were ones I wanted. I then tried an old RCA roof top antenna of the variety popular in the 80s. It picked up all the stations of both the GE and the DB4 plus some additional stations. I have returned this and the other antenna because their supposed \\"tuning\\" for HDTV isn't what they purport it to be. My old analog antenna works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"HDTV Antenna","review":"Great product, the antenna did exactly what I wanted it to do, I got 29 different digital stations on my TV.

This antenna is meant to be installed outside. However, our covenants do not allow antennas (though they allow satellite dishes) outside. We placed ours in our attic. At first, we had some problems. We weren't sure if it was because of the length of the wire, the splitters we were using, or the fact that it is going through a surge protector. In the end, it turned out to be some faulty wiring that the builder placed in the house about 5 years ago. When we used a different wire, we had an amazing picture.If you have any problems with your reception, check the wiring, splitters, connectors, etc before you give up and try something else because you won't have any luck with any antenna product if the rest of the system is not functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds Expectations","review":"Installed the antenna on a single family one story house in Broward county florida.

Not surprising I cannot receive it with this antenna.I should have done my homework. First I should have checked what frequency the stations in the Phoenix area transmit on. That was where I made my mistake. I know what a UHF and VHF antenna look like. It is a good UHF antenna. It is just the discription is misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works in my attic","review":"I installed this antenna in my attic. I replaced my old Terk HDTVi antenna with this one to be able to pick up some of the more distant stations from where I live in NC. It took some tweaking on the exact direction to face it, but I was able to get all of the expected stations.The only time I have issues with the more distant stations is on VERY windy and VERY cloudy days. It will make the picture ghost sometimes. I know that this is likely due to the fact that I chose to mount my antenna in the attic instead of outside on the roof.For those of you looking, I needed a Medium-Range Multidirectional antenna (purple I believe on [...]). This antenna definitely did the trick, but I believe the overkill of the DB8 might have been useful to help those few situations where ghosting occurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antenna Direct DB$ Directional HDTZ Antenna","review":"Well designed...have had it about a month...just mounted it on side of house....awaiting delivery of new TV....hoping for better reception.

However, this was not the case. This antenna was only able to pick up the 2 closest stations to my house, which were 10 and 12 miles away, and it even struggled to get those. The other stations 30-40 miles away didn't stand a chance. Interestingly enough, I mounted my original antenna([...]) in the same location as this one and was able to pick up all my local stations!

With a Channel Master amplifier CM7777 installed the VU-110XR was able to pull in nearly two to three times as many DTV channels as the DB4.

Several New York City stations moved their RF frequencies into the lower VHF frequency band during the transition, which are not covered by this antenna, therefore I no longer can receive these stations. I just wasted $69. Of course I could buy yet another \\"VHF\\" antenna and a combiner, or buy a VHF/UHF antenna, but what will be next......move some more channels into a newly opened SDHF (Super Duper High Frequency) RF spectrum so I have to buy yet another antenna.

When I hooked it up on Oct 8th '07 it worked about 5 minutes before water began gushing from the switch area and motor kept running with wand turned off.Naturally, the warranty expired 34 DAYS ago (I had registered it online). After being bounced around to 4 different reps on the Karcher Toll free line with no help at all, I surrendered and quit trying. Oh....by the way: don't bother trying to email Karcher. There is no listing for email contact available on their website.This was my second Karcher.

Spend your money on a cheap Chinese model at Harbor Freight."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"Yes, I purchased this unit two days ago. I used it for 20 minutes and the high pressure hose blew off. You can clearly see the damaged threads on the attaching plastic pieces.

The karcher site is a pain in the rear to work with, but you can post messages to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Junk - Splits and Leaks","review":"All the internal pieces are TWO-PIECE Plastic. Not extruded one piece plastic. So after just a few uses, the high pressure starts making cracks in the seams of the two pieces. Mine had a crack in the \\"Connection Elbow\\" near the switch. Of course you use it a few times then store it until next year so warranty was up when discovered. I look and the only place to buy parts is in England. Or at least that particular part. Order it and wait a couple of weeks for it to get here and replace the part. So now the unit is able to hold pressure at the \\"connection elbow\\" which forces more pressure along the tubing into the handle and guess what, it is made of TWO-PIECE plastic and splits so now it is gushing from the broken tubing by the trigger. Can't find a part for this so I'd have to order a full pressure handle for about 1/2 the price of the original unit. Add that cost and the previous part shipped from England and you got a whole new unit.Absolute piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"great photography","review":"this was a book I kept going to the library to take out in college.... glad to have my own copy"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was twisted and looks like dried after wet","review":"It is very twisted and wrinkled.

Hacker pickes on whites? Sucks up to blacks? Hardly.I read the book some years ago and was very impressed. Hacker's use of statistics cuts through a lot of the rhetoric that surround the issue of race in America. I don't agree with all his conclusions--on the topic of race, none of us agree on every point--but he makes some very good points. My only complaint, actually, is the analysis is a bit light. I would have liked to see him draw some more conclusions. Still, if you want a statistical overview of race, linked with some good commentary, here's a place to start.Oh, and I suppose I should mention I'm a white guy. Not a self-hating white guy, just a white guy.

This book proves that it simply isn't so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check this book out of your public library","review":"White author Andrew Hacker mercilessly flays Whites and shamelessly sucks up to Blacks. 'Two Nations' is for Whites who want to feel guilty about being White, and Blacks who want to blame their troubles on Whites. For people truly interested in race and culture, I recommend buying Thomas Sowell's 'Race and Culture' . . . and returning this book to your public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"First off, I'll admit that I didn't read the whole book. Now I'll say my peace on it. Hacker generalizes broadly about the behaviors and sentiments of both whites and blacks. Though white himself, he seems to absolutely despise whites across the board as either racist scum or well-meaning but idiotic. Then he says that Martin Luther King Jr. only came to prominence as a leader of the civil rights movement because the whites in power chose him. It sounds to me as if Hacker thinks that the black population were too ignorant to choose there own leader and allowed the whites to give them their hand-picked MLK Jr. The thought of that makes me ill. Apparently, in Hacker's world view, everyone except himself is either evil or stupid.

Cole was respected, loved and feared by scores of Broadway and Hollywood dancers but no one seems to write or speak about him today. Well, here's your chance to see some of his most iconic choreography...especially noteworth is the title number. What DIDN'T I like about the film?The dull plot (did someone at M.G.M. really believe a musical of the \\"Rashoman\\" tale was a good idea?); the totally unbelievable dialogue; the fact that Gene Kelly looks too old for any of his gorgeous, sexy leading ladies; the director, brilliant George Cukor, is simply not at home helming a musical and lastly, the fact that the leading man, as written, is a boor....even Gene Kelly, certainly one of the most charming performers in movies, cannot make him palatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best forgotten","review":"This is one of the weakest musicals ever produced by MGM, leagues away from, say, American in Paris and Brigadoon. Gene Kelly, looking (oh, that wig) more like the dancers' father than lover, is saddled with a weak script that has him bickering, snarling, and bossing people about throughout the film. The girls in the story seem to be miscast, Kendall and Elg especially, and their lines are usually sappy in the extreme. The Cole Porter music is VERY minor and mostly embarrassing. The costumes are good, and the dancing is passable. All in all, this is a waste of time and money.

This story was about EMOTIONAL ABUSE - women suffering becasue some man has treated them like garbage. I was abused my whole liffe until one day I took a walk to a store (my husband had hidden the keys from me - I looked for them but at the time I was drugging - hooked on meth) and found a book on emotional abuse that changed my life.

No one will ever hurt me again."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Rashomon\\" with music and beauties, energized by Kay Kendall","review":"As several other reviewers have commented, this film, Gene Kelly's last musical with MGM, borrows its central conceit from Akira Kurosawa's immortal \\"Rashomon\\" - only this time, the central event isn't a murder, but a tangled love affair involving a song-and-dance man (Kelly) and his three gorgeous backups (Kendall, Mitzi Gaynor and Taina Elg) which becomes the subject of a media-magnet London lawsuit. The lovely, much-lamented Kendall's performance is the core of this movie (her drunken-opera scene is not to be missed!) but Elg, Gaynor and Kelly all turn in highly creditable work as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"little known musical","review":"(refering to VHS)This is one of the lesser known musicals and perhaps it doesn't have some of the innovation of \\"Singing in the Rain,\\" or \\"An American in Paris,\\" it is still a delightful musical. I have been a big fan of musicals for years and of Gene Kelly in particular. Kay Kendall is a delight, Taina Elg is lovely and very Parisien, and Mitzi Gaynor is darling as the down to earth American that keeps Gene's feet on the ground.

Zawinul did'nt like what he called Jaco's stock arrangements, but I think that was just sour grapes because Jaco was the star in Joe's band.With Toots Thielman, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock and a cast of jazz monsters, Jaco put together beautiful arrangements that would have made Mancinni and Mingus proud.Just like with Hendrix's guitar, Jaco's bass playing was the least of his gifts.John & Mary is so stellar it still hurts all these years later.This album is full of warmth, passion, color, pain, angst and joy.Big band / punk jazz by maestro Pastorius.Long Live baby !Doug CashMusician / Producer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat re: \\"Three Views of a Secret\\"","review":"This is not the same track that appeared on the original album.

The collection works beautifully on my Kindle app for PC. However, when I transferred this collection to my Kindle, the lists of poem titles and the links to them disappeared leaving only links to the poets. This means a lot of paging through text to get to the individual poems that are piled up on each other with little if any spacing between. There is an index of first lines at the back of the collection but this contains page numbers without links so is almost useless. I am only able to make use of this wonderful collection of poetry on my Kindle by using it with the information given on my Kindle for PC applicationWhy would the format be so different on PC and Kindle, when it's the same download?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it","review":"yes, this is a Very Good Book. it fulfills all the requirements of a Very Good Book, being tastefully short, having several flawed characters and one slightly ridiculous and sad main character. It might even be a Classic Good Book. But it isn't fun to read. It's dry, and sanctimonious, and you can't even bring yourself to be shocked at the dissapointing end, or to even care about the characters. Yes, it's very intellectual, but it isn't exciting, interesting, or even a little fun. Really very dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Musical History","review":"I suppose anyone can get picky and find fault with this or any other similar musical DVD. I enjoyed it immensely, and the choice of Michael Feinstein to do the narrating was excellent. I would have liked to have more of the lyrics sung to some of the songs, but in the interest of time this wasn't possible even though the program is nearly three hours long. On the other hand many of the songs I enjoyed hearing did have more of the lyrics than I expected. The great songwriters are all here. It's not necessary for me to mention all the names, but George M. Cohan, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Richard Rogers, Larry Hart, Oscar Hammerstein, and several others are all here. If you enjoy American music I can't imagine you not enjoying this historical program."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Class","review":"Perfect!!!!!!! Right from the first moment to the last this was fantastically researched and the narrative was wonderful. Ohhhhh and those old never seen before pieces of footage from the era that made music what it is today.

All of those immigrants landing in NYC with all of that yet to be discovered talent...Like Israel Baleen (Irving Berlin) and George and Ira Gershwin and Harold Arlan...WOW what a DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Nostalgia","review":"My wife and I found this tremendously entertaining, informative and absorbing.We sang along with most of the songs and found some of the moments definitely moving. The host was not intrusive and the use of movie clips to illustrate the narrative was ingenious.In a period when most movies are made for 14-year old boys, this is a treat for those of us who love movies and music. Having a Cosmopolitan while watching is definitely advised."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of $19.99.","review":"Where do I start? I suppose my biggest beef is Michael Feinstein talked almost the entire lenght of the DVD. He talked over the performers which is what I purchased the DVD for. I wanted to hear the performances, not him. And, to make matters even worse he spoke while the camera was on him but the words didn't match what he was mouthing. I wanted to see the stars, not Michael."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...","review":"I found the narraration terrible and boring. It seemed like he was lip sinking and his words did not match his mouth movement. I would have liked to see more performances and less of him. Also most of the performances seemed to be Judy Garland. I was amazed that there she was again and again, not that I don't like her but its not a Judy documentary. I was also disapointed that they ended with \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\". There was absolutely nothing about the great musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein like where was \\"Oklahoma\\", \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"My Fair Lady\\", \\"Music Man\\", \\"King and I\\"? These are some of the best musicals ever yet they were left off which I think is sad. Hopefully htey will have a part two where these musicals are covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only two reviews so far?","review":"This must be a reissue or something if only two people wrote reviews. And one of them wasn't impressed! Maybe it's not Carlton's most rockin', but it's not typical instrumental slap-together doggerel, either.

However there is much more. There are several live tracks like an awesome version of Ballad of Dwight Frye among others. Many fans think of Alice as more of a 70's icon but this album also proves that he has made some pretty good music in the 80's and 90's. This album could easily be overlooked at first sight, but the live tracks alone are worth listening too."},{"rating":"1","title":"th","review":"The guitar was a birthday gift for my 6 yr old nephew who loved it.

How embarrasing that the guitar can't even be tuned since it's not quality. The paint was chipped on each of the frets (?) So again I hung my head in shame.

However, unlike almost all WW books, this book was written by someone who is a little more upbeat and can keep the pace of the book moving by not getting bogged down in this angst-ridden tone that other books of the genre seem to have.I wasn't expecting the Vampire Hunter angle, but it really worked here. The plot had a few snags, but overall it moved really quickly and had enough action and realistic character development (something almost absent from V:tM books) to keep me interested. Plus, I live in Chicago and the author actually seemed to know a bit about the city (rather than having the just-read-the-Guide-to-Chicago feel of the clan novel series)Overall, I would recommend this book highly to action, horror, vampire and V:tM fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theology","review":"Whybray sets out the fundamentals at the onset and proceeds to open the nuances for understanding.

It seemed messy and poorly put together as you go between worlds and such.There were too many loose ends and the characters would do random, out of character things at times. It just may be me looking in to the book to much, but I felt that when the book was written, the author didn't put enough of himself into the characters. As a result, the characters seemed to have lacked definition.But, on the bright side, the plot was certainly interesting and unique. Points there."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Hawk Queen arrives in a parallel version of her own universe...\\"","review":"That's the jacket introduction - and this is the set tone for much of the book - the current enemy is really from out of the past - but from somewhere in the future there is a chance to save the present. And so, what starts as a very easy read - ye olde speak, a battle, an orphan, a man who is a leader in the eyes of his people but is at odds with the leader of his people, some magic and a prophecy... slides into a game of Chutes & Ladders as the wires get crossed - gates are opened and closed - characters arrive early as old and dying and then return later from earlier times young and ready for battle - la la la.I stuck with it - unknotting the story more times than I care to count. Not a bad read [it was a vacation airport purchase], but it's not likely I'll pursue others by Gemmell."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried","review":"I tried to read this book, a couple of times, it's so derivative and such a pale imitation of other, earlier writer's better work as to prove not worth the time or effort, sorry, my two cents worth.

And even better -- loads of fun.I was prepared to dislike Jane, the herione, after her introduction (first impression: grating -- and ungrateful to the people who saved her) but I kept on reading. I am so glad I did.Sterling manages to create an intricate world complete with elves and other magical creatures without a single stereotype (or over-the-top dramatic flourishes that give a fantasy that comic book feel) And she manages to convey a complex universe without sacrificing the story.Her characters are as good as the story. Even Jane quickly shows that she's determined rather than bratty. She and Charlie are a great match. Sterling's people and her story were lively, interesting and did I mention -- FUN. Exactly the sort of escape one needs during a dreary winter storm. Warming to the core."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...","review":"Jane Drysdale's life was radically altered when she hit a bunny with her car. At least, it looked like a bunny- but it wasn't, it was an elf who shape shifted into one. Now she' son trial for his murder, with a too die for lawyer as her defense. That is only the tip of the ice berg. Secrets buried since before she was born begin coming to light, making all she knows about the past false, and both her and her stalwart defender's futures something they never imagined.**** The title would make one believe that this is light weight fluff, but it's much more. Many elements come together, making this a great way to keep your resolution to only read good books this year. ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor...Read This Book!","review":"Ms. Sterling's vivid imagination and clever dialogue pull the reader into the story from the very beginning and don't let go until the last page.

The storyline is original, but most of the characters (especially the heroine, who really got on my nerves after awhile) have no depth (excepting the hero - I really wished he could find himself another female interest, because he was much to good for the annoying heroine) and the dialogue (which is filled with pop culture references and what are supposed to be witty quips, but aren't) falls flat in places. This book is worth buying used, but definitely not worth paying full price for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoo-boy Ho-Hum","review":"Except for the occasional witty wisecrack, I honestly found this book boring.

Big mistake. I rarely stop reading books before I'm finished (maybe 3 times in the last ten years) but I could not get through it. The characters are poorly written and the dialogue is pitiful.

The heroine automatically accepts that the planet she is on is guiding her destiny, even though she is a modern day woman from earth. She doesn't question what she should and i found her a little shallow. While parts were slightly surprising i didn't find anything that made me gasp in shock. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 due to some of the thought she made in creating the world, but the plot was pretty bad. I don't think i'll reread this book and i would borrow a book written her from the library before i bought one.

Nathan and Justin are \\"roommates with benefits\\" that are bored of their college lives and decide to get even with the \\"Ivy\\" boys by abducting, raping and killing them. Michael Burke is particularly wonderful as Justin -- his line \\"You're awesome, Nathan!\\" becomes funnier every time he delivers it.

It is a usless cashing in on Walking with Dinosaurs success. There is no need for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Walking with Dinosaurs!!!","review":"\\"Prehistoric Planet\\" is just a Discovery Kids copy of BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Beasts.

In the book he constantly talks about killing, euthanizing and even hunting the tigers, that the book (in my opinion) starts to get a wee bit morbid. He dosent talk about planing the birth of tigers in zoos, in a sort of conservation sence but rather that births just happen. So his solution was insted of puting a little effort in and planing the births of the tigers we should just let them mate whenever and then euthanize the cubs. He dosent talk abut collectivising the villages and settelments around tiger reserves,and land distribution issues concerning tiger reserves. Also he talks very little about anti-poaching patrols and how effective they can be as we have seen with rhinos in Kaziranga."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book how not to do conservation","review":"This is a waste of time for anybody who really cares about tigers.I recommend Schaller's \\"The deer and the Tiger\\", Sy Montgomery's \\"Spell of the Tiger\\" and \\"Tigers in the snow\\" by Peter Matthiessen for some good tiger books.

I have to admit, when I saw that he was going to use the same method of using history to teach cold calling principles, I was skeptical. But, to his credit, he pulled it off. This book was actually quite interesting for a topic that can be so dull. His chapter on developing an effective opening statement is the most useful cold calling information I've ever read.

The AI isn't any better than last year (one still misses lay-ups, makes bad passes, etc to make up for the lack of computer-controlled defense). Also, there are still joystick/control problems regarding player control. In short, if you dig a shallow game with a lot of eye-candy, this is for you. Otherwise steer clear of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"Every year I looked forward to buying the newest in the NBA-Live series, with each year getting better and better. I was very excited to be getting this game, thinking it would be the best, but I was wrong. This looks much like a step back for EA. Examples are, there is no referee, now the ball floats into the air magically again. The crowd looks like cartoons, with very bad animations. The players now look like cartoons as well. Little things like that may not seem important, but when it was better the year before it makes the game bad. Try Live 98, 99 or 2000 if you want a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THE LIVE SERIES","review":"I think that this game was very poorly made without much thought i hate live series and i wouldnt reccomend this basketball"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with NBA Live 2000","review":"This year's version of NBA Live is in my opinion the second worse release of the series. NBA Live '96 being the worse. The graphics are better than 2000 but that's about it. Gameplay is horrible. It is way too difficult to hit a shot on Superstar difficulty. You're lucky if you can shoot 20% in a game - very unrealistic. The 3-team trade option isn't much of an big advancement either in single player game.No wonder the release date was pushed to almost 3 months later than originally schedule. They should have taken another month or two. I am very disappointed.Save your money and stick with the 2000 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm baffled (Win2K user)...","review":"To give you some background, I've bought every NBA Live game for the PC since EA made the first one. It's the only game franchise I can't help buying. I have really liked the previous games, despite their flaws.So, like a lemming, I went and bought NBA Live 2001. I got it home, installed it OK, then attempted to run it. It showed the splash screen for about 15 seconds then crashed with a general exception error. I checked the support, and to my surprise I see that Windows 2000 is not supported. Hmmm, how many pieces of software are there out there that don't run under Win2K? NBA Live 2001 is one.So, it went back to the shop and I've given up on the series. Strangely enough NBA Live 2000 runs fine under Win2K (except for the GUI button's text, which were all scrambled). I might install Live 2K one day again for a blast, but I'm not going to bother with any more technically flawed products from EA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece for EA","review":"NBA Live 2001 keeps with the the great trend of spectacular LIVE games. The new features make this game a wonder and a must for every basketball fanatic! The graphics are outstanding along with everything you'd expect in a real game (i.e. referees' whistles, shadows, shoe squeaks, emotions, intense crowd, etc.). 2001 includes 3-way trades, animated bench, variant commentary, and a new soundtrack. Perhaps the best part about the game is franchise mode. This mode allows you to create a team and play with them for up to 10 seasons. Team chemistry can change, there is a draft, you can sign free-agents, and retire players. If you want complete basketball fun, I recommend you get this game now!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Bugs","review":"This ia a great game,However it has lots of bugs and will cause your computer to malfunction,If you do not set it on the right setting.a.a."},{"rating":"2","title":"NBA Live 2001","review":"The graphics are great, better than that of NBA Inside Drive 2000 (another basketball game I have). The game play is also better than that of NBA Inside Drive 2000 in that you can actually play a competitive game. For example, in Inside Drive, it is easy to build a 20-point, get at least a 80 FG percentage, lead and total about 150 points in a single game (the latter two never happens in a \\"real\\" NBA game). That does not happen in NBA Live. Like another reviewer said, there is no practice mode, but I kind of consider the one-on-one feature as a quasi-practice mode in that you just have one player to contend against instead of five.But in all, a great basketball game, one which I do not regret buying at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great graphics and good game.","review":"NBA Live 2001 is a good game, and the graphics are great, but just as EA Sports did in their baseball game this year (Triple Play Baseball), they took away more from the previous game than they added (where did practice mode go?). Still, the game is very well made, and as long as you have a good computer (I have a Pentium 4), the graphics are simply unbelievable. Give it a try - have fun dunking with Shaquille O'Neal and Vince Carter, and sink some threes with Reggie Miller and Dee Brown. The legends are fun to play with too - Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain, etc. Overall, this is a fun game that all basketball fans should give a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe if amazon actually would make up their mind about.....","review":"date of the release we would be able to review this game more readily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slashin' to the hole!","review":"NBA Live 2001 is the maximum fun you will ever have out of a NBA computer game.

The problem with this game is that now not nearly as many shots go in. I feel that that is not a major problem and would not dissuade me from buying it. Otherwise, the players ratings are more realistic, the players look more realistic, and the three-way trade option is good. But...about the three way trades, you can't give players from one Computer team to another, but it is almost essential to make a three-way trade work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beeeeeest","review":"This game is the best.

They did however forget to put Ref's in the game! The 2000 version had them, but for some reason they decided not to put it in. All in all. This is a major dissapointment waiting 3-4 extra months for a game which is priced extremely high for what you get.

Maybe they will get that one right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"This version is chock full of bugs from the get go. Unless you have all of your cpu's drivers updated.

Lindsay's performance on I'm So Afraid left me in awe in a way that has been hardly breached since. The performance on the album doesn't quite compare to live, but that is engineering and ambiance. It does capture the power and energy of the band at it's peak and in the raw, unlike the crisp productions in the studio.BTW, I was also fortunate enough to catch Clapton on the Slowhand tour about the same timeframe.

The tracks sound as if they were recorded in a tunnel, lacking the spontaneity and energy of the studio recordings. Of the offerings, Christine McVie comes to breathy, urgent life in a beautiful rendition of \\"Over and Over\\", and Stevie Nicks' \\"Rhiannon\\" pulsates, but itself can only hint at the furious Joplanesque vocal crescendo contained on the \\"Fleetwood Mac Live in Passaic 1975\\". Buckingham delivers a knockout performance of \\"I'm So Afraid\\" but otherwise hogs the mike and all too clearly thinks himself the band's centerpiece, which he is clearly not. His songs are often mediocre and under-developed. All things considered, this live album is more 'dead' than alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose \\"The Dance\\" Instead","review":"This album, recorded during Fleetwood Mac's 1979-1980 \\"Tusk\\" tour is disappointing. The vocals sound weak and mushy throughout. This CD documents a band that was tired and coked-out and is not even close to the excellent album \\"The Dance.\\" While it's nice to have a live version of \\"Rhiannon\\" the way Stevie Nicks performed it in the 1970's, there is little else to recommend this CD. \\"Sara\\" is a disappointment and you can barely hear \\"Landslide.\\" At the other end, Lindsey Buckingham screams \\"Not That Funny\\" for nearly ten minutes and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" sounds like a demo. Christine McVie is obviously indifferent in her songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic, Live and Raw Fleetwood Mac, not over-produced","review":"This is Fleetwood Mac. This is the raw energy captured back when they were in their prime. The Dance is pretty, but it lacks sincerity, emotion and energy. Fleetwood Mac Live is an essential part of classic rock history.

This set is great live music plain and simple. Mac classics like Go Your Own Way, Sara, and Landslide all performed beautifully. \\"Rhiannon\\" is amazing!

Also included are never before released tracks \\"Fireflies\\" and Brian Wilson's \\"Farmer's Daughter\\" bringing out Fleetwood Mac's harmonizing ability to the listener.

Okay, so Keanu isn't Pacino, and the sugar-sweet attempt at a secondary love story is unpleasant for all but the teeny-bopper set, but get real!

Not like alot of those sports movies that think you have to have alot of bed scenes to make it, this movie is funny and makes you cheer for the underdogs.

It has a lot of hilarious scenes between the characters and overall it is just a \\"fun\\" movie. Plus it has one of the most romantic scenes I have ever seen on film. It is the bar scene between Keanu Reeves' (Shane Falco) character and the head cheerleader. Something about that scene moves me every time I see it.

Especially if they had these cheer leaders on the side lines. A must have in your movie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer","review":"The Replacements really isn't a bad movie. It's something of a cross between Necessary Roughness, Minor League, and Police Academy. It's totally predictable, and not very entertaining as a result. The reason formula movie like this keep coming out of Hollywood is that we keep going to see them, buying them, and renting them.All that holds it up are a few comedic scenes and the performances of the stars. John Madden and Pat Sumerall repeatedly announce the team's games, and they've got some great lines. Gene Hackman is under-utilized, but does a great job with his role. Keanu Reeves mails in another wooden performance and you're left wondering how he's ever cast in anything.The cinematography is great, but the camera work isn't challenging. There's nothing wrong with the video or audio-both are well produced, but this isn't a title that will show off your home theater system."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad DVD","review":"The disc froze up half way through the movie.

The script was really bad, as was the movie making as a whole ... the absolute worse thing was the acting ... ughhhhh .... what was Gene Hackman thinking getting into this piece of trash. Hackman was in one of the greatest sports movies ever, in Hoosiers, but I've lost a little bit of respect for him, getting involved in this horrible film.

If you're doubting me, wait until the part where Keanu meets the cheerleader. Even her cheerleading is bad. I don't know how Gene Hackman ended up on the cast list, but this acting credit is now a blight on his career. The direction is so pathetically terrible. A film school drop-out could have done better. What an awful, awful mess. Thank goodness I did not watch more than 30 minutes of this plodding nonsense. If over-done sight-gags and prat-falls are your thing, watch this and be amazed. If you've seen other sports-themed comedies and enjoyed them, please watch them again and avoid this one.

But that's not the half of it. \\"The Replacements\\" is not really a movie, but more of a testament to everything that i hate in this world.Reeves is portraid as the flawed hero, a failed man who is finally getting his second chance at greatnes...

Gene Hackman, a favorite of ours, is excellent in his role as the coach and his honesty with \\"the replacements\\". Keanu Reeves, another favorite, is outstanding as the \\"comeback kid\\" who shows what pride, courage, and \\"heart\\" can make of a man (or woman). The whole team is funny, especially Angus, the soccer nee football player. Jon Favreau and the scene in the jail cell involving the team, after their little scuffle is hilarious with their disco dance to \\"I Will Survive\\".

It's \\"Major League\\" with football instead of baseball. It's good for a few laughs. I especially liked the fight and the jail scenes.The drawbacks: In the beginning, it's like someone decided alter the script of \\"Major League\\" just enough to not get sued.

Much more \\"produced\\" than most of her prior efforts, the album was comprised of outtakes from other sessons that hadn't fit into any of her other projects, yet the mood is remarkably consistent througout. Two of these songs, \\"Born to Run\\" (not the Springsteen tune) and \\"If I Needed You\\" were top-ten country singles, and Emmy's vocals on Chip Taylor's \\"Son of a Rotten Gambler\\" are achingly beautiful.

I never found it on cassette, so imagine my delight when it was reissued on CD! I have to agree with Sleepy Bumpkin that it speaks of lonliness and bleak landscapes, as I play it in the car on long drives. As with all of her other efforts, there are amazing musicians and vocalists here.

Hey Amazon, I'd like my 99-cent rental fee back, please. I like David Arquette and all, and he plays a perfectly good psycho, but the script was all over the place. There were unnecessary characters and unnecessary scenes, and the stuff that was actually important was constantly in darkness. I have never seen people keep their house lights so dim, or fail to turn on a light when walking in a room. The relationships between characters was needlessly developed since their interaction ended up making no sense in the end. The biggest disappointment was that all the characters don't die as bad as the film.

Heathcliff is just plain wicked--the warning he gives Linton against marrying Cathy is absolutely horrifying--and his origins, though predictable after a while, are intriguing.Unfortunately I found it came apart a bit at the end, which after ping-ponging about and even making at attempt to give the fatal romance a happy ending ends on an ambiguous note that left me puzzled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of \\"Fine Art of Small-Scale Woodturning\\"","review":"The Fine Art of small-scale Wooodturning is a pleasant journey both visually and intellectually.

Timbers are called \\"exotics\\" simply because they come from outside the USA, and then the names are misspelt - is that indicative of the global village, or is it simply parochial?

Every chapter of this book is a good tale. Anyone who loves the lifestyle will be charmed and inspired by Dan Aadlands relationship with his animals and even his pick-up and tractor.

Geez, I couldn't believe they robbed the dude at gunpoint while he was making his rounds. (He has to make an honest living like the rest of us.) As for the film's premise, it centers around the miracle of forgiveness. The moral of the story: Lending a willing heart to forgive your enemy of their trespasses.

I ordered a movie (DVD) through Movie Mars through Amazon and it would not play on any device in my house. I discarded the packaging before trying to play the movie, which I know was dumb on my part. However, it would not play and I emailed Movie Mars and they replied back saying that I purchased a Region 2 DVD which can only be played in Japan, Egypt, ect. and that I needed a Region 1 DVD. Hello, you could see by my address that I do not live outside the USA. They were not willing to replace my DVD with a correct Region 1. I looked back at my order and there was no place in the ordering process that asked what place in the WORLD that you live and no place to choose a Region 1, 2 or anything else.

Although it is texturally and sonically rich, those qualities are insufficient to redeem its ponderous plodding pace. That the musicians were able to maintain a consistant sound and tempo throughout is a testimony to their professional ability; however it is certainly laborious for the listener to pay attention to the music from start to finish, and it is not possible to aurally realize Berlioz's program notes for the piece from it.

I've also found it lacking in its depth of coverage, causing me to default to a pocket Kazakh-Russian/Russian-Kazakh dictionary I picked up along the way.On a positive note, the author was breaking relatively new ground (in 1994), so it is only right to compliment his efforts. But come on, it's been 11 years since its publishing! Isn't there anyone out there to continue the work? It begs for a revision (of its errors), an update (inclusion of new words/phrases), and an English-Kazakh section (reverse look-up).Only barely adequate.

Released about the same time as the rise of MTV and all those nasty 80's videos, Crenshaw released a pop friendly album that has stood the test of time. Naturally I was excited to see this album released by MOFI and I must say that they have done an excellent job in re-presenting this recording in glorious SACD!This mofi is an excellent balanced mix with a high degree of instrumental clarity and separation. The drums are a key part of the mix and are nicely contrasted and not in your face. Crenshaw's vocals are in the front but not so far that you feel like it is somewhere else (a complaint i have with the Pretenders Mofi release).If you are not familiar with this album you should give this a wee spin and if you like what you hear I would recommend you snag this on SACD....oh yeah and get ready to dance !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total, Crystalline, Gem Perfection","review":"It's hard not to resort to cliches when talking about this album. It is truly timeless, spacious and fresh and improves with each listening. Crenshaw channeled archetypal Buddy Holly and Ricky Nelson singing and writing to an incredibly sleek, perfect 80's idiom. The backing vocals, arrangements and sonics are also incomparable. His following releases ramped all this down considerably, but still had their moments. But this is Crenshaw's \\"Citizen Kane\\" and is what made him (and subsequently cursed him) for his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"So perfect","review":"If you have to buy one album in this mans catalog may this one be it.

Now that was a good album. I bought this cd because I wanted to listen to this album, but I no longer have a tape player. This album must be some type of remix or something. The song titles are the same as the tape I own, but everything else changed. I am extremely dissapointed in the production. The beats are horrible. This is not a typical GG album, I have 3 or 4 of them, and they all sound a heaven of a lot better than this one. This album is way out of their character. KMG or whoever you are, I suggest you getting some feedback from the OGG audience before selling nonsense like this.If you need help with production, holla at me.God Bless, Gospel Gangstaz, keep doing your thing.

The hatchet job that KMG Records did on the GG'z classics is worse than what's been done to 2Pac's posthumous recordings since his passing.

The real power of this book is not so much what's in the book, but how it's represented - how Schonbrun teaches it. In reaction to the review below, most guitar players like myself struggle with modes, scales, chord origins and such - regardless of how many books I read. If you already \\"get\\" these topics, few books if any will help you as you are in the minority. The reality is that the largest group of guitar players in this world do not have a clear understanding of how the guitar works and this is where this title excels. Explanations are clear, the tone is friendly and most important of all, he helps you understand it in your own way. I have learned much from this book and I will continue to do so for a long time. I recommend it highly to anyone you wants to advance their skills on the instrument they love so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I am really happy with this book. Even though it was written by my current guitar teacher, I'm not that biased! It's not your 'typical\\" guitar book packed with licks and little or no explanation.

It really teaches you how to think, which is a breath of fresh air.The CD is your run of the mill accompaniment CD, it plays all the examples in the book, nothing special; he does play well though :)I think almost anyone will get something out of this book. I recommend it!The only negative I can think of is that like all paperback books, it doesn't lay flat when you read it, it makes it a tad hard to play from. It's not THAT big of a deal, but spiral bound would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok... BUT!","review":"To tell the truth, 2 stars is a little harsh of a rating for this book. It's really ok. I'd think it would be good for raw beginners. I'd just like to tone down the hyper exuberance I'm seeing in the reviews so far. When people gush about how it's \\"good for anyone\\" and imply all levels of players can benefit from it... that's a little overboard as far as I'm concerned and I'd like people with a little experience who are looking for \\"WOW\\" instructional packages to be warned. I've only been playing the guitar for about three years and I've seen everything in the book elsewhere, including freely available on the web. If you already know how chords are built, basic chord progressions, your Major and minor scales and the modes derived there from... and your pentatonic scales, I'd suggest you move on to the playing type of books.
