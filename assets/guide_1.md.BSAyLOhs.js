The keys are mushy and feel cheap.3. The keyboard is very ugly and it takes up way too much desk space.The spacebar was the deal breaker for me.

Figuring it was a fluke, and knowing that Amazon is good about returns, I ordered one from Amazon. Same keys failed, in about a month. Amazon did a replacement. Same problem. I'm returning it today.

The construction seems solid and it all seems well thought out. My biggest issue with the keyboard is that the spacing of the keys is too far apart. Hitting CTRL C is a strain on the left hand. My hands are average to large so I think this keyboard would be very difficult for a user with small hands. Also, the space key is extremely loud; can't think of any reason it should be so loud.

BUT the spacebar is terrible--much too hard to press, especially from the left and right ends of it, where a touch typist normally would hit it. Mushy spacebar too. The keyboard is ergonomic for all of your hand/wrist except the thumb; I'd expect thumb discomfort/pain after a while using it. Returned it for a different keyboard. If you search the internet for the words _Microsoft spacebar fix_, you'll see that this is a common problem (but doesn't always occur--apparently some have this defect, and others don't), and that various people have tried various fixes, but none are really satisfactory. Wish I had seen this before buying it. Maybe a two-finger \\"hunt and peck\\" typist wouldn't notice this, but for this touch typist the problematic/defective spacebar is a dealbreaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While I am enjoying some of the features of my new keyboard, such as the programmable buttons, I am still finding it difficult to type due to the placement of the keys. Also, it is a very wide keyboard, which forces me to place my mouse far away to the right of the keyboard. The worst problem I am having is with the hard touch of the keys, especially the space bar. Instead of solving the problems I am having with my neck and hands, I think it has made them worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO FIRM","review":"I give this keyboard 2 stars, mostly for effort. Everything is good about this keyboard except that THE KEYS ARE WAY TOO FIRM. I am surprised that the term \\"ergonomic\\" was allowed to appear on the box of this product. The keys are stiff, and the spacebar is agonizingly stiff. This product should probably be reported as unsafe as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, these are not NEW Keyboards","review":"This is my second attempt at doing business with an Amazon Partner. Once again, I am unhappy. I bought two of these keyboards, they were described as new. They both came in scratched up boxes with broken or missing seals. Neither were packaged like new inside the boxes as well, internal packaging was ripped and the typical protective cover for USB connection was missing in both. Obviously these were returned or refurbished items.

In a \\"Green\\" world fashion, this decsion of Microsoft is more then wierd. They saved $0.5 and lost me.2. The characters are rub off the keys fast. The Plastic is two soft, so your fingers are just erasing the prints by a regular use. It never happened to me with no other keyboards, even very cheap ones. Prepair to lost some of the prints, especialy the A, C and < characters- where you fingers are resting the most.3. The space bar has to be pressed near the center in order to work smoothly. The inside mechanizem just can't handle well pressing on the side of the space bar.Without these three isuues, this keyboard could be a superb top product.Btw, it was very nice if it had a USB hub, but it's not so critic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective paint on keys","review":"In only about 6 months the paint on the keys are worn off badly. About half a dozen keys I can't barely even see! The 'N' which really among all the keys is completely gone!

So basically I am screwed and they would replace it but it would cost me more than I paid for it originally! I WILL NEVER purchase another hardware product from Microsoft since they don't stand behind their products anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multipurpose Keyboard","review":"Ever since I discovered ergonomic keyboards about 10 years ago, I haven't gone back to regular ones. The only time I use a regular one is when I am at work. Regular ones are ok, but the Ergonomic design is just better.If you have trouble typing, or learning the home row or whatever, this is the kind of keyboard you want because it helps you remember what keys are were..much easier than with the regular keyboard that just puts everything together.As far as gaming goes, the ergonomic design just helps out that much more. It allows you to find your shortcuts a lot quicker than with a regular design, same as with typing.The only drawback is as others have mentioned-The Spacebar. It is harder to press than the rest of the keys..but that's alright, other than that, the thing is perfect.Logitech does offer fancier keyboards..but it's a shame none of them (the newer ones, at least, all my previous ergo's were logi) are ergonomic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice layout but Very Stiff Space Bar","review":"I just got the keyboard this morning to replace my aging 10 years old MS Natural Keyboard. At the glace everything seem perfect for me. The lay out of the keys seem to fit my typing and I like the features that come with the keyboard. However after only few minutes I notice that the space bar is kind of stiff.Determine not to give up so easy, I continue using it for another couple hours (hoping that the space bar key may get softer or I may just get use to it). However after about 2 hours later I gave up. The spacebar is really too stiff!!. I started to feel the pain on my wrist/thumb. So despite all other stuff that I like about this keyboard, this one will definitely going back to the store tomorrow morning. I'm not sure this is just the defective one but given that several people report the same thing I will rather take my chance on different model/brand at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took a while to get used to but it really helped my wrists","review":"It takes a while to get used to the keyboard design, especially when you add the piece that lifts the front but I noticed an almost immediate relief from my carpal tunnel symptoms, especially the numbness in my fingers.

The difference in pressure required distracts and gets in the way. The keys in general I found to be oddly placed, unreliable (sometimes a given key didn't work - not sure if that's the brand or the specific keyboard I had).Aside from that, the keyboard looks great, and I loved the palm rest. But as a keyboard, where the Natural Elite excelled, this one failed. Ended up going with a Perrix as a close replacement for the Natural Elite.I hope Microsoft gets their act together, their hardware is usually a pleasure to use, and well built."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason its only $35.00 (which is overpriced by $34.99)","review":"Two words - 'Utter Rubbish' - Avoid this product. after about a year of good use, random keys just stopped responding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good features, poor reliability","review":"I'm a technical editor and spend many hours at my computer. So, the keyboard is important. I really like the feel, arrangement, and features of this keyboard. So much so that I just installed my third 4000.And, therein lies the problem. My first 4000 had to be replaced after about 6 months because the \\"X\\" key stopped working. The second started sending random keystrokes to the computer after about a month. (It is interesting to watch your e-mail client decided it needs to create an infinite number of new messages.) I just installed my third 4000. If it doesn't prove more reliable, I'll look elsewhere for ergonomic keyboards.I give this keyboard five stars for features and comfort and one star for reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential but couple big flaws","review":"The sticking spacebar makes this keyboard useless. Oh, and some of the keys work intermittently. In particular, the Y key only works about 50% of the time. I've seen other reviews with these exact same problems so it's going back and I'll try a different model/brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard; Mac compatible","review":"I've been using this keyboard for the last few months, and I love it. Keys are well positioned and properly sized, and the feel is great. Not very noisy and the keys have a reflective surface that works great at night, with the light reflected from the monitor.I used it in a KVM switch connected to both Macs and Windows PCs. Works great with both systems, and you can program the different media keys for the Mac according to your taste (requires installing extra software on the Mac).Now my only problem is that I need to get another one for work. But that's a problem with all ergonomic keyboards: you get used to the key arrangement and it's difficult if you need to use different types of keyboards on a daily basis.Also, please keep in mind that this thing is huge. That's not important if you keep it on your desk, but you won't be happy taking it with you on trips due to its dimensions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but terrible space bar","review":"As others have mentioned here, this keyboard is great with one exception - the spacebar! It is really ironic since the ergonomic form forces your hands to rest at angles, naturally drawing your thumbs away from the center of the spacebar. Any pressure at the outer corners of the spacebar causes the cheap plastic to warp and bind the plunger mechanism.I find it amazing that MS did not figure out that this spacebar is a complete piece of junk before it mass produced this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space bar way too firm for small hands","review":"I have very small hands that type hard. The thing about this keyboard is that for some reasons, when you press the center of the space bar, it doesn't require much effort. However, since I have small hands I can't always extend my thumbs to the middle of the space bar, pressing the sides of the space bar now become painfully tough.The other keys felt tight as well. However, were it not for the space bar, it would have been acceptable. So I'm in total agreement with the other reviewers who said that the keyboard can be too tight for some users.On the plus side, this is almost a silent keyboard. For someone like me who can't stand listening to the typing sound of keyboard, this is a lifesaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this keyboard without trying it out","review":"This keyboardMicrosoft Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000has a very comfortable built-in wrist rest, but that is about all I can say good about it. The keys were very stiff. The M, N and space bar are very stiff, to the point of being a major hinderance, and almost useless most of the time. I need to know when I strike a key that the text is typed, but that doesn't happen with this keyboard. I suppose if you are very heavy-handed it would probably be a fine board. I spend a great deal of time using a keyboard, and I have to have one that is responsive all the time, not one that requires me to beat on the keys to get them to work properly. Since some reviews here show that some people appear to love the board, I suspect that there may have been a bad batch or two. That is why I highly recommend trying this keyboard before you sink your money into one."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAILURE - Unusable spacebar","review":"The spacebar is stiff in the center and jams when hit at the sides. As the hands relax on the keyboard, the thumbs naturally tend to move inward. At this point, when the spacebar is hit at the upper left or right corner, it will jam. This will lead to wrist discomfort. I would need to make a constant conscious effort to keep my thumbs extended, and even then the spacebar would be stiffer than expected.NOTE: I have bought/tried this keyboard at multiple stores. This is a persistent problem that affects every keyboard that I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this keyboard only if you have thumbs of steel.","review":"This keyboard would be perfect except for one damnable flaw: the space bar is very, very hard to depress. The lower middle of the bar requires a reasonable force, but the left and right sides, particularly the upper left and upper right, cannot be depressed at all.Depending on your hand size and thumb position, perhaps this is not relevant. But for me the keyboard is completely unusable.I would not recommend this keyboard to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable--spacebar too hard to push","review":"To write this review I had to remove the keyboard and plug back in my old one. I tried to use this for a day and it was too painful--the spacebar is impossible to press. I've been working on computers for over 20 years and never have experienced anything like this. I'll be returning this ASAP.

I ordered this keyboard with hopes of improving my condition. I wish I had read the negative reviews closer.

Sorry, but I will be returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET!","review":"This new version of ergonomic keyboard is SWEET! I poured coffee into my original one (5-8 years old?)and was hesitant to order this model. The reviews were mixed. Don't let any negativity prevent you from buying this model!

Other than that one little request, this one's a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by Microsoft for Once!!!","review":"I have been looking for a new keyboard for a long time. I figured it was time to try out this particular model. YUCK!.I could hardly type on it, and some buttons required that extra oz. of pressure to type. It was un-usually BAD! I therefore decided to take a trip to a local electronics giant and see what they had on display. My findings are that most keyboards now do not have the tactile feedback we are used to, they are however more quiet and soft to the touch. That being said, I found the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 with the Blue Trac mouse to be a better feel and it was easier to type. It has been ordered and will hopefully arrive tomorrow as a replacement.2 stars on this one, a new review of the 3000 in a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"I love this keyboard, very user friendly. It divides the keys into parts and helps you to keep your hands in one place. It also has shortcuts to your favorite folders. The disadvantage is that it was purely made for Microsoft and I use a Mac Air. For example when you click the shortcut key for mail, it takes to thunderbird and not the the mail for Mac. The other thing that I don't like is that it is so big and requires a lot of space. Otherwise I recommend it for anyone looking for a comfortable keyboard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best keyboard on the market.","review":"This is really the best keyboard on the market. For those like me that suffer from pains in my wrists from using the keyboard at work, it is perfect. It puts your hands and wrists in the right spot to type.

Every one has the exact same space-bar issue.BTW, after that I conducted some expanded research on ergo keyboards. I am currently using the Kinesis Freestyle split keyboard. I've used it for several months now and it blows all the cheap ergo's away, And the Kinesis really does relieve the stress in the hands and wrist from typing.

And therefore the world's best keyboard.However, on Mac OS X, the button that would let you right-click doesn't work. To enable this button, you need to disable all of the special buttons that come with the keyboard. This is a shame, because I really like the zoom button. In the end, though, I leave one hand on my trackpad and the other on the keyboard, and being able to right-click is essential.Anyway, I didn't buy it for the special keys.

It seems well made, and is very comfortable to use. There's very little acclimation to the layout, except I'm used to hitting the 6 key with my right index finger, and it's on the left hand's side of the keyboard. The keys have a good solid feel, and you can tell you've hit the intended key (or not). The special function keys (launch browser, email, etc.) at the top are nice to have. The wrist rest is resilient and cleans easily (for those of us who snack at our desk) :-) Too early to tell whether it improves my carpal tunnel, but at least it's not increasing the condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'll stick to my Thinkpad keypad","review":"The biggest problem is that the space bar has way too much resistance--far more than the other keys-- although I think all the keys offer a bit more resistance than I'm used to. NOT exactly helpful when trying to reduce finger strain.If you have small hands, this keyboard is not for you. I felt like I had to reach excessively for some keys, like \\"y,\\" \\"control,\\" and \\"enter\\". Also, the space/angle separating right and left halves seemed too big.Too big and bulky in general- though it is pretty light for its size.Ended up returning the product. Have yet to find my ideal ergonomic keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for six months","review":"Like most Microsoft products, the keyboards have \\"lock-in\\". Once you get used to the split, you can't go back to a regular keyboard and have to keep buying new keyboards from Microsoft. I got one of these in June 2006 and used it a few hours a day until January 2007, by which time a few of the keys were no longer reliable. It is a great keyboard if you don't mind having to buy one for every computer that you use and keep buying replacements every six months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macintosh default key assignments problematic","review":"I recently got one of these keyboards at work for use with a Windows PC. I like it and bought one for personal use at home with my Macintosh. It was an unpleasant surprise to find its default Macintosh key layout switches the standard positions for the Command (ALT) and Option (Start) keys. Trying to fix this using the Microsoft Keyboard System Preference didn't work on my Macintosh (Mac OS 10.4.9). I was considering returning the keyboard, but found a utility on the web (http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net), that successfully switched these key assignments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to other reviews!","review":"This is a great keyboard.

That being said I would still recommend it and probably buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly clumsy spacebar","review":"I remembered the original MS natural keyboard was really nice and comfortable, which helps my typing a lot. But not at this time. Especially the SPACEBAR. How dare you MS sell this kind of junky stuffs to customers? You are not able to type space on side without awful amount of pressure, which means the balance of spacebar is not correctly designed. It only works whenever you hit the center of the bar. This is not the natural keyboard any longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great except for the keys","review":"The shape of this keyboard is much easier on my wrist than my flat laptop keyboard.Also, unexpectedly, it sync'd right up with my MacBook Pro - I was prompted onscreen to answer a couple of questions (which keys are next to your Shift keys?), and that was it. No messing with driver downloads and installs or anything like that.So why just two stars? The feel of the keys is HORRIBLE! They are simultaneously sticky and mushy - especially the space bar - the worst keyboard I've used within memory. I find myself making mistakes constantly. I'll give the keys a day or two to loosen up, but my feeling is that this is going back, which is rare - I'm not a big returner.I had an older edition of this very keyboard years ago, at work - and it was great.

Buyer Beware! Microsoft - fix your S*tuff!The keyboard does look sleek though -- the only reason for the 2 stars!The main keys are a bit quieter than my 10+ yr old \\"Microsoft Natural Keyboard\\" but overall that one is quieter compared to the constant \\"clack\\" (like there's ducks in my office) of the space bar.

First, there were intermittent periods when typing on the keyboard did not result in an appropriate on screen action. These periods would last typically for a few seconds. Second, there would be times when typing a character resulted in an action similar to what you'd get if you held the key down, i.e., you'd see that character run all the way across the screen even if the key was not being touched. This also happened with the space bar. Thinking that there was a problem with my wireless setup I purchased this WIRED MS Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000. Unfortunately, this keyboard does the exact same thing. It doesn't seem to make a difference which USB port the keyboard is plugged into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Microsoft test their keyboards at all?","review":"I wish I had read the 1-star reviews before I bought this keyboard.

It must make it a better keyboard, right?\\" Listen, just because it's got a hump in the middle and a left and right hand keyset isn't going to make you a better typist - just more pissed off as your typing accuracy goes into the toilet. In all fairness, my family and I attempted to use this silly thing for several months and none of us ever made a decent adjustment to it. The only memorable thing about this keyboard was its ability to induce sane people to swear like sailors as they valiantly attempted to type on it. It now sits in a closet, unused and unloved.

This means that half the time you press the N key and you get nothing. This is especially annoying for me as I'm just learning to touch type.

I would love to have one of these keyboards at each of my desks. I read some of the complaints about the spacebar and I don't have that problem with mine. Maybe mine is broken in...not really sure.One of the things I loved best about this keyboard is that the placement of the Insert, Home, Page Up, Delete, End and Page Down are still 3 across and 2 down instead of the 2 across 3 down that most of the newer keyboards have these days. I use Excel quite frequently and hardly ever use the mouse so these keys are used quite frequently. I am so used to the 3 across 2 down that using the other is almost impossible for me.I spent quite a bit more on this keyboard...and now at this price I may just buy one for each of my desks so I can be comfortable typing wherever I am.If you are used to an ergo keyboard, I would recommend buying it!

The zoom feature is amazing, especially for those who wear trifocals as I do. The 5 favorites assigned keys keep my hands on the keyboard for 5 common functions I use constantly, instead of having to go to the mouse all day. I am a medical transcriptionist and our programs are designed by people who believe the mouse is your best friend; probably 25% of my time is spent with my fingers off QWERTY, which is highly inefficient. The favorites function helps me keep my right hand (mouse hand) on the keyboard and relieves my tendinitis. And the angled pitch of the keyboard is very comfortable.Set-up was easy, and I'm looking forward to exploring the other options on this keyboard. Only problem I have found yet is that I need to press harder on the space bar, but I can adapt if it means less pain. Highly recommend this keyboard for anyone who has to type for a living. Next stop, ergonomic mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Excellent Keyboard","review":"I purchased this product for my wife who only likes ergo keyboards. She says she loves it. You really can't get a better deal. Microsoft has some great hardware.Update: This keyboard has some problems.

Like others have mentioned, the spacebar is a little hard to press. Maybe it will lighten up over time.(This is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5)The programmable \\"Favorites\\" are buttons are nice. If you forgot to program one (or programmed it incorrectly) the software kindly lets you know and pops up an interface to program the key or correct the programming.I love the fact that someone has finally put \\"(\\" and \\")\\" keys (as well as Backspace and =) near the 10-key pad. This is much more convenient than having to switch over to the numbers over the top of the keyboard.Lastly, I like the optional \\"palm lift\\" snap in piece.

Cannot go without it now.","review":"It took me about 2 weeks to get used to this keyboard because I went straight from a standard flat keyboard to this higher, split/ergonomic one. It freaked me out at first, but 1 month later, roughly, I could hardly type on a standard keyboard, nor did I want to! I'm a medical transcriptionist and I type A LOT. I love the \\"Favorites\\" keys and the Zoom in the middle. I don't know what I'd do without the Back and Forward buttons; I use them ALL the time to \\"surf\\" and use them going through folders, too. The Enter button is smaller, which I didn't care for, but I've adjusted. I do still have trouble with \\"p\\" at times, though; I think that's due to my short fingers ;o). It doesn't fit well on my desk (the slide-out keyboard holder), but I'd much rather buy another desk than go back to a regular old keyboard. I cannot do without this keyboard now! My typing speed has increased and my wrists and shoulders don't hurt me anymore.

Other than that, I'm in love with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first ergonomic keyboard, loving it so far","review":"As the title says, this is my first ergonomic keyboard and I'm loving it so far. It is extremely comfortable to use (thanks in large part to the wrist rest), has silent keys, programmable multimedia keys , and looks pretty cool.

I thought the Ergo would be a step up but the extra features were not sufficient to overcome its drawbacks. I returned it to Amazon and have ordered another Elite.The spacebar on the Ergo is loose and clicks loudly each time I depress it. Depressing all other keys takes more pressure than I'm accustomed to using. The distance between keys and the size of some keys is different than the Elite. Perhaps, with time, I would have come to appreciate those differences, but the other issues were enough to preclude my taking that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"After using a Logitech Ergonomic keyboard and wearing out many keys (I work as a medical transcriptionist), I wanted to try the divided keyboard and go a little less expensive than the model of Logitech I had. I tried this keyboard and could not type on it! As far as a hunt and peck typist or for someone that speed doesn't really matter, it might be fine, but for someone who works on production, this one just did not work for me. Went back to Logitech which is not divided but has just a slight curve to the keyboard. Seller was great to deal with, emailing me a return shipping label so no problems there whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT Keyboard IF You Never Move It","review":"Great keyboard - EXCEPT the USB cable entering the back is VERY thin, and there is NO strain relief or even an attempt to make the entrance point curve gently. In addition, the cable enters the rear of the keyboard at its deepest point. The very thin cable, the sharp bend at the entry point, and the entry point being at the deepest point mean that if you ever take the keyboard anywhere, the USB cable is abused, and consequently, the internal wires of the USB cable break. Although I am very careful (I try not to bend the cable sharply), and although I have moved it only a few times (admittedly once in a suitcase, on an airplane) it has broken twice in a few years. This last time I cannot repair it, and I am looking for a different model.I have one of these at work also, and it has worked for years just sitting on my desk.So, it's a GREAT keyboard IF you never move it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that ergonomic","review":"This is my third ergonomic keyboard and it's going back as soon as possible. The energy required to depress the keys (esp. the space bar) is considerable enough that it defeats anything gained by the improved wrist position, which any ergonomic (split) keyboard will give. In other words, it might help wrists, but still strains fingers, hands and elbows. My guess is that people rating it highly are mostly comparing it to straight keyboards. I'm buying another Fellowes ergonomic keyboard, which I loved until I spilled liquid in it (d'oh!). Those keys are incredibly easy to press and the back of the keyboard rises slightly so you don't have to reach as far for the top rows. I could type on that one all day.

The keys themsleves have a great tactile feel and are very quiet - exaclty what I was looking for. However, the spacebar is massive (and not split in two as it should have been), with the actuator right in the middle. Unfortunately, when your hands are in the natural position your thumbs are at the far left and right of the spacebar. Not only do you have to push pretty hard to get it to go down, it also makes a REALLY LOUD clicking noise because you're actually forcing the actuator down at an angle. If they redesign this with a split spacebar I would LOVE it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long history of good products spoiled by poor technical design","review":"I have used MS ergonomic keyboards since the original Natural Keyboard in 1994. I have been a huge fan of the line until this keyboard. For some reason, the keyboard I ordered from Amazon is nothing like the 4000 I've been using at my work for the past 2 years. This keyboard seems to drop keystrokes (particularly the spacebar) and there is no known workaround. Unfortunately, since this is an inconsistent issue with this keyboard, I didn't realize it was a problem until it was out of the time period that I could return the unit to Amazon.com -- so now I'm stuck with it.I have since replaced it with aLogitech Cordless Desktop Wave Pro.

It's a tool and a useful one---which is somewhat better than some of the products I've purchased with the microsoft label on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for Repetitive Stress Injury Users","review":"This keyboard is horrible for people with repetitive stress injuries because the keys are so hard to depress. I'm not sure what the manufacturer was thinking (maybe harder to push keys give the illusion of sturdiness) but it is irritating for wrists that are already prone to inflammation. I've used other keyboards in the past with greater success. I only chucked my last keyboard because it stopped functioning, but when it did work, it was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible space key","review":"This keyboard is excellent except for the space key, which is used the most.The issue is that this key doesn't push down without large force. My fingers get tired quickly with keep pushing this space key. Sometimes I had to use both my fingers to push it. It also makes noise when you push it.After 1-2 days trial, my finger's muscle gets tired and never want to use it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll notice it when you don't have it","review":"I had one of these keyboards (this is my second) and only bought another as I accidentally spilled coffee on the first one, causing some of the keys to stop working.

Keys are soft without being too spongy. The space bar issues often complained about on here has not been an issue for me. The problem is that the letters on each key rub away completely after just a few months. I notice this happens to those who regularly use lotion and/or eat greasy chicken at their desks. Most of the time, you don't need to see the key when touch typing but try it sometime without any visible letters.

Within 2 months the lettering on the keys was wearing off which since I type by touch is not a big deal. Now the left riser foot broke. I called Microsoft to buy a replacement and lo and behold they do not sell them and wanted me to buy another keyboard. Seriously? I should spend another $40 for a keyboard because of a 20 cent part even though it is in the warranty period? What a joke. We are such a disposable society today that they would only sell me a new keyboard rather than let me fix it. Sure it puts more money in their pocket while taking it out of mine. Not a chance. It will be a cold day in, well you know, before I buy another Microsoft hardware product. Why should I as they would never allow me to fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best keyboard ever","review":"As a software developer, I spend my entire day typing for the most part. This is the only keyboard I can use that keeps me from getting wrist pain. Every developer in the office has switched to this same keyboard and we all love it. For me there really is no other option as far as keyboards go. The one bad thing I have to say about this keyboard is that it is not tolerant to liquid spills in the least bit. I've killed two of these by spilling a very very small amount of liquid in it. It literally short circuits the circuit and dissolves it so that it is irreparable. Lesson learned, be careful with liquids around it, and unplug it IMMEDIATELY if you spill liquid on it. That was my own dumb fault though so I can't really complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable Garbage","review":"The spacebar sticks and is incredibly hard and stiff to use. This fact alone makes it completely unusable and it is going straight in the trash. It's a known problem that Microsoft is doing nothing about, as a Google search revealed.

I wanted to update to a USB model, and so I bought the 4000 model without hesitation. Unfortunately, as other reviewers discovered, the space bar is difficult to press down.....so much so that it makes typing rather difficult, which is exactly what an ergonomic keyboard is supposed to help alleviate!! As such, this keyboard is all but unusable, unless you type with only your index fingers. If I could give it zero stars, I would.Did MS even *test* this product? It's a disgrace that they would release something that has such a glaring deficiency.....but then, it's Microsoft, so why be surprised.

Unfortunately, with each replacement keyboard (and they only last a year or so), the quality has gotten worse and worse. I had to return one of these as the \\"b\\" and \\"n\\" keys of the last one wouldn't type at all. This one has a very rattle'y spacebar and the keyboard touch has gone downhill. I'm still having driver problems where the quote mark won't type unless a space is pressed immediately afterwards.Honestly, if there was another choice out there, I'd switch in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"This keyboard performs better than I ever imagined. Highly recommend. I have used an older model for years and they have improved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Key Feel","review":"I find this keyboard impossible to type on.

Could be more durable.","review":"I just plugged in my second Ergo 4000 keyboard. The first one developed a stiff \\"6\\" key after about 18 monthes of use. I suspect that I hit this key at an angle, since it is rather far from my fingers when typing. That may have bent something inside the keyboard. My older Microsoft keyboards are still going strong after more than five years.I am sticking with this keyboard because it seems to offer the best ergonomics of any reasonably priced product.

I am regretting my decison for not listening to the people. You can not use the space bar of this key board easily. It requires some effort, and you can only press it in certain angle. Probably, even a cheap key board will not have this problem.

Also some of the special keys (favorites, calculator etc...) are really useful. But that does not make it worth getting this board for. The keys are completely mushy. I have dealt with a lot of keyboards before that had this problem, but never to this extent. The spacebar only moves about one out of every three times I hit because it just kind of presses in, no snap or quick release to it. The Right hand shift is the same way.

The spacebar as many have mentioned had to be pounded to get it to operate. And I found that the angle of the keys meant my elbows had to be kept at an uncomfortably wide angle, causing instant discomfort in my shoulder muscles.Also the keyboard is huge, and if you're not a big number pad user and you're right handed, it puts the mouse waaaaay too far to the right to be covenient or comfortable.I'm still searching for the right keyboard, but this certainly wasn't it.For me, a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 8 months","review":"Before purchasing, I read the many reviews that warned about how this keyboard stops functioning after a few months of use. I decided to chance it and bought the keyboard anyway. I hoped the durability issues were just flukes. Unfortunately, they are not. After 8 months of use, the keys stopped working correctly. Whenever I typed E, EW appeared. At first, I thought my typing skills were going bad. Then, the JK keys got stuck together. Eventually, the keyboard became completely unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Designed for someone who types \\"correctly\\"","review":"Overall, it is a nice keyboard.However, the split nature will force you to figure out if you type correctly or incorrectly.I found that I type incorrectly, so I am currently struggling a bit.I have had it about 3 weeks now, and I am still hitting some wrong keys.I am a programmer, so I type all day long and am pretty fast at it.However, I did try going back to my old regular keyboard, and found that more frustrating.So I will keep using this one and hopefully I will get used to it soon.However, someone else's warning about it making it hard to use a standard keyboard (and laptop keyboard) is certainly true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Design","review":"Nice idea - an ergonomic keyboard to help my suffering wrist. However, the keys were sticky and noisy, and the spacebar stuck about every fifth time it was struck. The stuck spacebar alone made the keyboard a failure.

And like everyone else says, the space bar sucks and the keys are way too damn loud.I don't know what else to get, I'm tired of trying out keyboards, and I'm tired of the pain.

Unless you are applying pressure to the very center of the bar (rather than favoring the right or the left sides), an unusual amount of force needs to be applied just to operate it.This is extremely bothersome because it slows you down while typing as well as making it more fatiguing. It is also quite loud...I've actually had people in other rooms complain about the racket!NOTE: the sticky bar issue with this keyboard is an extremely common one (if not universal).

I purchased it despite seeing these complaints because someone commented that he thought it had been fixed. It has not as of 12/8/2011. It's quite disappointing to see Microsoft not bothering to fix this one glaring issue on one of the most used keys.

This takes some getting used to, but the design lends it self to quick familiarity. It's well built and very quite, unlike my other click-clacker.

The space key on this keyboard does not respond well because of the design. Your left thumb will reach the far left side of the space bar, which is designed to respond effectively if you press it in the middle, which you can't do unless you have a six inch thumb. This forces you to extend your thumb and stress the wrist. After two days of using this product, I may need surgery. Do yourself a favor and buy a normal keyboard.

The second keyboard, the \\"x\\" key has stopped working. <-- I just spent a couple of minutes looking on this page for an \\"x\\" to cut and paste.

I use the / symbol alot and I was constantly missing it and hitting the Windows key and opening the Windows page. I finally had to inactivate that key. Also, the space bar is very sluggish and my words were running together a lot. The keys are very slippery and my fingers were constantly sliding off them.

I have used this for writing reviews here and reviews for my employees at work. This is a great gaming keyborad as well. You can make macros if your a macro hacker.

I use my calculator quite a bit. and this has a calc hot-key so you don't have to go into your start menu or anything. The other hot keys are useful as well. The top left goes to your internet Home-Page, the second goes to your internet search bar. They started to think about internet users and the actions they most commonly take. Then put it on the keyboard to make it easier to accomplish. HOORAY microsoft. now just let me use your software without some massive bugs or viruses and i'll be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven quality, sticky spacebar and other keys","review":"I have bought or used at least three keyboards of this model. They all have different feel/characteristics, as if all made by different manufacturers. The first one was great: quick, quiet and very smooth. The second one was terrible, several keys are really sticky--they don't bounce back right away, and the Space bar is the worst of them all. Sometimes, I had to press it a couple of times not knowing which hit will show up. Then I had to Backspace out the extras. It was living hell. Then the last one is OK. Not quite as good as the first one but not as sticky as the second. I only used it for a couple of weeks now, so can't say for sure.It is still the only ergo keyboard that works with Mac (with build-in volume and play buttons) so I have little choice.

The only thing which we would like to see changed is the little plastic pieces on the back which lift the keyboard up at an angle. You have to be really careful with them because they break off easily. The keyboard still works well ~ it just takes away the option to have your keyboard at an angle. It works just fine laying completely flat on the desk though. Even with that little issue ... we would still purchase another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for small hands","review":"I have really small hands, and after 3 weeks of using this keyboard, my finger joints are in pain whenever I type. I bought this keyboard to potentially avoid an occupational hazard, but it seems this keyboard itself IS the occupational hazard. The size of this keyboard is built more for guys who have larger hands, and I find I have to constantly move my hand around or stretch my fingers to reach all the letter keys. Don't buy this if you have small hands (for comparison, my tiny hands are the same size as my 13 year old sister's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space bar ruins it","review":"Everything feels right, but the space bar is so stiff you have to SLAM it to make a space come up.

Pretty much useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, very poor tactile feel","review":"Over the years I have had many, many Microsoft ergonomic keyboards.The model 4000 arrived about a month ago. The design is good but the feel of the keys is poor. The action is at times very coarse and sometimes they hang resisting depression. Additionally, some keys are easier to depress than others which interferes with typing.Clearly, the bean counters have been at work at MS and have cheapened up the key action significantly. Not acceptable at all. More junk from China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful for small hands (average women)","review":"The 'ergonomic' keyboard is painful to use! My hands are on the small side of average for a woman. To make the space bar work, I either have to push down extremely hard with my thumb in a normal position, or else twist my wrist to hit more to the center of the space bar. (My thumbs naturally fall on the far ends of the spacebar, not the center.)I am going to return the keyboard, because for a small-side-of-average-woman like me, this keyboard is the opposite of ergonomic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Ergonomic But Unreliable","review":"I'm already on my second keyboard of this model, after the first one stopped working after a only a couple of months. The second just started giving me problems after 2 years of easy service - not acceptable.Though the design is very comfortable (though takes getting used to) and has been able to relieve me of wrist pain, the unreliability means my next keyboard will be a Logitech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very hard to type on if your used to regular keyboards","review":"When I first got this keyboard I hated it. But after I took off the slope thing and sloped it the other way, I really like this keyboard. If your not used to ergonomic keyboards but are trying to transfer to the type because of comfortability and posture, I recommend this one. Once you feel comfortable enough with it, put the slope back on. But how I have it setup now is how it looks in the first photo, and it works great. Couldn't be happier because the wrist rest is pretty comfortable and looks like it will last. Keys are almost silent too which is nice. Highly recommend this keyboard for it's price/comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've bought 5 of these... not because they're broken...","review":"So I do a lot of typing. I work in technology and at every job I've had in the last 5 years, I've made sure to get one of these keyboards along with my Logitech Performance MX mouse. This is my go-to set up on every computer I use.I love the wrist riser and how it keep my shoulders comfortable while I'm typing for hours on end. I'll admit, it took me about 2-3 days to get used to the split keyboard deal, and you have to be able to type... but it's a CRAZY good keyboard, it's quiet and I've found that I actually type faster on this than I ever could on a straight keyboard.get it... get it now... you won't regret it and you won't go back"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a nice keyboard","review":"This is a nice keyboard. I would recommend it to regular customers. There are only a couple of things that I can say I don't like. The 5 buttons that you can use to assign to diferent applications would work fine if the software were a little bit more flexible. It is not compatible with Java applications. Its missing also the forward and back keys for the media player (I miss them a lot). Taking out these 2 things, the keyboard is fine. Its very confortable and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"misrepresentation of ergonomic benefits","review":"The main space bar is very sticky, as one would learn from the numerous searches people have conducted on Google to learn how to fix it. In fact, there is no easy fix. I have found that using this stiff bar has exacerbated my thumb pain. Now Amazon will not allow a return since I'm past their very short return period. I don't know what warranty rights an Amazon purchaser has with respect to Microsoft. Shouldn't Microsoft fix this product, rather than continuing to sell it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keys too Hard Especially Space Bar - My fingers started hurting - Looking for alternative","review":"I was excited about the keyboard. I noticed on day one that I need a sledge hammer to use the space bar. But hoped that I would get used to it. Used it a few months. But my fingers have started hurting. Going to dump this and hope to find one with softer keys. I don't recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed Spacebar - Caveat Emptor","review":"The large, clunky, hard to press space bar ruins an otherwise fine product. My right thumb started aching after about just 15 minutes of typing. I returned the product. The space bar just pummels the right thumb in particular (maybe mine is weak, but I am a healthy fifty year old. Like I say caveat emptor. Check the keyboard out in the store first!!My feeling (as a layperson,not an expert) is that this keyboard might cause injury to some people's thumbs over time with prolonged use. Microsoft, in its latest keyboard iteration, the Wireless Laser 6000 has substantially decreased the size of the space bar and made it for more responsive and easier to press. This is, in my view, a tacit acknowledgement that its earlier generation of space bars were too hard to press."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the keys doesn't work!!","review":"I can't type the key that doesn't work, because it doesn't work!!!!!!

This keyboard is very comfortable and easy for my wrists. I am glad that I gave it to try.I only use my keyboard in front of my computer, I prefer keyboards with wire without batteries to wireless with batteries required.Two things to mention:1) I was little bit confused by Function keys' setting; they were programed in different command. I use Asian characters and using Function keys a lot, I had to find a way to make them to default function. I found FLock key next to Function 12 and it solved with one push.2) Space key is little hard to type when you hit the corner of the key. I had a habit of hitting the corner but now I am hitting the center of space key without training or thinking. Keyboard design helped me to type the center, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard with some minor flaws","review":"I've owned this keyboard for almost a year and I'm very happy with it. I was excited to see that Microsoft came out with an ergonomic keyboard where the Insert/Home/Page Up/Delete/End/Page Down block is oriented in a 3x2 group rather than a 2x3 group. I'm a programmer, so I use these keys all the time and I wanted the standard layout. The keyboard has a nice feel and I love the extra keys along the top. Another annoyance with my previous MS ergonomic keyboard was that the F-Lock key was always off on a reboot. As a programmer, I use the F keys all the time, so I'm happy to say that this keyboard remembers the setting.One gripe about this keyboard is that the zoom slider doesn't seem intuitive for scrolling. You push it up to scroll down a page. That just seems wrong to me, so I don't use it.My only other issue is that both of the back feet finally broke, so I can no longer tilt the keyboard up. I wish I could buy replacement feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keyboard","review":"Still getting used to this, like it now. The Right control key below shift is unwanted and I can't disable it.

In under 1 minute, I noticed that the Space-bar keeps getting stuck and repeating itself until I hit hard again. Without a working Space-bar, the keyboard is useless, no matter how comfortable it may be.So, I contacted Microsoft Support. Yes, the immediately created an order for a replacement. That was nice.After 2 weeks, nothing happened. So, I tried to chase down the Support personnel and there was no response. I created another trouble-ticket and they claimed that their system is having technical issues.Oh well, I guess I am just out of luck. Bad keyboard, broken Microsoft Support Tracking System, what more do I need to make my day.I am spending too much time on this broken keyboard. Don't bother considering this keyboard. There seemed to be a design flaw in the space-bar. I am not the only talking about this issue in this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000","review":"I'm a computer consultant and had used this keyboard model before. Initially the vertical curve of the keyboard felt a little odd but I became accustomed to it quickly. It's much easier on my wrists than a flat keyboard. Purchasing it from one of Amazon's \\"Daily Deals\\" saved me about 60% of the in-store cost and it arrived on the 2nd day after I ordered it. In my opinion it's the best keyboard available for anyone who works on a computer every day.

Easily the most awful thing I've ever encountered on a keyboard. You have to slam your thumb down on it right in the middle and it makes an awful clunking sound. Thankfully my hands are fairly large, so I don't have to stretch my thumb TOO much, but after only a little typing I can feel tension in my hand and pain in my thumb.

Our users seem to like the ergonomics, but that is about it.These keyboards suffer from poor quality (made in China like everything else these days) and I've got a stack of bad ones sitting beside me that have to be thrown out due to non-functioning keys. I've also had users complain about sticking spacebars (yes, even on relatively new keyboards), and they just don't seem to hold up.You've been warned - these things are poor quality and you're taking a risk buying one.

I know many people have written about the Space Bar, but I couldn't believe that it could be so loud....and the one in Best Buy didn't seem so loud during that trial. I noticed that if you depress the space bar with your left thumb, that it isn't so loud. Also, the space bar requires much more push than the rest of the keys.

I ended up giving the keyboard away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe Flaws","review":"As often mentioned, the spacebar on this keyboard is stiff and loud. I have been using my keyboard for six months now and there has been no change in that. Additionally, the \\"h\\" key does not work properly on my keyboard.

I really liked the keyboard I had, but had a tragic coffee accident when trying to change the batteries. The wireless keyboard uses a usb transmitter, so when I saw usb, I, non tech dummy that I am, assumed it was the same. It was not. It doesn't use the standard keyboard plug,which would have been acceptable, but needs a precious dedicated usb connection.

It is highly resistant to one-thumb pressure. Before purchasing this keyboard, I read the reviews that cited this problem but, silly me, I just couldn't imagine how bad the problem is. Well, I found out - the HARD way!Returning to my claim of flexibility: I have had to retrain myself to hit the space bar with both thumbs simultaneously. Doing so works but has slowed me down considerably. Fortunately, I'm retired so I have plenty of time to practice AND, because of my age, I'm expected to be slow. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same fatal flaw - bad space bar","review":"I went ahead and got this in spite of the reviews, hoping I would get a keyboard with a decent spacebar. But, no, it's just as everyone described. It's hard to hit, clunky, noisy, and causes thumb pain within minutes. I'm hoping the replacement may be the rare \\"one in however many\\" that actually is ok. The only good thing I can say is that at least Microsoft has good customer service, because after just half an hour on the phone, they're sending a replacement keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought and returned after 3 days","review":"I returned it because the space key was excessively noisy when pressed (a very loud clunk) and required excessive force to depress. It was annoying and slowed my typing down dramatically. (I'm also not sure I like the \\"split\\" design, but I probably would have gotten used to that.) NOTE: at a local Staples, I found an example of this model (albeit much more pricey at $49 on sale marked down from $59) which when I tried it hands-on had a much looser and quieter space bar ... maybe Microsoft has fixed the problem, but the supply chain still has the defective ones on sale. Conclusion: don't buy this keyboard sight-unseen, but if you can buy it in a store for a reasonable price and it doesn't have the loud space bar, then go for it. Just make them open the box before you buy if possible, because if you get stuck with a noisy one, you'll lose your marbles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space bar questionable","review":"I use the same keyboard at work.

I actually got one at work first and loved it so much that I bought one to have at home. At first, the curvature was a little awkward, but I got use to it really quick. Now, it's odd to be without it. I like the extra keys that it has too: back and forward buttons, zoom slider, 5 keys you can program what they do, calculator button. It is necessary to install the included software (Microsoft IntelliType) to take advantage of all the extra keys/buttons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible key action","review":"Key action was horrible - which is really too bad since the feel of the keyboard was very nice.

That's enough to make it the Vista of keyboards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the key response","review":"I didn't like the way the keys or the space bar responded, all very stiff & noisy. I type a lot of data into spreadsheets & need quick and accurate response, but this was the opposite - stiff, slow, somewhat clumsy under fingertips, and large. You know how you just want to feel no resistance, or noise - it wasn't this model. I even let my teenager try it to see if he wanted it before sending back, but he also couldn't stand it, and we immediately put it back in the box, it wasn't up to par, so we are returning. The one thing I liked was the built in gel wrist pad, that feature should be kept and the rest of it thrown out. If they would purchase a better designed keypad and put it in a smaller keyboard and use the same gel wrist pad, it would improve it a lot.

The spacebar is very stiff and oddly designed. You have to hit it at just the right spot and at the right angle or it sticks/hits on something below it that does not give. Very painful over time to my shoulders and very disruptive to my normally fast typing. I should also say that my fiance, who has large hands, felt the spacebar was a problem for him as well. But I found that in general my hands may have been too small for comfort with the layout of this keyboard. I also found that the keys were not as comfortable to hit over time as I had hoped. But the spacebar was the real \\"sticking\\" point that got me to decide to pack it back up today in order to return it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for touch typists - non-standard hand for number \\"6\\" key","review":"As a skilled touch typist accustomed to the standard keyboard layout, I was surprised and disappointed to discover that this keyboard forces you to use your left hand to reach the \\"6\\" key.Microsoft decided to make the \\"7\\" key twice as wide, and move the \\"6\\" key to the left side of the split layout -- where the right hand cannot reach it.This to me is a fatal flaw. If you don't touch type the numbers, maybe it won't bother you -- but if do, or if you share the keyboard with others, they might find themselves mistakenly typing \\"7\\" when they meant to type \\"6\\". I did this a few times already, but I'll be replacing this keyboard with something better as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"too stiff, doesn't like macs","review":"The space bar is much too stiff on this keyboard (especially on the right side).

A cheaper keyboard, Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 is much better, although its \\"Backspace\\" is also stupidly harder to press than other keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"mostly good ergonomic keyboard","review":"I bought this keyboard to replace an old crappy logitech keyboard/mouse set, and so far its alright.pros: good number of keys, with extra buttons thrown in as wellquite comfortable to usehas a pretty nice built in wrist-restcons:the damned spacebar wont depress properly if dont use allot of force if you hit it near the top of the keythe spacebar is LOUD it will go CLACK CLACK CLACK as you are typing while the other keys are quietits bulkytakes a bit of getting used to due to the curved design and the keyboard being split in twooverall, its a pretty solid keyboard, and the gripes I have with it are mostly minor, the only con that really gets me is the spacebar, given that its a US style keyboard, the space button will be used a ton since english uses spaces often...ill see if I can pry off the spacebar and use some WD40 or something, im not sure if it will help or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST KEYBOARD YET","review":"I have tried at least 15 keyboards in the last four years. I still have five or six. This is the most comfortable keyboard I have ever used. It actually increases both the speed at which I can type and the time I can spend typing.I was already a fan of the \\"Natural Pro\\" type keyboard because of its comfortable position. This keyboard is even better because of the down slope of the keyboard. If you get your chair and the board at the right height relationship you will find that there is no fatigue even if you are typing long documents for hours. This is as good as I have ever used.My only criticism is that the space bar makes too loud a noise when you are typing. It is not loud enough to make me do anything but mention it. The feel of the keys is just right.Anyone want some keyboards only slightly used?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Keyboard","review":"I use this keyboard as a computer programmer everyday and it is excellent for anyone who loves split keyboards. The wrist rest is padding, but doesn't get too oily over time. My biggest gripe is the positioning of the left/right navigation keys in the bottom center. It's far too easy to accidentally hit one. This can be very annoying if you really didn't want to navigate back/forward in your web browser. Overall though, the keyboard is good enough that I bought one for home usage with my laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent keyboard","review":"This keyboard is my first split keyboard and I and very happy with the elevation and the action of the keys.

I have to relearn where the keys are, but otherwise, I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very ergonomic, but a big flaw","review":"First of all, I am not a traditional typist, I do a lot of \\"two finger typing\\". It did slow down my typing speed a bit but not as much as I anticipated. I could see myself getting used to it, The key layout is very comfortable. I like the soft feel of the keys and it's not terribly noisy, like my Dell L100. But one attribute kills the potential beauty of this board, the space bar, which is one of the most used keys.You have to hit space directly in the middle in order for it not to have a sticking feel. If you try to press it from the sides it takes a lot more pressure. You have to hit it hard then it seems to slam down, highly unacceptable and annoying when you are trying to type fast.If it wasn't for the worst space bar design I have ever used, this keyboard would easily get 5 stars. But I must give it 2. I also read that the lettering on the keys wears off after a short time. This I did not experience for it took me a day to realize that it must be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"Replaced an old MS Ergo keyboard with a similar layout, but this has a more concave, rather than convex orientation under each hand. Took a little adjusting, but it's quite comfortable. My biggest reason for using these is the wrist angle required by regular keyboards is uncomfortable and the angle is pretty much the same, facilitates a much more natural wrist angle. No major complaints.Side note: what's up with the \\"Wow incredable\\" attribute? They know incredible is misspelled, right? Am I missing a joke?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Satisfied - But Buttons stopped working","review":"It is a great product. No complaints. Got used to the new shape pretty quickly.

Will update once I do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic keyboard-the pain is gone!","review":"I got this keyboard after hearing Marco talk about it on his podcast. I had been having some pain in my left wrist and thought I would give this one a shot. This keyboard is great. It looks a little funky with the piece that raises the front edge up but boy does it feel great. Your wrist stays straight inline with your arm. All of my pain is gone now. The space bar is a little bit loud while all of the other keys are very muted sounding. I also love the calculator key. Very handy for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail Proper Keys!","review":"I have been using the keyboard that was included with my newest computer for some time now. After an incident involving a glass of cola it was never quite the same, even if still functional enough. I finally gave in and purchased this upon a friend's recommendation. I had forgotten what it was like to have a keyboard with proper keys. And the wave design is as comfortable now as it was back in my early college days. Still getting used to all the extra buttons, but the only way this could get better is if it was back-lit and the keys were a bit more click-ly. But it is a definite buy if you need a good solid keyboard and value your wrists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller sent a used keyboard!","review":"Received the item in a short period of time. Upon installation, realized that installation CD was missing. Was able to install anyways only to discover that several keys didn't work.

I am still awaiting a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best keyboard I've ever used","review":"This is my 4th Microsoft ergonomic keyboard. First two were PS/2 models, which were passed down the food chain to kids. This is my 2nd 4000 model. The first was wrecked by a spilled cup of coffee (liquids are banned from within 3 feet of my desktop now). Unlike old-school keyboards, which you could literally run under a tap to clean out, any liquid pretty much kills electronic keyboards. Anyway, lesson learned, and my replacement was only $26, so I can't complain.This keyboard is sturdy and big. It doesn't move around the desktop. The built-in wrist rests are incredibly comfortable. I can type a million words a minute (or so it seems) on this thing, compared to hunt-and-peek index finger typing on a straight keyboard. Once you've gone natural, my friends, you can't go straight again.Not much else to say that hasn't been said already about this fabulous product. Microsoft makes great keyboards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality has gone down","review":"I've been using these for many years but the copy I bought today was returned in favor of a Logitech product.The key press on the new one had a kind of raspy quality and the pressure for the space bar is noticeably higher, which makes it hard to get used to working with it.I won't buy any more. (I already have 3 in use.)Look for an older one in a thrift shop if you really want MS- I got one for $2 that works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Board- used to be very expensive","review":"Once you get used to this board, its great. I used to use this board in my office but never bought one for home because it used to be so expensive. All it needs is a cool blue light underneath the keys to snaz it up a bit. I gave it only 4 stars for ease of use just so that buyers will know that there is a little to get used to when you switch to an ergonomic board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keyboards buttons stick, especially space bar.","review":"I ordered this keyboard through my company. They gave me some strange looks because they had to order a special one for me. I need it though to prevent strain on my fingers.So anyways the company delivered it and when I started typing I noticed how much the space bar sticks. It makes a loud noise too when you hit it. I dont want to bug my company so hopefully I'll get used to it.Microsoft is such a strange company. They make billions of dollars but the company is essentially run by really smart little kids who make tons of mistakes. I cant believe no one ever QA this. I also cant believe they haven't fixed this keyboard will all the complaints. I guess that's Microsoft for you. Everything they do half works."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke 2 weeks in.... very unhappy","review":"We purchased this keyboard. I have one in my office and purchased one for the house.

It is now the end of January 2013. The keyboard has failed. While it was working I liked it, but the key touch is amazingly soft. I like a keyboard with a click kind of touch. I have an Apple and the keyboard just stinks. Nonetheless it keeps working. Failure after two months just isn't acceptable.What to do? Looks like I'm out the bucks because Microsoft built a crummy keyboard. My wife will try and send it back. Hopefully, Amazon will stand behind their products. They always have.AD2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash it before buying","review":"I use Microsoft keyboards for many years and I was always happy until this keyboard appeared. It feels great, it looks good but it's just not working. I've owned 2 keyboards in row. On my first \\"H\\" button breaks every 2 month and I have to use my screwdriver and clean the keyboards, all the insides are very cheap and unprotected. Anything inside keyboard can prevent a button from functioning.Then I've decided to buy one more keyboard. A month and a half later \\"Y\\" key is barely functioning. So if you have better things to do than unscrewing and cleaning your keyboard, choose anything else. I still have noname keyboards from 95 and all of them still function excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty space bar","review":"The loud and sticky space bar ruins what would otherwise be a wonderful keyboard. All of them seem to do this (per other reviews) It is a function of the fact that there is one switch in the center of the space bar and the force at either side of the bar causes it to rack to that side and twist the guide above the switch, increasing the energy needed to push the bar down. (The torsion bar doesn't do its job.) Then it makes a loud noise when it hits the bottom. I would not want to use this in a public setting. Since I like the layout, I'm going to try to fix it, but I have a machine shop at my disposal. If I didn't, I'd throw this away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this keyboard for 3 reasons. First, I thought the mechanical feedback for the key press was poor. Some keys, particularly the space bar, required significantly more \\"push\\" than the others. Also, the space bar was particularly noisy when fully depressed. Second, the ergonomic design of the keyboard was quite pleasant, but the spacing and the sizing of the keys (some letter keys are larger than others) made typing a bit difficult; larger hands may find it a bit easier going. Finally, the web quick access button did not permit programming any other browser to open other than Microsoft's Internet Explorer, even bypassing the default browser (FireFox) set up on my computer. Other buttons could be programmed for it, but not the button labeled for the Internet. For those 3 reasons, I returned it since it was going to be too frustrating to live with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad for RSI sufferers","review":"I've had a pretty serious case of RSI for quite some time now and have tried many keyboards. for the last 2 years, i've been using the microsoft natural keyboard and can definitely tell that it's much better on my wrists than an ordinary flat keyboard. unfortunately, my natural keyboard is starting to act funny, so i bought the natural ergo keyboard 4000. i had high hopes because it looks nice, i like the reverse tilt (i often roll up a towel and put it under the front of my natural keyboard to create the same effect), and it seems to have some nice feature.unfortunately, i'm going to return it to the store primarily because the keys are just too hard to push -- especially the spacebar. it's actually hard enough on my hands that as i started to type this review, i decided to stop, unplug the ergo 4000, and use the natural keyboard instead. maybe the keys will loosen up with time, but i can't afford to aggrevate my RSI in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used previous natural keyboard...","review":"I have 2 10 year old natural keyboards with the old keyboard layout and when I saw this new keyboard with the same layout I bought one. Sadly, this keyboard is painful to use. The keys - especially the space bar - require far more force to use that my previous keyboard.

The 2nd one had a space bar which did not even move. I wrote a long review and Amazon did not post it. Bottom line, stay away from this keyboard! You will only have to return it.

You have about a full half inch square available - why not use it?? Why must you put tiny letters in the upper left hand corner? Are you not aware that some users have problems with vision?(2) Worst of all: the paint wears off. If one types fairly regularly on this keyboard for a couple of years, the white paint on the keys telling you which letter is which wears off to the point that you can't even see them! At least that's true on the letters one's fingers hit most often. All you have left are your mechanical habits dictating what letter to hit when, and they are often not enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Refurbished keyboards with problems within a week.","review":"I've used the same keyboard at work from Fry's, and figured I'd save a few bucks off retail by getting this on Amazon.

The biggest problem I found in the other reviews was concerning the space bar being as loud as an old typewriter - this bar is nowhere near that loud! I've been using a keyboard that makes a lovely click when I type, for the past few years. Whereas not everybody loves that, I can assure you this space bar is not even as loud as the keys on my previous keyboard. It is slightly louder than the rest of the keys on this board, but that's not very loud, really. The volume of the keys on this keyboard, I would say, falls right in between clicky ones and squishy, quiet ones. I enjoy the slight squish and slight click combo. This thing just feels good! :0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the keyboard, until feet fall off","review":"I'm pretty annoyed that I spend money on a premium product from a premium company and the little rubber feet fall off of it within 6-months. As soon as I lost just one of the feet, the keyboard wobbles when you type. If you take the other ones off, the keyboard slides around on my desk.I mistakenly figured that this happen all the time and microsoft would be all setup to just mail me a package of the appropriate feet. I was even willing to pay some reasonable fee, but NO LUCK. In fact, the rep acted like it was the stupidest thing ever to call the company for this kind of replacement part. She suggested 5 times that I just go down to my local computer store and get the feet. I seriously doubt that BestBuy or any other place has the exact feet that fit in the groves for this keyboard and if you don't line-up the height right that keyboard is off balance.Scratch microsoft off of my list of customer friendly companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes hand fatique!","review":"The keys are very hard to press - within 1 minute of typing, I am already feeling cramps in my hands.

Leave it to Microsoft to blow it by creating a beautiful keyboard only to make it unusable because of the space bar. I read the previous reviews where folks complained about the space bar but figured since this keyboard has been around for a while MS would have figured out and fixed the problem. Nope, you have to push the space bar down right in the middle for it to work, otherwise it goes down at an angle causing too much friction and not creating the space-character. It's called physics.For me to type this review, I have to extend my thumb has far out as possible to ensure I hit the space bar in the middle. NOT VERY ERGONOMIC.In short, I'm returning this dog and buying another Adesso keyboard. They have two space bars - one for each hand.

Regardless we all know what a keyboard should feel like (and if MS puts an ergonomic on the box I expect it to feel better than that), also this problem has been around for over a year and they are still shipping keyboards with the problem.

I purchased the 4000 and tried it out as a replacement. The keyboard is huge. If you are using a computer desk with a slide out keyboard tray, this monster will either scrape underneath the desk or not fit in at all when you try to slide it back in.There are lots of bells and whistles such as programmable keys and the sort, but these are more of a gimmick than anything else. The key response and placement are ok, but it's easy to mistype because of the angle of the keys.After two days, I returned this keyboard. It has a nice wrist cushion, but overall, the feel of the keys, the unwieldy over-sized footprint, and flimsy keys don't add up to a very good typing experience.

And the cars....I can't tell you how many times my son would cry out in frustration and I'd have to fish out stuck cars. All in all, I can't recommend this toy. It doesn't fulfill it's purpose. It's supposed to be able to be filled with cars, hauled around and unloaded. The entire time we had this truck we never, ~ever~ played with this without a tantrum from my 3 year old because there was more \\"fixing\\" than playing going on.

Turn the trailer back over after pushing the lever on the bottom and it pops up into launch mode. Also the lever that allows the top level of cars to load is always coming down onto the bottom level of cars. Also the trailer doesnt stay attached well to the semi during play forcing you to keep hooking them back together. This would be a great toy if it worked and wasn't so poorly made instead its frustrating for both parent and child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vantagepoints Helps You to See Your Own Life in a New and Vibrant Way","review":"'Vantagepoints on Learning and Life' is a delightful, inspiring book. Kevin Eikenberry writes with a mix of folksy wisdom and humor that reveals the significance and learning opportunity in the things that usually escape our attention, and helps us to see the ordinary in a new and vibrant way. Each \`Vantage Point' is short - perfect as a small pick me up in the middle of the workday crunch, or to savor in your free hours as you reflect on your day.

Sure when sha sha hit it was unlike anything you've probably heard, and now that he has his sophmore album out, you may think, so what it sounds similar to his first album. Yes it does sound simmilar, but it is much more developed then the first and although his style hasn't changed, he has grown as an artist. Maybe the impact is different because it is his second album and the sound isn't as new, but no matter what kewller's new album is still great. A must for any kweller fan, or those interested in a quality indie sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't sing, please don't","review":"Ben Kweller cannot sing or write good music. His voice is not \\"weak\\" or even unpleasant. There is NO singing voice. William Shatner might as well be singing. That'd at least be funny. Kweller's voice is just painful. There's not a good quality to it at all. He cannot sing in tune to his own songs. He cannot change notes, because he cannot sing different notes.The music itself is very bland, nothing special. It's all been done before, and much MUCH better.Finally, you cannot take his lyrics seriously. They typically mean nothing and will make you laugh. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I heard \\"I went to the zoo, where a monkey stole my kazoo\\" in there. It's that bad. It's like he just picked words that rhyme and threw in unrelated phrases to link them anyway he could. It's just bad.

It's Charlie Hunter's one bottom line statement that he belongs.

What is does feature is dry, canned, unchanging 4/4 beats. Do not expect much else on this release. Cevin Key and company pretty much keep one idea that can be heard and learned in the first 15 seconds of a track and turn it into a 4-7 minute work. I'm not against repetition, I rather enjoy some Porter Ricks and Speedy J, who are known to release repetition based music. But Music For Grassbars simply comes up short. There are some good ideas on this CD, particularly 'Purple Passion', 'The Kind' and 'Noorderlight', but after those three there's a big dropoff in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't tell how many cans are in this offer","review":"Please add information about the number of cans that are included in this purchase.

The DVD also is very customizable. There are almost too many settings. I can be a bit confusing. But you can, using the user's manual, configure it any way you like. I found the options a little confusing at first, but useful in the end. You can program this thing to work with a surround sound or a simple two-speaker system.

In my world, half-truths are still lies. This book has a lot of pictures of people from different cultures, with different phenotypes, et cetera. It does not walk the walk or talk the talk of a socially responsible take on human development and psychology.

Although it was a wee bit off in the Egyptology department, I didn't mind.The story is more of a Hollywood type of plot, with danger lurking around every corner kind of thing. But that was one of the things that made it so fun. The sexual tension between the two characters was great, too. I can't resist those geeky-yet-seductive male leads.At times the dialogue was a little campy, and the female lead (Cassie) was definetely on the goofy side.

She dutifully takes it to the police, but she's ignored until she fires it and confesses to the crime. Taken to jail, the mousy librarian is transformed into a bombshell by some of her fellow inmates.Sandra Bullock might consider a remake of this oddball film because it's not the crime that really matters here, it's the change Betty Lou experiences as she takes control of her life.

Also, the illustrations are beautiful! Even though my granddaughter is 14 years old, probably too \\"mature\\" for this book, I will probably give it to her.

But, WOW! Please stick to writing music not a book. Some famous people do successfully write a children's book but in this case, Madonna should have seeked help and advice from a good children's book writer. As an Illustrator who love creative children's books and I hope one day to write one, I thought the Illustration in this book was fantastic! The story was pretty much unrealistic especially this day in age for pre-teens. Maybe if Madonna tries to write another children's book, perhaps she should anonymously pass the rough draft to a few writers to proof read and give a honest critique before she decides to publish a book. Sorry Madonna.- Your true fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"An old classic story","review":"The English Roses, Madonna's first book tells about friendship between young girls.

They begin to change their mind about her and make friends with her.The story about such friendship is so classic but yet the colorful illustration is enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder to Christians","review":"Although I am not a Madonna fan or a Christian, the American \\"Christians\\" who are dissing this book due to a brief stage act should stop and think. The message in the book is to do onto others as you would have them do onto you, which is a main tenet of Christianity when the politics is removed from it. The other point of it is that how you appear is rarely who you really are. The world would be a more peaceful place if people could get this through their skulls. Most of the hate is due to the conservative idea in a material world that your actions equal your true self, which is simply false, especially an act on a stage. I doubt that if a male singer like Mick Jagger wrote a kid's book after sleeping with 4000 teens girls anyone would be hollaring about his inability to send messages to children \\"Instead of being born again, why not just grow up already\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up & smell the roses","review":"To all the nay-sayers, this book is definitely something parents would be happy to read to their children. It teaches one of the most valuable lessons about life - don't judge a book by it's cover.

With that said, judge the book, not the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all ages","review":"Although I am a huge Madonna fan, I was a little worried about what this latest venture would bring. All I can say is that it is purely magical. As an elementary school teacher, The English Rose is the type of book you would want your children to read. The story is touching and true to life in describing the way young children (and adults for that matter) treat each other. The book comes together wonderfully with the artists depiction of the five characters. This is the kind of book you want to keep on your shelf no matter what age you are. I am looking forward to the next installment!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Message","review":"I was shopping for a \\"special\\" book for my then four-year-old daughter and I was intrigued because Madonna was the author. After reading this book with my daughter, I thought it was a little preachy, but my daughter kept asking for the book over and over. We both loved the illustrations and as a preschooler, she was fascinated by a \\"big girl\\" story. It's appropriate for girls of all ages. The message: Don't judge a book by its cover (even beautiful girls can be miserable) got through. I give Madonna credit for writing about rivalry and petty jealousy which affects us even after we get out of 5th grade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Style And Great Content","review":"I liked this book more that I thought I would. This is clearly a book written for girls. Anyone with daughters ( I have two ) will appreciate how the story protrays how girls can be arbitrarily cruel and cliquey.

I read it with my daughter and had tears in my eyes when it was over. She has re-read it several times since and we have lent it currently to a friend with a 7 year old girl as well. It is such an excellent lesson for girls and their opinions on people without bothering to find out who they really are. That a person isn't who you think based on face value. That just because someone is beautiful on the outside they might still be suffering on the inside and in need of a friend. Good lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing, Boring, and Insulting","review":"You know, I actually expected it to be pretty good, as I figured she had probably hired someone to \\"edit\\" it into a well-written and fun book.Nope, she wrote it all herself.

Um, how did that bit get past the PC review board?Poorly written and insulting to anyone with only one parent, anyone who is snubbed by the \\"in crowd\\" for reasons other than being beautiful and perfect, or with a sense of literary decency.I'm appauled at how many people enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The English Roses","review":"I mistakenly trusted Madonna and bought this book after only flipping through. As a mother of two daughters, I have now hid the book so it is not chosen for our reading time. I find it full of all the wrong messages..beauty as the focus attribute, jealously and envy as part of a child's everyday existence, social clique acceptance. These combined with the condescending technique of scolding the reader and assuming the reader's thoughts and comprehension make the book an insensitive, insulting and shockingly irresponsible effort from a person I previously and consistently admired as an artist and mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilted Roses","review":"If you are even considering buying this bit of tripe from Madonna, my best advice to you is don't. There is absolutely nothing about it to recommend. The text is way too long, poorly written, and not at all interesting. Even the pictures are not enough to keep a young child interested long enough to sit through it. The \\"moral\\" isn't even thinly veiled, but is like sitting through a bad sermon. The only reason I can think of that this book was ever published is because of its author. I would give it no stars if the form would let me, and two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty unrealistic","review":"I've been a big fan of Madonna's for six years. I love her music and her songs. But this story is so simple and I feel that Madonna did not put a lot of thought into it. So four British girls feel envy for a lovely young girl named Binah. And a fat fairy godmother comes to them in a dream and changes their attitudes. Give me a break! Changes in a person do not occur simply from dreams! It takes the four girls getting over themselves and choosing to meet Binah or Binah wanting to be friendly with them that brings the change. And what's with the rudeness written \\"If you say no, you are telling a big fat fib, and I'm going to tell your mother. Now stop interupting me.\\" And the line \\"You believe me, don't you? You'd better, because I'm telling you.\\" BACK OFF, MADONNA! We are not obligated to believe a thing, simply because you're a controversial figure! You either write in a respectful or in a acceptably critical manner or you can keep those rude remarks to yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna is better at singing","review":"Nice theme, bad story. Madonna is better at singing than she is at writing. The narrator of the story couldn't possibly be more patronizing -and he (she) even tries to be funny! Leave it to the characters to be the funny ones. As for the illustrations, eventhough the illustrator has tried to portray every race possible, he forgot a simple detail: not all girls are beautiful and skinny.

I have a copy that was translated into Lithuanian, which pains me to read each time my little girl asks for it. Not so much that my Lithuanian is that bad, but the story itself is so boring and comes to such a trite ending with nothing much along the way to capture my girl's attention.

I first looked at the pictures and thought WOW!; then I read the book and I was suprised. The book is not about kids having wonderful lives, it's about how life for children really is. There is a girl that has to work her tail off because her mother has passed, and how the other children judge her without knowing her past. The other children only know that she is beautiful and they are jealous because of it. Then when they have the opportunity to switch places and see how the beautiful girl really lives her life without a mother, they decide her life is not BEAUTIFUL.

It reads like a story that a parent would make up on the spot to get their child to stop throwing a fit at the grocery store. Madonna has said that she thinks there are no good children's books now, but has she ever looked around in a book shop? There are TONS of good books. Hers is not one of them. The last pages states, \\"I didn't make this up.\\" Yes she did. OF COURSE she did. It has a fairy godmother in it, and the audience is supposed to believe that it's true? Argh!

ARGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She tried...she really tried","review":"I really like the pictures in this book. I think they appeal to the modern tweens with their cool girl images and swanky colors. However, the story is very weak. Madonna takes a lesson (don't judge someone before you know them) and she tries to make a story out of it. I think it started well, but she tries to by funny and that doesn't work. She is no Lemony Snicket, my friends. Also...the fairy godmother thing? Come on...that was just...ridiculous. All in all, the story is just too cheesy for me. The last page could've been great!

Its biggest pitfalls are twofold. (1) it lacks a clear audience; it proves to be cumbersome and tripping as a \\"read aloud\\" book for the pre-reader, but is not engaging for a self-reader. (2) the dialogue, in particular, is poor; its overdone attempts at feeling familial and directly addressing the reader are stiff and out-of-place.The redeeming value of this book is the lovely illustrations. The English Roses are unique and beautifully created. The illustrations fully deserve the extra packaging as a way to market the visual appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gender Role Heavy","review":"Not all girls dress in designer clothes, play with other girls, and envy the blonde. This book may hit home for some girls, but it has definitely placed the idea of \\"what a little girl is made of\\" in a teeny tiny box, wrapped it with a sickenly pink (AND PUSHY) bow, and alienated any mom, daughter, sister, grandma, and neice who would rather play with frogs and bugs, wear baggy jeans, and avoid clicky girly behavior.It's belittling to the intellect of young girls.There's already enough trite, superficial, girl fodder in the world. (Icing on cake, illustrations done by a fashion person)Maybe we should expect more for ourselves and our future generations and stop fostering these gender norms, especially with something this potentially visually damaging. Pick more suitable illustrations and maybe you'd have something to work with. Considering who the author is, that'll never happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"Average Read.

I do have a problem with all the girls having skinny, skinny bodies. Not a good signal for teen and preteen girls. The messages Madonna sends are that you shouldn't judge someone until you know them (OKAY), all people are thin (NOT OKAY), and last but not least, if you invite a beautiful person into your group, you will be beautiful by association (NOT OKAY). The lonely girl might better have been physically bland or marred in some way but still thought beautiful by everyone who knew her. That would have been a lesson worth learning. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to Look at the Book and Not the Author","review":"The English Roses is a fine, delicate, gentle book that effortlessly tells a warmhearted story. The book does not claim to be revolutionary. The book does not claim to be mind-blowing nor complex. The book does not claim to be innovative nor preachy. However, the English Roses does claim to be a kindhearted, sympathetic children's book-which it is. The book is tastefully written with elegant, stunning illustrations. If people would actually read the story instead of looking at the author's name, they would be astonished at how well written the book truly is. If people would actually listen to the message of the book, they would not be judging Madonna for her past or her present, but rather they would appreciate that she is bringing positive ideas to our future generation of children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written trash","review":"Read this to my daughter once and had to send it back.

As a teacher, I recognize that this poorly written, rambling book has little to offer as a teaching tool. There are other books already on the market that are better written, that tell the same tale of morality. While there is some wit interjected throughout the book, it is ridiculous, unnecessary and distracting where Madonna, the narrator, \\"speaks\\" to the reader as if the reader has asked her an annoying question. I found this device to be bothersome and trite. This is not a good book for teaching lessons of morality, nor is it a good book for teaching reading skills. It is slightly enjoyable for pure reading pleasure, but certainly covers nothing that hasn't already been covered before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone (big kids and small)...","review":"Madonna's first outing as a children's author isn't great, but it's pretty darn good. The narrative voice and story are pure Madonna (albeit in her British mode) and the story is one children young and old can relate to. The illustrations are colorful and eyecatching, but a little too busy for my tastes. I much prefer the illustrations in \\"Mr. Peabody's Apples,\\" Madonna's follow-up.

I will use the term loosely as her books for children are terribly written. The only reason she is published is because the publishers knew they could make money from her. It doesn't matter if she is giving the proceeds of her book to charity. Parents should be very concerned about this and whether Madonna is the kind of role model they want their children to aspire to. She should stick to music.

A real masterpiece which is no less than what you'd expect from Madonna.

She tries much too hard on this whole British thing, channeling Mary Poppins, and is much too obvious with the lessons to be learned by the little girls. The idea that the beautiful little girl has to slave away while the snotty little girls are mean is just a little too \\"Little Princess\\" (which is a much, MUCH better book) and very anachronistic. Madonna is trying very hard to build a new classic but fails. There are great children's books out there, many with good messages, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Book For Little Girls!","review":"I was very uncertain what to expect of this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. My 8 yr. old daughter absolutely loved it. The concept of envy and jealousy can be hard to explain to children but it is an emotion that many naturally feel towards their peers and don't understand. I thought the way in which Madonna told the story was funny, touching, and easy for kids (especially girls) to relate to. The illustrations are captivating as well. I recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly inspiring!","review":"Who would have ever thought that Madonna would write a children's book? I certainly never would have imagined it. Yet, here it is. The book is truly inspiring. Madonna has written a tale of jealousy, and how, if you don't know a person, you are judging the outside, but not taking into account what is on the inside. It is a story all children should hear. The English Roses is wonderfully written, and gorgeous in it's illustrations. Pick the book up for the story. Don't judge the book based upon your assumptions of Madonna. Plus, all proceeds for the book go to children's charity, which is a wonderful thing! Despite what a person who posted their review, without having even read the book, said, Madonna isn't doing this to cash in on motherhood. She's doing it to help children, in several ways. The book is great, and I recommend it for children of all ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this book","review":"The basic idea for the story was good, just poorly told. What really bothered me was the line in the book \\"If you say no, you are telling a big, fat fib, and I am going to tell your mother.\\" Binah (the object of envy)does not have a mother and how are children whose mothers have passed away supposed to feel? It's also hard ro believe that wonderful Binah had no friends whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Illustrated than Written","review":"The illustrations caught my eye and made me pick it up, the writing and trite and cliched story made me put it back on the shelf. Madonna is a lot of things but a good writer is not one of them, at least I didn't see it in this book. I will, however, be on the lookout for more books illustrated by Jeffrey Fulvimari. He deserves more credit than the author, and yet his name doesn't appear on the cover, as I believe is traditional with children's books. If you want a story with a moral and not inspired by \\"don't hate me because I'm beautiful\\" shampoo commercials, I recommend Shel Silverstein's \\"The Giving Tree\\" which will remain a classic long after Madonna's book is a footnote in \\"Where Are They Now?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for children","review":"Take it as it is, a wonderful book for kids. Its a shame that people are giving this book low reviews because Madonna wrote it, that is simply being ridiculous and not thought provoking.

If you have kids in the house, read them this book which has a great lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for children!","review":"This book is a great addition to any child's catalogue. It is simplistic enough for children to grasp and yet touches on a familiar subject that both children and adults (both male and female) could learn something from. It's straightforward, to the point and yet provokes thoughts in a gentle way, opening the door for family bonding with further discussion of the topic after the book has been read. It is cleverly told with a bit of humor thrown in which is a nice surprise in my opinion. The illustrations are vibrant and keep your eyes wandering from page to page.And just a side note to the critical eye out there who may assume that this is just another way for Madonna to make a little money off of the little tikes... all the proceeds of the book are being donated to children's charities. A gem of a purchase that I'd recommend to anyone possibly interested!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"White, Prissy and Preachy","review":"I prefer the REAL Madonna; the one she sold to us for so many years donning another disguise. She has become one trendy dogmatic woman. Geez, reading this book leaves me wondering why she is taking the fame away from other children's book writers? People mindlessly go buy her book because of who she is, not due to the substance. The English Roses is very white/prissy and preachy. Give your hard earned cash to marginal, unknown brilliant children's book writers that will never have a chance next to Madonna. Give your kids the gift of learning what true literature really is. Spend your money on books that will teach languages and cultures that have not been explored in the United States. Search the web for plot-driven children's books with substance, such as COOL SALSA, DRUM, CHAVI, DRUM!

Madonna has nothing finacial to gain from its sales. She did a good thing and for that people who clearly have no class trash her for it. REad the book , then you will see its worth the purchase.

It is not intended for adults who are slavish to the life of Madonna, the musical star, to enjoy. It is for mothers to snuggle up with their children and begin a story about a little girl who is made fun of. A little girl who has no friends because she different.It also adds the element of super-surprise by the introduction of a Fairy God-mother...something most little girls (and probably some little boys) wish they had! The story allows the question (as many fairy tales do NOT), who asked the \\"princess\\" in the story what she wanted? Did she want to be married and live happily ever after? Did she just want friends to enrich her life? The book involves the reader by \\"talking to them\\". This technique is used by many children's authors...Kate Dicamillo uses it in The Tale of Despereux. Children love it...and as stated, The English Roses is a book written for children. It is delightful and loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost gave up -- glad I finished it!","review":"I almost gave up on this one.... the story takes place after most of the action, and quickly leans upon technology so God-like that it is unbelievable.

I can't identify when, but at some point, I found myself invested in the story, and the payoff was worth it.Sure, it's dated, in both science and political correctness, but geez, look at how old the story is!I am surprised at how much I enjoyed it after almost giving up. Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yellow Peril garbage","review":"I love Heinlein's work. Really. But this piece is an embarrassment to the bulk of his work. Not only is it yellow-peril racism, but it's just silly overall and advances none of Heinlein's philosophical beliefs. Since it is from 1941, perhaps this can be understood since Heinlein was a Navy man and the Navy was clearer on the Japanese threat than most. You have go to the the 1962 book \\"Farnham's Freehold\\" to find a worse Heinlein novel.Two stars only because Heinlein wrote it. No need for anyone, even a fan, to actually read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Me Squirm in My Seat...","review":"This was my first Heinlein novel, and I have since been warned that it was a poor introduction, so I'm giving that warning to you all as well. This was one of his earliest, and definitely not his best. Don't let that turn you off to a fine writer.All that said, a lot of things in this book made me squirm. It was published in 1949, shortly after World War II, so some of the racist elements are as understandable as they can be to someone in the new millennium. However, I still squirmed quite a bit over the secret weapon that spares only whites and such. Some anachronisms in early sci fi are quaint. That one certainly isn't...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Heinlein","review":"If you were to speculate that someone foisted a job on Heinlein, or possibly black-mailed him to write the story for a \\"ghost author,\\" then Sixth Column would be my candidate, and in fact, that is case. The story line was from John W. Campbell, Jr. Somehow, he succeeded in persuading Heinlein to try and dress it up, but - sow's ear - silk purse ... Heinlein writes that he tried to clean it up and remove the racism, but given the surviving story there can't have been much other than racism in Campbell's original draft. RAH concluded that he did not consider the result a success.If you read this story, then you should certainly also read \\"If This Goes On --\\", which is Heinlein's own version of such a story. Published in 1940, ITGO focuses on home-grown \\"invaders,\\" when an extreme sect of Christianity seizes power in the US. Heinlein's brutal enemy is ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foaming-at-the-mouth racism!","review":"Heinlein was supposed to be one of the great SF authors of all time, but this book certainly isn't an indication of it!The only thing that \\"elevates\\" this story above mindless and juvenile kill everything war adventure is the violent racism in it. If you're willing to forgive RAH his racism (having written the book ca. WWII), then there's nothing.So depending on your forgiveness level, it's either racist trash or just plain trash, and definitely not worth reading in either case."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a good example from the time it was written, but might be tough for contemporary readers","review":"This is an enjoyable book and is typically Heinlein in many of its respects. It has characters you can root for and it hopes for liberty to triumph because people are willing to struggle and fight to make it happen, even against incredible odds. It is also the product of its time, which was very different from today. The racist presentation of Asians in the book will put off many readers. At the time it was pretty standard stuff given the propaganda of WWII and the Korean War, but today it comes off as offensive. If you accept that things were different and can set that aside, it is a fun and readable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for its time.","review":"I first read this book back in the sixties, and it is representative of the \\"WWIII/Invasion\\" genre of stories that were quite common at the time in print and on the screen. This is a good one, because despite the racial overtones (perhaps a tad less acceptable now), it is close to believable. I like that in a SciFi book. All too often, the author will make some stupid mistake or leap of faith that renders the rest of the story completely unreadable for me. Heinlein almost never did that. He either had his facts straight, or went somewhere where there weren't so many facts to trip him up.This is vastly different from the \\"stranger in a strange land\\" style, but it is definitely Heinlein all the way. And I personally found it difficult to put down. I recommend it as an excellent representative of a specific mid-century style, as a representative of Heinlein's early writings, and as a good though dated read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Thanks to the God Mota!","review":"I didn't know what to expect when picking up this Heinlein book. I had heard it deemed a classic of the 1940's, but they were fifty years ago and I had slight doubts as to the relevancy of the tale, especially looking at the odd cover of the man in robes. I wondered to myself: What could this possibly have to do with the PanAsians taking over America?I shouldn't have doubted. One thing Heinlein never does is disappoint and this novel sparkles with the ideas and imagination that has become his trademark. I don't recall any other novel that has people faking a religion to get back at their conquerors and I don't think anyone has ever done it with the flair for humor, wittiness, or creativity that Heinlein was the master at.A short novel and a light read, but if you're looking for something enjoyable but not lengthy this is exactly the book you want"},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you do when you have lost the war?","review":"In this novel ( also published as \\"the day after tomorrow\\") the heros are scientists who are in a secret bass in a mountain in Colorado.The novel has been called racist because the Japanese likefuture invaders are oriental ( and called flat faces and other things)in the book. The idea of using a religion as the base for a subversion of a society is an Heinlein theme in several classic sci fi novels.Like a Campbell novel the heroes use super-science weapons to complete the plot. The name 6th column comes from Heinlein's theories of an underground organization ( 5th column in other context).The problem of what you do when a people are being oppressed by a dominant minority who controls government law, police and armed forces isn't new.One answer in modern times has been terrorism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"I thought this book really rocked it was a work of sheer creativity. Only a man of Robert Heinland's caliber could cook up a plot like this. 6th Column is a great book, but don't buy it expecting a military epic. I won't say anything else except that all the comments of this book being very racist are untrue. You simply need to look at the book from the point of view of the occupied Americans. This is a great four star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of good talent","review":"Heinlein was given this story concept by an editor, who had it from a writer who was unable to develop the idea.

It is extremely anti-Asian. Now, I'm not a PC police type who shuts down every racist note from more ignorant times, but there should be a limit, this is it. It's not as if the racism is irrelevant to the plot: it is one of the central plot elements. Gone with the Wind is also racist, but at least it's not about racism. This book is, and in a disgusting way.Second, it's mediocre Heinlein. Simplistic in the extreme, it's full of goofy plots twists and impossible human behavior. Not much suspense.

New?","review":"Prepared for a rapturous experience, I listened with baited breath for the great rhythms, fine sounds I expected this CD to deliver. Ummm. Sound quality: not so good. Rhythm: not so groovy. After reading the liner notes, I came to realize that this compilation was mostly gathered by a fellow named Gerald Seligman who found many of these recordings by scrounging in various stores in Brooklyn. I found no information on original release dates, or even copyright acknowledgment for the artists, with the exception of one admission that a particular cut came from a tape the producer lost in a move, and had discovered it \\"years ago\\". If I had to do it again, I'd make a different choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product that is lasting","review":"I've has several personal DVD players. I am not rough on them, but I do enjoy bringing them along when I road trip or travel. None of them have been as sturdy as this little gadget!Since this DVD player was made for a child, it is made to endure rough traveling. It fell off my desk (onto a carpeted floor) but CONTINUED playing the DVD without a skip or hesitation!I've had this player for two months, and it has withstood everyday use and plays DVD's without a problem. The screen may be small, but people are watching their iPod's nano-screens, and this is a IMax screen in comparison! 4.5 inches is DIAGONAL. The widescreen dimensions are lovely when watching a widescreen DVD. The picture quality is pretty good, but there could be more options for color on the player.Overall, this is an excellent DVD player and hold up well for travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money - disposable","review":"We bought this last Xmas and after 6 months it turns on, but no longer reads any CD or DVD.Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"total waste of money","review":"Used only once and now completely unusable!

Also, it will no longer recognize any DVDs. The warranty is only good for 90 days, so I have to throw it out.

Within 10 days, the headphones broke, the door on the player would not shut properly so the CD's would not play. We had to open and shut the case numerous times to get it to work.

Sadly, it lacks any semblance of credibility after that. I have read every known account of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Lincoln assasination and have presented many talks on this subject. In my opinion, Balsiger's book ranks with Louis Weichmann's as one of the worst and most unreliable volumes on the subject.Factual information is either ignored, misinterpreted, or given short shrift. The \\"conspiracy\\" to the degree one existed was between John Wilkes Booth, Lewis Paine, George Atzerodt, and David Herold (and to a lesser degree, Michael O'Laughlin, John Surratt, and Samuel Arnold). ...

Has not failed to play any of my discs. Video quality is very good. This is a great step-up from the cheap Apex DVD players that many people buy; it has many more features and higher quality but it is still priced reasonably. A complaint is the loading time, but it is bearable.One of the people who gave a bad rating said that they bought the player out of country and it didn't work; that's their fault for buying a broken player from Mexico. And another person gave a bad rating because it wouldn't play 5 DVDs at one time...so you can increase the overall rating of this unit accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays DVDs OK, but...","review":"I was initially very excited about the advertised features and price of this unit. I got this thinking to replace my old CD changer and DVD player, plus gain MP3 capability for my stereo. WRONG.It plays DVDs fine. If that's all you need perhaps consider it. But it couldn't play MP3s of any kind without frequent skipping, or play CD-Rs that my old (reeeal old, like probably 10 year old LOL) player handles fine. Even as a simple CD changer it was slow and clumsy to use and would have been unsatisfactory.

The motor that drives the carousel is very weak and even when it worked it barely moved the tray at all then finally just quit totally.I think if you are going to spend this kind of money - not much, that is - on a DVD player, you should buy a single drive type rather than a spinner. There is just not enough quality in this thing to make it work effectively, its more of a hassle than its worth.

The Panasonic technician said that the problem was impossible to fix (\\"digital card\\" and \\"servo\\" damaged) and also, that the warranty was void outside USA. Nobody at Panasonic Customer's Service was able or willing to help. This useless DVD player at least can play factory CDs but has problems reading some CD-Rs (distorted audio signal).

No two songs are similar in genre. As previous reviewers have said, this disc was unfortunately ignored. Upon doing some research, I found that one of the better songs on the disc was released on the \\"Scrubs\\" soundtrack. Maybe finally it'll get \\"NL\\" some much-deserved attention. A 5-star disc.

It stuns me how good this is, and it's a shame that Nil hasn't released more material.

One of my favorite songs is 'Vida Mas Simple,' a sweet tale of simpler days gone by...then there's 'My First Child,' 'Baro'...they are all great.

The insight, intensity, and development of characters submerses one in the tragic surroundings of the inner city of Chicago and depicts the valiant efforts of indefatigueable volunteers to lift young boys from the throes of poverty.

My only wish is that Disney didn't get its hands on the movie rights to this excellent book and produce such a substandard movie. The book, and this story, deserved better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrenching Look at Inner-City Little League","review":"This is a story that is more frightening than anything Stephen King has ever writter. It's a realistic 'The Bad News Bears' that will make any reader with an ounce of empathy feel like crying. The harrowing life that the children of the Cabrini projects must endure in their day-to-day existence is a bleak background of violence, drugs, and society gone wrong. The fact that Little League baseball can serve as a beacon for these kids is almost as amazing that a society like ours can let projects like the one depicted in this book exist.A powerful, important novel, and one that should be read by anyone interested in learning about the differences that exist in our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"VEHICLES ARE NOT INCLUDED","review":"The manufacturer's description is wrong.

The plot was predictable: of course the teenager loses the weight and ends up going to the homecoming dance with the football teem quarterback/Homecoming King; of course the goodhearted ex-husband gambler is dying of cancer and mostly reformed. The best that can be said of the writing was that it was redundant; for example, Macomber writes how the gambler's luck at the casinos influenced his moods, and then tells us in the very next sentence that he was happy when he won and depressed when he lost, as if it would have been the other way around. I didn't particularly sympathize with any of the characters or their situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Good Yarn - But Good Book","review":"A Good Yarn is the story of Lydia, the owner of a small yarn store in downtown Seattle. The book starts off where I'm assuming \\"A Shop On Bloom Street\\" finished. Although, I didn't read this book and can not say for sure. Lydia has overcome a lot of problems in her life and finds happiness and joy in working in her store with her sister.The story unfolds with Lydia starting a sock class. The students that join are all in different places in their life and are so diverse that Lydia worries the class will never become friendly. There is the young over weight high school student, a divorced librarian who has lost all of her money in a scam, and a newly divorced single mother of two who is trying to find not only her self, but also some semblance of life after marriage.A Good Yarn is an uplifting story of female triumph and power.

Granted, some of this has taken place in the middle of operating system revisions ( I now run Leopard 10.5) So....I don't quite know who to blame. Downloaded HP driver revisions today from the Apple site ( 90 MB) and still my scanner doesnt work. When I plug in the USB cable, it works fine, wirelessly ....forget about it.

It is bad enough to have a hardware fault to begin with, but guess what - printer out of warranty, no fix (unless I pay the price equivalent to another printer, that is). This, along with all of the HP hardware issues on servers we have at my place of employment, has strongly encouraged me to look to other manufacturers to provide better quality. I encourage you to do the same.I used to have a Canon printer, and it lasted 8 years(!!), so perhaps Canon spoiled me.

Cannot be used.3) The scanning feature is the worst I have seen, it seems the photos are covered with large dust particles, despite both the photo and scanning surface is clean. HP seems to belive this is a problems with the software.I note that several reviewers rate this product highly, so I suspect that the quality control is the problem and that all of these problems might not occur if you are lucky.

The fax also would get jammed, and replacing the six cartriges over and over again is very expensive especially when they don't have much ink in them in the first place. And the annoying thing is when in the middle of a print job it just stops and does it's weird very noisy adjustment (for those who own it you know what I mean) and that wastes time.

For some reason the software on the CD didn't work on my mac. The installation probably took 2 hours and now I am able to print and scan wirelessly from both computers. Because it works wirelessly I was able to store the printer in a closet to declutter my work area. The only thing I found that isn't perfect is the scanner.

Possibly the software driver slows down my PC like many say, but I can;t be sure its not other reasons (need to format drive and start a fresh). Scans are good too.

It is coupled with the worlds SMALLEST paper tray, so if by some miracle all 5 cartridges are full, and not expired, then guaranteed it'll be out of paper!!Every single time I have to use it, I contemplate taking it out to pasture and beating it to oblivion with s baseball bat, office space style. When I do, rest assured I WILL NOT BE REPLACING IT WITH ANOTHER HP!!! It's no wonder they are losing customers left and right. This level of ink sales greed has crossed the line!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"C6180 Scan Problems","review":"I had this printer for a month. All the functions except scanning worked fine. Software easy to install. All functions worked either networked or over USB.Unfortunately, scanned pictures were covered with white spots. Looked like white dust spects. Copying the picture worked fine, no white spects. Spend 5 hours with HP support with no resolution. Ultimately, I returned the printer to the seller. Otherwise, I really like the printer and it's functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea that won't work for me.","review":"I had numerous problems installing this on both of my Toshiba laptops as a wireless network printer. Never could get it to install at all as a USB printer. That's the good news. The bad news is, after finally getting the installation to go through as a network printer, it tied up 50% of my Toshiba processor. It does interface with my wireless router, and it prints, but the software screws up my computer.I uninstalled it and the processor was fine. Reinstalled it and the problem came back. I spent several hours working with HP to no avail. Back to the store with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"High printer cartridge consumption, annoying interface","review":"Well, I must admit the printer is a fast and easy to set up network printer. However, there are some very annoying factors:-- I don't know how they worked this, but I print mainly black. Nonetheless, the color cartridges are continuously depleting. I go through a new set of cartridges every month.-- When it gets low, it asks you to print 'black only', but then you have to walk to your printer (defeats the wireless purpose) to hit 'OK' to print the paper.-- I can not get the scanner to work wirelessly. It states 'out of memeory' (I have two gigs of ram, so I don't think that is the issue).Just my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad mistake","review":"I bought this printer for use in my church.....and was it ever one bad bad mistake. Every piece of paper out of it jammed. Nothing came out of it smooth/easy - was a disaster. I did return it - got a total refund and would never again buy this particular model again. I have a HP all in one 2710 I bought about 3 years ago for my own personal use and what a great machine it has been but as is wont in the commercial world, it is no longer made - but this model printer C6180 is for the birds - or better for the trash can.

Too slow, too noisy, too finicky","review":"I replaced my old Epson printer with the Photosmart because I wanted a fax machine. I have been regretting it ever since. The HP Photosmart C6180 is way too slow -- seems to take twice as long as my old printer. It is also constantly doing something it calls \\"Printer Preparation\\" which involves making a huge amount of noise. The scanner is slow and strangely complicated to use. I am mystified by the good reviews this printer has gotten. Maybe I got a lemon? It seems very user UNfriendly to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not scan or fax wirelessly...no matter what you do!","review":"There are some good qualities--I can print wirelessly and I've scanned some photos with good results. The problem is that one cannot scan wirelessly or fax wirelessly, which was one of the main reasons why I bought this printer for my home office. I recommend doing a Google search to review the countless complaints similar to the ones I've outlined here. Very disappointing...so buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it.","review":"As a piece of hardware, the printer is fairly sound. Unfortunately, this printer frustrates the heck out of me every single time I print. I hate this printer.When printing, papers shoot all over the floor and I ALWAYS have to recollate after printing jobs greater than 2 pages. The software is good as far as making the install and connection to the network very easy; however, EVERY time you print, the software leaves a new orphaned process (HPOID.EXE) running that will eventually crash your computer if you don't reboot regularly. When a colored ink cartridge is used up --in the middle of a print job, let's say--the printing stops and leaves you with the choices of inserting a new ink cartridge or cancelling and restarting the print with fewer colors. I would have preferred an option to continue printing without yellow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this printer","review":"I wish I had bought something else. Only a tiny space for paper so I am constantly refilling. Also uses A LOT of ink and interrupts constantly to tell you, low on ink, out of ink, want to order ink?, want to print in black only? Very disruptive, also noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but... ech","review":"This unit replaced my old AIO 7410, which I LOVED. This one just feels cheap.

It's incredibly slow even doing black and white copies. Often the copies have gray shadows on them.It's noisy and jumps around on the desktop. The enlargements over 125% are frequently distorted.I'd give it a 0 stars rating if that were an option.And yes, I should have returned it, but I was in the middle of a long job that required me to use it very frequently over a period of months.

It was packed in a way that allowed foam packing to get into all the openings. The box was partially bent in when I received it, and it was 2 weeks slow in arriving. I still haven't been able to clean the printheads to make all of them work. It was sold as something it isn't and I am extreme unhappy with the merchant that sold it. I would never buy from him again. He also sent the wrong cable to hook up the printer to my computer and the box he sent was full of miscellaneous cables that I didn't need. My rating is based on the condition of this particular printer and NOT on the brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's JUNK","review":"I could deal with the slow start-up, the ridiculous noise, and the costly ink cartridges that don't last long even with minimal use. But I've HAD IT! We had a power outage and now the thing doesn't work right. I get a repeated \\"Improper Shutdown\\" message. I've done a complete reset that clears the error message. But when I re-connect to our wireless network and try to print anything, it comes back again. I've done this FIVE times now. I could probably use a 20 foot USB cable, but I paid for wireless capability that is now unavailable. For all I know, it will do the same with a cable. I now own a big paperweight. Don't buy it.

I take a cartridge out and shake it only to find there is still a noise of a solution (ink) left in it BUT the software says you are out of ink, only use HP ink (very expensive) and you cannot refil because a software setting. If you don't replace the \\"empty\\" ink cartridge, then the printer will shut down on you and be rendered inoperable...The software actually tells you that in a message on your screen.

All other texts, especially Dorfle's, are hopelessly out-date and hopelessly out of touch with the signifigance of the narrowing gap between high and low art. The basic premise of the book: High art is good, low art is bad, is dull and un-nuanced.

There are worse romantic comedies you could waste your time on, but this one is nostalgic and genuinely glamourous fun. It's a great escape from all the current situation settings in similar films.Charlie Pearl (Alec Baldwin), multi-millionaire, is about to marry movie honcho Lou Horner's (Robert Loggia) daughter until his friends take him to Vegas for a bachelor party, and he falls for club singer Vickie Anderson (Kim Basinger), who also happens to be Bugsy Siegel's (Armand Assante) girlfriend.

The singing is not only offkey but delivered in a monotonic shriek, and the music is so determined not to be mainstream that it's just noise.

Children cannot comprhend (...), so what makes Madonna assume that they can understand her text? The illustration makes up for her story. Inspired by Norman Rockwell, and Edward Hopper artist Loren Long is a remarkable talent.

My 7 y/o triplets whom I homeschool have found much more worthy items to spend our time reading! We always look at the authors and their backgrounds and my children have viewed authors with a strong connection to the books they write. I have taught them that you cannot always judge a book by its cover, but that you can tell what is in a person's heart by what they say and do. Maybe Madonna is searching herself what is truly valuable in life...yet she'll still do things that SELL herself, while sheltering her own children from the smut she puports!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rumors yes, but what about...","review":"I agree that this book is well written, however, the moral doesn't take into consideration when a child should tell an adult when they think they've seen something wrong happen. It wasn't the boy's fault that the town turned to gossip instead of investigating first. The message here could cause a child to think it is wrong to tell an adult when someone touches them inappropriately or hurts them or a real thief is stealing apples. So, while the prose is excellent in the end the moral leaves too much for the child to assume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book1","review":"I have used this with groups and classrooms.

Cliche'd uninventiveness is the order of the day here - just like all these NuTrance collections going around. *ARGH*Do yourself a favour and make sure - instead - you grab The Best Of (blue ?), and The Rest Of New Order (pink ?).

I have several different docking stations for my MP3 players, but they are not very portable. Just don't expect much bass response from these tiny speakers.

Due to its price tag, I did not have much expectation when I bought it. I expected its sound quality to be on par with my cheap earbuds (which is a a pair of earbuds I bought for less than $1!). When I received it, its performance was even worse than my lowered expectation! There was sound and that was all I can say. There was no low, there was no high. Everything was muffled.

Admittedly I cannot crank it really loud at my desk, but for office use, I can hear it clearly and someone else over the cubicle wall does not hear it at all.It folds up nicely and precisely, compact enough to fit in my lunchbox.Now, the downside is that it doesn't come with an ac adapter, even though it needs one if you don't have a usb port handy. The BIGGEST annoyance though is that even though it says ipod nano, and its the right color, there's no way it was designed for it. In order to plug in your nano it has to sit upside down in a slot 4 times bigger than it needs to be...so in other words, your nano is very loose.

Requested a new one, and it arrived in the same shape as the first, but the on off switch is very loose and won't last long. The plastic is very cheap. They sound okay after removing the case screws and re-glueing it to the case, but the screws strip the plastic with a miniscule amount of torque, so I just glued the thing together instead. Don't expect them to last too long or take ANY abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, this is a must have","review":"I wasn't really expecting much from these little speakers since they were so cheap. I've been shopping for a small set to use at my desk. I can't play music loud becuase of other people around, but these are great for just that purpose.

The speakers fold open for decent stereo separation. But you may find yourself maxing out the volume, as these aren't very loud - then again, you probably wouldn't be looking at small portal speakers if you needed to fill a room with music.The sounds is very tinny and it sounds like...well, cheap speakers.

The speakers do not dock into the iPod but plug in through the headphone jack.

Avoid.A note: You WILL require MATLAB. Don't try this material without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague, poorly organized","review":"The book (5/ed) has a poor and loose structure, and even with plenty of (vague) discussion, it fails at teaching. The material is at a high level (senior or preferably above actually), but that's not my problem with this book. Rather, my concern is the lack of clarity and ability to click with the reader, especially in the first seven or eigth chapters, where fundamentals are covered.There are excellent alternatives, though, on control systems, most notably N. Nise (currently in 5th ed.) and, to some extent, K. Ogata."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to study control engineering","review":"It's a great book to learn how to handle control engineering. There are a lot worked out examples and a lot of excercises but there isn't a set of answers and that is a pitty"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Well first off the book does not do a good job of providing sufficient examples on how to do things. On top of that the solution manual you can get online through those 2 ppl that are selling it is useless. It has all the problems worked out wrong...just my luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a useful book","review":"This text provides good coverage of the material.One neat feature of this book (fourth edition) is intros at the beginning of each chapter that explain the motivation for learning the concepts presented in that chapter.Note that the subject matter is not easy, so the first time controls student should be prepared to read each section of this (and any controls text for that matter) carefully - and not just skim it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good book for beginners","review":"ok, after being with this book for 5 weeks. NOW, I have to say something about this book. I am now doing my homework and I have to read this book to do it, but in those examples, I dont' see much steps, all I see are \\"sudden jumps\\". Cmon, give me a break.. show me the steps... I do not want to spend hours on finding out what the missing steps are. If you are a beginner and dont' know much about feedback, DO NOT buy this book or you will have a hard time. Also, the way this book interprets the problems is not easy to understand either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not inflict this book on your students","review":"As an EE student taking a Systems and Controls course using this book, I have grown not only to hate the book but also abhor the teachers who adopted it at my University. The book is confusing and skips many steps in examples. I spend most of my time trying to figure out how the book gets from step A to step B. I should be spending most of my time learning from the examples - not guessing how the book gets from one step to another. There is no clear overview as to what is trying to be taught. Some concepts are explained solely through examples - and those examples are not clear (e.g. Chap 4. sect. 4.1). If you are an instructor, please don't assign this book. Go the no book route if there is no other available. I've spent too many late nights frustrated trying to figure these topics out. The Shaum's outline is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good introduction for engineering students","review":"I was required to purchase this book for a class, and I felt that the material in the text did little to prepare me for the exercises. The examples rarely reflected the exercises (for which no solutions are available), the example solutions were exceedingly brief, with little discussion of the 'why' and 'how' of each step. The lack of solutions is pained by the poor correlation between examples and exercises. I feel that more basics need to be covered before the text dives into applications for this to be a good introductory book to controls. I'm willing to agree that this book is good for those who know these basics, but it is certainly not a stand-alone resource for beginners, and an instructor must be ready to patch the gaping holes left by the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Unclear, & Boring","review":"I was required to buy this book for a mechanical engineering class.

But for those true folk fans who love to experiment, this 2 CD compilation pulls together Laskin's first two slabs of vinyl for Fogarty's Cove -Unmasked and Lila's Jig. While it's packed with gritty - and sly dark-humoured -hippie cottage singalongs that roam between traditional themes of the sea and the luckless and prickly observations of modern life, Unabashedly Folk is exactly that - 26 tracks of Laskin's blatant, unapologetic, in-your-face folk style which even at it's best remains an acquired taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grace not loveless","review":"I am a direct relation to Grace Loveless Doze and I wasoffended by the book, as was many members of our familyincluding her son, Clifford who is now 80 years old.This book portrays Grace out to be a fluzy and she was not.Just an unhappily married woman.This book has brought disgrace to our family and a lot ofheartache to Grace's son.Grace was a lovely person and well liked by the Doze family.Her mother, husband, son and relatives loved her and werehorrified by her murder which is still unsolved today.Our family feels Dr. Goldberg is profitting money off of ourfamily's tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective tape","review":"This movie is defective and skips.

Contrary to popular belief, cities actually fostered the growth of farming and hold a symbiotic and close relationship with the countryside and trade routes: John Reader's Cities provides a map of changes and the social, political and economic connections between cities and country around the world. The lively format the author John Reader created for Cities makes for an exceptional historical coverage which lends particularly well to leisure reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this song","review":"this song means so much to me. the first time i heard itwas wheni met my boyfriend who is the guy of my dreams. and it may sound kinda weird but i think it was because of the song that we are so close. well thats all i wish to say.

This is the most soulful performance captured on tape. It's too bad it took 25 years for Blue Note to release it.You'll be blown away by the Doctor's funky bass playing on James Brown's \\"I Can't Stand It\\", the percolating rhythm of \\"Scream\\", and the intensity of \\"Love Bowl\\". What Lonnie's performances lack in technical brilliance are more than compensated by his great soul, taste, and restraint. Fans of Lou Donaldson, Charles Earland, Jimmy Smith, and Eddie Harris should enjoy this album.Highly recommended![DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the other reviews","review":"I bought this clock because I sorted on best avg customer review. I don't know why the high reviews - the shortcomings of the clock are in the reviews. Setting via the atomic clock did not work at all (one of the other reviews noted the same but said its ok because they set the clock 5 minutes ahead). As another reviewer noted - the clock drifted - yup. Another wrote the alarm was not loud. I think that summed up my experience; the clock does not set, its not accurate, and the alarm is not good. I bought it to be a self setting accurate alarm clock that would wake me up. I will add a new comment, the clock looks like it is straight out of the Jetsons, and its big, that might be attractive to you, but to me it was scary. I am glad Amazon has a great return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work at ALL and isn't as shown!","review":"First, the clock doesn't have the nice black face with lit up digits, it has a BIG blue screen blasting right in your face, with black digits. Second, mine didn't work at all, completely DOA! It shows all the digits, turns to garble then goes completely blank. Its then my responsibility to not only send the POS to the manufacturer, but I have to include a check for return postage! Cheap construction. Can't tell what the crescendo alarm is, as it doesn't work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Clock","review":"When first plugging in the clock, its suposed to auto-set to your time zone. Mine didnt do that. But I didn't mind because I set my clock 5 minutes fast anyway. The indoor and outdoor temperature readings are great. I also like how the outside sensor is a wire attached to a screen you can hang on the wall. So you can see the temperature whether you're looking at the clock, or at the unit hanging on the wall. I LOVE the auto-dimming feature. One reason I switched clocks is because my other one was too bright. The brightness is perfect.One thing to be aware of is that the lower you are looking at the clock, the harder it is to see. My bed is pretty low and my nightstand is a tiny bit higher than my bed. Any lower and I dont know if I would be able to read the numbers while laying down. Just something to be aware of.Overall, a great clock. Recommended buy. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Single from the SD-Era","review":"This is an auditory summary of Pumpkins Siamese-Dream Era Rock/Dream Pop/Indie/Grunge. The three songs are to DIE FOR. No really. You could go spend $14.99 for Pisces Iscariot for the latter two songs, but um if you're running low on cash, or you just aren't harcore enought to sit through that other b-side album, this is for you! Today is a classic mainstream rock song, but yet is still has its induviduality, and does not fade into the category of overproduced-record corp-rock. Hello Kitty Kat is almost punk, seriously! Its got the happy hardcore music with some mildly disturbing lyrics, great song. The last track just rules, a tad mellower though.This is another pumpkin single filled with groovy photos and artwork!

Such a move makes no sense for kids, unless the intent is to get the parents to mistakenly purchase the DVD twice. There is no indication, even in the mouse print on the back, that this DVD contains the identical material the old DVD contained. It is even the same DVD in the box.

It also skips something terrible if held vertically, or bumped hard enough.I had another Panasonic with a 40-second skip protection, and that lasted me four years before it finally gave out.

So its not useful when listening to audio books and other spoken word training like learning a language, etc.Every MP3 player I've used had a least a limited ability to scan in the middle of MP3 tracks. What if you have a 30 minute MP3? With this player, if you stop it in the middle of the track, or eject the CD, you have to go all the way to the beginning. So it is very very lame.Sony also handles MP3s badly in that it scans through tracks very very slowly (tested in the Sony car consoles). But at least Sony can scan through tracks. Kenwood is best I've found so far, but have it only in my car.

The disappointing thing to me was the detail of how disjointed law enforcement is in the western world, nobody wants to work with any other countries? The book is ok and you can probably guess what happens in the end. If you are interested in this type of story, Killing Pablo by Mark Bowden is far better and more up to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Slang Dictionary","review":"Saw \\"Oxford\\" and thought I was getting the real deal.This is not a good reference book.

It eventually wore out and I was excited to see it available. Unfortunately this one does not work so well. The one lane is smooth and the car runs great, but the other lane bubbles and the car falls off halfway down the track. THis frustrates my children to no end. Am waiting to hear back from the seller to resolve issue, but so far they have not responded to my email."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke almost immediatly","review":"It is very hard to roll up the track, and not at all kid friendly. When my son rolled up the track the first time it got all bent up and would not go back correctly. After about 10 minutes of me fighting with it I got it in but I am scared to let him play with it again. If it was up to me and not my 6 year old it would already be in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy track makes ths more trouble than it's worth!","review":"My son loved the launching feature, and we liked the portability and easy clean up, but the track is so flimy that it was misshapen after 3 or 4 uses and kept flipping over unless weighted down (which makes one side useless!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun toy!","review":"My 3 year old son received this for his birthday this weekend. He hasn't stopped playing with it since we opened it up. I agree with the previous reviewer that the track feels kind of flimsy, but so far my boys have twisted the track a few times and it doesn't seem any worse for the wear. My 3 year old has no problem reseting the springs by himself. Rolling up the track when he is finished has been \\"mom's job\\" though. I think my favotite thing about this toy is that 2 cars race side by side, so both my boys can play together and so far NO ARGUMENTS!!! A toy they can actually share! Man, I'd pay double just for that added perk! Another awesome feature is that the track rolls, up and the toy becomes incredibly compact with storage for 2 cars. Overall, a great toy for your little car fanatic and a good deal for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable fun","review":"We bought this for our almost 3 year-old son and he loves it. He's a big car fan, and since this item is so compact he can take it and his case of cars to grandma's house. The track is fairly cheap, but it has withstood a 3 year-old so we can't complain. The \\"set\\" is designed to work like a tape measure, able to be rolled up when not in use, the track lies flat, and the unit has storage for 2 cars (not included). There are 2 spring activated tabs that propell the cars, and these are too difficult for our son to reset himself (our 4 year-old daughter can do it with a bit of effort)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advance Squash","review":"Dissapointed but okay Expected a better Advance Squash DVD I thought there would be more information on training this game much advanced grills etc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't worth it, even for Butterfly fans","review":"The first five tracks are decent versions, but if you are interested it for a version of \\"In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" that's two minutes longer, forget it. First off, it's a shade too fast. Then somewhere along the way, bassist Lee Dorman and guitarist Erik Brann get bored with the signature ostinato that made the song great in the first place. And if they'd based this album on a wider range of performances, or hadn't begrudged us an extra song, they could have ended with the \\"Iron Butterfly Theme\\". I saw them during the tour supporting the \\"Ball\\" release and they ended the show with that one by Brann putting his axe in the stand with the last note still sustaining as he walked offstage until the local DJ who acted as emcee came out and shut it off before msking his last announcement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Rockin' 60's","review":"If you are an Iron Butterfly fan, you have to hear this disc. This is the only live album ever released by this superb 60's band. All of the material is from their first 3 albums and truley rocks! Features another long version of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, complete with drum solo. This is a much better version than the studio album. Very improvised, and very live. Probably recorded during the Ball album tour although no dates are mentioned. Serious Butterfly fans will love it. Very good sound quality and crowd responses. Great price too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this version","review":"I bought this album specifically to get the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida mp3 long version. Unfortunately the live version is NOT nearly as good as the original on the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida album (vinyl). The quality of the sound is poor, the audience noise is distracting, and the variations the band used here were not an improvement. I have just ordered the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida album (remastered CD) in hopes the sound will be better and it will be the song I actually remember. (I played this for hours and hours for months on end when it came out and I was absolutely sober every time. If I still had a decent turntable, I would look for a good used original record.) So it has now cost me twice as much as just buying the CD in the first place. Once the CD arrives and I get a chance to listen to it, I will try to remember to update this review and tell you if that is a better option. My advice is to skip the \\"Live\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Butterfly - Live SHM CD","review":"A great deal of negative comments regarding the quality of previous CD releases can be found throughout the Internet, however, after making a few purchases of this album in recent years and also dissatisfied with the results, I took one final chance and purchased this Japanese import. I'm glad I did. We finally have a very well balanced sound between the 4 main instruments (guitar, bass, drums & keyboards). There's a fullness & richness to the music that has never existed before. Even Lee's Bass lines are more prominent than ever before. A welcomed addition to my collection. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kenton's worst","review":"I'm a Kenton fan of many decades, and it steams me to see reviewers touting The City of Glass. It isn't jazz, it isn't classical music; indeed, it's barely music at all. Graettinger was, well, eccentric, and somehow Stan took him (and himself) seriously. The result is nonsense, as the musicians who had to play it admitted. From the 1940s through the 1970s, Stan Kenton wrote and played a lot of excellent jazz. It is silly to contend that the Graettinger opus or the Tex Ritter album were significant parts of that history. In fact, they were the least of all that Stan and his great bands did."},{"rating":"1","title":"City Of Glass","review":"Owww. Everytime I listen to that music, my brain gets short-circuited. I don't know what Graettinger was thinking, but boy, was he in outer space.I used to try and play this for guests at my place, but they usually got this pained expression on their faces and then asked me to change it to something else, or just shut off the stereo.I'm sure Stan Kenton was very proud of this album, but I really didn't understand it. Graettinger may have a been a musical genious and ahead of his time, but it wasn't meant for any time period during this century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky but great music from a warped mind","review":"I'm not sure what when on in Bob Greattinger's head when he wrote this music, but it is very haunting. Some of this stuff could be used in soundtrack of a Sci-Fi movie.I can see how some of the musicians who played on these tracks said that their teeth hurt, after playing through this masterpiece. Talk about dissonance.I used to put this album on on Halloween, when people came over to my place. They always freaked-out when listening to the City Of Glass movements. It got so bad that some of my friends told me to shut off the music, because it was so weird. I loved it, and still do to this day. Bob Graettinger was a freaky genius; in his own spaced-out way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and pretentious; turgid","review":"Notwithstanding the opinion of at least one major jazz \\"critic\\" who has the audacity to list this as the only thing Kenton did that he deems essential, it isn't worth the time or the money. Just as Igor Stravinsky's Ebony Concerto, written for the Woody Herman Herd, was a dud, so this is. If one is interested in exploring ways that Kenton was able to advance the ideas embodied in modern jazz without losing the essential structure of the blues, one would be better off purchasing Kenton Showcase: The Music of Bill Russo and Bill Holman. The Innovations Orchestra would also be a better choice, in this reviewer's opinion. For anyone who has felt the depth of emotion and power embodied in Kenton's jazz library, this isn't even in the same category. Unless you just enjoy being bored to tears by a semi-classical precursor to what became known as Third Stream, avoid this and buy something that you can actually listen to rather than just keep on the shelf to be admired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Levi's Life","review":"Those who are devoted to the life and works of Peter Levi will enjoy this book.

I had to crank my cars volume to max to even hearthe music, and also allowed the speakers to hiss. The Way This kit is set up is that the cd player has less Milliwatts powering it, less headphone jack Milliwatt output and to top it off a tape adapter with the head distanced from full contact with the car decks head.

Listen to the lyrics. again. and again. it really grows on you. DMB is recording a new album in January that will probably include Lillywhite Sessions stuff. Everyone calm down. No one has sold out.

Anyone who is looking for a Dave Matthews Band should not buy this album, it may have the name of the band on the cover, but there is something else inside. With the addition of electric guitar and the removal of long melodious jams, this album is more Dave Matthews with backup instrumentals than the actual Dave Matthews Band. The only song that sounds like a Dave Matthews Band song is \\"Everyday\\" this is because it sounds exactly like one of their past songs, \\"#36.\\" Anyone interested in this band should do themselves a favor and buy one of their early albums, like \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\" or \\"Live at Red Rocks.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw it away","review":"I've been a fan of the Band since '95, and I honestly tried listening to this album, but it just sucks too much.

When I heard that Dave Matthews Band had switched from Lillywhite as their producer to Ballard, well I was shocked and very afraid. And as it turns out, my fear was justified.... I always liked Dave Matthews Band for not conforming to the standard rock and roll mold, but this cd makes them just another band. I heard the music off this album and almost [became sick] all over my computer...I immediately saught some relief from their original recordings with Lillywhite that never were released. I did buy this cd, but I think Dave Matthews Band owes [$$$]to everyone who bought this cd...I hold high hopes for this new Busted Stuff release, too bad that they only have two new songs on it...I'm glad they decided they really do need the Lillywhite stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Dave Matthews cd ever nothing like old stuff.","review":"This cd is nothing like the others.

However, after sinking into the music it is clear that the creative abilities of the band are alive and well. This studio release does not possess the standard acoustic guitar, sax, violin, base, and drum sound accustomed in their preceding albums. But, neither did Live at Luther College. DMB is making some personal musical breakthroughs with this latest effort, listening to the lyrics, chords, and instruments it is clear that the best is yet to come. Buy this album, imagine what it will sound like live with an acoustic guitar and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Matthews Band or Glenn Ballard Band?","review":"This album was a true disapointment for me. Dave's new producer has completely taken over on this album from co-writing the songs (as if Dave wasn't good enough on is own) to arrangements. Everyday don't even compare to DMB's previous efforts. And another thing, what happened to Leroi and Boyd? Are they just guest musicians now? You would think so when listening to this album. If you're a die-hard DMB fan buy it just for the collection.

Simply put, I don't believe that's the case with Everyday. Instead, it grows on you. I'll find a song from Everyday bouncing around in my head while I working. To me that's the mark of an album that has made an impact.

I'm not sure I can do that with Everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I never really got into these guys until this CD and after hearing this one, I had to go buy a previous album!

Every song on this CD brings you to new places. At first listen the CD sounds good, each time after it weaves it's way into your heart through your ears. Between Dave's voice, Stefan's exciting bass, Leroi's smooth sax, Boyd's wild strings, and Carter's perfect timing you are entertained, uplifted and taken on a journey that only these five men can lead you.

Its just not that good, and it came from a band that has proved they are capable of creating the best. Maybe it's just a matter of opinion, but the lyrics really ..., and the music is nowhere near what they have recorded. Maybe its a bold new step, or maybe they were sick of always playing the same sound, but to try and change what you are, just doesn't work. \\"I want to rock you like a baby in a carraige car\\" ?

I mean, \\"I Did It\\" is at least a *fun* song. But when I listened to the cd instead of just \\"I Did It\\" on the radio, I was *very* disappointed. The most fun you get out of the cd is seeing how many rhymes you count that don't have ANYTHING to do with the song, but are just rhymes. It was sickening. Put down the electric guitar, Dave, it's just not your thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the band GO?","review":"I have listned to the Dave Matthews band Since there first Independant release Remember Two Things. In this album I can not find the band that played on those first albums. The only thing resembling the band is the beginning od when the world ends and everyday, but have no fear the band manages to screw those up not more than 15 seconds in. I did it, is a joke, the music coupled with the video now in heavy rotation on MTV sadly enough makes the band ,perhaps on of the most talented in the 90's, look no better than the backstreet boys. What's next pyrotechnics, and dancers on stage at concerts. I will simply file this album under the horrible mistake category, and hope there next realease will be better. If this is the first Dave album you bought, They were good at one point, don't let this top 40 sell out material get you down there will be another album."},{"rating":"1","title":"DMB or Aerosmith?","review":"One collosal blunder!

Don't get me wrong, the album doesn't suck, but the fans deserve more than this, and I hope we get it with the next album. Things have been declining lately. I respect the fact that they have been trying to evolve, but effort doesn't count; I want results. I give it 1 star simply because I expect 5 from the band, and they didn't get there with this one.

I can't wait until the next cd comes out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Streamlined, bland.","review":"This album was produced by Glen Ballard - it shows. Usual DMB albums have songs that run to extremes - loud, soft, instrumentally focused, voice focused - and carry emotions and detailed sounds that run to extremes. This album feels like someone took it, and streamlined all the songs so that they are all 3-minute pop songs. Each one strives to be that - and they all end up sounding the same. Gone are the variations in tone, emotion, and strong instrumentation. Instead, all the instruments sorta just blend together into a big mush. Yeah, I guess this is what makes a pop hit - but this isn't what made people like DMB. I liked them because they were different - something that doesn't sound like every other pop hit on the radio. What was also best about DMB was that some of the best songs were the ones never played on the radio. Now that they all sound the same, some of that magic is gone. If you want this disc, I'd wait and get it used in a couple weeks or months."},{"rating":"2","title":"All guitar... little sax,violin","review":"I am a huge DMB fan.This cd appears to have been created to capture a top40 audience.

The mesh with Santana-WHY? Why do I have to struggle to find any sax or violin? The sax,violin and accoustic guitar is the cornerstone of DMB.

This is boring, uninspired, rehash, resting on laurels album.There are a couple of good tunes in there, but nothing to buy this album for. If you are in question, pass this one up.

I hope they can do better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"ditto - I'm disappointed but Dave doesn't care.","review":"I hate to say anything bad about DMB, as I've been a huge fan, but I am disappointed in the new sound too. I couldn't even hear the other band members....certainly not any solos. The collaboration with Glen Ballard doesn't work for me, and I am a big Alanis fan too. I hope this is just a one-time experiment and that Dave will get back to the sound that we all love so much! This reminds me of an album that Pat Metheny did without his band, ....a studio produced sound with synthesizers and backround orchestrations. Some nice songs and melodies, but not the unique sound we had come to expect. It's the same thing here. Let's hope it won't last.

Now, I have nothing against the \\"loud, blaring electic sound\\" theme that seems to be in a lot of bands these days. I listen to a few of them myself. But dear lord, this is Dave Matthews Band. The guys I claimed as my gods the first time I listened to Crush a couple of years back. What happened to the earnest, deep sound that sucks people in more and more as they listen?

Say what you will about old DMB- it was original <reminisces fondly of Minarets>One serious point, over the summer tour Dave referenced songs like JTR, Grey Street, and the like as to be \\"on the new album coming out this fall.\\" Were those songs scrapped with Mr. Lillywhite?

There are a couple of brilliant moments (mother father, If I had it all), but there is none of the passion, the incredible soulful lyrics that Dave is known and loved for.That combined with the great songs we know are out there (JTR, Grey Street, etc) is killing me. I thank god for the boot I have from last year and I look forward to the summer tour to hear how they will attempt to salvage this, but I am sorely disappointed. This one will likely get a few more plays on my CD player, then off to collect some dust.Also, for all those who hate the Crash girls, I suspect we'll be talking the same game with the \\"space\\" girls this tour and every tour going forward.Argh."},{"rating":"1","title":"DMB or Aerosmith?","review":"One colossal blunder!

It sounds more like Third Eye Blind or Matchbox 20 or Creed than anything that Dave has ever done. A complete 180 degree turn from everything that made Dave unique, original, and worth checking out in the first place. I offer this up to all the frat boys who don't care as long as its Dave.

This isn't just a bad Dave Mathews CD, it is a bad CD.I just can't figure out half of these reviews being positive.DMB music is awesome. Buy the Tim Reynolds & Dave Mathews live album if you want something to play over and over and over... Buy this one if you need another slot in your CD case filled with waste.DAVE PUT DOWN THE ELECTRIC GUITAR.

But, sometimes things grow on you and you learn to appreciate qualities that you didn't pick up on initially. That has not happened here, in fact, I may actually dislike it even more now. Bottom line is that the disc feels like it was pulled together in a week with drab and uninspiring songwriting. I've always felt that DMB's first three major label records were excellent, but this one is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not UP to par","review":"People listen to the dave matthews band for touching lyrics and a sound that is like no other, this is achieved by the contrasting insturments and the way they blend together to form a piece of music that tops everything. Everyday is trash, it feels like it was hastily produced and if i was boyd tinsley i would feel neglected just like his nonexistant violin. Dave's lyrics just arent there to grab the listener and keep them happy. Listen to Everyday, then throw on Crash and see how shitty this CD really is. Everyday attempts to cash in on crappy melodies that have no real business being in a dave matthews album. I am an old fan and this album just doesnt make the grade for me, it reminds me of Phish's farmhouse, in their attempt to go mainstream. Its sad to see a group who rocks get away from what they do best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written In A Week","review":"This CD sounds as if it were written in a week, and I think it actually was. Lacks all the passion and soul of all earlier music. Saxaphone and Violin are nearly obsolete. I am a big DMB fan, but I would not reccomend this album to anybody looking to buy their first DMB CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everday","review":"I hear many Dave Matthews Band fans remarking on how original it is to have horns, violin and other instruments taking center stage at a rock concert. Like Dave Matthews invented this format or something. Ever hear of Van Morrison? It's been done. And there is not much originality to Matthews voice either, he sound like a odd mix of Sting and Peter Gabriel. I think that this band is getting so much acclaim because there are so few good bands out there. We are inundated with Britney Spears and the like. DMB have some good songs, but their albums are not great and Everyday is probably the worst. If you prefer the real thing don't waste your time with these imitators."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW... what a let down","review":"Ok.. where do I start.. This could quite possibly be the worst production I have ever seen. The band has turned into a teeny boppin concert, and their music shows it. If you know dave, you know that his past cd's have been good, sometimes amazing, however this cd is the epitomy of horrible. I honestly believe this could mark the end of Dave, and maybe a new beginning with N'SYNC."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 0 Stars?","review":"This is CR@P! I returned it promptly!

Basically, this cd really sucks. i just started liking dmb during last summer. I bought this cd and at first it was ok. but then i listened to all the other cds and learned how wonderful they really are, and when i played this cd i realized it isn't the same at all. dmb is the best music ever, so if you like music go buy another cd, but if you like the whole pop music stuff, then you should look into this. Dave is amazing, and even in everyday although, you can barely tell it is dave. If you liked this all i have to say is go listen to the other stuff because it is the most wonderful stuff ever. Also go find a big dmb fan and get them to give you the lillywhite sessions, because that is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just...no","review":"Being a long time DMB fan, I feel a bit as if I'm betraying the band. But honestly...this CD is, hands down the worst one yet. Lillywhite Sessions is WAY better, they should've released that one. I absolutely refuse to listen to \\"I Did It\\". I hate that song with a burning passion. The only acceptable songs on the CD are \\"The Space Between\\" and \\"Angel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior to the Lillywhites any and EVERYDAY...","review":"Saw Dave last night, in fact. He played 9 of the songs from this album. Interestingly, he used old chestnuts and Lillywhite session songs strategically, to try and minimize the weakness of this material. I applaud his attempt to find a new direction; I hope that he keeps trying. All but 2 or 3 of these songs should be (permanently) shelved, as quickly as possible. Find yourself a copy of the Lillywhite sessions, listen to it, and then start the fascinating process of trying to understand how an artist can abandon such beautiful, personal work (in favor of this strange concoction)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M SO DISAPOINTED","review":"FOR ME BEING AN VERY DIVERSE MUSIC FAN[AND LONG TIME DMB FAN],I was very disapointed with EVERYDAY.Where's the rawness andjazzy vibe of BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS?

This cd had the hype to be the biggest and best cd you have had, but instead it turned out to be a flop, in my mind atleast. But with failure, comes an unusual form of success. I have grown fond of the song \\"the space between\\" since you performed it on Saturday Night Live. It is an amazing mix of all the instruments you use, and is kind of a flashback to your more glorious songs, such as ants marching, and crush.I'm sorry i had to write what i did, and rate it what i did, because i am a huge fan of yours, its just that i didnt quite accept the change from one style of music to the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it anyway","review":"OK, all you DMB fans watch out, sharp turn left straigt ahead. DMB broke the mold with this one, and while progressiveness is good, I'm not sure if this is a sign of development, or just change for change's sake. For those who remember the good ole \\"under the table and dreaming\\" days, you'll like \\"Father Mother\\" and \\"Dreams of our Father.\\" They feature Dave's warble and DMB's electic rhythms in full effect. For those ready to move on past ants marching, \\"I Did It\\" is a real rocker. All the rest of the tracks will take a couple spins to get used to. They are mellower and the lyrics are a little more cryptic. But, in the end, I would say get used to it. The tracks grow on you, and have a nice groove to them. Besides, DMB has a real tendency to be the trendsetters, not followers, so they might set the pace for what we will be hearing from other artists in the not so distant future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disapointing.","review":"When I first got it, I was excited about what it might contain, because I loved \\"I Did It\\" and \\"The Space Between\\". Unfortunately, those are the ONLY good songs on the CD. I guess I'm not supposed to say this, because I live in DMB's hometown of Charlottesville, VA. After listening to the first few tracks, I have only picked this album up a couple times, and that was to listen to \\"I Did It\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An atypical effort, but worth it","review":"Granted this is not a \\"typical\\" DMB album, but I give them credit for trying something new. In a time when most bands churn out the same music album to album DMB did something new by giving a violin and sax a lead role in its music. Now on \\"EVERYDAY\\" they try some thing different and I applaud them for it. This is by no means their best album, but it is still a quality work.For those people who want a band to keep playing the same type of tunes over and over go listen to Creed, Third Eye Blind, and just about everyone else on the radio. As for DMB and \\"EVERYDAY\\" I enjoy it and think it is a nice change of pace for the band. \\"EVERYDAY\\" has the traditional songs like \\"The Space Between\\", \\"Angel\\" and \\"Everyday\\". It also tries new material like \\"When the World Ends\\" and \\"Fool to Think\\". I really like this album and think a refreshing mix of music, which is the essence of DMB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This album is like musical wallpaper with words.

Brought it back to Europe and played it over and over again. Later I bought Crash and Under the Table and Dreaming, so good you play it over and over again. Heard I Did It on national radio (first time I've ever heard DMB on the radio in Denmark)and the impression was that Everyday is more mainstream than previous albums and the texts aren't as deep and thoughtful as previously. He doesn't play with the words the way he used to, maybe because he doesn't write them himself. Everyday is in my opinion not nearly as timeless as previously released albums, but still way better than most other albums out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Messy Emotional roller-coaster","review":"Bad or mixed reviews be damned. I have never been a huge fan of this band but this album - along with its predecessor 'Before These Crowded Streets' has made me a convert. There is true beauty to be had in several of these songs, most notably in \\"The Space Between\\". Dave's voice is an all-over-the-place growl that plaintively manages to attain real, raw emotion that leaves this listener anyway seriously moved.Other tracks of note include \\"I Did It\\", \\"Dreams of Our Fathers\\", \\"Where You Are\\", and \\"Mother Father\\".An album to be listened to again and again. (It gets better in repetition.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I listen to it Everyday","review":"Upon first placing the cd into my stero i was very exicted. after listening to it once i thought to myself, not so great. not until listening to all the tracks did i realive it's true potental. Now i listen o it all the time. It is by far DMB's most diverse album yet. All different songs are here. ballades to rock(and So right reminds me of Say goodbye). i could not give this 5 stars because there are better albums of his and if you had to choose between this or a live album, i would go for the live one. this does by no means make it a bad cd. it has to be gotten use to for anyone to enjoy it, i.e. i never really liked What you are, but now its one of my favs. this IS worth your money even if you only listen to it for a while. the different beats can satisfy anyone, for the die hard fan to a newbie. i strongly recomend this album to anyone who likes a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"First of all, I think Before These Crowded Streets was DMB's best album. I liked the new sound and complex direction they were taking. So, I eagerly anticipated Everyday. Then, I listened to it. What a disappointment. Dave's songwriting is mediocre at best and the lyrics are trite (even more so than usual). All of the choruses are very dark, but rarely differ from one another. The album is simply overproduced. Lillywhite is one of the best producers out there and his sessions should have been released. DMB stands to lose a lot of its following if it continues in this direction. They are starting to sound like Chicago (not that I'm knocking them, but DMB shouldn't take that course). The only bright light of hope on the album was that Boyd Tinsley was not featured very much, which is a great move on Ballard's part seeing as how Boyd Tinsley is just about the poorest violin player in popular music today."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like Dave Thomas.....","review":"this is really bad stuff. its a good thing Mr. Matthews made an apology for this album (ask any member of the warehouse). there are plenty of DMB cds, get the others. this is aweful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave needs to rethink his approach to music","review":"I understand Dave Matthews was attempting to try something new with this album, and I respect that. He had a pair of balls on him for going in this direction, but it didn't work. Millions of DMB fans are throwing their hands up in rage at the pop-oriented sound Dave has tried to swing on this new CD.It was an experiment.. it didn't work.. and the new DMB album will be fantastic, as his old stuff always was. Nothing to worry about."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressive....","review":"...work from a band of DMB's caliber. I guess i expected more.Didn't like Glen Ballard's production style, kinda miss the old DMB jam sessions with Steve Lillywhite behind the scenes...Could not hear the SAX or the Violin at all during the album...i am afraid will have to sell this one......"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to DMB?","review":"Overproduced is putting it lightly. Gone is the grassroots, guitar-based music that the DMB has always done best, replaced by some Alanis Morrisette-sounding emo-pop (no surprise, given the new producer). After the adventuresome 'Before These Crowded Streets', I expected even further explorations in musicianship from the group. Instead, it appears that Glen Ballard inspired DMB to produce an album almost completely without substance. The group doesn't even have a keyboard player, yet from listening to 'Everyday', one would think that the band is centered around a synthesizer. Down with Ballard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why do I beg like a child for your candy?","review":"If you think you are going to hear more of Dave's insightful lyrics backed by the bands complex music. You will be disappointed. This cd is loaded with very simple lyrics backed by very basic music and if it was done by anyone other than DMB it would be an incredible cd. However, we expect someting diffrent from this band and not everyone adjust well to change. I have old enjoyed by Dave's great lyrics and this cd doe not have them. But, I admit I have listen to this cd about 20 times since last week and it gets better everytime. Highlights include Space Between, What you are and Mother, Father. These songs should be incredible in concert. So pick it up and get ready for the tour!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave shows off an edgier side","review":"\\"Everyday\\" is not the best of Matthews' discs one can purchase (in my opinion, \\"Crash\\" will forever remain his best effort), but it's not one to ignore either. Certainly, Dave's new sound is a bit... odd, compared to his earlier recordings. The pop-ish jam that preceded this CD has become the band's trademark, and that may be why they felt the need to move in a more edgier direction. Either way, the band carries itself beautifully across the genre, stretching the bounds of rock music. Don't write off \\"Everyday\\", with songs like \\"Space Between\\", \\"If I Had It All\\", and \\"What You Are\\". Dave and his crew remain my favorite band of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Did It","review":"Yes DMB has done it again with yet another smash album, this one entitled Everyday. As an owner of EVERY DMB cd available, I appreciate the variety of this CD most. From the great guitar riffs of I Did It, to the slow paced Sleep To Dream Her, the quality of DMB's music hasn't changed at all. If you read the article about Dave Matthews in Rolling Stone (in stores now) you will find that this CD has \\"his best lyrics yet\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"New and Gripping","review":"\\"Everyday\\" is not normal DMB, but it's new and refreshing. Overall I think it is the band's most powerful work, but it does not contain their best songs. The entire album is overflowing with emotion and the songs (while they take a couple listens to get used to) make you feel them. If your a DMB fan go get this album, it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Soulless attempt at trying to create a radio-friendly album. Dave has proved his best songwriting days are behind him. Not one song on this album even remotely compares to the band's ten best. No creativity at all. Completely dull. A tremendous disappointment.

The first song and single off \\"Everyday\\" is an upbeat foot-tapper with excellent vocal harmonies and bass. \\"Space Between\\" is a slower paced, probable crowd favorite. For all you latin music fans, \\"Mother Father\\" stars Carlos Santana on guitar. \\"So Right\\" and title track \\"Everyday\\", quite possibly the best songs on \\"Everyday\\", sound like DMB to the core. To sum up \\"Everyday\\", it's very good, catchy, and begs for touring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Dave?","review":"Very disappointing. Starts out spunky, but fades quickly into mediocrity. Perhaps new fans may enjoy it, but those of us familiar with everything before Crash should probably avoid this. Also, I was VERY disappointed that Grey Street didn't make the cut. Shame on you Dave!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy blows","review":"Nothing could be more indicative of a civilization's decline than the popularity of this guy. All I can say is...this guy's music is totally mundane...mawkish, maudlin, and mediocre. I don't care about the virtuosity of his backing band, the total product is vacuous. Matthews is a total bore...his vocal stylings are hideous chirpings, and i can't stand the corny, superfluous usage of the splash cymbals by his drummer. In summation...all i can say is that this music is even more vomitous than Sting...or Counting Crows or any of that other lameosity out there that pretends to be music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best was Left with Lillywhite","review":"To anyone who claims \\"Everyday\\" to be a good showing of Dave's talent...well then you're right. To anyone who claims \\"Everyday\\" to be a good showing of The Dave Matthew's Band...well you couldn't be more lost. Dave should of saved Carter and Tinsley's time and just hired some studio musicians for this lack luster performance. I refuse to ever believe that Dave has gone cuckoo, but firing Lillywhite for Ballard was just awful. Think of it this way, Lillywhite produced Phish, which although some Dave fans might not care, they do play a similiar genre of music. However, Ballard produced Alanis?! Were is the connection? Unless Dave is on some sort of pop-MTV binge, then he needs to listen to his fans, which from my understanding, are quite confused by \\"Everyday\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No more sparkle in DMB","review":"DMB was a great band when they came onto the music scene. However, they've forgotton how to be innovative. \\"Everyday\\" is flat out boring, and seems like they are only trying to put out an album to make money. I'm sorry I wasted mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave! What Happened?","review":"I'm not gonna say \\"They Sold Out...\\" I promise. But the simple fact is, this cd sounds infinitely more like Matchbox 20 than DMB. I just don't understand. I was so excited to get this CD, even though I really didn't like \\"I Did It\\", but I almost choked at first listen. Dave tells us the Lilywhite recordings were too depressing, BUT WE ALL LOVED THEM LIVE!! Jeez, if you want some upbeat songs, toss a few into the Lilywhite album and actually break the good old 11-12 song threshold. Don't scrap a masterpiece to give us 9-day old schlock! Frankly, I got tickets for the June 6 show (Turner Field! ARGHHHH!) and I'm really not getting my hopes up. I guess at least the songs from Everyday will give me time to take about a dozen bathroom breaks.Oh for the days when \\"Lie in Our Graves\\" and \\"Two Step\\" rocked my world."},{"rating":"1","title":"DAVE HAS SOLD OUT","review":"I don't know why DMB has traded gold for glitter. The fire and sense of passion are compleatly missing from this album. The sound is generic with a modern pop ring. It makes me want to throw in crash and remember when DMB was one of the most orginal bands around."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO Disappointing!","review":"I really am very disappointed with Dave's style of music on this CD. Its almost disgusting! Sure some people may like the style, but its not Dave. No studio release will ever beat Under the Table and Dreaming. I sure hope Dave's next studio release will not be like this one, this one was completely disgusting. Everyday was the only song i could put up with, and even that one i was just sitting there like \\"Is this even Dave Matthews?\\" It is not at all Dave's style. So if you have never heard this CD and like Dave's original style, DO NOT GET THIS CD! You will be very disappointed. If you think any of those songs would be good live, I've been to 15 DMB Concerts this year and i heard about every song on that CD live, IT IS NOT ANY BETTER! The Space Between just is sickening. I'm not saying that any of the songs are bad, none of these songs are Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This CD, Not Like It","review":"I never listened to DMB in the 80's and 90's (too main-stream for me). So I had no pre-conceived ideas about what they should sound like when I took my 12 year old daughter to a DMB concert a week ago. I was amazed at how great the music was. I came home and borrowed my daughter's cd (Everyday). I can't stop listening to it. It is the best music out right now. I only have one complaint. That is, at the live show the musicians-especially the fantastic violin and sax. players-got to play more. It would have been perfect if more of that had been included on the cd. I think people should stop comparing this cd to the old stuff. Artists have to grow and change."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 For Talent- That's It Though","review":"These songs, like every other Dave Matthews song every recorded (in my opinion) are as boring and pointless as you can get. All my friends love Dave Matthews, but I just see them as a waste of talent. They have a very strong band in all sections(except for Dave's singing). This boring, fusion-utilizing, bizzare version of your Grandpa's favorite jazz band is not the kind of music that you'd hear at a party or want to rock out to at a concert, but more like the kind of music they play at your funeral. But I will give credit where it's due. They are all great musicians, but Dave will never be as good as an (read:electric) electric guitar player as say a Slash, a Tim Mahoney (311) or an Eddie Van Halen (actually, nobody will probably surpass Eddie Van Halen on the six-string anytime soon). And while Carter Buford is a world-class drummer, ahem, he is not the best. The best... well that guy from Rush perhaps? Or Max Weinberg? Come to think of it, how about Alex Van Halen?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a good album, just not a good Dave Matthews Band album","review":"Glen Ballard should be shot for this piece of garbage. If you are a fan of DMB, you will not like this album. It just doesn't sound like them.

Go buy \\"Busted Stuff\\" if you want something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Stop.....you reviewers","review":"PLEASE--- do not start (or even include) your reviews with \\"i have been a DMB fan for...\\" It just makes you all look stupid. It makes you of no authority whatsoever. Although Everyday could be a bit stronger in places, it's an undeniably great record. One reviewer had the nerve to say Dave's singing sounded like 'cats mating'. You obviously have no vocal background. Dave is solid through the entire record and excercises his voice control so well in \\"dreams of Our Fathers\\" that it gives me chills.I find it funny that you all think Dave is \\"selling out\\" when he is trying NOT to appeal to the masses.

He explains very well in details what I am saying."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, they have. The Dave Matthews Band is by far my favorite band. This album doesn't even do justice to their music or their sound. I can only hope that they will go back to the music that has made millions of people fans. This c.d. is for the mainstream pop culture, nothing like the riffs and impromptu playing of Boyd, Carter, Leroi, and Stefan. Dave kind of stole the show, and even with his amazing voice, the other guys in the band have amazing talent that was not displayed on this album. I gave it one star because after all it is Dave, but please let this be a learning experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but it sucks","review":"And I know there are going to be multiple reviews bashing me for saying this. However, this is not a good album - my friends and I had bets on how long DMB would go until they sold out. And this album is it...it features too many studio-wrecked pop tunes, and just not enough jamming that made this band special and unique. There are some songs that certainly have the potential to be good - they begin with grooves that, if developed, would make for some amazing music. But they appear to be too timid to do this, instead going for bland pop that is guarenteed to get lots of radio time. Also, the limitations of the band's musical ability (namely their bass player) really shows in this album - in addition to taking less risks, the instrumental work is less harmonically interesting. Admittedly, \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\" is a hard act to follow, but DMB fell far too short with this pathetic excuse for an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glen Ballard is the Devil","review":"Even though I just started listening to DMB about a year ago, it's been a long year of listening. Now, one year later, 50+ songs known by heart, and with a handful of live shows experienced, I got my hands on this CD. When I read that Ballard was taking over production I wasn't sure what to think. I hoped that he wouldn't upset the band's style...that is exactly what he did. These are not the kind of songs DMB fans are used to or will appreciate; do you picture people holding up lighters at his concerts for these?! And where is Tim Reynolds? If this would have been released as an experimental album then I might not have such a problem with it. Instead, this is what the fans get after three years of patient waiting. I sincerley hope this album doesn't destroy the band's reputation, however, I hope it does get Lillywhite back on the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a DMB fan, do NOT buy this album...","review":"A more appropriate title would have been, Glen Ballard, featuring the Dave Matthews Band...I really can't believe 1) DMB would pick Ballard as a producer, and 2) let him play on the album. Half the problem is having to listen to this guy's infantile \\"keyboard's and arrangment's\\"...the other half is the songs, not only are they a complete departure from even the latest DMB offerings (JTR, Bartender, Grey Street, Grace Is Gone, Raven, etc.), they are boring and unenjoyable. This is not a \\"DMB\\" record, this is a record to get some radio time. Period. If you listen to the other... Ballard has produced, you would probaly like this, if not steer far away from it.

After waiting so long for this album I am bitterley disappointed to find out it is no better than the latest N-Sync offering in terms of comercial dirge. Dave is clearly hoping to fund his retirement by selling this to all the teeny-boppers with no musical taste whatsoever. Every track could easily be the next Britney Spears single. I always wondered if Dave was having his music written by somebody else, and it seems that this is indeed the case, as Noel Gallagher (Oasis) publically refused to write anything for this album because he claimed dave has 'entered into a downward spiral of musical oblivion'. Come on Dave, you're better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different...but that's ok","review":"Bought the cd on the day it was released, listened to it, then went to a party with my friends where we discussed DMB's latest endeavor. This album is extremely different from previous releases-Dave plays electric guitar for the first time, Tim Reynolds is absent, and Steve Lillywhite has been replaced by producer Glen Ballard. Carlos Santana and Santana percussionist Karl Perazzo guest spot on \\"Mother Father\\". This is DMB's first real movement into electric territory, and feedback from my friends is against this movement. I'm reminded of when Bob Dylan first went electric and was shunned by the folk community, but now everyone realizes that some of Dylan's best stuff came from that time. Hopefully, in time people will realize that DMB's musical diversity is illustrated on this album and that a talented group can create music as varied as DMB has."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts me","review":"Its a good album, but not what I've come to expect from Dave over the years. Unexpected is fine. But, when it is what you'd expect from any number of overproduced, undertalented pop bands, well it sucks. They're on TRL for cryin out loud. But, I digress... I'm just gonna pretend this album never was released and go download the LillyWhite sessions and rock myself into musical oblivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"it hurts to think...","review":"I'm so profoundly disappointed in what they've done. I thought Dave knew that MTV's TRL wasnt the measure of great music. Now that they've lumped themselves with the overproduced, undertalented pop legion that is today's radio, I'm just sad. I've listened to the Lillywhite sessions and I know the old Dave and co. are still there. I guess anyone can be distracted by more tangible successess like number one singles and whatnot, but I hope they get back on track. I dont wanna wish the same fate on them as I do the rest of top 40 radio. Come back to us dave..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but Good","review":"I admit to being a lover of bands that change their sound, minimizing song remakes (from their old cds), so that soungs sound so...fimilar with that hint of flair. What hardcore DMB fans aren't realizing when they listen to this CD is that all the members are writing an ablum which shows them emotionally growing. Not that their sound is similar, but it is comparable to what Radiohead does with their CDs, none are the same. I must admit I was very dissapointed in the lack of violin and sax. Listening to the sound and the words on the Everyday album, there is actually meaning to them, and any DMB fan should realize this, and not automatically shut it down because the sound is different. However, minus a star because although the lyrics have meaning, and I don't mind whena band changes its sound, I think Dave has been a little too accomodating for Ballad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should have been the hidden album","review":"I love DMB, don't get me wrong, but this is not DMB. This is a Glen Ballard album in which Dave Matthews is the mouthpiece. This is Britney Spears pre-fab rock. Buy this if you must, but only after you get on a music sharing service and download \\"The Lillywhite Sessions\\", the actual next DMB record. It is great, this one is just barely okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could hear the one that they didn't release","review":"First of all, this album seems to embody the the term sell-out. Dave didn't even write these songs. This is just over-produced music industry fluff. Very bland, and very bad.Now, what happened to the album DMB recorded with Steve Lilywhite that is suppose to be fantastic, if not radio frinedly? I wish I knew. I do know that it has been floating around the internet, and I'm going to find it. Anyway, some powers that be made them stop that album near its completion and put together this horrid mess of an album. I only gave it 2 stars because it is DMB, it really deserves 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"<+++++DMB fans must read this review +++++>","review":"This album (stinks) pretty bad compared to the first three. It has a totally new sound that just doesn't work. If you are a big DMB fan though, you can go to (website) and download \\"The Lillywhite Sessions\\", (named after longtime producer Steve Lillywhite). This was originally going to be the band's fourth studio album, but the record company said it didn't have any hits, so they didn't release it. Then they hired a new producer and came up with Everyday. But recently The Lillywhite Sessions leaked on to the internet. It is a very soft and mellow album and may not be quite as good as the first three, but it sure is better than Everyday and I strongly recommend that you download it instead of wasting your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thud! Dave Matthews crashes back to Earth.","review":"After three totally amazing studio records and several rockin' live records Dave has crashed back to the land of the mediocre. If you are a fan of DMB you are going to be disappointed. This record does not sound anything like his previous sets. \\"I Did It\\" sounds more like Stone Temple Pilots than anything from DMB. There are precious few sax and violin licks and Dave has put away his acoustic guitar for an electric. The intricate musical qualities such as rhythm changes, syncopation and outstanding instrumentals are gone! Worst of all, their new producer (Ballard) has substituted \\"grungy\\" keyboards that aren't very good. Bands often change their style during their careers but in this case DMB has lost its edge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Glen Ballard Band","review":"Glen Ballard would be ashamed of himself if he weren't so busy playing all the parts meant for Tinsley or Moore. His keyboard is is almost as loud as the simple new(but un-original) arrangments:Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus. In nearly every song. A few of the songs stand out nicely, and they sound good live, but with the producer trying to play the collaborating musician, everything goes to pot. Dave's lyrics are probably the weakest they have ever been, stuff any highschooler could write. Go buy one of the old albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A positive difference!","review":"I must say, as a huge DMB fan... I was at first hesitant towards the new \\"Everyday\\" album... what I've heard from snippets off the official website (I think you all should go check it out)... It is in no way a typical style of music for them and very different, but different is a good thing! I don't think anything will ever beat Dave's classic albums, but to experiment and push the talent to another level is such a gift to his fans... It may take a minor warming up to, but once it clicks... you're hooked! Dave has once again proved why he is one of the music industry's foremost songwriters. He has been able to change their style while maintaining quality and passion... In their chord progressions and arrangements you can really hear the rock influence. It's an added spice w/ electric guitar riffs that really enhance the band we have already grown to love... It'll be a must have for Dave Matthews fans old and new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New side of Dave","review":"This definatley shows there is more to Dave than just having a good time partying, drinking and being merry. Dave shows he has a reflective side and is very emotional and writes some of the best wrote songs out of all of his cds. Different isn't always a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make this your only DMB CD","review":"I am a die-hard DMB fan. I never thought I would buy an album of theirs that I didn't love. BTCS took a while to grow on me, but I eventually loved it, just like all the previous offerings of Dave and Co. I was excited about Everday, and I bought it on the first day it was released. After listening to it only once, I tossed it back in the jewel case and never listened to it again (the radio stations played more than enough of it for my tastes). I felt let down, somehow, by this cd. Everything that I loved in a DMB cd seemed to be missing in this one (I have been known to jump up,dance, and sing at the top of my lungs to most DMB songs. This is particularly dangerous when I am driving). There was no passion in Everday. I don't feel inspired to boogie by this cd. My suspicions about the cd were confirmed when (on the same day) I heard Everday on a Soft Rock ... station, at the grocery store, and in an elevator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Dave?Why?","review":"I felt that this CD was sub-par for Dave Matthews Band records.While it would have been a masterpiece for any other band, fan of the Dave Matthews Band have come to expect more musically from the band. The lyrics were almost there, but the music was just way off. If you liked Crash, Live and Luther College and Under the Table and Dreaming, I wouldn't recommend this CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add Dave, stir...","review":"As an avid DMB fan, I have to say that I was not that impressed with CD when I first heard it. Not at all. There were a few good songs, Dreams of Our Fathers, for example, but other than that, I didn't listen to it much.After a while, I found myself going back again and again to listen to the songs. I eventually began to love this CD, even Angel, which I despised at first.The only problem I have with this CD is that the songs tend to sound alike after a while. Guitar from one leaks into another, possibly leading to the mashing of the stop button. Other than that, I'd give it thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"May other experiments be more succesfull","review":"The admiration of Dave Matthew's music started for me with the Crash album. The overwhelming and typical sound of the music made me seek for more. Live at Luther College was a masterpiece of it's own kind and travelling around the world I infected a lot of people with the DM virus. Hearing this live album over and over again one discovers little masterpieces in each song. DM songs became my most favourite ones. Then BTCS with the juggling pieces of voice, guitar, violin and saxophone parts, made me feel there was no better way playing this album than it was done. So when I just heard the samples of the new album somehow brought me in a state of shock. Almost nothing reminded me of the beautifull sounds of previous albums. Every artist has a right for discovering other fields for evolution of its music and to experimentate with it, but I would say DMB took the wrong turnpike here. But there's nothing wrong with turning back and exploring other directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely horrible pop album.","review":"im a fan of dmb, and this is unacceptable. their previous work had so much attitude and made you want to dance. what is this? it a few songs tailored to mtv music videos.. thats it.although i do like the space between (i mean, its hard to not like it when mtv and radio crams it into your head like that). but the rest is lacking. a disappointment. but they'll come back on top next time. its not the end of them. they are a very inspirational and talented group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it isn't so!","review":"I have been a big, big, big fan of the DMB since their early stuff. Back then they were like a breath of fresh air on the music scene. Now, it's like they aren't even trying. And Glen Ballard just destroyed their sound. I hate to rate any album of theirs this bad, but I was so disappointed with this one. I resent spending my hard earned money on something they obviously spent no time or thought into. I'll hold out hope for one more decent album but this one surely is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge DMB fan and hugely disappointed","review":"I buy a lot of music and I don't spend a lot of time writing reviews for albums, but I'll make an exception here.This is easily DMB's worst studio album and it is hugely disappointing. They have lost all of the lengthy, intricate, texture-rich songs that really set them apart from the crowd. If you are a fan of songs like Crush (not Crash) from \\"Before These Crowded Streets,\\" then don't even bother with this album. There is nothing here but uninspired, often unmelodic, 3 minute pop songs.I wish I knew what happened... Steve Lillywhite is no longer the producer, maybe he was disproportionately responsible for the old DMB sound. Another reason might be that Dave Matthews wrote most of the songs on this album himself -- maybe he should have received more input from the band.Anyway, I used to hold DM on a pedestal as a musical genius. Now I'm thinking he is just a has-been pop star."},{"rating":"2","title":"here's another review","review":"Alright, here's the deal. No, this album isn't the same as Under the table and dreaming, nor is it the same as crash, it's even different than before these crowded streets! But since when is a band changing their sound something to get mad about? Granted I'm suprised they have a video on TRL. But this is not a bad Cd. Songs like \\"So right\\" and \\"When the world ends\\" aren't a dissapointment at all. My biggest complaint is the absence of leroi Moore and Boyd Tinsley. But they'll still be there in concert, and I'm sure the'll rule then. In the mean time, quit your bitchin, give the cd a chance, and I guarentee you, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid DMB Effort","review":"While some people may not like this CD for it being, too pop oriented, I really don't feel that is true. The Space Between does sound, oh, just a tad bit over produced but, aside from that track, it's a pretty solid effort. Dave Matthews is progressing and, trying his hand at a few new sounds on this CD but, it works nicely. Nothing seems like it's that drastic of a change from anyhting else he's done . Like I said, to me this is a good solid effort which I have listened to many more times than anything I've bought recently. If you like the DMB, buy this. I'm sure if he would have come out with a cookie cutter copy of his last CD there would have been just as many complaints but, just from a different crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Save your money and wait for them to release the Lillywhite Sessions [.... Take away Dave's voice from this album, and I guarantee you wouldn't be able to recognize the songs as being played by DMB. You can't say that about ANY other DMB album. It's as if Glen Ballard took the musicians and locked them in a 1x1 ft. box and made them play within it. Too bad. Get the Lillywhite Sessions. They're awesome! [....]"},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll grow on you","review":"I'll tell you... after my first listen to the new DMB disc I was not completely impressive. It was quite different than the previous studio albums released by the band. But after further listening, this disc grows on you quite a bit. The melodys are different and new, but just as great! Everyday is a wonderful addition to any collection and adds onto the already wonderful DMB cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the Same from DM - Fortunately!","review":"Dave Matthews has managed to produce an album that still contains the same poetry and sensuality of \\"Crash\\" and \\"Under the Table\\" albeit with a harder, more masculine edge. The sound is a progression towards heavier rock and the final result is fantastic.DM is great in live performances; this music will further enhance their concerts. Play it loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave's there for you, everyday","review":"Ok, look, everybody has there opinon and some say its there best cd ever and others say its the worst, theres no happy median. well to tell you the truth, the cd is above average, but its no remeber two things or under the table. its a new sound you have to get used to. i cant describe it but once i got used to it i really enjoyed it. theres no solos like old albums more of meshing the instaments together and dave puts his heart and soul singing into it.but once again, its all about the lyrics, the metahpors and what dave speaks of, its great, definatly worth picking up a-sap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glen Ballard = menace to society","review":"The songs themselves on this record are pretty decent. My problem is with the god awful production and final mix. Glen Ballard has away of compressing instruments into the \\"wall of noise\\" syndrome. Everything just blends together into sonic mush at maximum volume. It's nearly impossible to make out the saxaphone or violin here. Mix engineer Chris Lord-Alge bleeds out any dynamics, making this record sound flat, abnoxiously loud, overproduced, and just plain terible.I think Ballard and rock bands using acoustic instruments don't mix. Anyone here remember the Van Halen songs with Diamond Dave back on the greatest hits album? Listen to tracks and compare them to ones produced by Ted Templeton. Ballard ruins those tunes the same way he does Dave Matthews.Hey Glen, go back to your little girlfriend Alanis and stop destroying good bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak at best","review":"Dave's weakest stuff to date. I played it for a week at most and haven't played it again. I am sure the songs sound great live but as far as the CD goes there is nothing here that is outstanding except maybe \\"Angel.\\" Mediocre comes to mind as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"sell-out","review":"I used to love Dave Matthews Band. They were original and inspiring. Yet as they get more famous, they seem to have forgotten about their original fan base to focus on the pop crowd. They've lost their edge, they sound just like everybody else on this album. This is a classic case of a good band gone bad, and letting fame and fortune get to their heads. If you're going to buy a Dave CD, get an early one. When they still remembered what music is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"astoundingly unlistenable","review":"This album pretty much verifies the dirty little secret I've suspected all along: Dave is the weakest link in this band. And here he dominates virtually every inch of musical space and the end result is a really boring record.I'll admit that I don't listen to these guys all that much anymore, but having grown up in VA and seen them play in the early days, I kind of like checking up on them from time to time to see how they're doing. At the time I thought that the previous album was kind of a letdown for them, but this new one is just bafflingly bad since they seem to have expunged all the elements that made them sonically interesting in the first place. Every time a groove tries to work its way through the mess, its blasted away with a wall of guitars and some banal lyrics. Some songs here are better than others, but none are among the group's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a DMB Punch Drinker","review":"OK, their first couple of albums were good. This band can rock and perform and that drummer is one of the best I've heard and seen...but this album was like a migrane - painful to listen to, uninspired, and just taking up space in my collection...oh yea, I sold this album years ago...an unfortunate blip on the radar for this talented band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointed","review":"I ordered the cd \\"Everyday\\" and it was packaged as such but when I opened the case, it was an entirely different cd that was enclosed. Really frustrating experience and a huge oversight on the seller's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Yes, this album is better than your average pop that one hears nowadays. However, I don't think that excuses Dave Matthews Band. This band has proven with earlier releases that it is a notch above other bands. They have such a unique lineup and such a talented ensemble, that it seems such a waste to throw it all away on songs like the ones on this album.Occasionally, it sounds like they are trying to be funky, but really don't quite pull it off here. Furthermore, this album has an over-produced quality, as though Ballard felt a need to cover up the brilliance with which most of the band members play (Stefan Lessard isn't exactly a great bassist, but the others are very good).I just don't understand WHY and HOW this album came into being. They're so much more creative than this album would show."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album makes me angry.","review":"I'm listening to it for the second time. I've had it for a month now. It's awful. It makes my ears bleed. I just listened to Before These Crowded Streets, by most accounts not Dave and Co.'s best album, but it was one of mine. The contrast is unbelievable. One album has music on it. The other is a collection of four minute pop songs, which wouldn't be so bad, except that there is a glaring lack of emotion from a band/artist that is best known for its emotionally captivating albums and performances. I've never cared for brand-name producers like Glen Ballard, and this is exactly why...all sonic perfection, and no heart. It's fine when he does this to Alanis Morrissette (who cares?), but for a fine musical ensemble like the DMB to succumb to his hollow ways is the most unfortunate thing to happen to music in years. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the hype","review":"Boy some people will buy anything. Besides the fact that DM can't sing and there are no memorable melodies on this disc some will insist that this is just wonderful. At least in the past there was some unusual instrumention and musicianship going on. This is just a stab at top 40 ala Alanis (whom Ballard also produced). 5 years from now you will be embarrassed to admit that you have this in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STARS...had to give it one","review":"You people are crazy. This album sucks. Dave Matthews is overrated and his fans are chowderheads.

This is their best album yet! I have listened to it several times a day verses \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\". I truly LOVE this band. Have seen them in concert twice and they are even better Live! This is very different then all other CD's....I highly recommend it as the music is very contagious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Albums like this only come a handful a decade","review":"The bulk of this album is great.

I have this hatred for Dave Matthews voice that I am surprised to see is not shared by more people. One would think that anyone who can love the nasal twangs from such varied artists as Dylan and Jon Andersen (not of Yes, but the country singer) should be able to appreciate the screeching, throaty sudden note changes of Dave Matthews, but that is not the case. Matthews sounds so much like a jackass that I flip the station every time he starts braying, er, singing. If you like the oversinging of Joe Jackson, or the \\"whispering as loud as I can voice\\" of Olivia Newton John, you might like this guy. Personally, I think a lot of people are being fooled by the Billy Joel or Barry Manilow of the Pepsi Generation. Please, make mine a Coke and hold the braying to a minimum."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"It pains me to say that this cd sucks. I love Dave, but this is just awful.

I've got news for you. It still blows.Dave - next time you have a cerebral meltdown, do us all a favour and just release another live album. We were all much happier then.In the meantime, I'll keep clicking my heels and hoping that this was all just a bad dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I'm sorry. Dave Matthews Band has to be one of the most overly-hyped and boring bands that I've ever seen.This album lacks taste, depth and all the other elements to make an album a true standout. I don't really even know why I bought this album, I thought, maybe I would try to like them this time, but album after album, they are a true bore.

How in the world can a band throw out Bartender, Grey Street and the other fantastic songs that were slated for the next album. Guys, loose the pop producer and go back to what you do best, jam. Where is the band on this album? I am a big Dave fan but Carter, Boyd and the rest got pushed off. What is this No Doubt? These are too good of musicians to play 3 minute radio friendly songs. I understand everyone needs a change, but please DMB, GET OVER IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"After listening to a friend's discarded copy of this musical tripe I have decided to warn fellow Amazoners to stay away from this sap (or a word that rimes with SAP) The \\"music\\" within this CD is like a reading of James Joyce on acid; it just carries on with a mind numbing monotony which makes it impossible to go beyond a few seconds of each track.

This album was produced solely for one purpose--music videos and airtime. Nothing else. Dave's \\"older\\" music was rich with acoustic guitar solos, colorful lyrics, violin pieces and virtual drum solos that would entertain over and over again. All that and his lyrics are completely flushed down the drain with this album. There isn't a song that's over 4 1/2 minutes as far as I could tell [meaning that the band probably plans on making each and every song on the album a \\"hit single\\" with a video to boot], and found the tones and style from song to song totally monotonous. Advice to Dave-->lay off the electric guitar, buddy. Leave that to Tim Reynolds.It happened to Metallica, it happened to Rush, and now it's happened to Dave Matthews band---you all sold out.Dave Matthews Band is now less one fan..."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy or sell","review":"Zero star. Do not pay for this cd. This is better than the hopeless Before These Crowded Streets but that is not saying much. The only difference here is that the songs have form and dont go on forever. The songs, like the songs on Streets, are boring and directionless. DMB has proven that they are very talented musicians and Matthews is capable of writing great songs (early work). He will not be remembered however as a great songwriter if these back to back throw-aways are any indication of what we can expect in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"He did it\\" (Sell Out)","review":"Not to say that DMB hadn't sold out before, but I really don't know what Dave was thinking by putting out this album. His music has definitely been lacking the chemistry that he once had in the past... I don't know what DMB intended to do except sell records when he got himself a new producer famous for making hits and cut a song and video of \\"I did it\\" that fits perfectly into the TRL scene. If this is the way the band was starting out and wanted to get it's break and get it's music out there with a pop sound it would be almost understandable. But as is, the band was and is so accomplished to the fan base that it's mindblowing to comprehend why he would do something like this. They have dissapointed so many with this crap. I can say that DMB was my favorite band, and now I can't say I feel the same way. I just lost a lot of respect.If you wanna hear catchy music, buy it. If you don't think you'd like a TRL version of Dave don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so bad...","review":"I've been a faithful fan of DMB for a long time and love their type of music. When this CD came out, I heard a lot of flack about how they were \\"selling out\\" on their music and how it had changed to mainstream. When I first listened to the CD, I agreed. But after listening to it several times, I have to disagree. They haven't \\"sold out\\"...they have just changed their style. I enjoy almost every track. While it's true that the band has changed its style to more upbeat and \\"mainstream,\\" it's still a great CD that will keep you listening the whole way through. I give it 4 stars for being a great CD, but I can't give it 5 stars because it is not true to the great DMB style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carter says...","review":"In an article from Rolling Stone magazine, Carter Beauford said this about Everyday:\\"My creativity, my expertise, as well as that of the other guys in the band, was smothered.

It's basically just an overpowering Dave Matthews on electric guitar. Over the last couple of years I have desperately tried to like this album, but to no avail. There are, however, a couple of exceptions. \\"When the World Ends\\" is a real cool song, and if it hadn't been for 9/11 would have been a big radio hit. The title track \\"Everyday\\" is a knock-off of #36, otherwise known as \\"Honey, Honey\\" (or for the diehard fan, the song was originally \\"Hani, Hani\\"). But the rest of the album is nothing more than dirty pop and thrives on the term \\"sell-out\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave lets us down","review":"This is a really disappointing CD. There's barely 1 track that I actually enjoy a little bit. Unlike under the table or crash the hit song [was no good]. And it's quite obvious that it was produced by Alanis Morissette's producer; it's completely different. I just didn't get the feal of all the rest of Dave's albums.

The Black Crowes were able to put an album together in two weeks with \\"Southern Harmony...\\" but DMB does not pull off the same effect as the Crowes with this effort.

I'd not been familiar with Dave Matthews Band until I'd heard these two songs that i've mentioned. Perhaps you are familiar with DMB's previous works, and i've seen reviews saying that they've done much better than this. well, to me this is very good music, and i'm not familiar with their previous albums. Let that be a guide to you if you are a new listener, such as me. Ciao!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different dave..","review":"Traditional Dave Matthews Band fans will find this album very different with a much more 'produced' sound. While I still prefer his older work and attitude (as I think he does as well) this album is still good compared to most other pop-rock albums out there. Don't pass it by because it is different."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is an excellant Matchbox 20/Third Eye Blind cd","review":"This cd is an average cd but not what we expect from Dave Matthews. I never thaught DMB would turn into an MTV puppet but they have. I am disapointed that the orriginal CD produced by Lillywhite was not released. The record company execs and Dave felt that the Lillywhite CD was to depressing. Well.... Depressing is better than this buttle gum garbage Dave threw at us and expects us to eat it up. After hearing this CD I decided to sell my tickets to see Dave this summer. I can't contribute to a man who alienates his fan base. I do however like When the World Ends and Angel. But the rest of this CD makes absolutely no impact on me when i listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album after a long time","review":"I've been following DMB's carreer since 1994 and had not heard such a good album by them in quite a while.Never mind the popular 'I did it'. It doesn't speak well enough about the album.Pieces like 'The Space Between' and 'Mother Father' (with the participation of Carlos Santana), show you that these guys have come back with a very high caliber album that brings back some of their early feel, along with some ground breaking work.I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhhh....","review":"Of course, like millions of DMB fans, i was extremely dissapointed with EVERYDAY. I've turned to DMB my entire life to escape this crap bubble-gum pop, because they didn't seem afraid to have 3 minute long music solos, entirely suggestive lyrics, and odd yet pefect vocals. i was trying to comfort myself by saying that they would soon get over this horribly sold out rut, but after reading that the change wasn't because of musical revolutions, but a change in producers, then the bands future began to look dull. Dave matthews lyrics, which were once amazing 7 minute long metaphorical poems, have been dumbed down to songs which mean nothing. \\"I did it,\\" i mean, what the hell is that. So all i can to now is hope they will hear the millions of cries, and change, but until then, i will listen to the phenominal UNDER THE TABLE AND DREAMING, BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS, AND CRASH. sorry Dave, but you've killed your career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God No! Stop This Garbage","review":"I didn't know the Backstreet Boys joined the Dave Matthews Band, cause that's what this album sounds like. A BIG STEP DOWN from Under the Table, Crash, and Before These Crowded Streets. Short, pop songs with no violin or sax. Dave has sold out bigtime, veering this album towards the teenyboppers of today. A big disappointment..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when you thought it was safe to buy DMB","review":"Just when you thought Dmb was a great musical talent, they turn Pop. Mind-blowing, isnt it? Myself and others use Dmb as our pop-relief, when the world is so full of \\"it\\". For us who love music, and know what music is, this new album is a swift kick in the balls. I'm just glad I had enough time to warn my friends. I did not realize what a negative impact switching to ballard would be. No more dave for awhile,'everyday' is in the trash, im ignoring the summer concert sales (it would be sad to see them attempt to play machine made music live...so pathetic on SNL), just the old 'remember two things' for me until their next album, another chance to redeem themselves. bring back lillywhite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad 'Day","review":"What a phenominal disappointment.With this album, Dave has abandoned all of the things that make him the most original singer/songwriter/musician of the last decade and floated a collection of generic aggro-pop tunes that only a teenage Alanis fan could love.Shame on you, Glen Ballard.When I was 20 my brother asked me if there was a single Grateful Dead song out of some 300 recorded that I DIDN'T like. I thought about it and realized the answer for me then was \\"no\\". I was completely and happily immersed in the whole Dead mythology. The only DMB fans who will like this album are the sycophants who blindly and automatically worship anything and everything that Dave foists upon them. They will convince themselves that Dave has bravely \\"reinvented\\" himself on this album, rather than realize that his creative juices have, at least for one album, sadly run dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glen Ballard sucks","review":"Jerry Seinfeld defended his decision to end his sitcom prematurely by theorizing that performers should always leave their audiences wanting more. This is precisely the case with Everyday in that the songs are mostly catchy and listenable (albeit commercial and slick), but just when you are expecting a prolonged Boyd or Leroi solo, the music fades to silence. Then again, Aerosmith and Alanis aren't that big on violins and saxophones, right, Mr. Ballard? Michael Stipe was dead-on when he declared, \\"damn that radio song,\\" and unfortunately, we have 12 damn radio songs on our hands here. One can only hope that these songs are given more life and length on tour this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED!?!","review":"After thoroughly enjoying UTTAD, Crash, and Before these Crowded Streets, I am VERY disappointed with this album! The three previous studio releases were fun... Everyday is dark, and dull. I listened to the whole album 3 times, and I can't remember any distinct songs! They all sound basically the same. There's a lack of other instrumentation (something that was present in the other albums).... I would recommend buying this simply to complete your DMB collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, Everyday is overly produced.","review":"Unfortunately, Everyday is overly produced. Dave Matthews said this album was \\"about the band\\", but the band has lost it's raw edge and appeal and doesn't sound as distinct as it once did. Dave's voice seems to get cluttered in all the band noise, which is electric guitar laden and has lost it's distinct, acoustical sound and has gone to a more pop or hazy electric guitar sound. You won't hear a single Boyd violin solo, acoustical guitar gets lost in the haze and Dave's voice is not heard as prominently as it once was...I guess because this album is, \\"about the band\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bombastic","review":"Much has been made of the fact that early sessions on this CD were scrapped, and that Dave and producer Glen Ballard started from scratch, penning 10 of the songs in just 10 days! They sound more like they were written in 10 minutes: love bombs, indeed. The lyrics make \\"Silly Love Songs\\" seem majestic and poignant by comparison.The biggest problem is, Ballard's production philosophy seems to be make it busy and make sure everything is mixed at the highest possible level, all the time. This type of production leaves no room for discovering the hidden layers of a song, and all of the sonic bombast just makes one tired after about 3 songs--where is the instrumental and vocal subtlety displayed on \\"BTCS\\" or \\"Crash\\"? (For that matter, where's the sax and violin this time around?)Bypass this and wait instead for the reissue of The Band's \\"Rock of Ages.\\" THAT is an album that displays the kind of group interplay that is so absent on \\"Everyday.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DMB: Caught in the Space Between","review":"Change is not bad. But change toward a sound we've heard before is boring. This album is uninspired and unoriginal. Riffs taken from Rush and Yes; vocals taken from Peter Gabriel; all solos cut down to size. This is the DMB's most \\"pop\\" to date. Gone are the days of long flourishing solos and mystical lyrics. This album proves that the DMB is no longer into the music as much as they are into the money and the hits. Although not entirely horrible, it's a severe disappointment. Be prepared for a \\"Revenge of the Eighties\\" feel. Tracks which stand out are \\"Everyday,\\" \\"The Space Between,\\" \\"Angel,\\" and \\"Dreams of Our Fathers.\\" Other than those, it's a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best, abandons their roots","review":"I rushed out and bought Everyday on the first day it was available. I must admit I am disappointed. The other reviewers have all pointed out that this is a different sound for the band. I don't think its a change for the better. The sound is, while still containing some of Dave's unique features, much more like generic pop and rock than the acoustic, reedy, improvisational and airy sound that fans typically associate with Dave. This album may well end up being more popular with the general public and become his best selling album, but I really miss the lengthy, improvisational tracks from Before These Crowded Streets and the great surreal singles from the early albums. Granted I haven't really given it a chance to grow on me, but I don't think I'll change my view that this is by far the weakest of his studio albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"I enjoy all the DMB albums and this one is no different. I liked hearing the guys take a different approach and think they hit on some very good material. It's not my favorite DMB album and some of the songs aren't very interesting... but other songs are fantastic and I hold this album as just as 'important' as any other, in its own unique way. It's a strong whole with some real nice songs and a brand new sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"DMB + Ballard = Fluff","review":"I hate to say this about one of my favorite bands, but the addition of Glen Ballard to the musical mix has eliminated the depth and emotion that I expect out of DMB. Even \\"Space Between,\\" by far the best song on the album, gets old quickly. I've never had a DMB song get old before, I'm in shock really. If you like DMB, make sure you listen to several songs off this album BEFORE purchasing it, otherwise your likely to end up selling it like I did..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Everyday\\" has mixed emotions","review":"The Dave Mattews Band is a great band with great fans. The band is also known as one of todays best concert bands. But the latest CD that the group entitled has released \\"Everyday\\" has had mixed reviews among the fans. Maybe it is the fact that Dave does not play the songs accousticly. Some fans may not like it because they think that the band is changing totally to how they sound on the CD. Although many fans do not like the new CD, many do like its new sound. A little change is healthy. This does not mean that the Dave Mattews Band is never going to be same. Good songs are good songs, and \\"Everyday\\" has good songs for listeners to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh New Sound To An Already Awesome Band!!","review":"I would like for everyone that reads this review to go out and pick this cd up. If you know already DMB is a different sounding band they mix r&b, pop, rock, jazz, and any other sound you could think of. It has any thing that you could want to hear Love songs, hate songs, and just good old DMB jamming sessions. What adds a new great sound to this cd, that is different from all their other albums is that Dave Matthews himslef picks up an electric guitar and let me say he plays it just as well as he plays any other guitar he picks up. This band is an absolutly remarkable example of true musical talent. And they bring it all together just for us.....THERE FANS!!! Go out and buy all there cds!!!! Dave Matthews Band Kicks...!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everday....different, yet still good","review":"I only possess Dave's live albums before I purchased this one and it did take me for a loop on how different it was. Although I really like this cd, it just seemed like it left me hangin' for more. No jammin', minimal Boyd and Leroi, less rawness(which was a good thing to have) and too much Ballard influence. It just seems too overproduced, especially for a band that thrives when performing live. But, for a studio album with all NEW songs, I was more than satisfied with the cd. Some of my favorite songs are When The World Ends, Dreams of Our Fathers, So Right, Fool to Think, Sleep To Dream Her, and Everyday. I, however, would've prefered the Lillywhite session songs over these. If you are a true DMB fan, get the album. Obviously its not the best, but its still Dave and we all should still support him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw, yet refined...if you like it that way.","review":"Yay for Dave Matthews for pulling himself out of a rut of depression by co-writing these 12 songs with Glen Ballard (of Alanis Morrisette's Jagged Little Pill success, amongst others). But his new sound, though musically credible, is under par. Not just for the lack of the \\"Dave Matthews Band sound\\" (the lack, on this album, of intense solos and acoustic mastery), but also under par for ANY band. Listen to this album with caution: would you think it was so great if it were the band's first album? If you'd never heard of the band or if you've never seen them live? No, this is not a bad album. But even though it is something new for Dave Matthews, it's not anything new for me, apart from Dave Matthews' unmistakable voice sticking out of over-produced songs with simplistic melodies. That's something I haven't heard before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of songs, with one major complaint..","review":"The music on the CD is great. This was a different direction for DMB. Definitely more of an adult-alternative sound compared with the jam band sound most fans preferred. However, that doesn't make it a bad CD. What makes this CD a little hard to listen to is the fact that it's completely compressed and the sound quality is garbage. If you don't believe me, check out any of the band's older albums. This is, by far, one of the worst mixing jobs I've heard on an album. Yet another album that could have been 5 stars had it not been for Chris Lord-Alge and his obsession with compression!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Good Really...","review":"I am really torn with this CD. On one hand, I am with the crowd that really dislikes this release because of its mainstream approach. The idea that mainstream pop producer Glen Ballard took the place of the beloved Steve Lillywhite was a crushing blow as well. Lastly, the very idea that the band had little collaboration together with this release takes away from that authentic DMB feel. But, on the other hand, I have to say that Everyday is quite good. I will say that Ballard did a great job producing this release. Each song has a tight feel to it, and even though its a little more mainstream than the past works, the musicianship is excellent for each song. I would still recommend DMB's older works over Everyday, but give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"DMB at their worst","review":"What more can be said? it lacks intelligent, fresh themes and complex lyrics and is ultimately boring. The only song worth listening to is \\"What You Are,\\" as it has a hard-edged vibe similar to old-school (non-BTCS) versions of \\"Halloween.\\" Also, the song \\"Everyday,\\" a revised version of its earlier superior, \\"#36,\\" is good when Matthews softly sings it alone on the acoustic (as he did at the performance for the televised 9/11 fundraiser). And interestingly, Everyday and their successive album, Busted Stuff, (both representing their worst efforts in the studio to date) are the only albums so far to feature the band members themselves as cover art. draw your own conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Great Collection of Songs","review":"Thank god Dave Matthews is rich. He can afford to do what he wants even if his fans are too small-minded to appreciate it. This is an extremely good cd. Perhaps Dave should begin recording solo records to experiment without so much hassle from rabid \\"DMB\\" fans. It's been said that some of the bandmates weren't happy with Everyday, because basically, they weren't showcased as they were in the past. I don't think I'd care about the Carter Beauford Band. Or the Boyd Tinsley Band. Dave is the heart and soul of DMB and they sound best when they follow his instincts.Every song on this cd is a quality lyric on top of a quality and catchy (why is that a dirty word?) rhythm track. Overall, the songs flow nicely and I've never skipped a song while listening.Don't listen to critics of this album, most of them hated it before they ever heard it, spend their nights getting plastered at frat parties, and haven't listened to this cd a half-dozen times. This is quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely different, but excellent none the less","review":"I was listening to \\"Before these crowded streets\\" right before I got this CD...their style of play is similar, but has definately changed a little bit.I would actually give this 4.5 stars, based on the fact its a bit different than they're old stuff. Gone are the get-up tunes like \\"Stay,\\" no more anthems like \\"Tripping Hillbilly,\\" and no more lyrically beautiful songs such as, \\"Satellite.\\"However, its a great CD. I was able to listen to it all the way through and wasnt unimpresed by any particular song. The tunes all seem to be laid back. A few songs pick up the tempo a bit, but not as much as they used too. All in all, if your a DMB fan you'll be surprised, but should like it nonetheless. If you havent heard DMB before, definately, definately check this one out, it seems to be more enroute with majority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second thoughts","review":"In March I gave this CD 3 stars, trying to be optimistic and loyal to a band I love. I realize I haven't listened to this CD since April. Why? Because I just don't like it. It didn't grow on me. I never started humming the tunes idly at work, fuggedaboudit! I hope the new tunes will be good in concert this summer(looking forward to Hartford)From what I've seen of the set lists they're playing a lot of the Everyday tunes, which I can understand. If I could pick some Everday songs for the sets I see, it would probably be So Right and Everyday. Maybe after I see some Everyday songs live, I'll change my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's the wrong way!","review":"I'm a Portuguese Dave Matthews' fan and I feel frustrated with his latest work. Precisely when Europeans were starting to enjoy his intercultural rhythm, ballads, and all the mixed styles that he achieved to put togheter, he decided to put in jeopardy the reputation that he had conquered since 92. This change, for a more commercial style, wont (I hope) collect many supporters and will force the band to revise the strategy. I've been almost begging for an Eoropean concert, but now I have my doubts..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw off the yoke of Ballard","review":"The joy for me of the DMB was it's musical wanderings. It was like watching a herd of wild mustangs. All were traveling in a unified direction but with much randomness. An occasional individual or two might veer off but always reunited with the group. Fast,free and unpredictable.This cd is like watching a plodding water buffalo burdened by a heavy sled, but a single road to follow. I would have readily accepted this cd had it been released as a single endevour. Then it could have been presented for what it is, a compilation of well constructed well thought out songs by Dave. But to market this as a Band effort while restricting these wonderful musicians from their creative input is just wrong. I hope and pray these songs will take another shape come concert time when chains may be broken and the music can grow on it's own.In short, as a solo effort good, as a band effort this cd blows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than other DMB albums, but still good.","review":"Sure in Everyday, the Dave Matthews Band has a new sound: the songs are shorter, and you don't as much of the saxophone and violin as on other albums, but Everyday is still a good album. The lyrics are just as good on the this album as their other albums, and I think the electric guitar that Dave now plays sounds cool.When you compare Everyday to top-selling albums from annoying pop artists like Britney Spears and 'N Sync, you know that this is one of the better albums that's out right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"DMB fan here who hates this album. Lousy short 3 minute made-for-radio songs. Angel is the most sickening song I've heard from this band. Never thought i'd use the word sickening to decribe a DMB song. One or two exceptions of course: Everyday and Dreams of Our Fathers have merits. That's it- nothing too articulate here. Just a quick review. Hope their next one is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dave Matthews","review":"been a dmb fan for awhile but was really caught by surprise by this one. its not dmb!! too commerical! go back to what made dmb great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Let Down","review":"After listening to Dave Matthews Band's newest release, Everyday, I am, to say the least, dissapointed. Gone are the interesting sounds of Dave's acoustic guitar. Carter Beauford (the drummer) is pushed down to hammering out standard rock tempos rather then than the usual complex array of drum licks. I must say since I heard \\"Remember Two Things\\" way back in 92' I was captivated by their unique sound. Now, it is time to move on to find another ground-breaking band. Oh yeah, the one star goes to Steve Lillywhite, for salvaging at least \\"I Did It.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment for classic DMB fans","review":"If you were a big DMB fan before, you know by now that this CD more than dissapoints you. The depth of lyrics is terrible. Compare lyrics such as \\"I did it, do you think I've gone too far?\\" with something like \\"Mommy, come quick, the dreaming tree has died. The air is growing thick, the fear you cannot hide. The dreaming tree has died.\\" from Before These Crowded Streets or a song like Typical Situations from Under the Table and Dreaming or any of their pleasant ballads like #34 from UtTaD. The depth has become the mainstream teenie-bopper-pop kind. Music-wise, they have also devolved. The fact that no other DMB albums have showed up in the \\"Customers have also bought this:\\" list should tell you a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't dismiss this album after 1 listening!","review":"Now, I've read the 100+ reviews of this album, and it is clear that you either love it, or you hate it. And I will tell you my opinion, I really like it. I've been a hard core DMB fan for a long time, and have really grown to love the unique and incomparable music Dave and the boys have made. This album is really great with the best lyrics and arrangements I've seen on any Dave studio album. I implore all of you hard core DMB fans out there who dismissed this album after just one listening, to give it a chance. Stop whining so much just because Dave is exploring and experimenting with his music. Just because it is different, doesn't neccessarily mean it's bad! Sure I was a little dissappointed when I never heard Boyd's violin, (hence the 4 stars, rather than 5),but I didn't throw the cd away just because of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"LISTENER (and Radio) SUPPORTED","review":"Wonder why Dave was NEVER on the radio? It was because none of the band's major albums ever came close to achieving that mainstream pop-rock appeal as this one will. Like a fine wine,the DMB of past was an acquried taste, but this album appeals to hardcore DMB fans, and will surely get all those younger kids (meaning not the Gen-Xer's) jumping on the Dave-wagon in no time. This will be a refreshing change of pace for all of us used to the \\"old Dave\\" whose drifting, cutting voice finally finds a home in the edgy \\"I Did It\\" and \\"What You Are\\". I predict at least three songs being regularly played on the radio and making the charts: \\"I Did It\\", \\"The Space Between,\\" and possibly (I hope)\\"So Right.\\" This might be wishful thinking, but Dave has really done it this time--he is truly a musical genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A change from the usual...","review":"Simply put, this is a great record. It's quite a twist from what we were used to with the band. Short songs, more electric guitar and a bit less presence from the other band members. Even if there are some amazing songs on this CD, I miss the \\"old\\" DMB with the violin solos and everything. Nonetheless, if you have read a bit about the events around the making of this CD, you know it was a step the band ad to take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of the rack.","review":"If you have been following DMB for the The 'DMB sound' don't bother with 'Everyday'. The album lacks the honesty, detail, and the tight arrangements associated with their earlier albums. The overall sound is more electric ( thanx to Carlos Santanas contributions to the Album ) and lack the raw 'jammy' feel. The band has clearly departed from its endearing blend of balanced instrument solos and intrusive vocals normally resulting in a tight sound. If not for Daves voice one would be hard pushed to recognize the band. This one belongs to the bottom of the CD rack......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have been a fan for almost ten years - I go to the concerts, own all the albums, love about every single song....until now. This album is just plain disappointing. Where is Dave? I miss him. It's such a tragic sell-out, pop-culture, bubble gum, wannabe story. If you must purchase, The Space Between is the only decent song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Collection of Top 40 Style Music","review":"This will no doubt be a readcord breaker in sales, but not because of its musical content. This will probably be their last original release before they breakup. I own every release from DMB, as well as many concert recordings, and this is by far the least creative. It has been over produced and over hyped. I have listened to it a dozen times and it still has not grown on me. As other reviews have mentioned, it does not have much Violin or Sax and it was this that made DMB different and special. If you like Top 40 style, buy it. If you want true DMB, try Red Rocks, Live at Luther College, Under the Table..., or even Crash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Matthews sinks into the Power Pop Of Glen Ballard","review":"Ok first, I'm a HUGE DMB fan. From the first notes of \\"Remember Two Things\\" I was hooked. This is the most disappointing album of DMB's career. My biggest question is \\"Where's the Band?\\" Unlike other albums,this disc focuses more on Dave's Voice than the band. I think there are maybe 3 tracks with sax on it. That's a sad state of affairs. Sure Dave hasn't had too many radio hits, but the label should have let the band continue their journey other than looking for \\"Snappy, Upbeat\\" Songs. So Dave please release the album that RCA made you scrap and bring Steve Lillywhite back. Or at least get a producer such as Daniel Lanois that has a more proven track record. Sure Alanis' \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is a great disc, but ever hear Paula Abdul's \\"Forever Your Girl\\" or The Wilson Phillips album? I rest my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This album is definitely a disappointment....I have been an avid fan since before \\"Remember Two Things,\\" and with \\"Everyday\\" DMB demonstrates further that they are willing to abandon whay they initially set out to do to gain/retain fan approval.....and to think that I had been looking forward to numerous albums worth of innovation.......this is boring. I'd've given it no stars, but that is not an option. You can do better, guys! MUCH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The worst Dave CD Ever, i couldn't believe it when i bought it. Dave and the band need to find there roots again i believe. There was this whole thing with Dylan's not gonna be the same after electric, but he proved it, he proved he could. Dave proved the couldn't, this is awful, it's made for MTV ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DMB where are you?","review":"I have been a do-or-die DMB fand since the beginning. Growing up between Charlottesville and Richmond, VA, I've been inundated with their sound since I was in junior high. Call me a traditionalist, but I honestly think that Everyday is one of the worst albums I've bought in a long time. I have never said that about a DMB album until this point. I was more impressed by Hanson's new release, although I was at least smart enough not to by Hanson's album. What a waste. I am all for band expanding and experiminting musically, but not all growth is good growth. Luckily I've collected over 25 \\"bootleg\\" concerts and I will always have those to jam to. Dave, I'm sorry man but I'm just not buying into this \\"mushroom cloud\\" thing backed up by electric guitars. If anyone sees a copy of Everyday laying on the side of the highway in rural Virginia, feel free to have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DM's Biggest Fan Disappointed","review":"I have been a huge fan of the Dave Matthews Band since I first heard them perform in Charleston, SC in 1992. I've seen them in concert in Charlotte, Nantucket, Chicago and New York several times in the last 10 years and needless to say, they ROCK! However, I am VERY disappointed with their new album, Everyday. The band typically tours with a song for a year before recording it, and it was evident upon listening to the album for the first time that Dave threw together some unpassionate lyrics, added an electric guitar and recorded. There is honestly not one song on the album that is particulary melodious or memorable.Will continue to support the band in its efforts and hope that their next album makes up for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic DMB","review":"Several well known hits on this album and the lesser known ones are just what you would expect from DMB. The late Leroi Moore's sax skills shine on several songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is by the record label, not the artist","review":"I've been a DMB fan since before they were popular, and this is the album that I refused to let people play on my stereo in college. First of all, the cover makes me want to throw up in my mouth. Some of the songs are alright, but the whole album has a feel that leaves a bad taste in my mouth (again my vomit) DMB wanted to put out Lillywhite Sessions, but it was too \\"real\\" and \\"good.\\" So they forced the band to record an entire new album of dull, watered down crap that turned into this album. Luckily, the forces of evil were thwarted and more people downloaded Lillywhite than bought this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defects on Tracks 2 and 3","review":"I have found one glaring defect on this album. I exchanged my first purchase for a second cd which had the same errors. Track 2 ends prematurely with Dave being cut off in the midst of saying 'beginning'. The track ends with begin and then jumps to track 3. I also have found some sound engineering flaws at the beginning of track 3 as well. I can let go of the minor errors on track 3, but the error on track 2 leaves me scratching my head. How does something like this go unnoticed before mass production of a compact disc?"},{"rating":"1","title":"only slipup i've seen from dmb","review":"with little to no pessimism or doubts about the ability and loaded potential that DMB holds as they head into the coming years, i think Everyday is an unfortunate slipup and if anything an experimentation with a forced and awkward style that's seemingly brought in more for marketing than for inspiration. The hope I'm left with is that the band will evolve through music that is willfully theirs, more like the Lillywhite and Busted Stuff tracks, and every recording made prior to Everyday. A few listenable songs but nothing making it worthy of a new purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummmmm alright","review":"Lets see, some songs are alright, I mean Everyday is fine, but the over playation of the space between and i did it got annoying. The older music and style of DMB is awesome, but when Glen Ballard had to step in and produce this album things changed. in my opinion they went downhill. i say go for crash, before this crowded streets etc. but lemme tell you i cant wait for the new \\"busted stuff\\" with some lillywhite session material its gonna ROCK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst CD","review":"DMB is definitely my favorite band, but this CD was a major let-down. I think most people who love the band (not just those who like it) like the fact that their main instruments are a violin, a sax, and an accustic guitar. It gives their music a sound like no other band. This album is nicely polished and could very well sell better than all the others... but those who are fans of Under the Table and Dreaming will find this album boring. There certainly are good songs, but nothing so amazing that you will still listen to it 5 years from now.Here's hoping they fire their new producer and get back with their old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every great band has 1 very forgettable effort","review":"This is the one everyone will forget about or joke about 10 years from now. I'm a BMD junkie and would find a Backstreet Boys cover by the band to be great. I was shocked to find myself disinterested in Everyday after the second listen with the exception of a couple songs. If you are a fan of DMB's music you won't like this effort. The lyrics sound very thoughtless as if they were rushed when they were composed. The music doesn't sound much like anything they've played before. It sounds like this is their producer's music and not the band's music. I've listened to this CD 3 times through and find 2 good songs, 2 ok songs, and 8 \\"skip\\" songs. Everyday will definately be on the bottom of a large pile of great Dave Matthews CD's I own. It'll be pulled out to listen to a paticular song or 2 but not to be played completely through."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad departure from a magical sound","review":"Unfortunately, this cd (and the new direction the Dave Matthews Band is taking) falls flat. The culmination of a lot of psychological strain, creative energy, and intense emotion has pushed Dave in a new direction, which edges dangerously close to pop. This cd leaves me feeling like his music has been washed in bleach. Gone are the strong eccentricities (like the prominent strains and solos of the violin and saxophone and the melodic sound of the acoustic guitar) of his past cds that truly made his sound unique. There are only remnants of these wonderful eccentricities in his current wave of music. What has replaced these, is the electric guitar - how original. There is really only one song on the new cd that I think is worth listening to, and that would be \\"The Space Between.\\" I would forego buying this cd and download only that song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy any other Dave than this one","review":"This album is terrible. It's noisy, unsexy and simplistic in lyrics. In fact, you will get more romance from a Hallmark card. Witness this line: \\"Legs don't work 'cause you want me so bad so you just lie spread.\\" Women don't like to think of themselves as \\"spread,\\" Dave. That is locker room talk at best. Dave Matthews Band has distinguished itself on all other albums and in concert with long violin and saxophone solos, extremely erotic lyrics and, to me, a lot of foreign influence in the music which had always kept things interesting until this album. If you have not heard much of the band's music and buy this album, you will probably not like the band. I suggest you buy any other album they have done, or any other album in the world. I have had a listen to their new music that is not released yet, and it is great. So buy an older cd or just wait for another to be released. But do not waste your hard-earned dough on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bye\\", this album","review":"This just doesn't compare with any other DMB albums at all. A few reviewers are stumped as to why people are trashing this album. They are the blind majority of people who don't know real music from commercial mass market garbage if it stared them in the face. Buy any or all previous works by DMB but by all means, stay away from this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please can't I give this zero stars?","review":"This is a severely disappointing attempt from a band that is my #2 favourite of all time (U2 being #1). Dave is here, loud and clear on his new electric guitar (what a mistake!) The rest of the band seems to be on vacation. I certainly don't hear the unconventional drumming of Carter, nor the excellent saxophone or the energetic violin of LeRoi and Boyd. The songs are poorly-rhymed and hastily-written. The electric guitar is overwhelming and nothing like the thoughtful acoustic of the old DMB. The lyrics aren't the genuine and introspective lyrics from before. If you ask me, DMB should have stuck with Steve Lillywhite. There are some songs on this album that would have been good, if they were recorded by anyone BUT Dave Matthews. As it is, I'm disappointed in the album, and can only hope they're better live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave and the boys have done it again!!","review":"I've always been a huge Matthews fan. That's why once Everyday came out I had to get it. I didn't know any song from the new album only \\"I Did It\\" and when I popped the cd in my car I feel in love with the new sound. The thing with Dave Matthews is that their sounds can change but the lyrics and the way Dave sings just stays the same and wraps around you. A band like this that has been around for a long time souldn't be takin lightly. All the songs on Everyday are amazing. Every song. I mean everything. The lyrics are humble and passionate, but they've been that way always. I really enjoy Everyday and I hope you will too. And if you don't then you really don't know good music. Just hearing Dave sing is powerful in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cd to listen to everyday!","review":"Just when the DMB was sounding old and out of ideas they come up with their best album to date. Some followers will despise this album because they won't find any 8 minute jams on everyday. Fans should look at it from a different perspective though. On Everyday Dave takes his lyrics to a whole new level and the addition of electric guitar is a plesant surprise. The best tracks on Everyday are The Space Between, So Right, and Angel. Angel is an instant DMB classic and by far a cut above the rest. Out of the 12 tracks on here only the first released track I Did It is a disappointment. By the way if you like DMB check out The Pat McGee Band and Coldplay....2 of the best kept secrets in music industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyday is to DMB what Coda was to Zeppelin","review":"Although this album has a number of catchy tunes, I hope this will be a momentary departure from DMB's unique sound. While there is a little of Dave still left in \\"Everyday,\\" it's very disappointing that there is minimal sax and violin. Although we hear that the live versions will make up for this, I wouldn't mind having a taste of that jamming in my living room or in my truck. Decent album, but not noteworthy in comparison to past works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Have to admit I disliked \\"I Did It\\" and still think that it is the worst song on the CD but even the best CD's have at least one bad song. I just bought the CD last night and can't stop listening to it. I own every CD Dave has put out and up until now have thought \\"Crash\\" was the best. I would rank \\"Everyday\\" right up their with \\"Crash\\". It's different but in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but missing something...","review":"I like this album, but DMB is starting to sound more like a regular band - what happened to the violin??? its practically nowhere to be found. and even the sax has been pushed considerably into the background. I think the inclusion of these two elements which have made so many previous DMB songs so brilliant (crush comes to mind) could also have made this album great."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not Dave Matthews BAND!","review":"this is like a Dave Matthews solo album his \\"band\\" is mostly wasted as just backup studio musicians. the album is very hit (\\"fool to think\\", \\"if i had it all\\", \\"the space between\\", and \\"when the world ends\\")or miss (\\"I Did It\\", \\"What You Are\\", \\"Sleep to Dream Her\\"). \\"I Did It\\" is probably the WORST song on the album and I really can't believe it is getting so much radio play! If Dave had let his band play a little more it might have been a better album but instead we get him dominating the songs with his new found electric guitar and a desire to keep the songs short. new comers to the band get Under the Table and Dreaming or Crash 1st. oh and skip Before These Crowded Streets its utter crap this is at least a step up from that pile of dung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gut-wrenching Disappointment!","review":"I have loved EVERYTHING dmb has done until now. i own every song the band has ever recorded. after listening to everyday, i have 12 songs too many! i do not have enough room here to adequately explain the sick feeling this album gave me. this effort is simply dave matthews with some back up musicians. gone is the meticulous interaction that was the magic of dmb. this album sounds like some bad electronic music from 1982, i have never heard anything so over-produced in my life. i never thought i would say this, but i will never buy a dmb album without hearing it first again. the illusion that i had of this band being more interested in the quality of their music than their commercial success has proven to be just that, an illusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 words.....","review":"Big Disappointment. I've been a fan since the beginning, and have always had a little trouble getting accustomed to new albums. There is always something different with each new album, but it was still Dave. This is not Dave.. this is every other annoying rock band. This is the kind of garbage you hear on that one radio station that sounds like the same song playing over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's terrible","review":"Sorry, I need to agree with the earlier review. This is just an awful album - the band has sold out. So much for the great eclectic mix of music - they are now officially commercialized pop junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad album","review":"I am a huge DMB fan, and own every album they have. This is by far the worst album they made. In fact, it probably should have never been released. Some of the songs on the album make great live songs such as what you are and when the world ends but other than that the quality of the album is just not any good. The sound is not classic Dave, which the sound all dave fans know and love. This album is even worse than his brand new release Stand Up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of DMB !","review":"From the moment I own \\"live at luther college\\" and found there maybe my favorite album ever, I thought DMB was great. It's not on this terrible album. There are only two good songs (maybe !) \\"If I had it all\\" and \\"The space between\\" and I can't listen the others (so annoying, so bad !). FORGET THAT ONE !"},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTENTION: READ BEFORE BUYING EVERYDAY!","review":"i bought this thinking of the great albums dmb has produced. tsk tsk tsk..... horrible. not one song is well crafted. buy other albums from dmb . BUT DEFINATELY NOT THIS ONE. sdont waste your money. im begging you...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Has Hit Me","review":"After posting a five star review of this album and praising the band for \\"changing\\", I listened to Everyday over and over again. But something happened: I realized this CD really, really stinks. I never cared for the Glen Ballard/Dave Matthews pairing at all and now I really hate what Ballard has done. His production WAS magical with Alanis Morissette and now she has decided to go alone for her next record. After hearing Everyday, I don't blame her. Ballard and Matthews have striped the emotion from the songs and have created Backstreet Boy songs which is fine, only that I thought DMB was a \\"real\\" band. Ballard's previous work with Alanis was Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which is the last thing from \\"mainstream\\", but his work with Matthews is just that. Why did Dave and his band have to create an album so uninspired and geared towards top 40 radio fans? I was really excited for them to come to my city to play, but that was before this pathetic album hit stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"dave matthews digs deep","review":"I'm a great fan of the DMB and I really enjoyed this cd. All you die-hard DMB fans should just relax and give this recording a chance. The songs are much shorter than in the past, most of them coming in at a radio-friendly four minutes, but the quality of the content is what sets this album apart. I believe Dave has reached into his soul and pulled out some beautiful songs, the kind that aren't possible without some suffering in life. So buy this CD, put it in the stereo and crank it up, and most importantly, enjoy. Thanks DMB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Matthews Everyday doesn't work.","review":"In the world of sellout rock bands that were good like metallica and Pearl Jam, this is the next thing to cram after this awful cd, Poor plot, lowbrow production values and stereotypically boring scenes that might have been rip-off smash mouth than dave, my best advice for dave and the crew to stick to your guns, because this is not a good cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What exactly IS their best work?","review":"This guy is destined to go down in history as one of the most massively popular but worst artists ever (a la Billy Joel). Tailor-made pap for middle-aged, middle-to-upper class (see, we can listen to rock and party, too!) suburbanites. Don yer Dockers and golf shirts, looks like Jimmy Buffet has some competition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"What a disappointment from their previous albums! I saw the 60 Minutes story on Dave Matthews and the show hyped this album as a breakthrough work with their new producer (some know-it-all guy who thought he was improving the band's sound). First off, 60 Minutes was anything but impartial, and they were propping DMB as the greatest thing since the Beatles. And so as a fan and I couldn't wait for this album to come out - and yet from track one I couldn't get into it...I felt as though this band may have been going in the direction of Hootie and the Blowfish if they didn't turn ship soon. I haven't bought one of their albums since...go ahead, prove to me that they're back. Otherwise, they're a come-and-gone sensation like the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"I am as big of a DMB fan as there is and this album was just a total let down.Then, I go to see him in concert last night in Atlanta... even bigger let down. The acustics were horrible. All I could hear were drums and electric guitars. I saw Dave singing on the video, but I'll be darned if I could hear him.Oh well, at least I don't get tired of his earlier stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"New and Good","review":"When Dave Mathews Band came out with their new cd i didn't know how good it was going to be. After listening to it a couple of times I really got into it. I enjoy their cd crash the most but this is a great change for the band. This cd sounds more like Before These Crowded Streets. Overall the cd is a good one and is probably the second best one. What really makes Dave is if the songs sound good live, if that happens then the album will be a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is good,but anything he has put out before is better","review":"I bought this album the day it came out .When I first listened to it I absolutly hated it.But I did not give up on it yet.After a few days I began to like it. In my modest opinion Everyday is the bands worst album, but it is still good.Thats how good they are.As someone else mentioned the Lillywhite sessions are really good. I would recomend either downloading the album or you can go to ebay.com and bid for a copy of The Lillywhite Sessions.I gave this cd 2 star because it does not live up to any of their other studio albums.The song on Everyday are \\"More radio friendly\\". I really hope DMB's next album they choose Steve Lillywhite as their producer .Hope this is of some help to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having My Say","review":"Okay, there are plenty of reviews out there. No one really needs mine. I don't have anything earth shattering to say. Do I like this CD? Yes. A lot? Yes. Do I think it has some flaws? Yes. Are they forgiveable? Yes.As I see, this CD is being disparaged and lauded (well, at least enjoyed) by different factions for one reason: it is listenable. A virtue and a vice. But which is it more?? Depends on you.I like it. You be the one that decides if you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews just can't stop reinventing himself!!","review":"Everything good has already been said about dave matthews in all the other reviews for this album so i don't have to say much other than this is another amazing CD from Dave Matthews. I did miss his acoustic guitar a little but he knows how to use an electric nevertheless. This is just an amazing CD and this was not a let down at all, and for those who say that the music is not as complex as the older material and the drumming or the riffs aren't as inventive your wrong still. The drumming may have been tone down a little but it is still excellent drumming and the guitar riffs on Everyday are still amazing and more complex to play then most stuff on the radio today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"This is hardly the worst CD you could buy, but it isn't as good as some of their earlier works. If you haven't got any of the early CD's by all means get them first, but this should be a welcome addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews Solo?","review":"It seems that people are split into two camps on this one: either you love it or cuss it. I fall into the love it category. \\"Angel\\" is a great love song, \\"The Space Between\\" and \\"I Did It\\" both have great hooks that just stick in your head, and with Santana, how can you go wrong?Frankly, I think this could have been a solo album for Dave Matthews, with him getting some sticks help from Carter Beuford, since Moore and Tinsley are relegated to occasional blasts on a few songs. But, that's not to say this is a bad thing. I for one have tired of artists that always throw out the same sound -- ANY of them, and this includes Dave Matthews. Maybe this should have been a solo album for Matthews, but regardless, a fresh look at life never hurt anybody, and this CD is no different. Turn off what you think DMB should sound like and give this a fair listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down with 4 minutes pithy songs","review":"Dave Matthews Band is far better than what this CD represents.

Who knows Dave, mabey you're reading this. I have been to numerous concerts and this band has always managed to keep the same groovy sound. After purchasing \\"Under the Table...\\", \\"Crash\\", and \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\", I could put in the album and listen to it all the way through. I find myself constantly skipping through songs on \\"Everyday\\". The only 3 songs I would consider listening to again are \\"I Did It\\", \\"The Space Between\\", and \\"Angel\\". There is little (if any acoustic guitar) and no instrumental solos. I would release a live album quick just to overshadow this one. Dave, take my advise and go back to the basics with your next album......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyday sounds very much like everyday music","review":"This album was written half by Dave, and half by Glenn Ballard: THE PRODUCER!

This was awesome because i was at that show. The only live track that isn't from Chicago is \\"I did it\\", i don't know where they got that one.

The story has mythic resonance in spades - mirroring the Hero's Journey in many ways, but not so much that you notice it heavily.What I loved about this tale is that the main character clearly changes throughout the story arc.

I was so disappointed in the slow development of the book that I decided to read a book I bought a long time ago, The Anvil Of Ice by Micheal Scott Rohan. The obvious parallel between Jordan's and Rohan's series is that they both are epic fantasy: a great evil is sweeping the land, and a normal boy-who-becomes-the-hero finds himself thrust in way over his head to save the world. Although the Anvil of Ice is the first in a trilogy, the book has a satisfying ending. It reminds me a bit of Terry Goodkind's series; it ends, but there is more to come, the evil force is still out there, at least a part of it. The Anvil of Ice is fine reading, well written and there are no unnecessary stops as in Jordan's later books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happen Panasonic?","review":"Look I just got this player yesterday I had High expectations for it but sadly this thing sucks.

A must see and a future cult classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much cussing, but very accurate portrayal of car dealers","review":"I have been a car salesman at a One-Price dealer for 11 years, and this DVD is very funny. The accuracy is pretty spot on for big cities in the old days of car selling. We all got a big kick out of some of the ridiculous stuff on here, as most of it is over the top, but some is very true.There is an overuse of the F word, and a ridiculous ending, but overall a fun film for car guys. Some of the events are things that I have actually seen before except maybe being left out in the street with no pants after a test drive and subsequent sexual interlude with a beautiful woman...I wish..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on!!!","review":"This movie is 1000% true to life.

Unfortunately, his ironic \\"I Bought You a Plastic Star For Your Aluminum Tree\\" isn't here--that's on Capitol's \\"Jazz Christmas Party\\". And I'll be damned if I can find \\"Island Christmas\\" or his pensive treatment of Guaraldi's \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\" anywhere but the peer share sites. That's 4--count 'em--songs and this dude still ain't done no Exmass album. Elsewhere on this disc, Lou Rawls and Dianne Reeves does \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" better than the Virtual Cole & Daughter pairing could have in a million time-warped years. All in all, this disc is a really decent Holiday collection when you consider the fact that jazz's improvisational nature can often be at odds with the fact that a Christmas song (even an instrumental) should be played as straight-ahead as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre jazz, mediocre xmas - buy it used","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, the Dianne Reeves/Lou Rawls duet is stupendous, but not worth the price of the whole CD. The rest of the music is dull, easy-listening, \\"mellow\\" and hardly festive. I think I can salvage about 4 cuts off this disc (not Michael Franks, thank you), which would make it worth buying used, copying some cuts, and then donating the CD to the local library.

Unfortunately, that wasn't very often. The first unit I got would just shut off for no reason during recording. I returned it and got another.

This book is more of a fantasy book than a historical book. The plot is lukewarm, the characters are lukewarm. I had to fast forward a few pages every now and then.

I'd assume her core listeners have always been musical fans or soul music lovers of 70s and the adult contemporary songs of 80s, but, being produced by such recognizable names as Kashif and Paul Lawrence Jones III, half the songs from this album were enough to make Melba a mainstay of funky electro funk scene of early-80s.As an appreciator of funk, this one is almost the best collection of Funky Melba Moore (less McFadden & Whitehead-produced \\"Let's Stand Together\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite authors","review":"B.

On the other hand, if you're a writer, this book is very good for finding creative and uncommon names for your characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This book was a total disapointment. Of all the books I've purchased on Amazon this was the first I've ever sent back for a refund. The illustrations are amateurish. The author uses historical events to draw conclusions about the effectiveness or lack thereof of different weapon systems. Only problem is his history is inaccurate thereby rendering his conclusions invalid."},{"rating":"2","title":"This disc is a lot of bang for the buck, Silent or otherwise","review":"With a mixture of E, W & F, Chicago, Fusion Jazz, Soulful Blues and other ingredients this CD does't stop even after the disc is done spinning in the player. You know... the tune that keeps you in the car till it ends and without meaning it, it blends into the next song and well, it's in your head the rest of the day... That kind of good! I discovered this gem looking up another song on iTunes. The 30 second glimpse was all I needed, I downloaded it! Now I wish I knew more about the group. They are polished and the production of the CD is next to flawless. I apologize for my lack of info, but the music speaks volumes. If you like the Blues, well... why are you still reading this...why haven't you bought or (legally) downloaded this wonderful excursion into the Blues.Addendum: www.bluestrain.vispa.com/ will fill in the bios and other info, but go buy this CD, demand they make more.

I was very disappointed with the width of these bandages and would like a full refund!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely voice and great remixing make for a quality single.","review":"My personal favorite mix is the club-length Samba mix, where a riff from Black Box's enduring anthem \\"Strike It Up\\" and some Latin whistles and snare drums spice up the song. The song, which is short on lyrics, doesn't go far enough in showcasing Rozalla's superb vocal abilities, but we fans are just so happy to hear anything new from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtuosity!","review":"What can one say? This is EXCELLENT!! You cannot go wrong with this CD that showcases the sheer brilliance of Jordan's guitar technique and the beauty of his interpretations of standards such as \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", the Beatles' \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", among others, as well as his own \\"Flying Home\\".This is beautiful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This was my first introduction to Stanley Jordan. I am impressed. I am delving more into jazz, and the more I delve, the more I like it. There are more styles of jazz, it seems, than there are of rock and roll. This is a very good album if you are not familiar with S. Jordan. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INFORMATIVE AND ENTERTAINING","review":"This witty, lively and beyond all doubt very well written account of Napoleon Bonaparte has the makings of an exceptional cable documentary or docudrama, since it brings the life, times, ambitions, accomplishments, victories and defeats of this larger-than-life military figure into crystal clear focus. Here's a book I can easily recommend for everyone, ranging from military history buffs to readers in general out for something nice to curl up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napoleon","review":"I have read numerous books on Napoleon, and I feel that this book does the best job of capturing the man. Most authors praise his military genius and spend so much time talking about how and why he is the greatest military comander of all time. But in this book his military life is avoided and instead an author actually tries to figure out why Napoleon did the things he did. Steven looks at Napoleon very rationally and explains why he did the things he did with refrsehing logic. This is a great great book, and deserved to win so many awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad impulse buy.","review":"I bought this on an impulse while purchasing several other singles in to fill in my Pumpkin collection, and I was fairly disappointed with this one. I am a die-hard Pumpkinhead since I first heard 'Today' back in '94, and own pretty much everything they've ever done. They still remain my favorite all-time band. Cherub Rock is an awesome song, and Pissant is good as well. However, I recommend that you buy \\"Siamese Dream\\" for CR and \\"Pisces Iscariot\\" for Pissant. I already had both when I purchased this single, and was simply trying to fill in the 'French Movie Theme' hole. Simply put, FMT isn't a song. It's just some weird music with odd humming-like noises in the background. Just stick with the albums and forget this single. Get the singles with good b-sides instead. I'd highly recommend \\"The Aeroplane Flies High\\" boxed set of the MCIS singles, as well as \\"Pisces Iscariot\\" which is a collection of b-sides from the Gish and Siamese Dream eras."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic alternative anthem from a classic band","review":"From its dramatic opening to its blistering end, Cherub rock never ceases to amaze me. The studio production methods used to create this raw, powerful sound enhances the mood in everyway and the obvious attention to detail makes the song completely flawless. The drumming is incredible and along with the soft melody, crunchy guitars and smooth bass, an absolute classic song has been made coming from a classic album, Siamese Dream. An absolute must for any alternative rocker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Embrace this!","review":"The story of John and Abby and the trials they face in what should be the golden years of their lives was awesome. Ms. Kingsbury did not mince words in writing about the feelings that many of us have when bad things happen to good people. She explores the depths of despair, feelings of anger with God, reconciling tragedy with God's will and ultimately forgiveness. This book is well written and guaranteed to make you think and appreciate all that is well in your life. However, the author always has a message of hope, as well. She has accurately pegged the way things typically happen in our lives - John's livelyhood is threatened, John's feelings of inadequacy in reaching his students, the accident, feelings of helplessness and anger afterwords. Everyone should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Pleasing to God n Unimaginal Faith","review":"John and Abby have a marrige that is so profoundly based on God that I desire it. In this book the author shows what having faith and prays in God can do for you. Amazing book and I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!! Karen Kingsbury is AWESOME!!!!!","review":"Thanks you Amazon for helping me find EVERYTHING from Karen Kingsbury-- Her books are AWESOME!!!!Thank you to Karen Kingsbuty for letting the LORD use you to reach millions!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time to Embrace","review":"I have just recently finished reading a Time to Embrace by Karen Kinsbury. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Kingsbury is an amazing writer.The book touched on subjects about divorce, marriage, abortion, and lots of others. The book was about a couple who had recently reconciled their marriage. Kingsbury makes you really feel as if you know the characters in the book. I laughed and cried as though I was a part of the story. This book really made me stop and think about how we need to have God in EVERY aspect of our lives, not just when we want but ALL the time. I highly recommend this book and any others written by Karen Kingsbury. I have already reserved some of her books from a different series and I plan on reading all the series she has written.This book was provided to me by Book Sneeze in exchange for a review. The review does not need to be a positive or a negative review but an honest one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"I lived in Singapore in 1992 when I first saw this movie with my younger brother. It was very funny, in fact I laughed so hard over this film I had to go back and see it. My brother and I went back and saw the movie the next day, and a couple of days later we saw it again. It has some very funny elements and without betraying the plot I think Leon Schuster did his best work in this film. It was similar in style to the series \\"Gods Must Be Crazy\\" but was very independent. Its main focal point was making fun of the way the United Nations sometimes handles their \\"security details\\", and the movie never takes itself seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipping method not very good","review":"I chose this rating because the book was damaged on corners due to packing method.Book wrapped in thin foam...and plain vanilla envelope...paper envelope tore at one corner crushing the book corner and part ot the spine.I suggest a more padded envelope be used...or use bubble wrap over book.Book started out in very good condition, though. I'm a little sad it's been crushed. Love the reading parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Despite almost lyrical quality of the writing and enormous research done to produce this biography, it is somewhat boring and stilted. I am not getting the feel of the era, everything about Isak falls flat. Was this book a reflection of Isak's true nature? I don't know and I don't care either. Am giving it two stars because the writing is, of course, top quality but it is a lifeless work and echoes nothing from the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Woman Behind \\"Out of Africa\\"","review":"\\"Isak Dinesen\\" is a thorough book on the life of this very interesting, hard-to-understand writer. Judith Thurman took on quite a helfy task in writing about this author. Dinesen's life was not easy, specifically because she didn't choose to make it so. She seemed to be after one thing in life ....pleasure, in its many forms. Her choices in men only led to heartache...Bror Blixen and Denys Finch Hatton...both strong, independent men held her love but this adoration was never returned to her. When Karen Blixen(another name she uses) is happy she is soaring. When she is sad, she plummets to the depths of darkness. There seems to be no middle ground for Karen. The author of this tale shows you all sides of Karen Blixen and leaves you to your own conclusions. Interesting story of a real person who really lived life to the heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, scholarly and dense for the casual Dinesen fan","review":"I bought this because I love the movie \\"Out of Africa\\" and wanted to learn more about this fascinating woman. Ms. Thurman has obviously done years of research. But I am just not interested in this level of detail and minutia about EVERY single member of Dinesen's family, every acquaintance, every meal she ate and dress she wore. I skimmed the first 100 pages or so to get to her marriage to Bror and the move to Africa. Then I found myself still skimming because there was nothing of interest that I didn't already know from the movie. Finally gave up about halfway through. Maybe it was just the wrong book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to go to CD-ROM","review":"Big, fat, slow volumes--very costly. Scholars would prefer CD-ROMs. Thanks for listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful ideas!","review":"500 pages of cabinet designes in line drawing format! If you get one idea from this book it is worth the price, and believe me, there are many ideas you can use. I have been designing cabinets for a year now and this book has added to my ability to generate good designs for my clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost meaningless","review":"This book seemed meaningless to me. As others have noted, it is basically a very long sequence of rather poor line drawings and very little else. Very few low quality pictures are included; that is a pity because they could help provide some inspiration or guide your design. And fairly little know-how information is provided for do-it-yourself folks - the author recommends using professional installers. For most people, cabinet manufacturer websites and/or a visit to your local Home Depot or Lowe's kitchen design center will be much more useful than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of plans, not very useful","review":"This book has lots of plans, developed in CAD. Plans are in black and white. Having color pictures of finished installations as well would make it more useful. 99% of the book will never be used, and for the 5% that may be used, the usefulness is limited since it is dependent on the size of the area you're working with and where you can get the cabinets. It is just as easy to email a picture of the area you're working with to a cabinet designer and have them come up with ideas. I wouldn't recommend spending the money on it - it is easy enough to do the planning on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more photographs and instructions","review":"This book contains almost no photographs of finished projects. There are hardly any diagrams of the intermediate steps, and the instructions are minimalistic at best. This book assumes a reasonable knowledge of cabinet installation techniques; however, persons who possess such skills would largely find this book unnecessary. What you do get in this book is lots of line drawings of how to stack and arrange cabinets in different configurations, but these drawings are much like the ones you can get through the design services that are provided by Lowe's, Home Depot, and other major home supply stores.A better choice would be \\"Built-In Furniture: A Gallery of Design Ideas\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Seduction","review":"With each book written Suzanne Enoch gets better and better. Everyone of her books is a delight to read. An Invitation to Sin is definitely one of her best. Never has seduction been written so masterfully, as each page is one to savor. The reader feels bereft when the book is over. Ah, but not for long, as this is a series and another will soon follow. Lord Zachary Griffin has got to be one of the sexiest men alive and Caroline Witfield is his perfect mate, a beautiful, but strong woman. No flighty characters here, other than the crazy relatives, which makes the lighter scenes so much fun. The combination of art and seduction is volcanic. I do not think I will ever look at paints again without thinking of that blazing love scene in Lord Griffin's parlor. A definite 9 out of 10 on the sensual scale. A definite keeper and one to read over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak leading characters and story","review":"I have read this author before, but this book was disappointing. Both leading characters are weak and selfish, including Caroline's family members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations!","review":"I purchased this book excited to be reading one of my favorite authors only to be sadly dissapointed. This is the second book of Suzanne's I did not care for. I was also dissapointed by \\"Sin and Sensability\\" This plot moved very slow and the herione's family was obnoxious. The point of the story was to show a herione who was independent and career minded yet her sisters were obsessed with trapping and marrying a man. I found their involvement as well as other secondary characters in the story boring and exhausting. The few times the main characters were allowed to be alone, the story would get interesting. Alas, this was to little and to late in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd book of the Griffin Series","review":"This novel is the story of Zachary the youngest brother of the Griffin family. He finds himself at a house full of six unmarried daughters all trying to find themselves a husband - all but one! Caroline just wants to paint his portrait and leave the country side to study art. This historical novel has some wonderful funny moments and great love scenes. I can't for the next novel on the Griffin family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Romance","review":"I thought that this was a well developed story. I liked how the characters and their family's interacted. There was a nice amount of balance with the romance and the surrounding characters, who added instead of distracting from the story. Here's a guy who can't commit and girl that can in life. They teach each other about what they are missing in life. I liked both characters and how they grew through knowing each other. Both characters were realistic and I could see how they each grew to love each other. The angst was there for both characters and each had to figure things out for themselves. I enjoyed this a lot. I also saw a future story hinted at and hope it comes to pass, as I see that as being an enjoyable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!","review":"The behaviour and language was not appropriate to the period in which the story was written. (The hero kept saying \\"No worries\\" Argh!) I often can overlook this if the story is compelling but in this case I had to force myself to finish the book. I so enjoyed this author's trilogy ending in England's Perfect Hero that I added her to my auto-buy list. After her last two novels, she's off that list. I hope her next book will be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Simply AWFUL.Bad acting, bad story.

A friend recommended it to me. I do like some of the other Punk/Emo groups. The Getup Kids, Alkaline Trio, Knapsack, Jimmy Eat World are just some of the few, these are the best in the industry, but not this. They just can't sing. They seem to be screeming all the time. I'd give it a one but I'm not a mean guy. No one song seems to jump out at me. After a few listens I still have no idea of what the lyrics are.

This time it refused to burn-most of the time-and when it did the disks came out hotter than fresh asphalt and wouldn't finalize. The repair guys tell me it is taking so long because they cannot get the necessary part(s) from Panasonic.I've complained to Panasonic via their website. Twice. They reply with a canned (read meaningless) reply within a couple of weeks. They don't seem to be terribly interested.My advice: consider another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic DMR-E60 @ Bytesector.com","review":"Panasonic has been great at designing and applying aesthetic principles and creating user satisfaction over the past decade. When it comes to their DVD recorders, these qualities are not forgotten. From the DMR-E series recorders, we will be looking at the DMR-E60 model from Panasonic. The E60 is packed with features; it is an mp3 player, DVD-RAM player/recorder, and picture viewer plus a still capture device, and much more.

I love the charm (s) however was slightly disapointed that the seperating of the 3 left some really sharp spots that we needed to file to avoid injury. I wonder if the gold ones would have been so sharp upon seperation. Anyway, all worked well and the girls were thrilled. They are very dainty and pretty, I think all in all the quality is nice as well. I also would have liked to see the rings that hold the charms on a chain sodered.

I agreed with the reviewer who stated that it lacked the \\"Wow\\" factor of Robbie's past efforts. But I think after a few more listens, it becomes really easy to listen to from the first track to the last. \\"Ghosts,\\" \\"Tripping,\\" \\"Make Me Pure,\\" and \\"Advertising Space\\" are all great songs that I'm sure will be huge in Europe. Unfortunately (for his record company), I still don't see this being a huge hit in the US.

I bought this CD, listened to it once . . . and waited for a catchy beat, lyrical wit, or melodic cohesion. It never happened.The rhythms sound like they came from a beat box, the band that played \\"How Bizarre\\" wrote better lyrics, and the melodies sound like notes were thrown down the stairs and placed in the songs in whatever random order they were picked up.Buy 'Escapology' or 'Greatest Hits' instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done Robbie!","review":"If you haven't heard Robbie before, this album is perhaps going to disappoint you. However if you are already a fan of Robbie and know everything about his ups and downs in his music career, you'll love it.This man has so many faces; he now comes up with an album which is kind of an experience of sorts. It is a sort of travel from evil to divine. Needless to say Robbie sounds a bit philosophical and has certainly matured not just as a singer but also as a songwriter. His association with Duffy has certainly worked wonders for him and may be this album will be the turning point of his once glorious career.As far as the songs are concerned, they are good and really good. While some songs could have been a bit more \\"decent\\" (in all senses of the word), I guess fans won't complain, coz this man's ultimately the \\"greatest entertainer\\"!Most certainly a must have for all Robbie fans. You must experience the reserruction this man is undergoing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun album!","review":"I picked this up last week and have listened to it on a daily basis.

He rips off every other pop and rock sound and, with Stephen Duffy, transforms it into intoxicating pop songs. He knows where his bread is buttered, but sometimes goes too far to ensure devotion. Straight women and gay men love Robbie, but he sometimes tries too hard for their vote. Each album has a requisite maudlin grandma song and gay romp, and they fail every time. Robbie does his best when he just crafts a tasty pop song. His lyrics either make you feel like he's writing just for you--or for himself. He's a much better rocker than he admits, and frequently his rocking tracks (like A Place to Crash) that he's tossed off are better than his carefully constructed dance tunes. Ultimately, Robbie won't ever be famous in the U.S. because he's too good. --A US fan since 1999"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are people raving about this?","review":"Robbie Williams was a promising talent when he first emerged as a solo performer, but this collection of bland, cookie-cutter sappy ballads is indicative of the self-indulgent posturing that has capsized many a musical career. Every song sounds the same and not one has a hit-worthy hook. I see that I'm in the minority here, but it's rather unfortunate that the current state of music is such that this slab of disappointment is lauded as being some kind of masterpiece. Something has to change."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see faults in this","review":"Seriously, this is Robbie going backwards, thinking he is the who.

Sadly there is nothing original here, just another mish-mash of pop tunes that could have been done by any X Factor wannabee. In fact it may be fair to say that Mr Williams has done very little since 'Let Me Entertain You' and perhaps now might be the time to call it a day, especially as he's struggling to get anyone in the U.S. to notice him! He obviously has talent but why he insists on releasing formulaic albums such as this one is beyond me.

Amazing songs!","review":"Doug Teti on vocals is the best of the best. A top notch crooner. A velvety, and yet Rock N' Roll kind of voice, with amazing vibrato.! The songs are superb.

They've been all too often compared to the Doors. Tunes I liked best were \\"Someplace To Hide\\", \\"Sometime You've Got To Be Strong\\", title track \\"Movin' On\\" {good psych guitar} and the awesome \\"Can't Be Without Her\\" (employing some rather heavy soul vocals). Personnel: Doug Teti - vocals, Jim Shugarts & Lenny Perchowski - guitars, Ken Carson - bass and Mike Petrylak - drums. Might do something good for (I'm second guessing here) fans of - say H.P.

Aren't executives the high and mighty of the corporate structure, the exalted to whom lesser souls look for guidance? Well, yes, maybe. But they're also human and this is where Alan Downs gets into fresh territory. Fear, he says, isn't something to be embarrassed about (it sounds downright \\"uncorporate\\", doesn't it?), but something to deal with. And once the fear, whatever it might be, is dealt with, the executive is suddenly freed of nagging concerns that have actually held him back in the past.

He offers worthwhile advice to others as he explains his history and accomplishments as a filmmaker. Both young professionals and veterans in the media industry will be able to relate to Mr. Hoffman's struggles and achievements since he talks about them on such a personal level.I was engaged throughout most of the film, especially when Mr. Hoffman took the camera crew into a room where he keeps his personal belongings that survived a fire.

Well Aurora Borealis sure pulled out and did it. The amazing opener \\"Triumph Again\\" kinda starts out like \\"Thrice Told\\"(from Northern Lights) with it's light speed riffing and beats. The 2nd track \\"Sky Burial\\" is my personal favorite. During the chorus plays one of the best riffs I have ever heard. This whole cd is a concept album inspired by lots of history, and the song \\"Berserker\\" inspired the cover art. Included are also 2 bonus tracks (remade on the first cd Mansions of Eternity) by Ron's old band Lestregus Nosferatus. All in all, this album completely shreds with his own original mix of death metal, history inspired lyrics, and black metalic vocals.Totally amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a breast cancer survivor diagnosed at the age of 32, I expected this book to be stories bases on women who were diagnosed at an earlier age based on the cover photo. Most of these women are in their 50's and if I had of read this book while I was actually going through treatment I would have been scared to death. Some of these women just had some bizarre things to happen to them during treatment that I would think are not typical. It made me realize how fortunate I was that everything went well for me during treatment. Also, the majority of the women were diagnosed with Ductal carcinoma, not a one of them had lobular carcinoma. So I agree with another reviewer there wasn't much diversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some cancers disappear untreated, study finds","review":"There are many people who cure (themselves) from cancer (and other diseases, for that matter). A few things they all seem to have in common:They take responsibility for their health/sickness away from doctors or anyone else.They get rid of negative feelings (like anger, grudge, helplessness and, most of all, by doing this, FEAR). In other words, they CHANGE their lifestyle (most of the time they also take control of what they eat - which is where this book comes in handy).But most important (togheter with finding peace of mind):They give their body TIME TO HEAL ITSELF![...]Hope this will be of help for a few people."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is terrible","review":"Reviews must be twenty words long, so I'll see how many other ways I can say that this is a really, really bad movie.

I picked it off the shelf thinking it would be just another dull chronology - but when I examined its layout, I just had to have it. It consists of three sections: a detailed and highly readable 300-page history of the Arab world; a set of brief chapters on each Arab country; and a final short section on how the Arabs are viewed by both themselves and Westerners.The ability to pick a single country to read about individually is the aspect of the book that most stands out for me: I was really interested in reading about just five or six Arab countries, and I wasn't about to buy a book on each of them.

I'm actually kind of impressed that they captured the essence of garbage so well that I kind of want to raid the cats litter box to get the taste out of my mouth.I did do my research before I purchased this product. I looked here as well as many other websites, and saw mostly favorable reviews for this.

Clearly, it is brilliantly researched, extremely well written and a really enjoyable book to read. Anyone looking for an entry into ancient history would be well served reading this book. Mr. Everitt does spend an inordinate time on Octavian, Augustus' name before he became emperor, however the book remains a comprehensive source of information not only on the life of this truly unparalleled Roman leader, but the Julio-Claudian family overall. The family lineage, which is a difficult feat for anyone to successfully describe, is very well laid out and clearly organized in both text and helpful chart inserts.I had read Everitt's earlier work on Cicero and was immediately hooked on his writing style. Fans of the aforementioned book will not be disappointed with his follow up, \`Augustus'. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Lite -","review":"The author's style is a bit too casual - perhaps appeals to some but not to me. Apparently, it's important to be edgy today. The book is less like reading history and more like reading a gossipy, tell-all.Also, the author's bias permeates the book - you never have to guess which historical character he likes or dislikes. Everitt blithely impugn Caesar's (and Anthony's) sexuality, based on no real historical evidence, but it does add a salacious element.Everitt does manage to convey a good amount of information, but it is too bad that Adrian Goldsworthy hadn't written a book on Augustus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating View With Sketchy Sources","review":"Anthony Everitt brings a judicious sense to the weighing of the sketchy sources that are inevitable in a biography of Augustus. Everitt also gives perspective, as in his observation that neither Augustus nor his privileged colleagues were aware of the most important event of his long reign as emperor: the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. The psychology of the ancient Romans is fascinating. Especially for a Christian, it is fascinating to see what was the mentality of the most successful and powerful at the time of Christ's birth and to contrast that mentality with the radically different ways of the Nazarene. Contrast is a great teacher. Many times we learn much from those we do not wish to imitate at all and who, in fact, repel us. Wisdom has many teachers. History is one of them, and Mr. Everitt has helped to transmit that wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, Easy to Understand Biography","review":"As a student, I only knew the basics of Roman history. Something about this book attracted me. This is an extremely well written, easy to understand history lesson on both Caesar Augustus as well as the Roman Empire. Everitt makes sure to explain every Roman or Latin term he uses. He covers all events througout Augustus' life that I never knew. After reading this book, I feel that I am significantly more knowledgable regarding the pinnacle of the Roman empire. Augustus entertains as well as informs. Highly reccommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chapter missing","review":"The introduction and 1/2 of the 1st chapter is missing, unreal. Where is is the quality control??? It will be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly entertaining book on a fascinating character","review":"This book is a great read that provides significant background to the times and events of history, while focusing on the life of Augustus. You really get into the life of Octavian/Augustus and the people and events surrounding his life. They are all carefully brought to life along with the personal and political idiosyncrasies that drive their actions. While historical biographies can sometimes be heavy reading, this book is easy to get through with plenty of historical fact and avoids getting too serious with detailed references. It is a much better read on the downfall of the Republic than Rubicon (although more limited in time). I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read, Learned Many Things","review":"I lived in Rome for 5 years and only ever obtained an outline sketch of this period of Roman history. This book did a wonderful job filling in the gaps for me, in a most entertaining way. I am presently reading the author's book on Hadrian and finding it equally enjoyable. A lot more time is spent explaining how Augustus achieved his power and built his system, which may get a bit deep in the weeds for some, but I appreciated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem with Kindle edition","review":"This is a pretty good book for those interested in Roman history or Caesar Augustus himself. Everitt is not as compelling as Freeman when it comes to ancient biography though.I checked the physical copy out from the library and discovered that the Kindle edition is missing the first paragraph of every single chapter. Very strange quirk and pretty disconcerting. Hopefully, Amazon can fix this issue soon. 3/29/12"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paragraphs missing","review":"I bought the e-book version of this biography and whilst the book was interesting enough - entertaining in fact - it drove me crazy that there were paragraphs missing at the beginning of every chapter; suddenly the text made no sense! I was so annoyed I returned it to Amazon - no hassle! - but I'd rather have the complete version..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever reconstruction of an important life","review":"Anthony Everitt pieces together a plausible and well-presented biography of Augustus Caesar, using multiple classical sources and some intelligent deduction of his own. Beyond the very interesting account of Augustus' life, the book provides a fascinating look at the political and social structure of First Century Rome as well as a well-documented examination of everyday life of the period. Everitt attacks a lot of old gossip about the perfidities and viciousness of Livia, Augustus' second wife. This makes the biography a lot less juicy and satisfying than Robert Graves' ficitional account of the period, \\"I Claudius,\\" but there's plenty of treachery and drama in this \\"non-ficitional\\" account too. A good read--especially if you're looking forward to the second season of HBO's \\"Rome,\\" which will be covering a lot of the same ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picturesque Sonoma Valley has a unique history","review":"Sonoma Valley has a unique history and this book captures it all!

Solid, funky, and beautifully crafted, the influence of these tracks on modern techno is undeniable. Launching the minimal/tribal sound thats still going strong today, they continue to act as a reference point for producers like Sims, Beyer, Mac etc.If you have turntables, then seek out the vinyl releases. There's nothing better then dimming the lights, cranking up the volume, and rinsing a bit of purpose maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"He went too far","review":"Michael Crichton again writes cautionary tale about Tech (Nano-bots instead of Dinos this time) pushed too far. Predictably it lashes out and must be thwarted by the protagonist. He is writing same old plotline with the same stock cardboard characters. Still he places just enough background and science information to make it passable until the last half of the book. Then he jumps over the line of willing suspension of disbelief and is then relegated to silliness. This same book written with a more subtle hand could have been chilling. He makes nano-bots into a large visible menace. My only thought is he was trying to write the book to be a movie. It might be a great visual but it ruined the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping!!","review":"\\"Prey\\" by Michael Crichton is a riveting story of survival for the characters. It also sheds light into the world of nanotechnology, which is unfamilar to much of the public and how it's qualities are becoming more like pandora's box. Once you pick this book up it is difficult to put it down. Each time I read this I feel like I'm reading it for the first time. If the right movie director got a hold of this, it would be a fascinating movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Quickly Assembled","review":"As usual, Michael Crichton begins with the most fascinating science and ethical questions of our time, and a great idea for story, and churns out a book in poorly written prose. The characters are two dimensional at best, there are some inconsistencies within the plot, and the rhetorical cliches could only be perfect for, you guest it, a B movie script. Once a gain, a brilliant idea degenerates into scenes better suited for action movies than educated readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"This book is wonderful. It keeps on the edge of your seat. You never want to put it down. It usually takes me a while to read a book, being as busy as I am. But not this one.

Don't waste your money on this best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Crichton has written many super books, but this is not one of them It's downright stupid. Hey, if those nano critters couldn't deal with a stiff breeze, why didn't those high tech folks just put together some battery powered fans. Every time someone dies, it's just ho-hum. I liked the first part when we get to share housework and shopping with our hero. Really exciting and takes up about 25% of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nano Thrills","review":"The story was pacy and it was thrilling in parts. However, it became very predictable and I could easily stay a step ahead of the story without even trying much. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROBOT DANCE","review":"You may turn the pages, but you will not care about either the robotlike heroine or hero in this mechanical dance of a novel. The hero, if you can call him that, is more concerned with the price of diapers and feeding the baby than he is that his wife has become a stranger who slaps the baby.When the story finally progresses from shopping and changing diapers to fighting the little monsters, the plot loses all originality and becomes a cut and paste from other books and film. Sad.That this is what passes for popular bestselling fiction is a good reason not to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable Science","review":"A really good novel illustrating the potential danger of nanotechnology would be a welcome addition. Prey is not that novel.Here's the plot: Somewhere in the Nevada desert, a hi-tech corporation has been experimenting with nanotechnology swarms. Of course, the little critters get loose and begin evolving into fierce predators. Jack Foreman, an expert in designing computer programs that mimic the behavior of swarming animals, is called in to deal with the swarm. Jack's wife is a Vice-President at the firm, but she hasn't clued Jack into the big picture.I won't give it away, but the swarm evolves so rapidly - and unbelievably - it's difficult to sustain belief in the storyline. Actually, it's impossible. Adding to the disappointment are B-movie characters that blur into the background, their tracks sinking out of sight in the sand of a sluggish plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Crap","review":"Well, maybe not crap, but its nothing spectacular, either. Once again Michael Crichton brings to life a story that he once could have written so much better. Little tiny robots have been invented, and theyre smart. And they can learn. And adapt. And...do things that youd only expect in a horrible John Saul book. For the last 50 pages I kept expecting the alien's spaceship to come out of the clouds and end it all. Not that this book was about aliens (at all), but it had that crappy sci-fi feel to it.I've no doubt that nanotechnology could become dangerous if used carelessly, but the scenarios Crichton imagines border on the ridiculous. This is the kind of book you buy at an airport, and when youre finished you leave it on the plane so the next person can have it. In some cases people do this to share a good book with a perfect stranger; in this case youre doing it 'cause its just not worth carrying around. 'Prey' will pass the time, no more, no less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have always enjoyed Michael Crichton's work but this was a complete disapointment. The book reads like a B Zombie movie. It follows an obvious plot line (heroes trapped in isolated outpost and faced with horrible monsters) and doesn't even try to hide this fact. It creates the situation using comepletly unbelievable circumstances. The story was predictable, the character's shallow and the science forced. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read but a little far-fetched","review":"I found the book enjoyable to read in just one sitting. The story moves pretty fast. The background information on nanotechnology is very well presented and easy to understand.However, i found certain elements of the story really far-fetched. Don't worry, i won't include spoilers.I just can't imagine that there are only a handful of programmers in charge of the fab production. This fab seems to have sprung out of nowhere with little evidence of a ramp-up in technology. It's like they've managed to produce high speed laptops while the rest of the industry is still struggling to get a working abacus.Not to mention they don't wear bunny suits in their cleanroom. If they're situated in the desert you'd think at least they'd wear protective boots so they don't get sand all over the floor. I can't imagine the air shower getting all that off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, but too predictable","review":"Michael Crichton is one of the best popular writers today. I don't think that's debatable. That fact makes Prey all the more disappointing. In it, Crichton relies too heavily on his page-turning style of writing (similar to Harlan Coben) and abandons what made him a must-read - a plot people believe. Maybe he's a victim of his success. Regardless, the characters here are shallow and undeveloped and the \\"horrifying\\" nanobots are really more of a joke than a threat. Anyone could predict the end if they're paying attention in the first couple of chapters. Unfortunately, you have to read 350 or so pages to confirm that assumption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tecno-thriller","review":"Crichton is the master of showing us the dire consequences of man playing God. This book is a thrilling ride, and superbly gives us a glimpse of some of the possible dangers of both nano-technology, and computers that can think and learn for themselves. This book is fast-paced, exciting, and seems ready-made for conversion to the silver screen. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see this one become a movie, or at least a cheasy television mini-series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Believable Story","review":"I have enjoyed quite a number of Michael Crichton's books (such as Jurassic Park, The Lost World, and Timeline) and I have to say that Prey is one of the worst that he has written. Jurassic Park/The Lost World is based on the history of dinosaur and in a way, it is a believable science fiction. Timeline is based on Quantum Machanic and he has done quite a good job in making it as believable as possible. Being an avid science reader myself, I find that his interpretation of Nanotechnology lacking in many ways. The story is full of flaws and at times, I really wonder why hasn't the author done more research on the subject matter before taking on the challenge (He has spent many years in preparation of the Timeline story according to him).Nevertheless, if you look not too deep into the details of Nanotechnology, it is quite an engaging storyline. Hence, the 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable a good read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I picked it up and could not put it down. the technological aspect reminds me a lot of the andromeda strain, but in the new millenium"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another \\"Body Snatchers\\"","review":"Once again, Michael Crichton demonstrates his talent for squeezing the most amount of words into the least amount of sense. This really is little more than another \\"Body Snatchers\\" tale, interspersed with Luddite warnings of the imminent dangers of technology, which are in turn brought to life with the kind of plodding descriptions that show you that the only thing he actually understood properly was the use of copy and paste in his word processor. Kind of embarrassing at times, even. He's got scenes about from inside an ER that show such astonishing ignorance of a field he really was never in. A painful read in those places, particularly. But then, a lot of his stuff is. If you know anything at all about the subjects of his books, you almost always seem to understand them better than he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"A once-enjoyable writer now produces self-parodies","review":"Crichton's downhill slide as a writer, it could be argued, dates from the sequel to Jurassic Park. That dreadful book was obviously intended as a basis for a screenplay. Since then, Crichton seems to have been going through the motions. In \\"Prey\\" we're given unformed characters, an absurd plot, and -- most disappointing of all for a Crichton fan -- boring science. Is the writer getting old, or does he care only about the money? My impression is neither: He just seems bored. And so will you be, if you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this book","review":"This is the worst Crichton book I've read. I'm a big fan of his books normally, but this one really sucked. Buy sphere if you haven't read it...that's a good book. Timeline wasn't bad either..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, dopey execution","review":"The story starts out with a lot of promise, which is why it's so disappointing when you get to the preposterously dopey ending. I won't give too much away, but the ending is like something out of a 1930's B-movie. There are so many ways this could have been done that would have been infinitely more plausible (for example, see Richard Morgan's handling of similar issues in a subplot of Broken Angels). I was literally angry as I got to end of the book because it was such a letdown--I was listening to the audiobook version in the car and was actually shouting at the CD player as the ending unfolded.Hard to believe this is from the same author that gave us The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Unless you're *really* good at suspending disbelief, avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't turn this into a movie... Please","review":"This was a great story.

Great book, I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I had only...","review":"\\"Vancouver is lovely. There is no other word for it.

In this case he uses nanotechnology as the \\"fearful antagonist\\" but he is not technically accurate, or even complete when describing his own pretend version of the technology. The scariest thing about Prey is not the plot (highly predictable) but rather that his portrayal might actually influence people into believing that this is the real nanotechnology of the future, and it is not. The nanotechnology of the future will have amazing benefits, cures for cancer, solutions for environmental issues and food for all (try a Google search). And while any emerging technology has it's cautionary side (remember when human jobs were predicted to be replaced with computers by 1985?).

By about page nine or so it will start to get under your skin and itch (bad pun intended), and you won't be able to put it down until you finish it.Crichton has really put it all together here, a tight well worked plot, a really terrifying threat, and just the right touch of erotically served up evil to really give you the creeps. The Thomas Dolby song \\"She Blinded Me With Science\\" will make the perfect opening score for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awesomely Bad Movie in the Making","review":"A decent opening and some good basic science are extrapolated into the most ludicrous B movie garbage that would insult the intelligence of an 'Independance Day' fan. Lack of attention to basic plotting too, for example the hero is forty years old and attended university in the late 70's yet the book is set in 2009, go figure.Crichtons unique style makes it readable, but can't stop it insulting the intelligence, no doubt the basic issues need to be raised though."},{"rating":"1","title":"New concept but misses the mark","review":"This book has the trademark twists and turns you expect from Crichton but I was not impressed. He could have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing--A Good and Thought-Provoking Read","review":"Perhaps not Crichton's best book ever, but a solidly gripping tale that will hold your interest. Good suspense. The characters aren't overly interesting, but they get the job done. One of the important things Crichton does with this piece is open the dialogue on the ethics associated with micro-, molecular-, and nano-scale cyber organisms. As he points out in this story, we always think we know what we're doing when, often, we really haven't come close to grasping the ramifications of our actions. Good food for thought and discussion. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes you second guess everything you know TODAY about technology","review":"Crichton does a fabulous job of portraying how our human ignorance can lead us down a path of no turning back. How much do we really know about how computer technology works? What explains the strange anomolies that appear in computer code? \\"Prey\\" shows us just one hypothetical example of what could happen. It also makes you wonder how long before science fiction turns into science."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was so-so","review":"Like other reviewers, I think his vision of an army of rapidly evolving nano-robots is unique and rather frightening if it came to pass. The book starts out strong and draws in the reader. However, much of the book's buildup read like the Andromeda Strain and the conclusions at the end were over the top and ultimately not believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try, No Cigar","review":"The only other book of Michael Crichton's I have read is \\"Timeline\\". Okay but rather trite and predictable. This new one looked intriguing so I bought it before I caught a flight. It starts out very well and the tension builds quite well. Unfortunately, once in Nevada and the \\"swarms\\" start, it goes downhill. The suspense just isn't there. Page after page of \\"explanation\\" and shallow characters and the \\"F\\" word every third sentence, made me leave this book on the plane for someone else to use as a sleep-aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, simply horrible","review":"This book is, sadly, one of the poorer scifi stories I've ever read. From cover to cover, it is filled with inane, trite convoluted plots and annoying unrealistic characters that take us on a whirlwind trip to nowheresville.Some less discriminating readers may enjoy this type of airport drivle, but I was rather tunred off by it. Anyone with a desire for any type of realism in a novel would be forced to ask several discriminating questions about the story. Why do these supposedly brilliant scientists act like territorial adolescents? Why are there only 5 workers in a billion-dollar nano-manufacturing plant? Why is the first hundred pages dedicated solely to the main characters 30-something midlife problems? Why do books like this always turn into zombie stories?If you want to waste 5 bucks on a laugh, by all mean buy this book. Then destroy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best...","review":"This book is one of the best of Michael Chrichton's reads. I would suggest this book to anybody who like's science fiction and a what if book, for which wakes the reader to the possible danger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"loved it. Couldn't put it down. He ties the whole book together so thrilling and exciting. Look forward to his nect book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing concept, but executed like a horror flick","review":"Exciting and suspenseful. Too bad it turned into a horror flick with the grossness of the dead bodies. That part when the hero got his foot stuck in the chest of his teammate was especially hokey.The entire hive felt like it was out of a alien-like horror movie. I was kind of frustrated that it took them so long to figure out that the virus could defeat the e. coli assemblers. The plot dragged on and on as they tried to fight it with conventional weapons, blowing up things, etc. I had already figured out that Julia was colonized by the particles. I also don't like the loose end about the cause of the accident. Perhaps the real Julia wanted out, but the particle man caused her to crash.A bit slow at the beginning, but picked up after the rabbit died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a movie - a really bad one","review":"Given several hot new techs to play with, Crichton mangles his ambitious introduction to the promise and perils of each. Long-winded, particularly at the beginning (easily half the book is consumed by character development that eventually goes nowhere), even still somehow the setup is left half-baked by the time an attempt to patch plot-holes appears at the end. Scenes stolen from \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" and \\"Aliens\\" appear without the benefit of Racquel Welch or Sigourney Weaver. I agree with another reviewer - this book reads more like Koontz than Crichton (that claim not intended to impugn the former!). What a disappointment - would be rated a three, but docked a point since it comes from a master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of Crichton Novels","review":"Found this Hardcover version on bargain section of Borders in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, grabbed it without a second thought, brought it to the hotel and started reading the first few pages...Forget about Jurassic Park, Congo, etc. This novel starts extremely slow, and it continued to be very slow for a very long time.Though the nanotechnology issue is intriguing with Crichton's usual finese in researched information back up, it cannot salvage from this sinking Titanic plot. There are a few sections which are interestingly written, but mostly mundane and boring. I have fallen asleep many times reading just a chapter from this novel. I always pace myself to finish reading a book to the very end, since I am not to judge it until it is totally depleted. Well, this novel is not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better when it was called Jurrasic Park","review":"In Prey Michael Crichton rehashes the story of Jurassic Park, except this time instead of dinosaurs you have a swarm of killer nano-bots and instead of an island it takes place in the desert. The book reads like the screenplay he is sure to develop from it and quite frankly he should have just skipped the whole writing a book and gone straight to Hollywood.It's a fast read and an ok story, but wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prey, the unabridged audio","review":"I have always been and will continue to be a fan of Michael Crichton but \\"Prey\\" was a disappoinment. Since publishing \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" the author has written several screenplays in the guise of novels in which technology runs amuck. This novel follows the same theme but is tiresome. \\"Harry Potter\\" is more fun and for that matter more believable under the circumstances. The audio book was poorly narrated--at first I thought the bateries in my machine needed changing so I changed them but the narration remained slow. Also, the narrator continuously pronounced Nevada the irritating way Nevadans resent. For those interested in the audio version, don't waste your money on the unabridged version--buy the abridged for a quicker and less tedious \\"read.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, but....","review":"The concept for this book, especially in the hands of Crichton has huge potential. Unfortunately, it falls short of the very bar that Crichton, himself, set. The novel is obviously very well researched and there is an extensive bibliography at the end. I only wish Crichton had spent similar effort on the plot and the characters. The plot is fairly linear and predictable and the characters are mostly shallow and stilted. This is one of those rare cases where I wish the editor had indulged the author a bit more to allow him to render a richer environment and a deeper plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton going downhill fast.","review":"(a few spoilers here) This book is not a true exploration of Nano-technology and it's possibilities. It is a science-fiction mind-number in which the villian (the ferocious little nano-bots) have no limits. One second they are starting to recognize shapes, the next they eat a few memory-chips and start controlling human minds. Is this believable?And as if this lame plot were not enough, the story is chalk-full of flat characters acting entirely obvious. The prose is weak, the dialog is worse. I officially give up on Crichton, Airframe was bad, Timeline was dreadful, and Prey was nearly unreadable.So my advice in a nutshell: if you loved Jurassic Park, you will STILL hate this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Mediocre","review":"I only purchased it because I was in downtown Phoenix for a conference and couldn't find a real book store within walking distance. I was stuck with the hotel's W.H. Smith and the NY Times bestseller list (blech.)This book is a fast, pleasant read. The early portions were quite promising, evoking a feeling of creeping doom. I also liked the sprinkles of social commentary, particularly the discrimination fathers face in custody proceeedings.However, the plot quickly became utterly -- and I mean utterly -- predictable. The only suspense left for me was seeing just how long it would take the main character to figure out what I had figured out, and details of the resolution. The last portions degenerate to a long \\"beat the unstoppable monster\\" sequence.Might make a good movie on the Sci-Fi channel.Save your money. Or, use it to buy Charles Pellegrino's \\"Dust\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must have it, find it at a yard sale.","review":"This is a good story idea poorly written. At times, I was convinced that Crichton's twelve-year-old (if he has a 12-yr-old) wrote it. It was just that bad. The dialogue is often comical and should be embarrassing for a writer of Crichton's credentials. Crichton's insistence on using sentence fragments masquerading as complete thoughts was annoying. Literary license is one thing if it adds to the story. But sloppy sentence structure that leads you off in the wrong direction, or leaves you wondering what is being said, is inexcusable. If this story makes it to the big screen, it will need a major rewrite, hopefully by someone other than Michael Crichton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prey","review":"PreyPrey is an excellent book to read. This book contains many characteristics that a book needs. It is action pact, has some romance, mystery, and even a little bit of comedy. It starts out as a guy with a working wife and they have 3 children. The tension starts to build up as one of them gets sick. The father (Jack) is very loving toward his family. Bad things start happening one after the other; he finally gets a job offer and then moves over to a desert in a facility where something is terribly wrong. This fast pace book will be quick, because it is very easy to get hooked on reading it. This book will be one of the best books you have ever read, and I'd say it is more of an advanced book to read. It is a great book and the awards bestowed upon it and Crichton proves my statement true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"A fast moving and exciting story about the dangers of technology. I really couldn't read it fast enough. The characters were 'real' and the plot had just the right amount of technology (not being a technical kind of girl)However...if you are a technophobe then stay well clear...the plot will terrify you!! :-o"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Maybe the worst book I've ever read. One dimensional characters and dialogue so bad it's like nails on a black board. The author clearly mailed it in on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same formula, worse results","review":"Crichton uses his standard formula again in this novel: a startup company develops a new buzz-word technology which goes out of control. In this case the buzz-word is nanotechnology, which could be interesting, but not with this execution.The novel's beginning is it's best part. The protagonist is a family man who is looking for a new tech job in Silicon Valley, when he begins to notice weird occurences surrounding his wife and kids. Unfortunately the novel suddenly changes tracks, and most of the interesting early sections of the book are forgotten. For the latter 2/3 of the novel the reader is treated to detailed yet ridiculous situations involving the biotech organisms in the middle of the desert. This is one of Chrichton's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"De ja vu all over again","review":"I used to really like Michael Crichton, he was cutting edge and new. The problem with Prey is that in truth it owes an awful lot to a book that came out two years previous to his called Decipher by Stel Pavlou. Nanoparticles that can mimic humans, eat flesh and become a formidable foe. Sure that book is far more complex and the nano tech is just one part of that book, but it's so obvious to me having read Prey that Crichton read that book and borrowed the bits he liked that Prey has made me lose a tremendous amount of respect for him. Prey on its own is okay for the first half, strange things are happening and the hero doesn't know why, but many of the questions are left unanswered, and perhaps the most annoying thing of all was the lame last minute attempt to wrap everything up with a two page excuse near the end. It made the book very unsatisfying. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton's Worst!!!","review":"I am a huge Michael Crichton fan. I've loved him since I read \\"Jurassic Park\\" in three days when I was ten. Twelve years later and I can reread his novels again and again. \\"Prey\\" was a HORRIBLE disappointment. It seemed as if he had merely gone through some first drafts of earlier books and cut and pasted them together. The first person narrative was extremely ineffective (Crichton's never done this before, for good reason apparently.) To be honest, I'm sort of embarrassed for him. Oh well, I've got my fingers crossed for the next one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Couldn't Finish It","review":"I had been looking forward to reading \\"Prey.\\" Crichton was such a master at the futuristic thriller that I was hoping for a good read. Unfortunately, after 200 pages, I couldn't go any further. The characters were not interesting and the premise was unbelievable--even for Crichton. The storyline was completely predictable from the beginning and I completely lost interest. Crichton has produced some fine novels such as Andromeda Strain, Timeline, The Great Train Robbery, and State of Fear. \\"Prey\\" is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"This novel is well worth the reading/listening time! I learned a great deal and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing to me","review":"I came to this book with high expectations from Jurassic Park, Disclosure, and Timeline (which was a better book than movie). I was dissapointed by this book, I expected it to be better than it was. It is readable, but I did not get a good feel for the characters and the storyline, while interesting on the surface, suffers from what is best described as \\"limp\\" telling. It just didn't grab me as most good books do. I can't say that it will do the same for you, but this is my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Movie","review":"I have read two reviews of this novel. Apart from some mild criticism, both were favorable. These reviewers have been too kind. Prey is one of the most poorly written novels I've ever read. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it offers some interesting ideas as well as some fascinating information about the burgeoning new science of nanotechnology.Michael Crichton didn't try to write a readable, engaging novel here. All the characters are one-dimensional with virtually no character development, and much of the dialogue is inane--in one chapter, two of the main characters spend a half a page discussing the virtues of various disposable diapers!Prey isn't a novel--it's just a sloppy treatment of the film (complete with some interesting ideas for cool special effects courtesy of the author) that will undoubtedly be forthcoming in the next year or so. In this case, the movie is sure to be better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Movie","review":"This book is going to make a great movie, just like Jurassic Park. Remember how Jurasic Park's theme was that nature cannot be harnessed? I cannot give this book a 5 star rating (save those for \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" or \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" (Ken Follet). However, Prey is a good read. I could not put it down until I read the whole thing - it made me late for work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton gets it right once again","review":"As an avid Michael Crichton fan, I have read every fictional work currently published, and Prey is definately one of the best. He holds the reader in suspense, combining the terror of microorganisms as in The Andromeda Strain and the entangled feeling of Sphere. I was able to finish this novel in three days, and was found arguing with myself at 3 in the morning whether to sleep or to continue reading. I give this novel my whole-hearted recommendation, and hope all Crichton fans enjoy it as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loopy. You do not know what will happen next.","review":"All right. You are a computer scientist/programmer. You made the Predprey system. Chrichton looks at every aspect of losing a job, and having 2 kids. Brutal. Then, as if to add more stress to the bundle, your wife is wearing clothes you never thought she would wear. She is losing weight, coming home late from work, and, on top of the great things already, your baby daughter nearly dies. Brutal. then, it gets more Chrichton-esque and gets into nanotechnology. Could this answer everything? Maybe, maybe not. Read to find out, while you still can.You travel to Silicon Valley, only to find........your wife? now is when things get hairy, or should I say, quite \\"dirty\\". no, I mean like Dirt and Dust dirty. you get in all sorts of trouble, but you can't die, because you're the main character,right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Formula","review":"Chrichton is my favorite author. I love the techno-thriller that he has perfected over the years with his master formula. He intermingles science with suspense to create oustounding novels. Prey may not be his best, but it sure is an awesome novel. I just love those action sci-fi novels. My favorite is Sphere, but Prey is still a great novel. Keep up the good work Chrichton!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, a must read!","review":"This is one pf the best books I have ever read. I have read all of Michael Crichton's fiction novels and this is by far the best. I started reading one day and I literally did not put it down until I was done. Great action, excellent scientific background and explanations. The changes in the characters were strong. They are believable and very real. It almost seemed like I knew them in reality. This book can be genuinely scary at many times. I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out. What happens to some of the characters and the events of the book seriously stayed in my mind for days, and when a book gets you thinking like that, you know it's good. The ending seemed quite a bit tragic to me, but I guess that was one of the many tools Crichton uses to show the possible effects of this emergent technology. All in all, a very compelling and thrilling novel, possibly the best I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nano-bore","review":"I read one review that PREY should have been longer. I wanted it to be shorter. About 200 pages shorter. The \\"NEST\\" chapter would have made an excellent short story. In PREY, what precedes the \\"NEST\\" is dull, and what follows is ridiculous.Crichtons evolutionary factoids are as welcome as always. However, the idea that nano-particles will actually be visible to the human eye (\\"black cloud\\") or can be simply blown off with up/down bursts of air severely stretches his scientific credibility, and hampers the already-flawed plot.PREY could have been a taught, logical thriller like Crichtons previous works, but ended up reminding me of those silly radiation-monster movies of the 50s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows Crichton's limitations","review":"My major complaint with this novel is that it's pretty obvious that Crichton never once actually ran this past someone who is experienced with the electronics side of nanotechnology. From about page 70 I started nearly screaming -- \\"so when are you [guys] going to construct an EMP generator\\"? The idea of disrupting the silicon parts of the nanotechnological beasties is something that never occurs to any of the supposedly technologically savvy types in the book. The fact that the \\"final\\" solution was totally biological in nature just shows the author's lack of training or knowledge in this area..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible excuse for a book","review":"Not only is this book writen with all the literary finese of a 7th grader, the entire plot is unbelievable, even as science fiction. It reads like a horrible movie, with completely unsympathetic characters and just bad science all around. If you want a good sci-fi book on nanotechnology, try The Diamond Age by Neil Stephenson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing.","review":"This is not the most mentally stimulating read ever - I was not very attached to the characters and it didn't blow my mind. However, it is an excellent way to pass time on an airplane or the beach. I'd much rather read this than watch tv. I didn't regret the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes years of practice to write this bad....","review":"I love Michael Crichton books. I mean, who doesn't right? This book is not up to par at all compared to his other works. I felt like this book had an excellent premise and could have gone the distance. The beginning was very good and I thought it had promise. All of a sudden, when you get about half way through chapter two, you come to realize your error. This book is just cheesy. If I wanted to watch b flicks on the Syfy channel I would be doing that instead of reading a book. It is hard to believe this is out of the same mind that brought us such books as Jurassic Park and Congo. I might have to start reading the book previews before buying if this becomes a pattern. UGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Crichton","review":"A fantastic book that is easily listened to in its audio form. A review for this said that he spent too much time on the scientific details, but if you read Crichton, you know he gives the reader background on the science described in his writing. It doesn't bog down the story in any way, but rather gives the story plausibility.This book is akin to Andromeda Strain and is great for a trip in a car, plane, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nanotechnology run amuck","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. As in his usual style, Crichton blends technology with a sci-fi thriller. In Prey, the subject is nanotechnology.Jack Forman is the protagonist who used to program computers to problem solve by mimicking nature at its most efficient (e.g. swarming bees).Jack has been called in to help out his wife (who works at a research lab) on a top-secret project. He discovers the lab has created self-replicating nanotechnology. The swarm of microscopic machines have escaped the lab and now seem intent on killing everyone they encounter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton drops the ball.","review":"Sorely disappointing. I want to say that I like Crichton, but this was just a joke. The idea is fascinating, but it's executed in an insanely predictable way. I think that Crichton is just re-writing the same novel over and OVER again: Protagonist is trapped in a secure facility. Means to safety is outside that facility in an unprotected building. WATCH OUT. Oh, it's all okay. Whew.I'm glad that's finished. Spare yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and suspenseful plot","review":"Crichton mixes science fact with science fiction to create an irresistible book that keeps you up at night to finish reading the entire book.

It's one thrilling read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"absurd","review":"some reviewers here said this read like a B-movie. So true. I could only laugh reading this and thinking what the movie will look like. Twister in a desert! Nano-particles that think for themselves! Oooooohhh!! This book was absurd and absolutely laughable. I laughed at the way these characters behaved and this swarm was ridiculous! Laugh out loud at the swarm dragging bodies across the desert you will! The end was just a rushed, botched attempt to explain everything that didnt make sense in this book which was most of the story after the 1st section. ... And this sold millions. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cricthon's new novel brain candy, but plot falls just short","review":"Being a fairly diehard fan of the work of Michael Crichton, I was pretty excited when I received my copy on release morning. I picked it up and ready it straight through. The science behind the book is mind-blowing. As usual, the longtime spinster has crafted a mix of science fact and science fiction into a pretty good story. That's my biggest complaint about this novel. The story was just pretty good. Now from any other author, I think this would be an excellent read. From Crichton however, whose mind can at times be sharper than a surgeon's scalpel, this one doesn't make the cut. The plot seems forced, almost like this is an abridged version of what it was intended to be. This really takes away from the natural element of suspense that the story is capable of. Here's hoping that there will be a \\"director's cut\\" of this novel release in the future, but then again, some things never turn out how you think they will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predator on Prey by: Karl the Pencil Monkey","review":"This technological thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end.

My friend $ketch didn't like this book. But I would highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing experience","review":"In no time at all you will be \\"preying\\" for relief. One-third whine about the travails of a stay at home father, one-third info chunks gleaned by Dr. Crichton's research team and one-third loosely structured story, the novel is filled with logical incongruities and haphazardly conceived story development.Having read many of the authors earlier works which provided enough of a scientific framework to create a believable possibility, Prey indifferently attempts to fabricate a storyline with apparently little interest in whether or not the \\"facts\\" presented as the building blocks of the novel fit together in any cohesive or particularly interesting manner.It will probably make a visually interesting movie. Don't waste your money on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not crichton-like","review":"I read nearly all of michael's novels. This is my least favourite. The topic nanotechnology is exciting and Michael, as usual, does do his homework on it but the story and the characters he built around it somehow do not fit in it. An out of work team leader who does household duties, a handful of programmers becoming biologists and a working mom/full time scientist all handling the 21st century nanotechnology: it just does not match. With this topic at hand, the particles able to resemble a human form, I was more thinking of the liquid robot from the Terminator 2 and with that given you can create a much more juicy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a 10 part recipe, this was 9 parts research and......","review":"......1 part writing. Crichton has been my favorite author ever since Andromeda. Sphere, Rising Sun, Disclosure - all brilliant. He started losing me with Lost World, which was Disney-kid fluff. In this one, his science extrapolation is excellent and classic Crichton. However, the writing was dreadful. \\"I did this, then I did that.\\" Some authors use first person as a crutch; here it is a fully powered wheelchair. I lost track of how many times Jack tells us there is no way out and he'll be dead in seconds. And he tells us this so matter-of-factly that you expect Jerry Seinfeld to show up and say, \\"Ah, that's a shame.\\" And what do writers do when they can't portray the intended angst? They use exclamation points; ug. The characters are painfully stock, and the dialogue is B-movie. The most dynamic relationship is clearly between Jack and Julia, but the lack of pre-crisis Julia character development made me not care about the denouement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prey It's Not Made Into A Movie","review":"Well, although I usually enjoy Michael Crichton's books (not to mention ER and his movies), this one is definitely not his best work. Full of cutesy \\"Mr. Mom\\"-type scenes and dialogs of the male protagonist, but devoid of characters you might actually care about, the plot moves along through its Jurassic Park paces, towards the inevitable happy ending. I just found it boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL & PREDICTABLE: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"This is not Michael Crichton's best work. An interesting idea, but not very well fleshed out or expanded. I could have done without the scenes with the kiddies and I found it hard to believe the hero ever loved his wife. So who cared if she became infected. PREY they don't make a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Achieved Far Below Potential","review":"This book probably deserves a 3 star rating, but I had to penalize it one star because Michael Crichton is capable of so much better. On the positive side, I enjoy Crichton's books because I feel like I learn about cutting edge scientific information. In this respect, the book did not disappoint. The book included interesting information about both animal behavior and advanced technology. And the book was somewhat entertaining, in a \\"feel like I've just wasted my time\\" sort of way. Character development and dialogue, never strengths of the author's, became notable by their awkwardness and artificiality. As the book progressed, it read more and more like a movie script for an implausible, B-grade horror movie. I'm sure that most readers who have enjoyed Crichton's other books will feel disappointed by this effort. It is apparent that it was written with the movie potential in mind, and effort was not taken to make it into a good book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, weak finish.","review":"I used to really like Michael Crichton, and I still *want* to like Michael Crichton. Unfortunately, _Prey_ is not his comeback novel. It feels like he is in such a hurry to get the books out these days that the parts of them are just sketched into place.The idea of the nanotechnology baddie in the book is timely and clearly well-researched. The ending, chase scenes, and all the associated stuff aroudn the relationships, could all have been left out. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccuracies in the text.","review":"Michael Crichton's book contains two errors. On page 42 in the large print edition it is stated: \\"We entered a vein, so the red cells are not oxygenated.\\" The pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood. Not all veins are low in oxygen. Also, on the same page it is written: \\"We're coming to the right atrium, and we should see the mitral valve.\\" Correction: The mitral valve is located between the Left Atrium and the Left Ventricle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Impressive Read","review":"I read this book over two days. It's definitely a page-turner in the same league as The Andromeda Strain or Jurassic Park. But best of all, it gets down to the science of \\"science fiction\\" in ways I think some of his other novels (Disclosure, The Lost World) seem to have neglected. While it's not \\"hard science fiction\\" (e.g., the sample computer code in the novel doesn't even make an attempt at looking like a recognizable programming language), it has enough scientific detail to keep the SF fan interested. The characters are also surprisingly well-thought-out, especially for a Crichton novel (where the characters are normally not nearly as important as the concepts). All in all, I would recommend this book to SF fans who were interested in a good read, or any reader who is interested in being introduced to Crichton's writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"Very little narrative flow (long and constant digressions on nanotechnology and its evolution/ problems-- more than the story required), cardboard characters (was anyone surprised at who the evil ones turned out to be?), silly plot holes.To bad- I usually like Crichton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Michael Crichton been corrupted by Hollywood?","review":"For the first two thirds of Prey, I was enthralled. Michael Crichton is one of my favorite authors, and Prey was up to my expectations.Then in the last third, I thought the book fell to its knees. The plot devices were no longer credible, even given the suspension of disbelief inherent to this type of book.My hypothesis is that Crichton was thinking of the big screen when he wrote this book. He put in things that will make great scenes with modern special effects, but that just don't work in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better books","review":"This would have been a decent short story. First half is almost boring, and I almost quit three quarters of the way thru. He stretches the book with a lot of non-essential househusband whining which the feminists will love. Science is too farfetched and his descriptions of the mechanics of the factory are difficult to follow. You keep wishing a decent sized dinosaur would show up and give the book some energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton Can do Better","review":"Interesting premise, but so formulaic that Crichton's real motivation to take this straight to the big screen becomes transparent. Michael, don't let us down. Remember your roots and Andromeda Strain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Often amusing but implausible and unsatisfying","review":"I bought this book on CD (abridged version) because the plot sounded intriguing. I managed to finish the entire book (so it wasn't completely without merit), but I was disappointed. The story was not very engaging or believable. Too many coincidences. Several of the plot lines were just plain silly. I appreciate a dose of real science in my fiction, but in this case the extrapolation from the science was absurd. The book had no other redeeming virtues to compensate for these deficiencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the emotion?","review":"While the technical plot and science were interesting, the lack of any real human emotion among the characters was something I found to be disconcerting. Without giving away much of the plot, I found a lack of realism in the effects that friends' and long-time colleagues' misfortunes had upon the hero, Jack, as well as upon each other, not to mention the lack of emotion about what was occuring to spouses and children.This, to me, was such a major shortcoming that it made the whole experience unbelievable and unsatisfying for me as a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"He frowned. I said. Then I did. I said. You will frown.","review":"This is the first M.C. book I read. It was kind of fun, especialy liked the cliff-hanger parts on the end of the chapters. I almost expected a commercial after each.Michael Crichton delivers a fun book, but not a very well written book. I frowned. She frowned. They frowned. GET IT!?If anyone is a Next Generation fan (Star Trek), you will be able to guess most of the book. Those crazy \\"Nanites\\", were able to do so much in such a little time. I kept expecting to see the Terminator 2 robot pop up somewhere in this book.Once again, just like alot of his work, scientific advances go haywire in a secret isolated environment. I read the book. I frowned.The ending is pure Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichtonian Formula","review":"I have been onboard with Crichton since Sphere came out many moons ago, but, sadly I am jumping off his bandwagon. I trudged through Airframe, Disclosure and Rising Sun to see if he would return to his own created genre. However, what original ideas he used to have are now becoming formulaic non-sense. Here is Crichton's formula - Research Obscure Technology + Find Worst Case Scenario + Have Technology Act Out Worst Case Scenario + Isolated Location (underwater, desert, medieval Europe, whatever)+ Ignorant Character and Children = brilliant novel, plus a script Spielburg will look at (crosses fingers). Can't wait to see him tackle the time-travel issue, oh he already did. It was enjoyable in a mindless way, plus you get to feel smarter about yourself afterward. Anyway, I'm not expecting much from him next time and I'll wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe the same guy wrote The Andromeda Strain","review":"The synopsis of this book and the blurbs looked very promising and even after it begins you get off to a good start, but soon this book dissolves into a boring plot that is sci fi at its worst. I've seen this plot elsewhere. I really thought sci fi and humanity would combine forces in this novel to tell a great tale of struggle against a new kind of bad guy and that maybe it contained a message to the future to beware of how far we push the technological envelope. But this promise never fulfilled itself. It's amazing how quickly this book rocketed to the top. I enjoyed CLONED LOVE and SILICON SECRETS by two unknown authors far more than this book and so will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Crichton","review":"Another classic from the King of Thrillers!

Michael Crichton is a true master of suspense. It kept you interested from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts promising but ends flat","review":"\\"Prey\\" is the first book I have read by Michael Crichton. I was intrigued by the premise of an artificially intelligent being based on nanotechnology. The plot is captivating at first, but there are so many scientific impossibilities that it was impossible to suspend disbelief for long. The way the bad guys are dispatched of is especially bad, reminiscent of old \\"B\\" movies. Key plot details are given cursory explanations in the last two pages. Overall, I felt my time would have been better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie mystery-thriller","review":"Just as \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" is more fantasy than sci-fi, \\"Prey\\" is almost part mystery. Crichton lays out the clues for his readers and allows them to match wits with his protagonist, Jack Forman. I did figure out some of the outcome long before Jack did, but the novel was still incredibly fast-paced and engrossing. Unlike some of Crichton's other novels, which portrayed situations I do not see myself falling into, \\"Prey\\" was downright frightening. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton going through the motions....","review":"Prey follows the standard Crichton formula quite faithfully but much less capably than some of his past works. I got the feeling while reading Prey that Crichton was just going through the motions and at the end of it I felt much less fulfilled than with some of his previous works. As brain candy it worked but it doesn't achieve much more than that. Prey can be an semi-entertaining 4-5 hour read but don't expect more than that. It is what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jurassic park meets nanobots","review":"Michael Crichton has done it again! Yet another shallow novel based on a dubious premise filled with interesting scientific detail and characters as flat as matzoh bread. If readers find the plot eerily familiar to Jurassic Park, that's because it is -- secret lab loses control of its invention, which turns on them. Give me a break! And just like Jurassic Park, an \\"evil\\" scientist sabotages any effort to rein in those wacky new life forms. Captain Underpants dispatches his enemies in 70 illustrated pages -- why does Crichton require over 300. There is no suspense, no character development, and no attempt to create a credible antagonist, i.e. the nanobots. As Lincoln once said, \\"People who like this kind of book will like this\\". Otherwise, wait for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reversion to earlier days","review":"The first half starts off well. In the Crichton tradition it builds the mystery slowly. Little clues and red herrings are sprinkled throughout. The pages begin to turn faster until you are dying to know how everything ties together. It reads much like Disclosure or Airframe.But then the ball drops into the basement, where Terminal Man days are relived.Monster loose. Monster kills everybody. Hero uses gun/explosives/brown sludge. Hero escapes by helicopter. Hero calls Army (thankfully it's not the Costa Rican \\"more teachers than soldiers\\" Army this time, but rather the good old US Army who sits in a warehouse awaiting phone calls from panicked scientists to go blow stuff up).All the clues, the buildup, and the tension were wasted. The wrapup was force-fit into a paragraph, and the grand mystery wasn't so mysterious after all...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"This book talked about some neat stuff about programming. I'm a Computer Engineering Student.. and it was all very interesting.I couldn't put this book down .. read it straight through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining plot and non-stop action","review":"I think this is one of the best Crichton's books yet. The plot is very entertaining and original. The action is non-stop, and the writing is good. I couldn't stop reading the book once I started. I am extemely surprised some reviewers found the book slow. Possibly they lack some technical skills necessary to understand what is going on. The book does get a little technical at times, almost a la Heinlein in some his books. But it made only more interesting to me. Anyway, I personally enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crosses the border from Science Fiction to Science Fantasy","review":"One of the things I always like about Crichton's books was that there was always a feeling in the back of my mind that the story was somehow possible.From Jurrasic park's \\"DNA locked in amber\\" to the \\"alien life form\\" brought down by a satelite in the Andromeda Strain - I always believed that someday - this kind of thing might happen,In Prey - however - I just didn't get the same feeling and I think the book goes way beyond what can someday be possible.Crichton puts the story line of Prey in present day terms when in fact - technology such as this won't be available for many, many years - not in our lifetime anyway.If Crichton had put this story a few hundred years in the future - it may have worked"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick but not among his best","review":"I don't believe \\"Prey\\" is among Crichton's better novels, though he's so talented that even when he's not hitting on all cylinders he still comes up with something pretty slick and entertaining. My primary criticisms of this book are that the character development is a little weak and that the plot seems to fit sort of a prototypical Crichton mold without breaking new ground. I don't think Crichton should stray away from his fascination and concern with technology in future novels, though I would like to somehow see him reinvent himself a little. I don't know how, but I would like to see him expand his vision a little in the future. Nonetheless, \\"Prey\\" is still quite a good book that most Crichton fans will enjoy. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirt Bag","review":"This book gives new meaning to the words, \\"dirt bag.\\" The predator is a artifically created swarm of robotic dust. The author doesn't seem to appreciate the difference in words like evolution and mutation. His whole world is evolving and his story very nearly unravels. It is just a bit too preposterous to swallow even if the author does believe it possible. It doesn't hold together as well as his swarm. Too bad. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"Prey is full of made up techno-babble garbage. It has as much depth as a Star Trek novel, if even that much. If you want a more entertaining and better account of nanotechnology in science fiction, read Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this book","review":"By buying this book, you encouraging a decent author with some very enjoyable previous books to churn out more of this ...1. Kids do not talk like this. Adults do not talk like this to kids.2. There are plot holes a Tryanasourus Rex from Jurassic Park could walk through.3. The use of first person here fails miserably. Tech/action does not lend itself to the use of first person.4. His novels have always walked the edge of \\"beleivable\\" scienctific future - this one falls off the edge and the book starts when it is about halfway down the cliff.I like Crichton - almost everything he is written. This one is a complete waste.Oh yes, the reader on the audiobook version should be ostracized from society. He somehow made the children's dialogue even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst possible book i've ever read in 50 years!","review":"Well here it is 2008 and I bought this to read while on a flight to Cancun to work. The plot is basically terrible, the first part of the book reads like a General Hospital episode. The part of super manager fails unbelievably. Worse, I already had a better way to destroy the supposed villain at half the book's length than the ending. AVOID THIS BOOK! Anyone that has seen the movie, (yeah, I know I'm using a movie reference here) The Matrix knows that EMP will kill any computer type device unless it is hardened to MILSPEC (I'm thinking that Dude missed this movie....). So to kill nano machines that use electrical circuits? EMP! DUH!

Fair premise but a bit heavy on the \\"deus ex machina\\".

They could search the world's encyclopedia's and randomly pick subjects for books, much the way he does now, except faster.

Once or twice is okay, but when it gets in the way of the story, it's time to call a halt. Which I did at page 225. Upon further reflection I realized that as the frequency of the word increased so did the deterioration of the plot. I've heard Mr. Crichton say that he loves research but hates writing.

Back to the screenplay (with detailed instructions to the special effects crew.)I regret putting my hard-earned cash into this entertainer's pocket.

Building on some reliable technical information, he produces a cloud of rogue nanoparticles. Just a few days in the wild are enough for them to evolve into superpowerful swarms. A few infected humans are transformed in zombies, controlled by their alien and evil intelligence. The nanoparticles also reassemble and rearrange themselves at will, to mimic with perfection any human being they choose to. They evolve so fast, so well, that a makeshift biochemical process is worked out to synthetize brand new nanoparticles, expanding the swarms (animals and a few unlucky humans, purposedly hunted and killed by the swarms, are the raw material). Luckily, swarms and zombies are no match to an heroic human couple, provided by Crichton to unveil their evil secrets and torch them. Let's pray God will spare us PREY - The Sequel !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising Premise But Lame Ending","review":"The premise is promising--a secretive startup firm becomes the first company to manufacture commercial quanitites of simple nanobots that can perform a complex funtion as a swarm, and they get loose. However, the kind of havoc they wreak increasingly strains credibility, despite the author's repeated descriptions of the \\"emergent behavior\\" that a rapidly evolving swarm is capable of.

I get the feeling he was somewhat interested in this and had to get a book out the door after his last \\"Travel Guide.\\" Its good, don't get me wrong. But compared to Rising Sun, Timeline, or the Great Train Robbery, Prey comes off as work...hard work. The story has a lot of build up and seems to end abruptly.

This just isn't one of them! This was Jurassic Park with Nanomachines replacing the dinosaurs and it just didn't do much for me. Characterization was poor and after awhile, you get the impression that Crichton has never worked or been around real life people.I enjoyed Airframe because Crichton was RIGHT on about the causes 0f such accidents and the flack that surrounds a crash.I liked Timeline because he did a good job of throwing us into a good time travel yarn, which has not been done properly for many years.I liked Jurassic Park because of the ideas presented.The Terminal Man was exciting.Congo was silly, but still enjoyable.This novel was just really a sorry reason for the death of some trees.

But I was ultimately unable to suspend disbelief in the last quarter of the book when Crichton totally left the realm of the possible and indulged, for wont of honest imagination, in utter fantasy.His bot swarm development and activity make anything in \\"Jurassic Park\\" seem like the hardest of proven science by comparison, and it was far-fetched and belied a half-baked understanding of the biologically possible.I was terminally disenthralled with this book and with Crichton as a serious writer. My respect for his work has been badly shaken by his indulgence in fantasy to make this novel work.

Unfortunetley for the scientists they never gave the microscopic devils an OFF switch. Though this book has mild cursing in it I still find it's a good read for any half way decent reader.

As usual, it's real food for thought (and in this case we may be the food for that thought,both literally and figuratively!) The thriller/horror film blockbuster potential is also there, although as a real horror fan I'd rather they made a book out of Harry Shannon's rollicking 'Night of the Beast,' so there would be some more surprises in store.

Having just read it, I'm now glad that I didn't rush out and buy it as I almost did. There are so many things wrong with this book! My number one complaint with the book, and the only one that I will mention here, is the liberal use of the F word throughout the book.

You know, the one he'd just used the day before to talk to his kids, and that worked just fine out in the desert?Nevertheless, I kept reading to the end because Crichton's discussion about programming based on the natural world was fascinating.

I'm no scientific genius but I could easily follow the science in the plot, which made the book very enjoyable. Not so with this one. The science in the beginning seems like it could be comprehensible to a knowledgable person. However as the novel goes on, it begins to wheel completely out of control, and in the concluding sections just gives way to slam-bang action. Mr Crichton seems to have no consideration for the familiarity of the reader with the scientific aspect of this story. A dissapointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Crichton's best effort","review":"After reading most of Crichton's books, it gets hard not to compare the latest effort against the previous books. With such books as 'Jurassic Park', 'The Andromeda Strain', and 'Disclosure' it makes it difficult to always hit a home run.This book takes on the dangers of dealing with nano-technology. Crichton is such a good writer that he grab the reader and keep them captivated sometimes in spite of the subject. I think that is a great skill and still enjoyed the book.The story did lose me a little regarding the mass of nanobots and their life like abilities. It is hard to believe some of the books imagery. This may be partly due to the limited knowledge regarding nano-technology.If you a Crichton fan or some looking for an enjoyable easy read, then this book is good. However, if you're looking for Crichton's next great novel, I didn't think this book stood up with the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't feel threatened.","review":"Horror and suspense authors can relax; this book just did not instill fear the way one would expect from author Michael Crichton.

These nanoparticles take on life like qualities and chase people around sucking the life out of them. Continually evolving, they change both shape and Modus Operandi with every turn of the page, leaving the reader not quite willing to submit to the usual spine tingler.

Although I am not a literature snob, I find much contemporary fiction to be kinda dime novelish, (I created a new word!) with the exception of Crichton, whose work I have enjoyed since the old Andromeda Strain days.This particular book reminded me of s Stephen King book - Crichton starts to tell a perfectly good story, then, not knowing how to end it, tacks a ridiculous ending on it.If you absolutely have to read this book, either check it out of the library, borrow it from a friend, or wait for the paperback to come out.As a side note, I was very disappointed with the quality of this volume in general - pages raggedly finished, with ink blots partially obscuring the text. Really lousy quality for a hardcover - I have seen few paperbacks printed so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing \\"Prey.\\"","review":"What a tragic and awful novel given the earlier work of Michael Crieghton. Written in the first person -- often a small sign that the writer has lost his touch -- this book leads its readers to believe that it might be another wonder of new technology. It is like that at first, but Creighton gets almost desperate at the end to conclude the mish-mash that he has created. Surely his agents and the marketeers will love this book for a movie, and that is precisely what drives this sort of drivel. Creighton knows that and knows he wrote this book below his level. Go for the buck, Michael, and waste your talent.Don't waste your time on this book; you'll feel like you've been drug though a seemingly informative string of chapters only to find that it all led to a remarkably stupid and unbeleivable conclusion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton Delivers","review":"Just when you think Michael Crichton has written his best work, he comes up with an even more fascinating topic.I have been interested in the possibilities of nanotechnology since the late 80's when I read a book by Drexler called \\"Engines of Creation\\". Crichton has taken this idea and coupled it with some of the latest ideas in Computer Networking theory to produce an exciting, fast-paced, nightmare of a book. I read it in one day. I especially loved Crichton's editorial comments explaining the scientific concepts including actually providing the code that the programmers where concerned about.I'm just grateful that Crichton continues to aim his books at his most loyal audience. Those who actually \\"get\\" what he's talking about. Its refreshing to read Sci-Fi that is based at least partially on some scientific premise rather than the more commercial \\"And then it happened Automagically!\\" approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing novel","review":"I read Prey filled with the expectation that this would be an excellent book... I have learned in life that if you expect something great you will get something great. However this did not hold true when applied to this stinker of a novel.Unsurprisingly this novel was \\"hi-tech\\" and required many many descriptions of what exactly was happening with the science. That was ok, I expected that. However I didn't expect to have the answers to the problems to be so obvious. I guessed what was wrong with Julia long before it was actually explained. The characters were dry and one dimensional. By the end of the novel I didn't care what happened to them. The only reason I gave it one star is because of the original idea, nano-technology gone out of control. This could have been a much better book. God forbid Chrichton creates a sequal to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly his best, Written Like a movie","review":"This book is such a quick read, it's apparent it was put together with cinema in mind.

I won't give anything away but suffice it to say that reasonable suspension of disbelief goes out the window in the last 20 pages.Second, the dialog is awful, as are the characterizations.The collection of stereotypes having stereotypical reactions/conversations physically hurt me. I wonder if he wrote it with a straight to screenplay in mind.Anyways, a easy 6 hour read out of the bargain bin-- but not worth much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"alsome","review":"this book was amazing at first it was really slow but once you really got in the book it got alot better. if you like science you should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Crichton Even Write This Junk?","review":"Like the others who hated this book, I'll be brief. I consider myself a fan of Crichton and I've read many of his books. Airframe was one of the first books I literally couldn't put down until I'd finished it.

It is wooden at every level -imagination, dialogue, description. Almost every character is tediously unpleasant or else their proper name is implied to be enough to flesh them out.The world described,in dozens of instances, couldn't possible correspond to any other imagination than that of an unimaginative 12 year old boy raised solely on the worst action cartoons-in fact it could have been written by Gov. Arnold.The worst part of it is this brand-Crichton-just has to move its bowels every year or two and the product is efficiently consumed in robot fashion by millions of well trained ninnies. I highly recommend The Diamond Age as an antidote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed Crichton Fan","review":"I have to say that I was very disappointed with Crichton's latest offering. He does a very nice job of explaining the technology behind his premise. He describes the \\"rules of the game\\" as every good technothriller writer should then he breaks these rules over and over again as he tries to make the story more and more sensational. I know, you need to maintain a healthy \\"suspension of disbelief\\" to enjoy any book, but there was only so much I could take. The good news is that I read it from cover to cover in 5 days (which is pretty good for me!), so it had to have kept my attention, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad science, bad dialog, bad storyline (that's already been done) ....just bad.","review":"I'm not an expert in nanotechnology, but obviously neither is the author. It's fine to exaggerate the science in fiction, but Crichton introduces this as plausible in the real world. I don't think so.His pseudoscientific explanations are BORING and slow down the pace of an already very slow moving story. The characters are unrealistic, bombastic and stupid simpletons. The plot line is a compilation of many finer works. The dialog is bad. This is just a real disappointment. Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unputdownable good thriller with an insight into what the future holds for us in nanotechnology","review":"I liked it better than Airframe, Timeline. But Prey is one of my all time favourite novels. I liked it on par with Jurassic Park, COngo. I read it when it was released, and now it's been years. I plan to read it again and I am sure I will enjoy it again. It's educational too. While Timeline teaches you teleportation, Prey tells you about nanotechnology. Prey is a must read, BUY IT!His next two novels State Of Fear and Next, though educational are not real thrillers. read them too but Prey is better than these two.Please Mr. Crichton, we like to be educated but we like it to be packed with thrills too, so continue with novels like Prey. I cant wait to find out what Crichton's next novel is going to be on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-compelling","review":"A disappointment. While the premise of nanotechnology run amok is full of possibilities, the characters in this novel are utterly forgettable - especially the protagonist Jack. It seems that the author wanted to make sure no one was left behind in the plot development so we're left reading lowest common denominator character development. Main characters die off and....who cares? Even the other characters in the novel seem oddly unaffected by the unfolding events within the story.This book isn't horrible. There are a few moments of spooky tension but overall it's not up to Crichton's other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah! Didn't Hold My Interest at All After First Section!","review":"The first section of this book was good, but after that it was downhill all the way!! I had to stop reading it after a certain point, (the first 160 pages or so), as it was so boring!Prey takes us into the story of a mechanical plaque, and the desparate efforts of scientists to stop it. It speaks a lot of nantechnology and artificial disturbed intelligence.The plot was weak and never really picked up again. I wouldn't waste my money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books EVER.","review":"I&#65533;ve never submitted an Amazon review before, but if I can stop just ONE person from reading this piece of trash, save just ONE person from suffering through the clumsy prose of this wreck of a novel, then it&#65533;s worth speaking out.I used to look forward to a new Crichton novel every couple years. But I think Crichton&#65533;s novels have gotten progressively worse and more unreadable as the years have passed. And just when you think he&#65533;s hit rock bottom (i.e.: Timeline, Airframe, etc), along comes Prey. Prey is so awful I can&#65533;t even describe its awful awfulness to you. I&#65533;m just hoping my repeated use of the word &#65533;awful&#65533; will convey how awful this novel truly is. After finishing Prey, I decided I would never waste money on a Crichton novel again. Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.

What you do not get is character development or pristine prose. Every year or so I willingly accept that trade off.Prey deals with the cross section of biological evolution and the computer age. Crichton does a great job of feeding the reader hard to digest scientific/ technical facts in format that is easy to understand (I think?). As always, the plot is futuristic and told in a \\"this could happen \\" style. It is a page turner and a compelling read. There is a real JURASSIC PARK feel to the structure of the novel, the character quality and behavior. It's only missing the dinosaurs.I do not rate this amoung Mr. Crichton's best but it was a good read for a cold winter's night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor prey!","review":"Frankly, I think this is the worst of all his books, I read it twice over two weeks then gave it to Oxfam bookshop!

Get this book if you enjoy Michael Crichton because this one is just as good as his best sellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK book from an author who should do better","review":"Prey is definitely not one of Michael Crichton's better works. The science is there but the fiction makes it a bit ridiculous. Only a few days for a bunch of nano-particles to evolve into full symbiotic pirates on human bodies? Give me a break. If that happened in three days then ants would rule the world from giant ant cities ruled by massive distributed intelligence beings. Crichton doesn't convince us that 20 lines of code in a nano-particle is better than an ant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing read","review":"Very cool idea. Michael Crichton is a great writer. He makes you believe nonobots could really sprout artificial intelligence. Enjoyed this immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"prey","review":"Although I have seen many Michael Crichton movies and loved the series ER this is the first book of his I have read. There was LOTS of action. Lots of details. Some of the information was too detailed for me. Nevertheless, it was interesting. I could see this as a movie or made-for-TV movie. All in All it was OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the science...","review":"I liked the evolutionary ideas presented in Prey because I also had a lot of time to reflect on them as I read the book while camping. The theories and evolutionary discussions were far more interesting to me than the plot or the characters, I'm afraid. The climactic scene of the final destruction of the mutant strain, while not the end of the book, is reminiscent of the take down of the raptor nest in Jurassic Park.Crichton, keep writing and I'll keep reading. You're very good, but can't win 'em all. One book that really interested me by the same author was Eaters of the Dead. I really enjoyed that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nano Technology is Cool","review":"The book makes one shudder at the thought of Nano Technology. Even though this is a cool technology that will make our lives far more eventful... rather like living in Star Trek era....Mr. Chichton used his suspense to the ultimate limit in this book and makes it quite difficult to put the book down. He has a knack to discuss and explain high end technologies in simple and easy terms that are easily comprehensible by an average joe ...I cannot wait for his next title to come out ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"Have you ever read any other Michael Crighton novels? If you have, dont' expect the same suspense, well thought out action sequences, and character development that are usual fixtures in his works. Prey seemed like it was thrown together hastily. It's as if he didn't have a lot of time to get the book together, and this was teh finished product. The dust cover is pretty snazzy though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have been enduring a divorce when he wrote this one!","review":"While the science and the 'this could happen' ethos is a lot of fun, the book's start is astoundingly mysogynystic. His protagonist goes on AT LENGTH describing the normal day hundreds of millions of mothers world wide endure as if it's something novel. His male character whines about taking care of kids, how his wife doesn't call home when she's late, how it's hard to run into former pals who still make a paycheck. Honestly, no female author could ever have gotten such tripe published, but because our protagonist is a male, this is fodder for narrative. My husband and I howled at the beginning, and simply skipped entire chapters to get to the part he's good at: telling a scary story using potentially real science. But the guy sure was ticked off at some woman when he wrote this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea gone bad","review":"This is another case of \\"good idea gone bad,\\" and it disappoints me to see this particular one performed by Crichton himself. A genius tale about microrobots evolving to the point of mimicking humanity is hindered by an unnecessarily long introduction telling the story of a stay-at-home husband who thinks his wife is cheating on him. While this does gives some hints towards the rest of the novel, it's not enough to make up for all the scenes of grocery shopping and diaper changing and the like; after all, most foreshadowing and hints are fulfulled in the last couple pages of the entire 300+ page book.There are quite a few scary scenes towards the end, and I would love to see this made into a movie (as I'm sure it will), but when it all boils down, \\"Prey\\" says too much and achieves too little."},{"rating":"1","title":"I \\"PREY \\" FOR NOT ANOTHER CRICHTON DIVORCE","review":"Is this book just evidence to support his divorce?Does his x-wife get the rights , so he just wants to punish her?As usual , he is on the cutting edge of technology, but all he seems to want to do is write a mysogonists diatribe against women and mothers. I guess this book should be used in writing class to teach why someone going through a divorce should not write. I went to school with this 6'4 baskeball star, but all he does in this one is\\"dribble\\" and \\"foul out\\".More Nano-lit than nano-tech."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting, if far-fetched premise with major flaws","review":"Michael Crichton has created a unique story based on glimmerings of emerging nanotechnology with excellent action and suspense values.However, the story is fatally flawed-atleast as presented on DVD. There is a character, referred to in the beginning of the story, which uses a single flashback approach,who we find out later is actually dead at the time. Aside from this gaff,there are numerous logical flaws in the story that prove to be distracting from what otherwise could have been a riveting and thought-provoking story.One has the feeling that the author tore through the writing of this book and that the editor did likewise, perhaps both driven by commercial pressures. More care next time, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Bad B-Movie Script","review":"That is all this book is. There are too many plot holes to even mention here. The dialouge is terrible and he sums up the plot lines after each interaction like a soap opera would. The book had a great idea and the book needed to be technical, which is great, but he dumbs everything down to a 5 year old reading level. Wait for the movie and you might be able to see some cool special effects, but don't expect anything you haven't seen before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the hype...","review":"Disappointing page turner.

This is a far cry from the originality he displayed in THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN. Futuristic stories that are based on humanity like in the novel CLONED LOVE is the road to originality in the sci-fi world. This novel fails to bridge that gap."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIKE PAINTING BY NUMBERS","review":"Crichton's premise of nanotechnology gone awry is interesting but not necessarily new and his characters are shallow and one dimensional. I found the first hundred pages tolerable but the remainder of the book to be formalistic.The science of the \\"black cloud swarm\\" requires way too much information and takes away from what could have been a good sci fi horror story.Much of the book reads as if it was originally written as a screenplay. Skip the book and wait for the movie that will, no doubt, be coming to a theatre near you in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama plus accurate science","review":"Crichton did a very good job in drawing drama out of science. Some readers may have a problem with the depth of characters other than Jack Forman, but for me and most other geeks and nerds, the plot plus accurate science is the priority. I've been reading about genetic algorithms, complex adaptive systems, predator-prey processes and emergence phenomena for years and this book brings those ideas together in a great science fiction suspense-horror story, complete with monsters, slime and grotesque dead bodies.I see a problem with the death scene of the infected characters. Given that the E. coli simply give feedstock molecules to manufacture of future nanostructures, if all the E. coli in a swarm die, the swarm wouldn't die instantly. So, the people infected with virus wouldn't die immediately. This is about the only glaring mistake that I could find, given my limited knowledge. However, I may be missing some other clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windy","review":"So much exposition, so little patience. This book annoyed me.

But once I started I could hardly put it down. Crichton built suspense throughout the novel used things that were more obvious to the reader than the characters to help build that suspense. A well crafted voyage on what nanotechnology out of control could look like, and an ending that is very well played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"My 3rd book from MC and I am hooked!

An interesting idea, but not very well fleshed out or expanded. I could have done without the scenes with the kiddies and I found it hard to believe the hero ever loved his wife. So who cared if she became infected."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Crichton's I've read","review":"The Premise of this book is very tempting, When we move into new technology (Nanotechnology) we believe that we are in total control of these developing technologies and that nothing can go wrong. Yet many times some thing does, some time with a disastrous outcome.With this book how ever Mr. Crichton goes to great pains to make sure that even the simplest reader will easily be able to predict the ending. He does this so often that it becomes obvious that there is a suprise ending comming straight out of left field.It seams that Mr. Crichton was rushed on this book and just wanted to get it done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Implausible Drivel","review":"This plot was so far off the beaten path that not even the writing skills of Michael Crichton could make it work for me.

The characters are one-dimensional, poorly developed when developed at all. The premise of nanotechnology is a fascinating one, and ripe for science fiction, but not particularly believable as forced into the \\"technological boogeyman\\" role in this novel. It seems to me now that Crichton has built a large audience, his works are becoming more cookie-cutter and predictable, written with the inevitable blockbuster movie version in mind.For a much more imaginative, well-written, and believable look at how nanotechnology might shape the world of the future, and a great story to boot, I recommend Neal Stephenson's \\"The Diamond Age.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but poorly written.","review":"Crichton is resting on his laurels now. He simply picks a popular topic and cranks out a canned novel on the subject. While I found the storyline interesting, the character development stinks. The main character was an imbecile. All kinds of bad things are happening around him yet he continues to deny the truth. When he does finally wake up to the problem he continues to make one wrong move after another. It's hard to believe that anyone is that dim. All of the other characters in the book are just as weak. The kids are horrendously annoying, the villains are wooden, and the good guys are uninspiring. Even the Swarm is not that scary. The ending is a little too clean as well.This book is simply weak. It is not worth the money. Crichton, like Danielle Steele, can write crap now and people will still buy it. For a much better book on a similar topic read Greg Bear's Blood Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"rehash-retread","review":"I waited for the release of this book with such anticipation and was so let down.

Then it's up to the hero to outwit the nanobots (which shouldn't be difficult since they blow away in a stiff breeze). And that's about it, folks. The plot of Prey is recycled from the endless \\"people are taken over by aliens\\" stories that have been around forever. The characters are stock: Crichton doesn't bring them alive, and if they were alive, you wouldn't want to know them because they're so dull. A couple of action scenes -- characters battling swarms of nanobots -- are lively, but the rest of the prose is flat. Crichton had some interesting ideas about nanobots but lacked the originality to do sufficiently interesting things with them to make the story worthwhile. The novel might be okay -- just okay -- as a fast beach read, but there are better options.

Authentic Thaumaturgy is, if nothing else, an interesting read about the author's take on describing how a GM might design a \\"realistic\\" magic system for any game system, not just GURPS. He talks in depth about how people, past and present, view magic and how it really works, and points out that, for some, it really is a religion or way of life not to be taken lightly. The only real problem is that the book makes no real attempt to provide good examples of how that might be done for a full system -- it is left as an exercise for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"The idea behind this book is interesting, to make a generic magic system based on real world magical beliefs. Boneswits failed miserably.Bonewits spends most of his pages explaining how anyone who doesn't agree with him is either a fool or a liar. When he does get to game rules, they are too complex. Literally dozens of stats must be calculated, many of them vary from spell to spell and casting to casting.

Worthy of the full five star rating, unfortunately, the pin-heads at Universal have decided to release this gem in a full screen, pan and scan version.

I live in the U.K. where this film has never been released in any format, so I was eagerly awaiting this release, unfortunately I will not be purchasing it until the widescreen version arrives, and I guarantee that in a year or two it will and everyone who has bought this disc will need to upgrade again.

It is a great story, and to release it in a fore-shortened format (AND NO CAPTIONS, EITHER) invites the criticism of stupidity. In this vein, I would like to point out that in general the market for these older movies is getting older and older, and for some of us the extra cost of a quality production is well worth it.

The air field still looks pretty much the same (minus the junk cars). Exterior shots of Charley Varrick hooking up with the mob secretary were shot in Reno.Walter Matthau could do it all, comedy and drama. His portrayal of the detached, rather humble Charley Varrick was excellent. Fans of this movie might enjoy the short-lived 72-74 \\"Banacek\\" TV series which pops up on internet auctions sites, George Peppard played a detached good-guy insurance investigator (\\"Banacek\\" does depend on a lot of dialogue).And yes, this film deserves a much better DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even as good as Rockford Files","review":"The plot summary sounded like a lot of fun: Walter Matthau running from the Mob.But the movie was a huge-let down. It was poorly paced and the script was worse than mediocre. With such uninspiring fare, even Matthau couldn't make it interesting. There's a scene with Matthau flying a plane that could have been spectacular but due to poor writing and poor pacing it fell flat. I can't say more to avoid a spoiler, but let's just say it was excruciatingly predictable.The overall feel is like an episode of the Rockford Files, but not nearly as well done.

Hopefully that will happen with this equally-worthy film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Star Movie, Stellar Cast, Disgraceful release format","review":"I totally subscribe to the views expressed by many reviewers. This is a travesty of a release. Charley Varrick is a superb film with a cult status only because it has never been adequately presented or marketed. I bought this in advance of its release on the bizarrely timed date at the end of december 2004 (Have the marketing department never heard of Christmas?) and I was thoroughly disappointed. The print looks like a bad 70's piece of television and the ratio is the same. This film was shot and screened in the cinemas as a panavision 1:85 or wider ratio. Who wants to look at something that doesn't reflect its true worth? Don't buy this even though it is a great film.

When the studio halfwits realize that only brain damaged in-duh-viduals want to see the cut, blurred by panning-and-scanning full screen version, and when they decide to release \\"Varrick\\" in a proper, widescreen version instead - *then* I will purchase a copy. As for this one, I would not want it for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD report","review":"Everyone knows this is a great film, and in my opinion it gets better with every viewing. The plot is surprisingly intricate, and there is no dialogue explaining what is going on -- a true rarity.But what about the DVD? I bought it, after delaying for a long time because of the angry reviews re fullscreen versus widescreen. And, indeed, I wish the DVD had a glorious widescreen print. But it is great anyway. It seems obvious that the film was shot fullscreen, since there is not a single shot that seems awkward. No pan-and-scan. No shots of one person on the screen when there should be two. No half heads. Moreover, the 'extra' material on the top and bottom of the screen never looks awkward. It looks like it was composed for full screen presentation. The picture is very nice. There is nothing to distract you from the very fine film.To anyone who is hesitating over this purchase for purely technical reasons I recommend that you hesitate no longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Flick","review":"this movie is long on twists and turns that kept me involved, and way short on gratuitous sex. I'd seen it a few times before, but not for a few years. The characters were great. The story was very plausible and not hard to follow. Matthau couldn't have been better, Joe Don Baker was superb, and the supporting cast were really credible. This movie is not one to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charley and the Mob","review":"An exciting and fun film as Charley manages to stay just one step ahead of the Mafia hit man who wants the Mob\`s money back. There is plenty of action and the clever plot, together with Don Siegel\`s skilled direction, ensures that we are kept enthralled. When I finally remembered the familiar face of Charley\`s assistant, I realised that it was Andy Robinson, the baddie in \`Dirty Harry\`. Pretty bad in this film too! Joe Don Baker is a terrific hit man. Never giving up on his prey, he and Charley have a battle to remember when they finally meet up. Good viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly done and highly entertaining","review":"This film about a bank robber being pursued by the mob for monies that he unwittingly stole from them is one of the best pictures of the crime-chase genre that I have ever seen. Not only is the pace and suspense admirably sustained by the much underrated action film director Don Siegal, and moreover, with mordantly witty (almost Hitchcockian) touches throughout, but the characters all come across as highly distinctive, even idiosyncratic, instead of generic types (as is often the case in such films). Matthau shines in an effectively low key portrayal as the unassuming but ultimately crafty and resourceful crop duster pilot/bank robber, Charley Varrick, as does Joe Don Baker, who uses his hulking presence to come across as genuinely fearsome as the hit man, Molly (how do you like that as a choice of name for a villain?). Also, John Vernon is both sophisticated and sinister as the white-collar executive bagman for the mob.Highly recommended as a very fun watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining","review":"For those who are tired of run-of-the-mill crime dramas, this one is worth a try. Pilot-turned-bank-robber Walter Matthau matches wits with mob enforcer Joe Don Baker, and both actors play their roles to perfection. Matthau is superb as the laid-back bandit, while Baker is truly menacing as the sadistic mobster who pursues him. The supporting cast is also excellent, and the script contains some clever and original plot twists. This may not be one of the best-known films of the 70's, but it is certainly one of the most entertaining. Get this one - you will enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you like Walter Matthau","review":"I only recommend this movie to those who are fans of Walter Matthau (which I am). The script is fair at best, the directing is lackluster and corny, and Matthau's supporting actors in this movie seem distracted or half-hearted (except Joe Don Baker who couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag). If you are not familiar with Walter Matthau, there are other choices which have better writing and directing, and far better acting by the supporting cast.The DVD itself has two major problems: 1) it's a 4:3 pan and scan; and the sound track is \\"noisy.\\" The \\"focus\\" and other visual problems are not as apparent as other reviews might suggest."},{"rating":"1","title":"... more like a bad 70s made for tv movie","review":"Cheesy music, hitman story, crummy sets and locations. Matthau is pretty good, but the story is not engaging or convincing as clever suspense. There are bunches on non-sequiters and for a movie that wears nearly 2 hours the plot is pretty thin.Supposedly Charlie is some kind of rebel hero, but the script never convinces us he's more than a selfish thug himself. Overall, a misstep for Matthau because the story wasn't good enough for him to take on this dark character. Fairly cheesy overall. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Write a second one Dr. K!","review":"See my comment to the vet student who could't handle the Tale of Tom-cat McGee. Review therein.

I bought the book sight unseen because like many I am fascinated with the idea of a pet monkey. I thought that a veterinarian would have some fascinating insider information on monkeys. Well after using it as the clever title the author only mentions monkeys in the preface in two short paragraphs. We learn that they bite and they smell they throw feces and owners of them love them anyway. We also learn that vets would rather deal with a spitting cobra than a monkey. The author than promises that later she will reveal how vets hold monkeys safely to inspect them. Well, a page by page examination of the book yields no further reference to monkeys and her promise is left unfulfilled.Besides that I must agree with the reviewer that was disgusted by her microwaving a cat to conceal her lies to the owner.I guess a vet that is willing to lie to a cat owner wouldn't hesitate to mislead her potential readers to sell books as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"And People Still RESPECT Veterinarians??","review":"As a veterinary student, I was appalled to read that such antics as lying to clients and microwaving cats not only seem to be acceptable, but touted as entertainment in this book!

For both The Cramps and DEVO were products of Ohio, low rent art scenes, and desperation to smash back at the sludge coming from the payola radio of 1970s America. What is ironic is the Cramps were accused of embracing a cartoonish version of Satanic theatrics as part of their image, while meanwhile head-banger music as ludicrous as a spandex pentagram was chronicled with precision and admiration by CREAM.For anyone starting a band and considering your placement in the pantheon of rock genre, this is a must listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I'm not usually one to give very negative feedback, but this purchase was a waste of our money.This training CD gives you no reason for what they are doing during the tutorials, no definition of what various processes mean, or how you could use any of the functions in your own work.

He's small so he's still got a few pounds to go until we move him to a bigger seat. I can't wait! The handle gets stuck on the sunshade every time you move it up or down. The handle release is akward and very hard to squeeze. The buckle is also very akward to get buckled especially with a squirmy baby (although I suppose any seat is hard to buckle when they're squirming). You have to fit together two small pieces and get them simultaneously clipped into the buckle. It's not easy. The only pros...I do like the triangular handle, it gives you many carrying options, nice fabric, and the built in level. Also it has gotten good safety reviews. In retrospect, we should've gone with the Graco Snugride. Easier to use, a little cheaper, and got equal or better saftey ratings. If we decide to have another baby, we definitely won't be using this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detestable Pain","review":"We used this car seat briefly because we were traveling and our hosts borrowed it from a friend.It posed one difficulty that marks it as near useless. I doubt the waist buckle was designed by anyone who has ever buckled a child into a car seat. They have a design that somebody probably thought was clever but is actually a pain to latch/unlatch. They also didn't align properly so it always seemed as though one side wasn't properly latched (note: this might have been a problem with our specific seat, but I doubt it).I want a buckle that I can latch in freezing weather and unlatch in an emergency. This satisfied neither requirement.Aside from that -- which is also why I give it more than a star -- it was okay. It seemed heavier than most car seats but I liked the heavy duty handle. We secured the main part with a seat belt so I can't comment on the base portion and connecting to that.Buy a Graco instead. We love ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Car Seat","review":"We purchased this carseat because it was the most affordable and highest rated according to the American Academy of Pediatrics website.

It is very lightweight, easy to operate, and easy to manuever.

The car seat was a little heavy, by itself, add an infant into the mix, you have to be very strong to lift and carry for any amount of time. I didn't like the handle either. It was awkward to maneuver into a carrying position. However, the features that I did like, the material, the easy adjust straps, ease of cleaning and getting unattached from the base totally override the bad things. I am expecting again and am looking to buy a Baby Trend car seat again, just can't beat those ratings for the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the handle","review":"I love the triangular handle on this car seat.

But it snaps into the car in a flash and my little guy is very comfortable in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"handle","review":"I have 3 kids and I got this car seat for my youngest, cause it was cute. Overall, it is good, nice fabric, easy to clean, and it is pretty light compared to others. The latches on the handle to release it are very difficult to push. If you pull muscles easy, like I do, I do not recommend it. It is seriously very stiff, even my friends pointed that out right away. And also the straps that hold baby in seat are rather short so it does not last the first years, I had to get a new one when my daughter was 6 months old, she would not fit in it with a sweatshirt or jacket on."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, I hate it!","review":"I HATE it. I hate the car seat because its WAY too heavy. And I hate the stroller that goes with it. It is sooo hard to move and steer, the wheels have NO traction. I have had it for 9 months now, and I am ready to toss it and get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good looking but not safe!","review":"I recently bought this carseat and when I got it I thought it would be perfect. When I tried to install it was when I found the first problem. Putting the seat in the correct height to have it level proves to be near impossible unless you are very strong. Raising and lowering it by the little button the base is very difficult. After I got that figured out and got it installed by a certified person, I thought I was going to be done with it until I had the baby. I didn't pay any attention to it for a couple of days and when I was putting stuff in the backseat I noticed that one of the LATCH clasps was undone. I couldn't figure out why this would have happened but didn't think anything of it and just hooked it back on. By the time I had driven home, less than 10 minutes, it was unclipped again. No one seemed to be able to tell me why this was happening, I'm just glad that my baby isn't here yet! I'm returning this one and I don't think I'll ever look at a Baby Trend again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical","review":"If you are looking for a book to explain how to make true home made wine with out a kit, this is the book you need.

Simple, easy to follow instructions. No guesswork. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought...","review":"It's been 5 months since I purchased this book and began my first batch of wine. I just dumped them out. I was a beginner and have realized from my mistakes that these recipes omit some very important steps. Some recipes even have the process out of order. The author assumes the reader knows more than the basics. I wasted a lot of good apples, pears, cider, and honey. Not to mention time and money. Not a good wine recipe book. I'm starting over."},{"rating":"2","title":"good basic recipe book","review":"While this book isn't really for the beginner it has plenty of good basic wine and mead recipies. I've tried several with mostly good luck. It's also one of the few publications that have workable mead recipies. My only objection to this book is it seems to treat aging as the most important step in all wines. While it is very important, it isn't all that makes a wine, and especially mead, great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnatural chemicals and additives","review":"I really didn't like how there are so many unnatural additives and chemicals in all the recipes. I can't imagine drinking a finished product knowing those things are in it especially since classic recipes using herbs, fruit, and/or flowers would not have included the unnatural additives they recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes","review":"This book is a great gift as well s one for yourself if you making homemade wine. I recommend it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very wild","review":"The title suggest \\"wild recipes\\" and I thought that recipes would be presented which you can make mainly with wild or backyard ingredients, maybe even using wild yeasts. Instead it is a pretty usual wine making book. Nearly all recipes ask for fruit juice concentrate, even for very unusual concentrates. I have no idea where to get these concentrates, certainly not in the next supermarket.For this reason, I think that the title is very misleading as it suggests real \\"back to the basic\\" recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring but some details are missing","review":"I got this book for my first winemaking book, and used one ofthe blackberry wine recipes for my first batch. The recipesare just recipes, without the minute detail, and it was hardto turn back and forth from the recipes to the 'how to' introto get the general detailed steps, and there were a couple ofsteps that I wasn't sure exactly what to do. Also, there aretips I could have used, for example the siphoning; the bookmakes it sound simple but it was very frustrating, and thereare tools available to start the siphon that I hope will bevery useful.The book is very inspiring and the recipes are diverse andinteresting, I expect to use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great place to start","review":"I love making mead, and this book gave me many ideas for new recipes and combinations. I doubt I'll follow any of their recipes exactly (since I don't cook my honey), but it certainly gives me a place to start. It was worth buying to have on hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Picture","review":"I was not happy with this purchase because the picture givin on the site and the actual product received are 2 different items. The picture is of a round water bottle (which is what I needed) the item I received is a rectangular water bottle. I already have a holder for a round bottle and just wanted a bigger bottle for same holder. Haven't figured out what I'm gonna do with rectangular one yet. I decided to just keep it because it's not worth the shipping and hassle to send it back.

Beth Peters uses a great technique of writing to make it very interesting. It's not just a book that you sit down and read through. It's got quizzes about Brit, facts (from her fave things to the address of where to get a script of the play \\"Ruthless\\" that she stared in), and information on her former MMC stars and where they are now. In between all that, it tells the story of super star, Britney Spears.

I recently purchased a copy of this book only to discover that it is simply useless; despite its high cost. The print is unseasonably tiny, but, above all, the words are so horribly mangled in many of its pages that it lacks any real intellectual value. Luckily for me, I have access to an 1896 edition of the book, which the publisher should have simply filmed and printed exactly as it is. This copy is elegant, agreeable to the eyes, and, despite its age, a delight to read. The publisher had better repeated this very badly executed project."},{"rating":"1","title":"repeat photos","review":"Dont get this book. They show the same restaurants over and over.

A must have for anyone who is interested in interior design, or contemporary Japanese architectute."},{"rating":"1","title":"warp in dishwasher","review":"Mine warped after a few runs through the dishwasher. I great idea, but bad execution. I loved it while it wasn't warped. Now, I use cheap white plastic cutting boards from a restaurant supply store, with a damp dish towel underneath to prevent slippage. These cheapo restaurant supply store cutting boards have never warped in my dishwasher, and cost me a lot less."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cut that's a little too deep","review":"I have been searching for a good cutting board for a while and I own 3 other boards (wood, glass and plastic). I was hoping that I would use this only for cutting raw meat, but after couple uses, the board was covered with rough cuts marks. I don't think it will affect the functionality but I am concerned with the plastic residue that might end up in my food. I guess I just have to wash the meat after I finish cutting it. A little disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what you are looking for...","review":"It is true that these boards come warped from the factory - concave on the cutting side. I found that heating up the board on the cutting side with hot running water makes it expand and actually invert the warp, but it switches back when cooled. Probably due to the different parts being fused together to make the single board. This makes cutting difficult in two ways:1) with a concave cutting surface, long flat knives (such as slicers or bread knives) won't cut all the way through to the board in the middle2) The non-slip surface is only touching in the center, and the board pivots easily on the counter topAdditionally, the board does cut very easily with sharp knives, and it appears impossible to get food staining out of the cuts.Bright side is that placing in the dishwasher doesn't make the warping any worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"This cutting board does not lie flat on the counter and therefor it is not actually non skid as it is advertised. I could spin the board with one tap to the corner. I bought two and promptly returned them both.

Not only does he give you a thorough list of novel exercises to prepare you for your chosen sport, his text is rich with spritual and philosophical insights that makes one re-think the skism that most athletes in the Western automatically assume to be true -- separating our training from our life. Mr. Ilg allows us to see that the more we integrate the two, the more we focus on the present, the greater our growth as athletes and human beings. The book is called The Winter Athlete, it could just as easily (and perhaps more accurately) be titled, The Wholistic Athlete Within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The latest Intrigue by Ms. Herron is wonderful.

This author has written a great book that I will recommend to all of my friends. But be warned -- it is an emotional read and will make you cry!Great book! I look forward to reading more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic suspense?","review":"This is a pretty average romance novel. I would pick it up at a UBS. Then I saw it was supposed to be a romantic suspense. In that case, it is disappointing. Little action and a silly mystery. Gayle Wilson and Suzanne Brockmann write romantic suspense. No one who has read their books can think Rita Herron's is in the same category. You will like it if romantic intrigue is not what you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore long-winded reviews, this one was great","review":"It chaps my hide to see wanna-be writers who try to dissect a book in a public forum and who end up displaying their ignorance with a healthy serving of sour grapes. What? Did Intrigue turn down your manuscript? Herron's book is a solid example of romantic suspense; when true love conquers all, even a severe detour like a missing memory. It kept me reading for its plot, its style and its sense of satisfaction at the end. Face it, IntrigueFan is spewing vitriolic reviews because of some need to see her words in print and this seems to be the only way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical perspective of preaching","review":"This book has some age on it, true enough, and some of its concepts of preaching may be outmoded for 21st century congregations, but not all. I got it for the chapter on the history of preaching which I found to be most helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"tropical delights","review":"Dewdrops in the rainforest... an absolute masterpiece; haunting melodies and heartbreaking songs. No need to understand the lyrics here, the message will come across anyway. Also, production-wise this is fantastic, the traditional and modern elements blend together beautifully.

Seriously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult reading for the amount of information","review":"I am a big fan of Ralph Kimball's data warehouse books. I was looking for a similar book for operational data stores, and had hoped this would be it. I was disappointed. There is a good bit of information in this book, but it is not written with the clarity of Kimball's books. The biggest disappointment though is the lack of real examples of ODS data models. I expect examples to be less \\"definitive\\" for an ODS than for a DW, nevertheless I desire something more tangible than what is presented in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Coal","review":"I found this book to be a truly captivating representation of the hypocrisy and oppression that the early 20th century coal miners encountered. While the plot is not as notable as his earlier work, The Jungle; King Coal is laced with it's own gruesome depiction of the corruption caused by greed and apathetic treatment toward the mine workers.Upton Sinclair devoted his life to exposing the flaws of big industry and I think everyone could benefit from reflecting on his work.I would also recommend Germinal by naturalist, Emile Zola or The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. The latter book illustrates the life of a family of sharecroppers during the Dust Bowl while the former concerns the lives of workers in the French mines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"We love all of the Dora videos, and this was no exception. Plus it was a great deal-2 for 1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Although dated, it remains a good primer on the origin and evolution of the universe","review":"Since this book was originally written in 1952, a lot of scientific discovery has taken place. Nevertheless, it remains a solid description of the history of the universe from the \\"big bang\\" until what we see today. That is generally due to the excellent expository writing of Gamow, he is able to take the complex nature of astrophysics and distill it down into an understandable form. He does all of this while retaining the fundamental science, which is sometimes very difficult. Gamow also never hesitates to use formulas when there is an obvious need for them. Therefore, even after 50 years this book is still a good primer on the origin and fundamental nature of the universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to vacation in Quebec","review":"Frommer's travel guides never dissapoint, and this one continues in that tradition. Mr. Livesy brings to life so vividly a place like Ile d'Orleans that you would, at best, be remiss not to make it part of your itinerary. He doesn't pull any punches when discussing Quebec City's relative lack of \\"haute cuisine\\" compared to Montreal. After reading this book, I have to believe that Quebec City and its surroundings would warrant its own 274 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a help to me.","review":"I had this book along with the Lonely Planet guide to Montreal. I found that the Lonely Planet guide to Montreal had better information on Quebec City than this book did.It may be that this book is just not designed for people like me, but I just did not find this book useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis- information","review":"We were disappointed in the inaccuracies in the information regarding Quebec City. The listing for the Auberge St. Antoine indicated two levels of parking (valet and self park); in fact the hotel only offers valet parking and for considerably less than listed in the book. The hours for at least one of the tourist attractions were not correct. The biking information does not include the nice trail in Levis accross the St. Lawrence and accessible by ferry (no car required); instead, the book sends you to an island that requires a car and does not have traffic free paths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I grew up with a Polish grandmother who constantly used \\"dupa\\" as a swear word (I won't give away what it means). When my family watched this movie for the first time we died laughing. Yeah, it's a terrible movie, but wonderfully terrible. The Cher/Bono skit is one of the highlights. If you've never seen it you absolutely should not buy it. Rent it first.

But this book (in my eyes) is not made for people who look for a \\"tourist guide\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seductive Seattle","review":"This is one of Robert Carmeron's last books and it is one of his best. Seattle really lends itself well to this kind of photography, the city is so naturally blessed. The photography in this book is classic Cameron and the photos are so vivid. I recommend this book to anyone with an interst in this beautiful city or just an interest in great photography in general, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"The characters are engaging and the plot rarely slows. Wilde weaves comic book heroines and government agents and secrets together and makes it work. Of course her heroine and hero are the best part of the book. For Texans, the locale is as much a part of the story as the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little unrealistic","review":"I picked this up on a whim, mostly because of the cute front cover. However, I ended up disappointed because the character's behavior is so completely unbeleivable. I'm all for fun and whimsy, but there has to be a backbone of reality. None of these characters acted like people do in real life. After a couple of chapters, their antics became annoying to read. Also, I found the dialogue rather cheesy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gold Mine of Info for Playwrights","review":"Gary Garrison's New and Improved Survival Guide is an absolute necessity for anyone who even just thinks about writing a play as well as seasoned playwrights.

She does not play with the carriage at all.Her 16 month old and 4 year old sister play with the carriage they put their little people and weeble wobbles in it and push it around. Not worth the price we paid at all. Very disapointed in Mattel.

I just wanted to mentioned that you definitely will not be seeing any of these movies on TCM (Turner Classic Movies), UNLESS the film and transfer quality has been worked over by the wizards that digitally improve the quality. As they stand now in this boxed set the quality of the films and the transfer of the films many times is abysmal. I would strongly advise renting this from your local library rather than putting out hard earned cash for these movies. And, yes, Robert Mitchum is in one of these movies, but it is such bad quality and he is in it so infrequently that it is a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good, the bad, and the ugly of WWII films","review":"While many of these films aren't particularly good, a few are definitely worth the price of admission. A Walk In the Sun is an all-time classic, while Gung Ho and Go For Broke are entertaining looks at lesser known WWII stories. Films like Aerial Gunner are also interesting as pieces of propaganda that were both entertaining and educational. As with all budget titles like this, the quality ranges from fair to bad, but it's hard to argue with the price. Definitely worth picking up if you like old war movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compressed to an impressionist window pane","review":"What a krappy production.

Until I bought the Embrace 5 Travel System (similar to the Aura). First of all the infant carrier started to show white stress marks in the gray handle before my son reached 15 lbs. It also tends to sit a bit upright in the car. Secondly the Stroller! If you have more than 9 lbs in it the wheels get stuck due to poor design. When I called the company to ask what to do. They said it wasn't a safety issue. I nearly knocked over the stroller several times while trying to walk on a sidewalk. The wheels get stuck and comes to a complete stop or goes to the side.

Second, our baby is only 6 months old and 15 pounds and for the last two months has felt too heavy for the seat. We are already seeing white distress marks on the handle!

It charges if you plug the power part into it but it doesnt sync. I tried another chord that was laying around and it still didnt sync. I thought it was my computer so I brought my friends psp over to test it. It worked fine with my spare chord which meens the 2-In-1 USB Power Cable will impair your PSP Slim's syncing cabibilities.

This book panders to women's fears and disempowers everyone by fostering shame for men's natural passions and joys. For millennia traditional arrangements between men and women were essential for survival - now, thanks to men's inventiveness, they're not. It is sad that Stoltenberg's construction of masculinity is so myopic that he sees only evil.The other reviews that talk about the feminist straw woman of radical teachings should sit in on a few university classes where students are shamed just for having a penis. The hostility of academic feminism, idealized by Stoltenberg, is very real and helps neither women nor men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Day Trips!","review":"Nice places to go to in Arizona.Well thought out and written.

I previously had a Sassafras Pizza Stone(for nearly 20 years until it finally cracked)which was fantastic. It cooked the pizza perfectly and browned the crust evenly. This new pizza stone (purchased a few months ago and which is not made of the same material)leaves the crust soggy. Obviously, whatever materials it is made from does NOT conduct the heat properly or in the same way as the old pizza stone. I say this with the experience of making several pizzas on it. The only way I can get a browned crust is to remove slices from the stone after baking, and put them in a heated frying pan for 3-4 minutes.Save yourself the money on wasted ingredients and a terrible dinner.

It seemed the most useful for the cost. I followed the directions, put oil and cornmeal on it and heated it in my oven. Almost immediately the oven began smoking. We opened the oven and had to open all of the windows in the house due to the smoke. We took it out and placed it on a metal pan and within 2 minutes, it broke in half. Needless to say, it was a terrible investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baking Stone Received already Broke","review":"I can't say how I like it because they shipped it with inadequate packaging and I received it broke.

He said no and that a replacement would be sent.Now I get an email after it has shipped telling me I must return the item within 30 days or my credit card will be charged. Since I threw it out I can't ship it back. There is no email address to tell them this and to tell them if they charge my card I will report them to Mastercard. Anyone have an email address for customer service? I guess I wouldn't recommend buying from this source since the stone is fragile to begin with. You will have to pay to ship back to get one that may or may not be broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring.","review":"I am surprised to see this book got 5 stars from all reviews. I have bought this book for two years now and I must have attempted to read it at least 7 times. Maybe it's the very small prints, maybe the very first few stories are just plain slow and boring, I kept putting it down and started reading other books.

It is confusing at times, and sometimes difficult to follow the plot action, but it's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty forey into litterary Theory incarnate","review":"Seeing the recent trend in philosophical reflection towards litterary theory, nothing tops Stoppard's witty examination of the nature of narrative and characterization through a parody of not only \\"Hamlet\\", but philosophy and litterary theory itself. Gloriously executed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great play; Wrong edition","review":"This is a wonderful play, but the Grove edition sucks, just reproducing the original text. But the Samuel French edition (http://www.amazon.com/Rosencrantz-Guildenstern-Favorite-Broadway-dramas/) includes the original PLUS an author intro and additions to the text from staged productions. It's cheaper too (not that a few dollars is the issue)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Witty and Entertaining!","review":"I found Tom Stoppards'play to be a magnificent combination of wit, humor, and creativity. Stoppard takes you backstage to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are waiting to play their parts in the Hamlet production that is going on onstage. Their utter confusion about making decisions and frequent mentions of death make fun of thier basically inconsequntial parts in Shakespeares' Hamlet. Its length was very short, but there were always plenty of interesting allusions and thought-provoking lines. Overall, Stoppards' play was a witty twist on the orginal Hamlet and I would love to see the play in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"the joy of words","review":"This book showed me how amazingly infatuated I am with words.other than the brilliance of the writing, the philosophy, the references to hamlet -- it is the way Stoppard crafts sentences, phrases, the way he can make literature delicious.A very tasty read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Presentation","review":"The book looked lousy on my Kindle Fire, was difficult to read, and I wondered why.

The Shakespearian sense of humor is certainly not always mine to say the least, but I'm not used to feeling as if I simply missed the boat entirely. I suppose my overall reaction would have to be a resounding \\"Hunh?\\" (Perhaps \\"Ho hunh!?\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring play, BUT...","review":"I gave Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead only one star, because that's how I felt about this play when I first saw it performed. At the time, I was just a kid who was unfamiliar with the story of Hamlet. To me it was boring, made no sense, and was not the least bit funny.HOWEVER... If you love Hamlet and know the story well, you will love this play. Before making any hasty judgements on Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, I strongly urge you to either read or watch Hamlet. Only then can you appreciate this play for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"grossly overrated","review":"Hard to believe all the good reviews here. This is a silly little book, with no story, no coherent dialog, and no meaning. Worst of all the jokes are not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful. An attempt at intelligent playwriting, gone wrong","review":"This play was designed to show a lighter side to Hamlet. The idea of using familiar characters is not exactly original and Stoppard fails in all attempts at humour. The play is muddled and seemingly without direction. This may be an illusion created by Stoppard but it seems to me to show a lack of certainty as to what to do next."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION!!!","review":"I bought the Kindle edition of the play and received commentary rather than the actual play. I don't know if Amazon is aware of this mistake, but until they are, DO NOT BUY THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny!","review":"very funny book and interesting twist on hamlet. read it for a class in school, but i would recommend it to anyone whether or not you are a shakespeare fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing since grilled cheese","review":"I loved this play. It is amazing because it has so much entertainment value, but it also has a great deal of intellectual quality and deep understanding. It's hilarious and thought-provoking. An awesome read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I absolutly love this play. Rosencrantz's philisophical ramblings are a riot and the only thing better is his and Guildenstern's back and forth. I saw the movie but I had to read the actual play because I can really slowdown and absorb every little line for all it's greatness. I actually it while on jury duty and it made the day a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Entertaining than Hamlet","review":"In his best-known play, Tom Stoppard takes absurdist theater to its height! The play's main characters, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, are two minor characters in Shakepeare's Hamlet. In Stoppard's play, the action takes place off-stage during of a product of Hamlet; much of it centers around the two characters' confusion about the play as well as the world around them.Yet, amid their nonsense ramblings, Stoppard has Rosencrantz and Guildernstern cleverly remind us of some universal truths, largely expounding on the theory of existentialism. If you are a fan of the theater of Samuel Beckett or Harold Pinter, if you devour the works of Albert Camus, or if you simply enjoy language-play in general, this is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer brilliance","review":"I've seen a few reviews here that say \\"read it, but don't go see it.\\" Most of the time, I would probably agree, because most people who do the play don't get it; they think it's a straightforward comedy, and it is almost anything but.R&G; is all about pace; except for a couple of spots, if the pace isn't almost franticly precise, the end loses its entire effect. The beginning of the second act\\"Hmmm?\\"\\"Yes?\\"\\"What?\\"\\"I thought you...\\"\\"No.\\"\\"Ahh.\\"takes a lot of work to get right; someone missing a beat is almost as bad as someone walking through the invisible fourth wall.Guildenstern has the first real line in the play: \\"There's an art to the building up of suspense.\\" If you aren't on the edge of your seat when the penultimate scene begins, then the director and the actors have missed the boat.Unfortunately, nothing Mr Stoppard has done since is quite as good. His plays are good, especially if you like the Pinteresque types, but just not quite as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant. Insightful. Humourous. Artful.","review":"Have you ever wondered exactly what became of the two men who accompanied Hamlet to his death, only to have it turned around, and instead be their own?This story answers that question; and goes on to explore death, life, probability, and everything.Your mind will be dashed to bits by the amazingly well paced and versed dialogue; and you'll be thankful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Play","review":"Video doesn't play on my Sony tv.

They were originally published as separate pieces, mostly in \\"The New Yorker\\", but I wonder whether the author had this collection in mind from the start.The labeling of this book as fiction puzzles me. As far as I can tell from internal evidence, it's acually a non-fictional memoir. An introduction by the author would have been welcome.Fans of William Maxwell's fiction interested in learning about the author's background will find this book very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a MUST for every parent!","review":"We've got a young family, but the topics within the pages of this book are phenominal for all age groups in your family. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is interested in teaching their children principles that will last them a lifetime. Making them good citizens in their communities! Hooray for the efforts of this couple. A sister of mine knew them and they are everything in person, behind closed door and in their community as they are in this book. It is nice to see someone REALLY practicing what they preach. Not only will it make you a better parent, but it will also help you become an improved spouse, friend and member of your community!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great reference book for ALL ages","review":"I was looking for a book that helped me teach ethics and values to my children and this is it! The book is formatted with a chapter for each \\"value\\" (honesty, etc) and then broken down by age, with discussions and ideas that are age-appropriate--from preschool thru high school.I am a fairly liberal parent. My husband and I have different religions. I found that this book was not heavy-handed or overly religious. It really seemed to stick with the actions and thoughts around each ethic. And studies have shown that ethical education is effective for children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UNREALISTIC","review":"Maybe in the perfect world children act as this book illustrates. If parents made children have such family discussions and play such games as the authors describe, the children would crack up laughing (especially school age children and adolescents). The book has about 7 games and discussions methods that they just change words to apply to different values. They receive two stars only because they did make some good points, such as teach by example, praise, and listen. However the rest of the book is filled with stupid games that no child I know would ever play. I, honestly, feel bad for their nine children who had to experience all these stupid discussions and games. Also, monetary awards do almost nothing for children, and that is the award type the Eyre's use. So, in effect, they are paying the childrent to play those stupid activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I love the Eyres!

He's traveling with two mistresses and he wants to bed Emma, and thinks she'll go for it? The fact that he hadn't gotten rid of them early on boggled my mind. Then the middle of the book was better, and more intriguing. But towards the end Emma lost her faith in everything and decided the best thing to do would be to run away from the mess one the courtesans began, leaving the poor students with no headmistress to run their school. She doesn't give Grey a chance, and even calls in her friends to help, who really did nothing more than agree with her and say she's in love with Grey. But it was all wrapped up very nicely at the very end. All in all, a book definitely worthy of reading. The two problems are made up for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"Okay, the story isn't dreadful, but most of the characters are shallow. Compared to other books in this genre, this is a weak contender. The author attempts to convince the reader she is writing a \\"Regency\\" novel by overwhelming the story with adjectives such as \\"jaded\\" or \\"cynical\\"--obviously all heroes must be dukes no less, who radiate such qualities. Nothing original here. Dozens of better authors exist--Lindsey, Coulter, Quick, Laurens etc. Don't waste time reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....Silly Story","review":"The synopsis sounded interesting and the reviews were good.

I bought A Matter of Scandal based on some very high recommendations. After getting 1/2 way through the book, I am very disappointed!! While I like the plot of the book with the wager, I felt that the story could have been better developed overall.What distracted/frustrated me most was the fact that Grey brought along his shallow friends and those simpering women!! They kept getting in the way of what could have been a more romantic, fun story.I think Grey's arrogance was a bit over the top!! He just really wasn't my favorite type of romantic hero. Emma was developed a bit more than Grey. If she had been paired up with a stronger hero this story may have worked for me.I am going to donate this book and a few of my other \\"recommended\\" books to a nursing home, hospital, or local library. Otherwise, it will collect dust on my bookshelf from lack of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found myself skimming...","review":"I've read several Suzanne Enoch books -- this is not one of her best. I was just kind of bored with it. The main characters were likeable enough, but the story never really draws you in, and after a while it gets rather tedious. Try reading Dare's story in \\"The Rake\\" and the other two \\"Lessons in Love\\" books by Enoch for a much better respresentation of her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What awful people","review":"I thought this book was a disappointment. A really stupid 'wager' results when Emma refuses to pay her rent increase because the land-owner has a rich nephew, the Duke of Wycliffe, and he can afford to support them for free. Throughout the book all the characters say how arrogant he is (including all his friends), but its never pointed out that she's as arrogant if not more so than he...certain that she literally knows everything better than anyone else. Everyone over 18 in this book is shallow and selfish. Grey wants everyone to do things his way, she wants the same thing, his guests are leeches, his uncle is an idiot, Freddie is evil, Tristan is plotting against his 'friend' for a lark. Its definitely not the worst book I've every read, but I found the plot and characters very unengaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable fluffy read, witty author","review":"I was surprised at how often this book had me laughing out loud, and that alone is the reason I gave it 5 stars instead of 4. The dry sarcasm in several comments was hilarious. I enjoyed the characters. Mentally quick Emma is a school headmistress and falls for the duke. The arrogant and condescending duke dislikes and distrusts all women. He believes the school does nothing more than teach girls how to trap a husband. He ends up changing his mind about the school and the students, and of course he falls for Emma. I'm going to try more from this author.

I became a fan of his work from a music sampler (song was Market Day- another album). I bought 3 of his albums, this being the last...I was not disappointed. I found this album a bit different from Night to Night and Beat The Border, meaning it had some more \\"traditional sounding\\" stuff on it. By that I mean stuff I deem as more traditional African music via beat and style. Not bad, but not what I love about G. I fell in love with the somber low voice of Geoffrey, and this album continues that style. I am glad I found him as an artist, and this album continues to solidify him as a wonderful and powerful singer. Simple can be better! If you have any of his albums and want more this is a great addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, perfect","review":"His rhythms are impeccable. His voice is a smooth & gentle hero.

I don't even know how this got published. It is chock full of atrocious falsities, misspellings, and story-like nonsense. Aside from all that, the book is also told in a very racist context, and practicioners of capoeira know that capoeira unites the races, not creates something to segregate. Capoeiristas come in every age, gender, race, and nationality. I would definately advise writing to the publisher to get this book off the presses. This book spreads the disease of ignorance. Avoid this \\"publication\\" at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"i put it in my trash can","review":"This book was a complete waste of my time and money. As I read it, I wondered if the author actually had any idea what capoeira is.

I just feel bad for the rest of the people who actually bought this thinking they would learn about capoeira."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is still too much","review":"This author had no factual information and had ascant viewpoint into the actual waycapoeira is played and lived.

Anyonewho said that this book would enhance their viewpoint and knowledge of capoeira, then they should learn more about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"African Brazilian \\"Karate\\"?!!","review":"At first I thought that the author's titling of the book using the word \\"karate\\" was a joke.\\"Capoeira: African Brazilian Martial Art\\"Now that is how it should've have been titled. Karate just doesn't equate with Capoeira. Any martial art having to do with \\"karate\\" is of course Japanese, or of it's influence thereof. It's really sad that this book has even gotten this far with a title like that. My suggestion? Shy away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An twisted an Racist look at capoeira","review":"This book not only contains false hoods about Capoeira, but also makes it to be percieved as a black against white issue. Capoeira is a martial art that uses fluidity and grace to master it. When one such as Mr. Salaam uses such racialy idealistic notations it clearly makes it out to be rigid and unliberating. All other books I've read on Capoeira are about the art itself, are informative, and very very well written, this is the worst exception, not only should this book be read as an example of what Capoeira is not, but what we all should not posses in our hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capoeira: A Dangerous Subject in the Hands of the Ignorant","review":"It is difficult to review this \\"book\\" due to the fact that it's very poorly written, it lacks structure, and it has no particular point or theme beyond its blatant pro-African American agenda. The sad thing is that there is a very powerful connection between Capoeria and Africa, but the author misses the point completely by indulging in ficitional (and often downright incoherent) tribal Capoeira fantasies, rather than delving into its the actual history and traditions.Poor penmanship can be forgiven, but this \\"book\\" is just plain irresponsible, without substance and grossley misleading to anyone looking for information about Capoeira"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm contacting the \\"publisher\\" now!","review":"I'm thrilled there's been so many accurate reviews for this title, telling of its misconceptions and predjudices.

Can anyone recommend a great bhangra cd for dancing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As delightful as the film itself","review":"The soundtrack of the film Bride and Prejudice is a delight to listen to and infectious. While listening to it I couldn't helping humming to myself or even singing aloud, not mentioning the private bathroom dancing I performed.The more I listen to the music, the more I am getting to like it, even those songs I was not so fond of when first seeing the film. It has a charm that grows on you gradually.The wedding song is funny and exotic at the same time, makes you feel part of a different, but exciting and rich culture. The song \\"a marriage has come to town\\" is one of my favourites, so are the 2 exotic and sexy songs performed by Ashanti. I was very happy when I saw that the song \\"Arrogance, pride and vanity\\" -which unfortunately was cut out of the film, although you can find it on the dvd in the Special featurette - is actually included on the cd.If you like the film, you shouldn't miss out on the soundtrack either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie - great music!","review":"I don't know anything about this type of music. That said, after watching (and then purchasing) the movie, my kids got so hooked on the music I ordered the CD. This is a lot of fun to listen to and dance along with. My daughter knows all of the words to \\"No life without wife\\" and I must admit it is a rather catchy little song. Drives my husband nuts though. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Bride and Prejudice CD","review":"My favorite song was #1 the Panjabi wedding song. I play it over and over. The reast of the CD I also good.

Most of all is just cheerful and bring a smile to your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three good Pooh stories","review":"This is a nice little selection of Winnie-the-Pooh tales, and the simple, sparsely-placed black and white drawings keep the emphasis on the text, which you might or might not this is a good thing.The first story involves Pooh eating too much honey and getting stuck in a hole; the second involves a hunt for a Heffalump which Pooh manages to foil (this story was recently made into a movie); the final story is a real charmer in which Pooh, Piglet, and the other members of the cast try to scrape together some rather dismal presents for Eeyore on his birthday.Children like Pooh, and this book does a good job of capitalizing on this fact to get a child to read, rather than just look at the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few laughs, but has been done before","review":"There were a few laughs early in Lucy Kellaway's lightweight corporate parody. The jargon wielding life-coach, the cringe of over-enthusiastic corporate re-branding, and anti-hero Martin Lukes' negotiation over how much he is prepared to commit to being \\"better than the best he can be,\\" make for some grins in the first few chapters.However the same basic device has been used before, and is better executed, in Matt Beaumont's \\"e,\\" and as the book developed, it reminded me more of a grown-up Adrian Mole, though without the comparative subtlety of that series, and lacking the capacity to reflect naivety of the main character in the way that Sue Townsend (and more recently Mark Haddon in \\"The Curious Incident...\\", ironically fleetingly referred to in this book) achieved.I was ultimately disappointed in this book because, although it does not position itself as anything more than light humour, it has to work hard to get to that, and it offers nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soggy pain au chocolat","review":"I picked up this book for its 1) catchy cover and 2) author whose opinions and style I enjoy in her FT column. But I was disapointed by the dryness of the whit (borderline suicidal) and the lack of contrast between different correspondents (this is an epistolary novel). It seems the main character addresses his mom in the same way he writes to his wife/boss/colleagues/son. It's at times a colourful read but definitely not a gripping tale or an \\"instant classic\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work","review":"The idea of narrating a novel through emails is not a bad one, but it doesn't really work. At least not in Who Moved My Blackberry. What starts out as funny ends up being tiresome, and the main character is too obnoxious and egocentric to keep the reader's interest. The book does show a corporate world that is shallow and somewhat ridiculous, and that might be good enough for an 800-word column, but it's not for a 368-page novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A monkey could have written this.","review":"This book was bad. Really bad. Unfunny and just trying way too hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corporatis Absurdum","review":"This is one of the funniest books I have read in long time. Brilliantly executed as a series of Blackberry-sent emails from Martin Lukes, a delusional marketing executive, it goes for the corporate jugular on the many stupid things executives do and say. It also takes dead aim on one of the hottest executive trends today: The personal coach.Being both a marketer and working for an executive coaching firm, the author (Lucy Kellaway) just nails how branding can be stupid & overused (Crovation TM) as well as how poor executive coaches sit behind a host of adjectives and exclamation marks (\`be 22.5% better than your bestest!').If you want pure escapism, for you or a holiday treat for a Blackberry-aholic, this is the book. Warning: Very addictive reading...when it's finished, you'll want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackberry Addicts","review":"It's a great gift for all those who are unable to leave the modern toy alone, even in restaurants and at the dinner table.

I laughed the whole way through and recommended it to everyone I know.

An easy read and light hearted. Definitely worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Product works great, but picture is deceptive","review":"There's two pictures on the listing, the second is the actual product.

PSK mixes 80's influenced rock and pop with techno dance sounds and outstanding tight harmonies. This is loud, brash pop/rock that is relentlessly fun. Its clear that Pop Star Kids are a rock band with a unique sound that dares to be different while delivering hook after hook of tight, colorful Power Pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound of a session, not a studio","review":"The album does a fantastic job of capturing the sound of a pub session, which is the natural habitat of the music. Many other traditional music CD's sound sterile, as if they're classical pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music at Matt Molloy's","review":"This is a great album for anyone who enjoys celtic, irish, bluegrassy, or something similar. I heard about it from a friend who loves celtic music. It is a live recording done at Matt Molloy's pub in Dublin. Good quality music all around, especially the amazing irish flute playing of Matt himself. There's a good mix of energetic and also slow, more mellow songs which give the album a well rounded appeal. I also recommend John Whelan's \\"Celtic Fire\\", Lunasa's \\"the merry sisters of fate\\", Solas's \\"Sunny spells and scattered showers\\", and the Chieftains' \\"boil the breakfast early\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"The tray is cheap plastic!

Since I could not find it in the store anymore, I ordered it online. Disappointingly, it came in a plain brown box like bulk packaging and the stone did not look near the quality of the old one. I did not try it however, and sent it straight back. The Sassafras stones used to come in a nice box etc. - the way this was packaged make me think they just sold their name to someone who markets it cheaply through Amazon.

I had been baking my homemade pizzas on metal cookie sheets. Nothing compares with how golden this crust comes out. It is crisp on the bottom (not soggy at all) but with a nice thick chewy edge. The pizza is more of a small-medium pizza pan, but perfect for 2-3 people."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"Used it three times and even subjected it to thermal shock by putting it into a 475 degree oven with no preheating.

I initially used if for desserts, like coffee cakes, but found cornbread, and deep dish pizza worked great in it, too. I used this product faithfully for the last 15 years, then dropped it on my porcelain tile floor. It broke, and I got online immediately to try to replace it.I was so happy to find the same exact brand and size. I received my new dish several weeks ago, and have used it multiple times since for pizza, cornbread, biscuits, and rolls. Just remember to spray with oil, and breads will come out easily.

Instead, only 4 of the books are of the original print edition, the other 2 are from later print editions. You can tell as they book covers do not have the same style as the other 4. Also, seller stated that they are in 'Very Good' condition... they are not. All the books are creased, dog-tagged or exhibit some form of water damage. There's even a receipt that was provided that they bought these books for 3.79 each. If i wanted damaged books i would have paid that myself.

The Germans built planes for 30% of the manhours the English required. They did this because of the differences in the social contract and the education system. Read this book to understand what we are doing wrong and what we do right. I came away with more respect for M. Thacher and the changes she is made to England and an better understanding for the strong points and weak points of our society.I wonder if anyone else has ever read this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This touched my heart","review":"No other autobiography I have read has ever been this powerful. I was pulled into Gelsey's heart and felt her pain. She is probably the most beautiful and amazing dancer that ever was in America. Yet she did not feel beautiful. I could relate to all of Gelsey's struggles and emotional hardships. I recommend this book to all those who enjoy autobiographies, all who enjoy ballet, and especially to those who wish to become dancers. It gives a truly realistic view into the dance world. Will become a favourite.

However, Kirkland comes across as self-centered, snobbish and shows no ability to take responsibility for her own problems (she derides ballet administrators and choregraphers both for treating its dancers and children and not saving her from herself). A little cheese with that whine, Gels?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A narcissist, depressing look at the dance world...","review":"...and really, it's not always that bad. While this book may give a behind-the-scenes look at the demanding life of a dancer (I know, I am one), it seems more like Kirkland was attempting to make readers pity her. If she wants people to admire her for what she did in her life... it's not happening. She may have been an amazing ballerina, I'll give her that, but writing is obviously not her strong point. Stick to the stage, Gelsey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to study a clinical Narcissist, Gelsey's it","review":"This biography could be the study of a clinical narcissist. Kirkland expounds on her adventures in plastic surgery (silicone lips and breasts), drug abuse, anorexia and promiscuity. Finally, she finds love in the arms of a fellow cocaine addict, who sounds like (and resembles) Norman Bates with literary pretensions. I felt sorry for the other people who had to come in contact with this self-obsessed prima donna on speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating Psyc Case, Frustrating Dancer","review":"True,Kirkland should be commended for her ability to tell all; few dancers mention anything in their books to put them in a bad light. Nevertheless, I find her to come across as completely self-absorbed, so much that she can't even really let herself go as a dancer. God forbid, she actually ever let spontinaeity take over! And as far as I'm concerned, there's no excuse for all the trouble she got herself into. The vast majority of professional dancers manage to swim rather than sink, and she could've done the same. Still, it is a fascinating book because of how the workings of her mind are put so blatantly out on paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical, enthralling...","review":"One of the best autobiographies written by *anyone* let alone a dancer.

Her descriptions and observations are vivid and insightful, and, if you read her continuation, \\"The Shape of Love,\\" you will be even more impressed. I read this book when I was 16 and it was a turning point in my life. It helped me to recognise theme in my life, and though I have never had drug or any other kind of addiciton, I was inspired by her ability to overcome it and go on to another stage of her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Gelsey Kirkland did an excellent job writing her biography, Dancing on my Grave. It is a book about the hard life of a dancer, and how dedicated and hard-working you have to be to \\"make-it\\" in show buisness. But, she doesn't only do this, Gelsey also shows us the pressure that results from this perfection needed and how her life was sculped with this pressure. I loved this book, and hope that one day I will get to meet Gelsey, her book inspired me so much! :)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing on my Grave review","review":"This book written brilliantly by Gelsey Kirkland and Greg Lawrence is positively a book that I would recommend to all dancers like myself as well as anyone that is intregued by the effects of the dance world. In this book Gelsey takes us through a journey of chaos and problems. When you read this book you travel through the abusive effects of drugs as well as more dancer prone problems like eating disorders and self-image. You also see the beutiful side of the ballet world and it helps you relize how much work ballet dancers put into their passion and how little they get out of it. Gelsey and Greg did a great job at showing the reader dancer or not how hard and sometimes impossible the dance world can be. Over all in my humble opinion I think that this one is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping from Target in 1 to 2 weeks!","review":"Yeah Right, BEWARE...

How do YOU deal with a high horizon? What is YOUR sense of the abstract? Each exercise has a painting that \\"models\\" the challenge in some way.

The extra features are a plus. If you are a Jem fan like myself, you will watch these DVDs over and over. My cousin who is only 7, loves Jem. Although Jem is before her time, she says this cartoon is so much better than the cartoons of today. And of course, I agree with her 100 percent. Thanks Rhino for releasing these 26 epsiodes on DVDs.

Get Captain N out, get Thundercats out, get the original Ninja Turtles out, get the original Inspector Gadget out, get Wowser out, get Galaxy High out, get Sharky and George out, get The Real Ghostbusters out!There are a whole bunch more that deserve a DVD release far more than Jem does, so what are you waiting for.If you agree with me then please click yes rather than just passing by, that way the DVD companies might wake up and start releasing the good stuff.P.SNo offence to all those Jem fans out there.

They act out scenarios now and sing the songs!! Granted, you can tell the cartoons were done in the 80's, they are not really enhanced at all, but still good.

Jem was an amazing TV show for kids, especially girls growing up in the 80s. They featured totally independent and strong women who defined \\"girl power\\" of those days! I'm beyond exicted to see that this is coming out on DVD. The songs are catchy and are ones that I still find myself humming once in a while especially when I wish for simpler days and want to be transported back to my childhood.

It would with any but the most expensive pro audio equipment.

The book's author spends time telling us just how great a director Ang Lee is and how each actor in the movie is the best actor ever and how the Hulk himself is the best comic character of all. With only a few interesting notes(a full color reprint of The Incredible Hulk no. 1, some behind the scenes photos of the old Hulk TV show, and some pics from the upcoming movie) and spending most of the time it ends up making fun of comics, this book is recommended for only the most avid of Hulk fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"for completests only...","review":"What a waste! This is not an \\"encyclopedia\\" at all...it's more a like a presskit for the \\"Hulk\\" movie. After reading it, I had gained NOTHING in the way of new insight into one of Marvel's oldest characters. In fact, the sections of amatuer psychological analysis is embarrassing to read. While not 100% happy with volumes one and two, which I purchased at the same time as this volume, the previous books stand mountains above this exspensively-printed drival. There's a good reason why the book is wrapped in cellophane - Unless you are a fanatical completest, skip this volume. The same author is atributed to the upcoming Spiderman volume, but unless it's more inline with volumes one and two, I won't be buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great overview of the Hulk, but NOT an encyclopedia","review":"First of all, this book is probably a great buy for Hulk fans if you want some background on the Hulk in comics, TV, animation, and the new movie. It also includes three comic stories- the first Hulk story, a sample issue of the current series, and the issue of the Ultimates with the Hulk. However, anyone looking for a repeat of the terrific X-Men Encyclopedia, or even the mediocre Marvel Encyclopedia Vol. 1, will be disappointed, as there is VERY little encyclopedic information. (One reason I think it's a bit unfair that it's shrinkwrapped- in stores, you can't tell what you're getting.) The Hulk Incredible Guide by Tom DeFalco is MUCH better for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an Encyclopedia?","review":"After finishing the first chapter, I knew I had just thrown away $.... You'd think the Hulk was invented by Axel Alonzo and Bruce Jones. What about the other four decades? Garbage. It never gets better.You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"Marvel Encyclopedia: The Hulk is one big let down when it comes to the Marvel Encyclopeida series. The author, Kit Kiefer does not take the subject seriously. For every fact he states about either the comic, tv show or movie, he makes a sarcastic comment to go with it. He admits that he is not a fan of the Hulk. Overall this book is a campy nonsense look at the history of the Hulk. I really can't see comic fans or even hardcore Hulk fans enjoying this book.If you are new to the character of the Hulk (because of the new movie) and want to read about his history, you're better off passing on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't have paid $1 for it....","review":"...if I knew what ignorant (Bruce Jones wasn't the only writer on the Hulk that made an impact) and deliberate misinformation (Glenn Talbot died in a volcano in HULK #260) this book was trying to promote. Rather than use flip commentary and catchy alliterations, the author should have focused more on what made the Hulk popular in his hey-day thru the decades. The most aggrivating part of the book was the slights to two of the Hulk's longest-running creators: Sal Buscema (with a 10 year career as artist from 1975-1985) and Peter David (with his stunning writing career from 1987-1998). I'd recommend this as toilet paper, but because of the heavy paper stock, it wouldn't be a good idea. Best bet would be to cut out the \\"purty pichers\\" and use the rest as kindling on that long-awaited camping trip.For a COMPLETELY ACCURATE guide/encyclopedia to the Hulk, get the \\"Ultimate Guide to the Hulk\\" written by Tom DeFalco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant complain much more than these guys...","review":"As many people said about Vol. 1 of this set, this vol. seems to just be a big advertisment. So far vol. 2 was good although it was missing some stuff, but this was just flat out an attempt to get you to go see the movie. and as for the spiderman volume, guess what comes out around the same time? yep, so that volume probably wont be much better than this one.

It was a Christmas gift for our 7 year old son. Granted the age on this toy is 5+, but our son is interested in regular pool, so we figured it would be neat to get this so he could get the idea of what it was all about. Yes, it's a fun game...if you can get through it without any pieces falling off and/or breaking! Just received our replacement Skittle Pool in the mail today and, already, it is broken. It truly is a piece of garbage as far as quality goes. It's all plastic...the \\"A\\" frames (two are included) are warped, making for total inaccuracy when \\"shooting\\" the cue ball. The plastic piece that sticks up out of the swivel arm (which a stationery cue ball sort of gets inserted on) snapped off ~ one of the reasons we needed a replacement game...and then one snapped off the replacement!! For the price, I would think they could invest a little bit more money and make this game a bit more sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction, but decently fun","review":"Table under felt is plastic, not wood and therefore not very flat. This is mitigated by the fact that the balls don't have to travel far, but obviously a flat surface is the most important quality aspect of this game.The swivel \\"aimers\\" are not constructed with precision. One is very tight and sticky, which is very annoying, and the other loose, which is less annoying.Still my 4yo is having decent fun and probably improving his coordination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skittle Pool Table","review":"This is a nice game, but not very child friendly.

Be sure to look at the dimensions because you'd be lucky to serve more than a single glass of any beverage. It might be handy to use to serve sauces or gravy but for those purposes I would want a tray underneath. We returned ours because we couldn't figure out what to use it for and purchased a reasonably sized water pitcher instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The book is more of a product catalogue for life formations thanit is a resource guide.

The pictures and text give the history of some bamboo types, leaf/wood samples, use in the garden for both visual effect and to build with. Bamboo's versatility in the garden extends well beyond just adding an Asian flavor to an area. That said, my only critique would be the need for a better way the species can be identified. You can figure out plants to the Genus using this book, but nailing which plant species it is can be foggy. Mr. Bell did a great job introducing a new plant for most gardeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bamboo resource","review":"I stumbled upon this book before I was about to purchase a bambusa vulgaris. This book was well written, informative and visually appealing. Since, I live out near the water, I needed to know how to care for and successfully grow bamboo in my backyard. With the help of this book, I have maintained a couple of potted bamboo plants outside and a giant one indoors. Helpful to a novice bamboo grower like myself, but also a good reference to keep always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mustt-Mustt work by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan Sahab","review":"This is not the best by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, but gives one an example of how much command Nusrat has on his vocals and on Sufi Music.

Nusrat's music appeals more when its not remixed by Bally Sagoo, Bengal or someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"give this album a break","review":"While I agree that Nusrat unproduced in the raw is the way he was meant to be heard, and anyone who can pick up videos of him performing in Birmingham England at some local center, will be amazed. But this album has its brilliant moments. I think noone can own music and sound, and we love music because we love experimentation and allow artists to interpret and reinterpret styles. I think anyone who thinks that all the music that ever will be has been written , and that everything else is derivative misses the point of creativity. I mean if musicians can come together, so can people of different nations come together in other ways. Artists allow us to bring cultures together, and unite instead of divide. I know thats alot to place on one album, but I believe in pure qawalli and I believe in this blend as well, both are art. So Cheers to the makers of this. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very medioce stuff from a master singer","review":"This CD presents the magnificent voice of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and some of his regular musical family playing with Western musicians, and treated to the \\"enhancements\\" of studio technicians and DJs. For those unfamiliar with him this may well be a knock-your-socks-off experience. However, for those who have been followers of Nusrat's career this is watered down stuff indeed. It is ironic that after the usual diddling/remixing which seems a necessary part of pop music recording today that the result should be such a limp product compared to his \\"old fashion\\" performances. Clearly producer Michael Brook simply wasnt up to dealing with the incandescent power of the real Nusrat. If you think this slick production is great stuff - listen to his untampered with qawwali recordings and have your heart medication handy, 'cause you ain't heard nothin yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocal Clarity with Heart","review":"Critics always comment on the clarity and precision of Laskhmi Shankar's melodious voice, with it's three octave range.

You might as well just look up how to calibrate your TV on the internet using Blu Ray disks like Ice Age or Dark Knight or whatever.

The disc provides plenty of information on how to calibrate your TV and why without providing too much information to confuse the viewer. You may choose to watch the informative portion or you can skip the information and just use the calibration tools.Some users may find the disc disappointing if they are expecting the disc to make their TV look better. Unless your settings are way off, you may not even notice any changes. Avid A/V junkies will enjoy knowing their TV is calibrated as it should be.

On the front of the package it claims \\"Easy to use HD set-up toolkit.\\" That couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth. You'll be way over your head in technical jargon and explanations that are completely useless to the basic user wanting to calibrate their HDTV. This disc features a horrible menu system that is confusing to navigate and understand. It took me awhile to figure out where to go to calibrate my set without hearing the lecture about the evolution of HD. The narrator will talk FOREVER about what adjustments you'll eventually have to make but you'll never know when exactly to make those adjustments.

Once I bought it (like three years ago at Circuit City) I noticed that it didn't look as good as some of the store display models that had been calibrated. I noticed at the store they were showing The Hulk and it looked awesome, so I bought the same movie to try to make it look as good. I got pretty close, and I was happy with that. I recently realized it didn't look as good as I thought it should, so I bought this disc. Worst. Idea. Ever.This disc is so boring, so ineffective, so lame that I feel someone owes me my $19 back. I followed the (lame, boring) steps and the tv doesn't look much better.

There is NO explanation on HOW to use the color gels. what is the right configuration? or wrong one? especially for red and green.If you go to his website, you'll find that there is NO phone number, NO email and NO support available! Perhaps he was overwhelmed with all the incoming questions that his video raises? but fails to answer?This has the capacity a GREAT video... but only if there was someone more caring about the viewers experience... and not so self absorbed in jargon that really doesn't apply to the end result: A BETTER LOOKING PICTURE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised at the praise","review":"I purchased the DVD to adjust a 50\\" Panasonic plasma TV. I tend now to think that these things are the toys of the compulsive. The actual number and degree of adjustment that you will likely encounter is borderline trivial. The final result is certainly trivial. The problem is not that it's too technical: in fact there is far less there than meets the eye. Perhaps the Panasonic comes so artfully adjusted there is no need, or alternatively the exuberance noted in some of the earlier reviews is rationalization for that \\"compulsive's\\" purchase habit. In any case - save your money, or if you are determined to buy... lower your expectations.

It just breezes through it and still leaves you with questions.I was disappointed at the lack of instructional content and guidance.

There's some references to people's luck being drained from them when one of the other luckies touches them, but this is never really explained satisfactorily. The characters' storylines are never really fleshed out to let us know who's who and what their relationships are to each other.

It did nothing to forward the story and after two books on the characters, I think we got the point.

It took her six years after Through A Glass to finish this one - I would have thought that would be more than enough time. The story is SSSSSOOOOOOOO BORING and totally predictable!

It seemed to me that Ms. Koen wasn't sure whether to write one or two novels and wrote one that just isn't good. She seemed to be setting the background for her next novel rather than just writing a good novel. She is a good writer. It is just a shame that she seemed to be going off in two different directions at the same time. She didn't seem able to bring the two stories together. She didn't do justice to either the Jacobites or the tobacco growers of the south."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much historical information","review":"I loved Karleen's previous book Through A Glass Darkly but this sequel did not live up to my expectations.

I think good writing is communicating in the simplest way possible, not in trying to impress the reader with the author's vocabulary and ability to construct impenetrable, wannabe-sophisticated, long, compound sentences.Don't get me wrong, I'm an engineer and I've got a decent vocabulary and fairly decent language skills.I've found the books by Murray N.

Tracks that more than make this disc a keeper are the almost pre-Zeppelin like seven-minute \\"DA Blues\\", the powerful \\"Cars\\", \\"Everyday\\", the awesome \\"Time Seller\\" and \\"Hot Days\\" which certainly makes for good road music.

I honestly think it could be damaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Cherie Bennet's Usual Standards","review":"Now, I know this is not a truly serious piece of fiction. It's fluff and it's meant to be a quick read, so do not think that I went into the book with the wrong mindset. I have read Cherie Bennet's books for years, not just the Sunset Island ones but others as well (I believe there is one called Whatever Happened to Amber, that I would recommend) I was very excited about this book when it arrived, but after reading it was quite dissapointed. The book's plot was an interesting one, but it was not very well written and comes across as being completely and utterly cheesy. A better book dealing with a sudden change in how one establishes one's identity is Izzy Willy-Nilly, by Cynthia Voight. It doesn't deal with weight gain, but it addresses almost the exact same issues with a much more insightful and in depth view. Skip this book unless it's the last one you have in your house to read, and get something better to occupy yourself with until then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not plausible but still a good read.","review":"This book is entirely fictional and feels it, but that's okay. The life lessons and issues surrounding the main characters very fictional disease are very real. I love how the author shows the experiences of someone who quickly gains a lot of weight. Those experiences are painfully accurate. I have a sleep disorder that after being left untreated, I gained 70 pounds. It was EXACTLY like this book. The humiliation, the relationship strains, etc. And I am an adult! I stumbled across this and couldn't put it down. Now that I am on the downside of my weight, I wish there was a sequel to this book as I would like to see what the author would have done with the newly transformed Lara."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Read the review by Anna Weiser-Woodward","review":"Life in the Fat Lane, by Cherie Bennet is a story to open your eyes to different point of views, and what it's like to be pitied. Lara has little time between her family and friends, but discovers she has a rare diseas where you gain weight rapidly, even if you eat nothing. The plot moves along smoothly, although Lara's life does not.I'd give this book two thumbs up. It is a great example of how body image influences everyone.

It's a perfect insight of what life is like in the fat lane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Livin' in tha Fat Lane","review":"Well i wasn't exactly sure how high i should rate it probably actually a 31/2 which is good.

I found it to play characters out stereotypically, but most stories tend to. It does make you take a 2nd look at how you treat everyone. it also, well, at least made me weight conscious although i already was. Its a good little book to take some of your frusturation out and read on a rainy day.

I fight with my dad all the time, but my parents' divorce was different than hers, my mom walked out on us, but I put that behind me, and the tables turned when my dad, decided that I didn't need counseling, or I didn't need my mom, he thought I was just fine the was I was, boy was he wrong!!!!! But no matter how much I need to be with my mom, he doesn't care about that, he thinks I'm fine where I am!!

Now Lara will find out who her true friends really are and the \\"in-crowd\\" starts to completely shut her out. I really enjoyed this book because the story is so real. The characters are everyday people and it really explains what high school and are society is like. People are so unaccepting to others with weight problems.

The reading level is 5.2 and the interest level is for grades 9-12. I don't recommend this book for anyone who is below the 9th grade because of issues with body image, family relations and minor adult content. While this book's genre is coming of age, I would recommend it mostly for female readers. Life in the Fat Lane has a lot of dialog between characters and is extremely detailed. This novel could easily be made into a movie. The story is through the eyes of Lara Ardeche. The reader reads what she is cognitively thinking, what she says, and discovers all events as Lara encounters them. The overall theme for Life in the Fat Lane is that self acceptance is more important than if others accept you or do not accept you. I liked this book and enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Read It Three Times","review":"I juat loved this book so much, maybe because I am a girl likw Lara who isn't always perfect and who definitely has had to deal with some changes to my body that I had nothing to do with. My parents are very tall, and when I turned thirteen at the beginning of last year I just started to grow and grow. I don't think that the author wants everyone to feel sorry for Lara, or even to like her all the time. There were definitely times she was a jerk and mean, and definitely times she felt sorry for herself. But reading this book made me grow a lot, and I think it will do the same for any girl. It is a hard book to put down, and I got new stuff from it each time I read it.

Her father had an affair with a young woman and when her mother found out she overdosed on valiums. They soon enough moved to Michigan to start their life over.

As I poured freshly brewed coffee inside the coffeepot, it cracked from the inside out. Considering the coffeepot was previously at room temperature and it's currently quite hot where we live, there is no possibility of a temperature shock leading to a potential crack in china. My husband and I were very disappointed with this, as we were expecting the Villeroy Boch china to be of high quality, and a coffeepot should be made so as to resist hot/warm temperatures.

Not because I enjoy being a critic, but as a caution to anyone looking for a good ghost story."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE KEEPER","review":"This is not just another horror book about a small, cursed town and all of the people in it. Sure, it has all the perfect elements in place: a page-turner plot with that ever-present sense of dread and creepiness. Susan Marley, who just can't seem to stay dead. A dreary atmosphere. Lots of violence. The oh-man this is gross storyline that keeps you reading. And reading. As the tension and horror grows, you will not be able to look away from this book. It's good old-fashioned horror.But it is so much more. And it's in the details. There are so many wounded characters that come to life. Each one is richly drawn and full of emotional depth. The sharp and witty insights on life, sprinkled throughout the text, add another layer to the writing. The kind of brilliant writing you see in literary fiction. I wouldn't be surprised if Sarah Langan takes her place among the other masters of horror. It would be well deserved. I totally loved this book. I can't wait to read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counselor Lucky","review":"Am I extraordinary because I was not impressed with this book even though there was no charge for it on my Kindle? The story is an incestuoous relationship between a father and his eldest daughter, its effect on the child's mother and younger sister, and its creepy effect on the small town. There is also the background of long-term environmental devastation to the town itself and its residents which pre-dates the story itself. When the author listed her credits and acknowledgments at the end of the book, it all made sense as she is completing a degree in environmental engineering and was showcasing her concerns over damaging our environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a keeper","review":"This book was well written and I believe Ms. Langan had a fresh idea in a tired genre, but she works so hard to build the story, which I believe she succeeds at, but doesn't give a thorough explanation at the end.The story starts off very creepy and reminded me of the great horror novel, Ghost Story. All the elements were there, but when all hell breaks loose around the last 1/3 of the book, it gets confusing and boring. The author writes very cryptically about what is happening and why, and while she knows what she is trying to get across to the readers, I doubt very highly if most readers get it. The incest part of the story ruins the horror portion, the two just don't go together.The characters for the most part are strong and can each stand on their own two feet. Ms. Langan does a fantastic job keeping everyone consistent with their individual personalities. If it weren't for a confusing and silly ending, this book would have shined. I would definately give her another try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This is a horrible book. Not that it is badly written. The story is obviously a horror story, but one that is too close to home to the true horror of what many people experience. I firmly believe in no uncertain terms should anyone with any history of abuse, be it child abuse, sexual abuse, emotional or physical abuse should read this book. The characters are true real, the injuries and pain too plausible. This is art laying bear the reality of the pain and despair that can reside within human lives through hyperbole certainly, but it is still very real. Having counseled people so injured, I would be concerned that the story, which grabs you, would open many wounds and even forestall healing that is already taking place. It is a horrible book because it reflects what is in all to many cases a true horrible existence for some human beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning, poor ending","review":"I enjoyed the beginning of the book and thought to myself: this will be interesting, but everything got just too boring, to the point that I gave up on it after reading at least 75% of the book I just could not finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a creepy little town!","review":"I really enjoyed this book despite a couple of problems. There were quite a few characters and I had a hard time keeping track of them, plus I would have loved an epilogue. Still, Sarah Langan really knows how to write a creepy ghost story. I am looking forward to reading more from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book rambles and basically is a total waste of your time to read. I almost didn't finish it. It took forever for the story to get going and even once it did I didn't feel like it ever got where it was supposed to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts strong, becomes too long and boring","review":"This book started out with enough mystery about Susan Marley I was hooked. She wanders around town with no explanation as to what is really wrong with her. However, as this book goes on the mystery starts getting a little old. I was ready for this book to be over long before the end came. I was disappointed in this book, I wasn't sure what to expect. And the closer the end got the more confusing the book seemed to get for me. I had trouble following it and what character was actually talking. I didn't realize from reading the back of the book, this was a story about a town destroyed by a paper mill and the ghosts were coming back. I don't recommend this book; it felt more like a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Writing !!","review":"This book jumped from here to there, character here and there with no explanation of why it changed. First it talked about a person or a conversation - then jumped to another person out of the blue. And none of it was even interesting. Boring..I could not finish. This lady is no author in my opinion. Just a bunch of rambling on...this is probably the worst book I have read and I am a huge reader with so many books I had to get a kindle. It will be deleted off my kindle to make room for something else. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The book starts off well but by the middle of the book, I just wanted it to end. I kept waiting for it to get better but it just got more bizarre and had a stupid plot. I couldn't wait for it to end and then I felt like I just wasted my time. It was a freebie and worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time ...","review":"Okay, I have really been trying to find something remotely interesting about this book .... its just not happening. I found myself skipping pages looking for something meaningful to happen. I am giving up today, can't even finish the book! Guess it was worth the price I paid for it ... nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time","review":"Besides being a disgusting tale of a father raping his own daughter, the book is stupid and boring. Even free it is overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never really takes off","review":"I enjoyed The Missing, but couldn't get into Audrey's Door; so I gave this writer a third try with The Keeper, to break the tie. While I enjoy Ms. Langan's style, The Keeper just didn't go anywhere that gave me a sense of foreboding or a taste of fear. I kept reading, hoping the tension would mount and climax at some point, but, I don't know, it just never came to fruition. It's going to take a lot of hardy recommendations to pick up another of this author's books. I've been reading horror for like forty years, so perhaps I'm jaded, or just hard to please at this point. Four stars for the good writing, minus two for the premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, but...","review":"I really wanted to like this novel, but I couldn't. I tried to get into the story, but finally gave up about halfway through. It just wasn't that great of a story. Most of the characters seem contrived, though I did like Liz Marley. I just wish the others had been as interesting as she was.I don't like to give books negative reviews, so I'll just say perhaps this just wasn't my kind of story..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't do it...","review":"I tried, really, but I just couldn't finish it. Too many characters with too little substance. Herky jerky jumps from one character then back again. It just didn't tie together well. It was like watching a bad TV program that you hope will get better but just doesn't. You know where the plot is going but getting there just isn't worth the time. After reading 68% of the book I said, \\"That's all folks\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLow and boring","review":"I am glad that I managed to get this book for free because I would have felt cheated otherwise. It took me a long time to finish the book because of how boring it was.It is funny to read through the reviews and notice that there are some that loved the book and some that hated it. I am one of the later.If it was still free I would say to go ahead and attempt to read it... but they are asking $6.99 for it now so I say save your money and read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but.","review":"there are no heroes, only victims. imagine poltrgeist if everybody died and nobody tried very haed to help each other or even themselves so you did not really care anyway. great writing in service to nothing. what a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meanders","review":"I picked up this novel after it was mentioned in a New York Times article called Shelley's Daughters. Mostly I found the story just meanders. I think the combination of the constant shift of viewpoint and the unexciting writing makes the novel feels diffuse and bland. The climax doesn't feel like a climax. And there is nothing else to keep one's interest; neither character or writing. Woudn't recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Read this book and then buy more to give to your friends. This is a wonderful group program for older women to mentor younger women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apples of Gold","review":"This is a wonderful, structured plan for older women to follow in mentoring/nurturing younger women in following God's word. It helps you set up a 6-week program, meeting once a week for 3 hours. The first hour is spent in the kitchen, while one woman, the cooking mentor, fixes a pre-planned meal. The second hour is a Bible study, taught by one of six mentors each week. These lessons are in the book and menus are also in the book, if you need them. The lessons are Kindness, Loving Your Husband, Loving your Children, Submission, Purity and Hospitality. The third hour is spent eating the meal, talking about the lesson and getting to know each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful program. I honestly can't say enough good about it. What a way to reach out to the women in your church, or in your neighborhood! I went through the program last summer and had the opportunity this week to serve at a new AOG session. It has been such a blessing to me, especially at a time where not many take the time out of their busy schedule to nuture friendships. I have never felt so truly cared for. The meals we did were not the ones in the book, but we did do meals. Some groups have chosen to leave this part out. I would definitely not do this. There is something so great about having a meal together and also not lifting a finger! You feel so pampered! Can't wait until the author pens a continuation study!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Apples of Gold Teachings","review":"Excellent Christian teaching of Titus 2: 3-5 scripture.

The remote constantly sends the wrong signal to the system. I will press the root menu button the stop signal is sent, or if I press the next or previous chapter the setup menu comes up. More and more DVDs that I try and play with this system do not register and they work fine with my other DVD systems that I have. There are also lots of programming glitches that prevent proper use of the system. They were lucky that I had already passed the 90 day warranty. It is strange that all these problems started about 100 days into the use of the product.

Nusrat's vocals are powerful and inspiring, the tabla sets a nice beat, but the harmonium ruins the show. A little harmonium, OK, but not the WHOLE CD. What you get is Nusrat drowned out by the extremely annoying off-beat, wailing, choppy drone of that awful harmonium. If it wasn't for the passion that Nusrat brings to the recording, this cd would be no better than one star. If it wasn't for the grating harmonium, \\"Shabaaz\\" would be a four star effort. For Nusrat's inspiring vocals with a more soothing backdrop, try \\"The Prayer Cycle\\".

The writer creates such a vivid account of what the character is feeling and experiencing you feel those emotions with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best yet!","review":"Suzanne Enoch is getting better and better. This time around she gives us Saint, a man who appears unredeemable. I was a little shocked at what a bad guy he seemed to be, but Enoch carefully took us through Saint's development, and I really believed that he changed by the end of the book (Evie too for that matter). Enoch gave us some really delightful interactions (one of the characters kidnaps the other for a while!), and while some of it was implausbile, it was all very witty and fun. Go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Sweet","review":"Glad I took the advice of bloggers on The Romance Dish who said their favorite rake was the character in this book, Saint. This was a sweet book with wonderful dialogue- the \\"unsaintly\\" things Michael says to Evelyn are the stuff of dreams. \\"Unsaintly\\" dreams :) I read this book first and just downloaded number 1 and 3 on my kindle. I liked the characters so much I wanted to get to know them better."},{"rating":"1","title":"She DID NOT deserve the hero!","review":"I stuck with this book hoping the \\"heroine\\" would grow a spine by the end of the book but was disgusted to find her lily-livered to the very end. It was bad enough that Evelyn wouldn't stand up to her hideous brother about the work she valued with her orphans but she wouldn't even stand up to him over the man she loved. She was actually going to marry someone she despised (after her heartless brother sold her to him) even after St. Aubyn offered to take her away. No, poor Saint first had to get her worthless brother a job before she would marry him. Any worthy heroine would have told her family to go hang after the way they treated Evelyn and walked right out the front door.St. Aubyn was the only reason I finished the book and then I was sorry I did because he was then stuck with that awful spineless woman. The delicious Scoundrel deserved much better than her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real scoundrel all right","review":"I have seldom seen a more vulgar or ungentlemanly 'hero'. He is so uncouth that his supposed reform is completely unbelieveable. There is no real romance or sensuality-the only two love scenes in the book are depressingly brief and belittling. He treats her like a whore, and anyone who has stand-up sex in the theatre toilet alcove is just begging to be ruined. The fact that she isn't is a minor miracle, as is the fact that someone with an pretensions to intelligence at all, as the heroine has, should have steered clear a million miles from such a debauched man. His decision to marry her is downright insulting and the ending trite, cliché, and completely unbelievable as well. This novel makes light of adultery, orphans and a whole host of social ills in an attempt to bre witty and amusing, and it falls flat because the 'hero' is so callus and her own family are also odious. I was hard put to like a single character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters! Great Story!!!","review":"This is Suzanne Enoch's best book to date!!!

This is NOT the tripod; it is indeed a handle for a tripod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Great Benito","review":"I loved the character descriptions and the constant thread running through the novel. Alan Lightman's style, written in the first person, is precise and void of overly descriptive confusion. Benito too is void of overly emotional descriptions, yet his personal softer side still emanates.I loved the book and love Alan Lightman's style.The novel as it nears completion does however slightly fade into nothingness, my view perhaps because of my pedantic reasoning.

Don't let this one discourage you from exploring his other wonderful novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"An opposite opinion","review":"This book is nothing more than a publicity stunt and yet another attempt to blame others for the choices that we make. Traci obviously suffered some abuse but don't we all. Her discredit of the adult industry is interesting because without that past career, she would not be where she is today. I am a \\"porn star\\" myself and I know lots of others. Lots of them are happy, healthy women who are responsible for their choices and proud of them. She got mixed up with a bad crowd which from MY experience is the exception, not the rule in our industry. Don't waste your money on this book unless you support another form of exploitation by her and the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underneath it All","review":"I totally enjoyed this book. I could not seem to put it down. This book should be required reading for all high school students."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"POOR LITTLE ME!\\"","review":"If you want to read about Traci's experiences in the porn business, this book is not for you. She claims that she doesn't remember a single thing from those days because she was taking so much drugs and alcohol to mask her pain and indignity. If you read what her contemporaries have to say about her claims (Ron Jeremy, for one), I think you'll find yourself more inclined to believe them instead of her. The true surprise, however, is that Traci Lords is smart as a whip. She is insightful, astute and appears to be a keen judge of character. Of course the reader wants to believe what she's written here because she does come across as lovable and sweet, but somewhere within the pages of her book, I smelled a rat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact or fiction?","review":"I always thought Traci Lords was an over-acting, under-talented actress (except for her natural endowment), in or out of porn. One thing she does possess is a lot of ambition and the will to overcome obstacles. Her autobiography details her life into the adult entertainment industry and out of it. There's surprisingly very little about her years in the porn world and the 100 hardcore films she starred in as an underaged vixen. There's also no mention of her family's Jewish background. (She does mention that her great-grandmother on her mother's side was Irish, and her paternal grandfather came from the Ukraine.) Each chapter is rather short, and the book reads like a diary with carefully picked entries. There's a bit too much self-analysis. Even the pictures, some in color, are a letdown.The question is, of course, how much of what Lords writes is fact and how much is fiction. But maybe that's just a silly question. Like her films, Traci Lords's book is not to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another attempt to cash in on the last moment of fame","review":"This is typical, one moment she said there were no drugs. Now! there were drugs and booze. This lady is trying to cash in on her last moments of fame, well she knew what she was doing. Giving the readers a sob story with sexually explicit pictures, if she was so sincere she should have left out the pictures and got to the point such as what is wrong with the industry. Obviously she doesn't know enough about the industry since she was so doped up.Drugs and parties, anyone can figure out what will happen.A book I rather recommend is \\"Cut Throat Business, I am having the last word\\", a book written by a woman, film editor. She worked in the industry and she will tell the reader what really goes on and it is not 10 years ago that the story is referred to, this true story is fresh a revolves around the year of 2000-2002. Save your money on Traci Lords sob story and read a real story like Cut Throat Business, which it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Blame Me","review":"It seems so funny that everything bad in her life was alwayssomebody else's fault. She takes responsibility for nothingshe's done. There are alot of us out there who were molested and raped as children and didn't turn into pornstars at 15. Ihave a hard time seeing her as the victim she's so desperatelytrying to play. Don't bother reading this book unless you wantto read 281 pages of \\"Poor Me\\".

Her time spent in porn was fun to read about, but all the acting stories afterward were kind of dull. I did not like her lousy attitude towards the porn industry. She lied about her age to get into the business, and her time in the business ended up getting her way more fame than she deserves. Would people really give a crap about her movies and music were it not for her porn star background? I would imagine not.If you are one of those people that love her non-porn work, then by all means read this book. People looking for a lot of juicy stories about the world of porn would be better off buying books by Jenna Jameson or Christy Canyon."},{"rating":"1","title":"get back into porn","review":"she needs to go back to what made her.....PORN thats where she really shines like a star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Take This Chick Home To Meet Your Mother!!!","review":"At an age when most 16 year old girls are dreaming about their first kiss Traci Lords was performing in XXX Rated Adult Movies.She takes no responsiblity for her actions and blames her troubled childhood for what she became . Sadly and tragically there are many girls who are sexually abused at a young age yet few of them go into the porn industry. From reading this book it appears that Ms. Lords wants it both ways(no pun intended) She displays a contempt for the porn industry yet one gets the impression that she enjoyed all of the attention, fame and money that came with it.And just like any other \\"has been\\" sex symbol she writes a book about her life.

That's all I can say about it.

So, now you know..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie and nice extras","review":"It had been a long time since I'd seen these movies, so I pre-ordered Phantasm and III (along with the older DVD release of IV). I enjoyed the commentary on this almost as much as the movie. Great to have it out with such sharp image and colors -- check out the scene when they enter the white room and you'll see what a terrific job was done with this release.It looks like there wasn't a US DVD release of Phantasm II? Was it that bad, I really don't remember? I hope part V comes along and wraps this series someday..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reason Why They make DVDs","review":"If there was a reason that DVD's should be made. The special edition of Phantasm has almost every one of them. With two menus of extras, interviews, deleted scenes, and commentary by the director and the stars(all totalng at least 1 1/2 hours of extras). This version of Phantasm should be purchased by anyone who enjoys the film. As for the movie, Phantasm is one wicked ride. It is quite possibly one of the most stylish and symbolic films ever made. Is it any good? It depends on your tastes. The movie does have its weaknesses: it is totally nonsensical, dumb and with marginal performances. On the plus side, we've already mentioned the style part, the special effects(for the most part) are still good, and it does have tons of atmosphere(this one almost puts you in the mortuary halls). Some people get the uncomfortable feeling that it feels like death, it does. So I would only recomended for die hard genere fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cult Classic that will always HAUNT!","review":"I first saw this movie as a teenager at the theater. After the movie, as my boyfriend and I were walking though the parking lot back to his car and guy with a deep voice came up from behind me and shouted \\"Boyyyy!\\" in a deep voice just like Angus Scrimm. Well, I about peed myself.This movie is great. Today my kids ejoy watching it and my son has a plaster mask of Angus Scrimm. Speaking of Angus Scrimm, he is a legend in his own right. The Tall Man will always have a place in my best nightmares.Recently I was happy to learn that he is still alive and kicking! Perhaps they will make another sequel to Phantasm. I would love to see The Tall Man back in action, terrifying Michael, Jody, Reggie, and millions of other daring souls!Watch this classic then run for your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of phantastic","review":"PHANTASM, especially when you consider it was released 25 years ago, is a brilliant film for several reasons. Its chief strength, however, lay in its script. On one level, it utilizes classic horror movie elements: nightmares, grave robbers, the haunting mausoleum and cemetery, the menacing man who watches over everything, etc. But then it incorporates that with classic sci-fi elements: reanimation, the alien race conquering humans, transports into other dimensions, etc. All this, which could have been muddled by someone else is deftly directed with low budget (but very effective special effects) by Don Coscarelli. This edition, complete with interviews and additional footage, is even more enjoyable because of its enhancement of the film's theme which, like \\"Tubular Bells\\" from The Exorcist, remains haunting after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantasm","review":"The tall man is a live personification of the very essense of horror, on par with Freddy Krueger and Pinhead (Hellraiser), like the disclaimer says: if this one doesn't scare you, you're already dead! From the most avid Horror fan in the world (I am not exaggerating)this is a must. You won't be dissapointed. Angus Scrimm is trully remarkable in his role as guardian of the dead souls. This particular DVD version was superb in quality and production. I have nothing else to say, no superlatives would suffice, just order one, then, unplug the phone, turn off the mobile, switch off the lights, clear your lungs and get ready for a ride. . .

If you are new to Don Coscarelli's movies I hope this will encourage you to check out the sequels to Phantasm and of course the mighty Bubba-Hotep! (Long live the king!) The movie has a great balance of drama and good old 70's cheese (not over the top in my opinion....just enough to make you sit back and smile). After all when was the last time an aging ice cream vendor with pattern baldness was a hero!!? All kidding aside though, as a pretty avid horror movie junkie, and a fan that looks for really good horror films that continue to stand the test of time....this is one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest \\"HORROR\\" film of all time","review":"Leonard Maltin, stick to alleged classics like \\"Citizen Kane\\" and \\"Gone with the Wind.\\" Phantasm is way out of your league. This film stays with you long after you've seen it. At a time when slasher films were being cranked out, Phantasm stood out on its own and no one EVER tried to duplicate Cosarelli's vision. In my teen years I watched the film four times and still could not clearly remember the ending. How many films have you watched in this category that would give you nightmares? There are only a small handful of horror films that rise above the glut of knockoffs that are made today and those that followed Carpenter's Halloween in 1978; this is the best of them. 1. Phantasm 2. Dawn of the Dead 3. Witchboard 4. Anguish 5. ??? (we'll see)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different to me now than when I was a kid.","review":"I don't know what it is, but this film has captivated me since I bought it on DVD. I don't remember it being so deep when I was a kid. I remember my uncle (10 yrs my senior) ranting and raving about what a badass movie it was when I was 10, but its pretty deep also.I went right out and rented the three sequels and I'm in the process of watching them now. Phantasm 2 was decent. I really hope Coscarelli gets the cash to get #5 made. Its really a shame he hasn't been able to get into the stream and pump out some bigger budget films as I think he's a good solid director. I have a lot more respect for him now after watching all the extras on this dvd.See it again if its been a long time. See it if you haven't. Thats really all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"From one Phan to another, you've got to get this DVD!!!!","review":"While most \\"special edition\\" dvd's are usually less than special, Phantasm rises way above the rest. If you love the Phantasm series and you haven't got this dvd yet-GO GET IT!!!. The picture is superb, though it has a few (very few) glitches such as surface scracthes but all in all the picture quality is great. And the sound, my god it is perfect, Phantasm has never sounded so great. The real kicker is the extras. Included on this package are behind the scenes footage with commentary by Don Coscarelli and Reggie Bannister, a hilarious Fango Convention appearance by Angus Scrimm, a bizarre interview with Scrimm from Australia, a must hear disco version of the Phantasm theme, a full version of Bill Thornberry's \\"Sittin' Here at Midnight\\" (man, that guy can sing) and a whole lot more.

It scared me so bad that I made the guy who took me to this movie stay on the phone with me all night after he dropped me off at home. I woke to the sound of his snoring on the other end. I couldn't look at, let alone buy, a full length mirror for years. But seeing it again in 2008...wow, what a bad film! Maybe I've gotten jaded by today's horror films because the effects in this one are horrible.It's good for the nostalgia and camp: a movie to watch with your friends, drink a few beers, while each and every one of you proclaim that even you can act better than the actors in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, but funny to watch.","review":"This is honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I am not someone who enjoys putting things down. It's not even remotely scary--the theme music is the most stereotypical \\"horror\\" music imaginable. The acting is awful, the plot makes little sense, the special effects aren't particularly good, and worst of all, the screenplay is a disaster. I love horror movies and I am usually not overly critical, but this isn't horror! It's hysterical! I laughed my way through it and I would recommned it to anyone who would enjoy the humor in how awful it is. If you are looking for true horror, though, this isn't it. It's truly a terrible movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER HORROR CLASSIC","review":"Hand's down, this is a classic, it includes great special fx and makeup, great story, Don Coscerelli's best film so far, the first film of the series isn't always the best, but in this case it is, in my opinion, the sequels were good but they lacked the creepiness of the this film, so if your a fan of the genre look no further than to add this to your collection, it will be well worth it, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie but the sequel is better!","review":"My review is the title.

Waited for quite some time till it got delivered and was expecting to see something outstanding (smth you cant put your hands on in the middle of Region 2...). But frankly I was disappointed. This movie is not scary at all. It has some interesting scenes (the tension is quite OK when inside the funeral house, liked the head drilling sphere, maybe the dwarfs) but not much else. The plot is easy, the caracters are somehow (maybe only for me) not really believable. The Tall Man is \\"advertised\\" as a dreadful, evil caracter. For me he's just a weird guy (I don't mean to offend any Phan, sorry). To be fair, I'll give it one more trial. There are movies you need to digest and at the second watch they may prove to be better.I'm now working hard convincing myself that Phantasm has it's place in my collection as a horror classic but this does not seem to help. Luckily it did not cost a fortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is a long way from being the best horror film ever","review":"I have read alot of rave reviews about this one but I just watched it and I kind of felt like I just wasted $3. The film was'nt too bad until half way through we are shown a truly ridiculous buzzing fly kind of creature with glowing pink eyes and I just gave up on it from there. I have to say that it was NOT scary or gory and I have seen alot better low budget horror movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of my top horror flicks of all time!","review":"I saw the first Phantasm back in 1979. I was a little 6th grader with no clue what I was getting into. Back then the shows didn't check for I.D's. The movie freaked me out so that, that Saturday I was to have a sleep over at my girl friends. I ended up going home instead and ended up sleeping in my parents bedroom for two nights. And, anyway what where my P's thinking letting a 6th grader go to a horror movie. They just left me money and I went to see what ever I wanted. Maybe that is why at 36 nothing scares me anymore. I do own Phantasm 1. but not the others. Was not thrilled about the sequels, sorry. I still watch it every fall with friends from that era. We always have a good time, and I still get creped out.Great job on the original movie.Most Sincerely,Ms. Rebecca M.

You'll want to cruise to the local Tavern in the Cuda, and try and pick up hot chicks in lavender at the local Tavern while trying to ditch the annoying Mike....but all the while the ominous Tall Man is searching for your soul. Cool horror flick just cheesy-eerie and scary enough. The extras on the DVD are second to none...watch for the ultra cool interview with Angus \\"Boooyyyy!\\" Scrimm and director Coscarelli by an ultra hip seventies dude wearing a polyester leisure suit! The on-screen commentary by all the principals is a must if you are a hard-core Phantasm fan. Angus Scrimm is a real smart aleck, and very funny. Too many others to list, but this is a must buy if you love Phantasm...highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantasm is the best horror movie I have seen, it is great!","review":"Phantasm is an all time great movie. It has some of the best special effects I have ever seen I also think that Bill Thornbury and Reggie Bannister are two sexy men. They are both great actors and so are the rest of the cast. I have seen all of the Phantasm movies and they are all great. I hope they decide to do another one in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Children's Book?! Hardly....","review":"Ah, the English. Known for Toffee, the Beatles, and one of the rare modern-day monarchys, they are also known for another thing:Scaring the bejeeze out of small children.It started with Grim's Fairy Tales, and is kept up by folks like Roald Dahl and now, Mr. Gaiman. This book is creepy. REALLY creepy. I have always enjoyed horror in my movies and my books since I was really small. However, I can sincerely say that, had I read this at any age under 16, I would STILL be afraid of the dark. Some of the imagery in this book is so good that it just sticks in your head and shows up at strange moments (3AM when the heater comes on, for example).Mind you, it's a GREAT book. Just don't let anyone (child or otherwise) read this who is even a bit skittish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coraline, by Neil Gaimen","review":"When I first saw this book, I assumed it wouldn't appeal to me.

I could easily see Tim Burton making a film from this clever little story. If you like spooky stories, this one is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaiman's peepstone","review":"Like the young heroine of Coraline, Neil Gaiman holds a peepstone that illuminates the gems of reality hidden in the shallow constructs that pass for modern children's literature.This was a terrific choice for my 13-year-old daughter: imaginative and creepy enough to demand her attention for a full day; satisfying and redemptive without a shadow of moralizing; and chock full of original and compelling imagery.Don't tell your child that Coraline isn't really the scariest [children's] book ever. That honor belongs toThe Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon. But King's masterpiece is really too edgy and painful for a thirteen year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coraline and her adventures through the door","review":"This story would be in the same genre as Alice in Wonderland. It is a strange, dark novel that appeals to both the young and young at heart. It is the story of a heroine who must go to another world to save her family and other children trapped there. She is momentarily sidetracked by the appeal of this world where she can do anything she likes, and everything from the living toys to the plays of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible's (her neighbors) counterparts seems tailored to her entertainment. The plot thickens when the door back to her reality is locked and the stakes for her soul and those of her parents are threatened to be trapped forever. This is definitely an interesting story for all ages, another of Neil Gaiman's great achievements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story.","review":"This was wonderful; my 7 yr old boy loved the story, and so did the rest of the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best book but a great book, PIJH 7th grade","review":"This was a good book.Probably one of the best books I have ever read.It is very mysterious, but yet very creepy.Coraline lives with a lot of people.Also, she lives with a creepy man and two women.I don't Know how she can handle it.You will be amazed of the courageous things that happen.Neil Gaiman has done a great job with his stories.I can't wait for his next adventures........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven and not-so Scary","review":"Neil Gaiman is definitely a creative powerhouse, there's not questioning that. But this book really isn't worth all the hype surrounding it.Some of the imagery created by Gaiman is very clever and chilling, but the execution falls flat. It reads like a \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" book, and I never really felt the main character was in any real danger (just creepy circumstances). And even though the evil mother character is very well written, her actions and origins seem a bit vague so it all falls a bit flat.Although the book's jacket touts it as the next Alice in Wonderland, this book lacks the wit and charm to be a book for all ages. Kids will no doubt be frightened by by Gaiman's creepy imagery, but as they grow older, they'll begin to wonder exactly why as this book lacks the bite it's teeth imply...I'd stick to Road Dahl or The Brothers Grim..."},{"rating":"1","title":"i think that you will like it it gets you nervis","review":"This book is prity cool it gets you interested .It is a funny book this is what it is about.

We are presented her world through her eyes - the candor and quirkiness of a young adolescent put quite a spin on our adult actions.Descriptions of the scenery (right down to grandma's uncomfortable furniture), people (the neighbors are so mysterious and interesting through the eyes of a child), and monsters are so real, you are there.

But the audience that enjoys Harry Potter will definitely not want to spend money at an overpriced bookstore for this book.

In this case, it's other children who've been caught by the Other Parents.The book is too straightforward and, while creepy enough to keep the interest of the target audience, is just not GOOD enough to justify Neil Gaiman's name being on it.

It's the type of movie that I love and I couldn't pass it up. I got the chance to watch just a little of it (sadly, not all), but it was enough to make me want to read the children's book that it was based on.Coraline was a creepy read that I will definitely come back to in the future. Maybe when I have children of my own, I will fill their Halloween nights with tales of the 'Other Mother', her eyes made of black buttons, skin the color of bone, alternate reality, and a talking black cat. Oh...and a circus of mice. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the right amount of creepiness","review":"Another amazing book by Gaiman. He has won me as a reader for life.In this book Coraline feels ignored by her parents, but she understands why; however, a door leads her into an alternate world that mirrors her current one with one exception: the parents PAY attention to her.A creepy tale of the dangers of watching what you wish for - you just might get it (and find yourself in danger).This also makes a great audio books as well; Gaiman is the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coroline, big button eyes","review":"Coroline is about a girl who discovers a whole different world behind a door on her own flat.

Without spoiling anything by giving away details, Gaiman has written a book that reminds us that there were things behind closet doors and such when we were young that we simply have forgotten were there. Some of the best prose writers are those who can set a scene and create vivid images without taking thousands of pages to do it, and Coraline makes use of every word. At the end of the day, Coraline reminds us that we haven't banished the creepy things from our childhood closets, we've just buried them as best we can. No author I know of is better at describing the world between waking and sleeping than Gaiman, and Coraline proves he knows plenty of innovative ways of going about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic gaiman","review":"This book is an awesome addition to the collection of any Neil Gaiman fan. Told in the classic English fairy tale voice, he crafts a young adult novel that is original, creepy, and fantastic. I think adults might get a bigger chill from it than children...all the more reason to love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coraline Through Bricks","review":"Coraline (not Caraline if you please) is a precocious, bored young girl. She likes to explore and, in her rented home, finds a door which, when opened, leads to a brick wall. No way through, or is there? There is, and Coraline finds it, and, like Alice through the looking glass, enters a twisted world which, in her case, resembles her own but is darkly different. A woman, resembling her mom, or a doll-like, button-eyed look-alike, wants her to stay in this new world, and takes steps to make sure Coraline does stay, so as to consume her soul. No doubt scary for the young, and still entertainingly good for the grownups.The limited signed version, (despite a typo) is a prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Fairytale","review":"A bunch of the 4th and 5th graders at my kid's school are crazy over this book so I picked it up and read it. I must admit this is my first Gaiman book and I was impressed. It's perfect for that age group - it's just creepy enough, yet has the air of a fairytale. I know my 9-year-old will enjoy reading it, but I think I'll hold off on letting my 7-year-old read it.I may never look at button eye'd dolls in the same way again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightfully gloomy","review":"It's a book I think both kids and adults would enjoy. The Sandman apart, it's kind of my favorite of Neil Gaiman's books so far. I found it strangely soothing to be caught in the web of this story rather than in the web of my own existence for a while. It helped me get through the stress of being on a long flight when I would normally not be able to focus on anything and it's precious for that reason. It's written is a delightfully gloomy style that I very much enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so awesome","review":"no this is a book that i dont recommend.but if you want the best book ever get a copy of the hunger games"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland fantasy","review":"I cannot say that I cared much for Coraline. I didn't hate it. I simply felt that it wasn't much of a story. Coraline is a bored little girl who likes exploring, so she heads (a la Alice) into a \\"wonderland\\" of sorts, only it is a rather bleek and scary place. There she encounters various characters and has an adventure. She ends up having to fight to make it back home.I am an adult who loves children's fantasies. Coraline was a short diversion. I would put it in the category of filler as we wait patiently for Harry Potter V."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coraline","review":"I peronally disliked this book. It keep my attention with some horror.But i didnt like the horrible other parts.Like the the part with the talking cat and the other parents... that wasnt very intersting.A mutantes monster would have been way better.The only good part about this book was the disaperence of her parents, and the evil cat. The worst parts were everything else. The giant monster in the city was preety good. Also good pictures for everyhthing.The most understanding part was when coralines parents were missing and how she lived till she found out were the were. The missing parents was cool.That part was really good in detail of what she ate and acted as no parents where around.She also explained the cat very well. The theme seemed like a spooky/mysteriuos tone. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeek!","review":"I think that Coraline is an extremely creepy book. The pictures are creepy, and a lot of the characers are too. I could not finish Coraline because it freaked me out to much.Coraline should be for ages 13 and up. I definitely would not recommend this book to any one who dislikes creepy books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much scarey as really really ugly","review":"I give this book 2 stars for the writing talent the author has shown in the past and continues to display in this book. He obviously has a 5-star talent. But this book is not so much scarey as truly creepy -- and not in a nice way. This book is just ugly. And the pictures were even uglier. Think of the emotional reaction to something really sad and sick -- like maybe chronic skin infection exhudate, and that is my reaction to this story. E-e-e-w-h! If that is what you like, then the rating should be 5-star. But if you want a nice day with nice images in your brain, then avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Garth Nix Smoked Crack, This Would Be the Result","review":"This was by far the most bizarre book I've ever read. I began reading it, expecting a dark fantasy similar to Garth Nix's work. I was obviously mistaken. What I really ended up reading was what could be passed off as a Garth Nix crack-smoking fantasy. It made very little sense, and in some places made no sense at all. It reminded me of the strangeness of Alice in Wonderland. Usually I keep an open mind about different styles of writing, but this was just plain weird. Many reviews said this book is frightening, so I expected to get some thrills and chills out of reading it. Neil Gaiman tries very hard to freak me out, but does not succeed. The most chilling part of the entire book was the illustrations, which were disturbingly creepy. By the time I finished reading the book, I closed it wondering what, exactly, had just happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly, not for adults","review":"Coraline had to have been one of the worst books Ive read. I dont know, maybe Im to old for this type of book but I am a huge fan of Gaiman and I read everything by him. Its hard to believe that Mr. Gaiman wrote one of my favorite stories, the Sandman, and turns around and writes this mess. Ive read American Gods wich was about a 3 star, Good Omens, wich I liked alot, probably a 4 1/2 star and every Sandman book out there. Mr. Gaiman really accelerates in the comic world. His death series, Murder Mysteries along with the sandman series are definetly looking into if you have not read them.Someone said on the back cover I believe that \\"Coraline will finally surpass Alice in Wonderland\\" must have lost his marbles. Not even close!!! If I wasnt such a Gaiman fan, I would have rated this a 1 star.Gaiman spends to much time building up the story only to disappoint you with a short plot. I could go on and on but like I said, not a book for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Boring book","review":"I am a huge fan of Neil Gaiman, so it pains me to say this, but I found this book extremely boring and a tad too dark for young children. Coraline is not a very likable character. She doesn't have much going on that makes her interesting. Mr. Gaiman also doesn't do enough explore the other characters in the book, the two sisters, the man with the circus mice upstairs. I liked American Gods and Neverwhere much more. The characters were more interesting and there was more action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My favorite","review":"Most people that I know have read this book say it is great, spooky, and interesting, but I don't agree with them. I think this book is a good book, but just not the type of book for me. Some people think the whole idea of a alternant universe with an evil monster for a main charater is cool,I on the other hand don't. You might like this book,like my friends, or might hate it, like me.-M.E.P. *_*"},{"rating":"2","title":"a mccleary","review":"The book i am about to tell you about is unique. it starts out where coralines parents disappear. they wouldnt let her go in a room that is down a long dark coridor. well, when the parents disappeared a key to that room appeared in her pocket. when she goes into the room she see's her parents but they have button eyes and noses, but for the mouth it looked like it was sewed together but it wasn't. the fake parents wanted coraline to stay with them so they wouldn't let her go. towards the end of the story she got away and found her parents. her parents were stuck in a mirror. when they got out they didnt remember anything that happened.this is a great book. i would recomend this book to anyone in 7th grade or up. i think you would like this book if you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Gaiman Certainly Has Style...","review":"\\"Coraline\\" is a great book. It can get remotely creepy. Here's my review:Coraline has just moved in with her parents into a new house, which is not so new. Coraline {or Caroline to some}, is a bored girl who discovers a door behind a bricked-up wall in her room which leads to another world, to another mother and another father who have liquid-paper white skin and black buttons for eyes. When Coraline gets back to her world, her parents are missing and she finds out that her other mother has captured them with lost children's souls, and the only thing that Coraline has left afterwards is a friendship with a talking cat, and the only choice of a challenge with her other mother just to get her parents back. If she loses, her other mother keeps her there forever, and if Coraline wins, her other mother has to give one of her hands and Coraline would get her parents back to her world."},{"rating":"2","title":"MYSTERIOUS, CREEPY,but......

Fun, creepy, and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grim(m) Fairy Tale in the Original Sense","review":"Neil Gaiman's \\"Coraline\\" is a very dark fairy tale. It's very well-written and, for a fairy tale, well-described (though, for all intents and purposes, everything takes place in one locale). I'm rating it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5. However, I was torn about the rating. Since the book is a fairy tale (and Gaiman, in his afterword, specifically says he wrote it for his 6-year old child), I initially considered it to be far too dark for its audience. But, after thinking about those original fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm (which are darn nasty), I changed my mind. Gaiman's forte is myth and fairy tales and this book falls right in that domain. It might somewhat offend our sensibilities about what young children should read. But, still, Good triumphs, Evil is overcome, and everyone lives happily ever after. It's worth a bit of a scare."},{"rating":"2","title":"For kids that want more than a fairy tale...","review":"Coraline discovers a locked door in her home that appears to open only to a brick wall. Turns out that sometimes there's more behind that door than just a brick wall!I just discovered Neil Gaiman this year and I must say I am now a fan! Coraline is an excellent book! It's quite creepy and scary, so I'd be careful about letting kids prone to nightmares read it. That being said, I think this would be a fantastic book to read with the kids around Halloween. This is a five star read for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coraline","review":"This book is hard to find in stores now that the movie has come out and is hard to find this issue without it being the movie cover.

I read it once and now I can't wait to read it to my little cousins. Neil Gaiman creates an alternate world in which Coraline is wanted by her \\"other mother\\". She must somehow figure out a way to get back into the real world with her real parents. She has the help of what she thought was a boring stone and also, the black cat. It was very interesting to see how Coraline gets out of the alternate world, and how she gets her parents back. And even after all this, how she takes care of her \\"other mother\\" for good. Even though this is a YA book and I'm 26, I was still a little scared while reading the story :)This book is very creative and I can see why Gaiman is such a popular author.

The toys are much much more fun, the food is mouthwatering, and she has a room where the walls are pink and green. As life maybe pleasurable, her pseudoparents are very disterbing. For one thing, they have skin like rice paper, and buttons for eyes. Now, she must come out of this world, and live with her real parents.As fun as this book was, it was very...disturbing. Not only in the text, but also in the illustrations. I was frightened at most of the pictures, and had nightmares at night too. For this book, i reccomend it to kids over 10, for disturbing images."},{"rating":"2","title":"a scary book","review":"this book is about a girl named coraline, who lives in a flat and is also very adventurous and wants to explore. one rainy day, she explored the house and came upon a door, so she opened it and it was blocked by a brick wall.

She kept on walking and she saw this man and this women and they both had button eyes, they said that they were her other parents. She went back to her house and her parent were gone the other parents took them!!! Caroline was asking for her parents back and her other mother locked her in a closet with three stolen souls.

But, using the hole in the stone, the spirits, the cat, and her brain Coraline finds the three souls. She finds the snow globe that holds her parents inside and escapes. This book is very good because it tells of a girl who was bored and goes on a adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely fairy tale","review":"The best thing I can say about Coraline: It reminded me strongly of being a child. It is a classic fairy tale, the kind I loved as a kid. A clever child using her wits to overcome extraordinary challenges.Most childrens' works condescend and pander in the extreme; They feature dumb adults that need to change and come to respect their more clever offspring. Written by someone else, Coraline's adventure might have ended with her parents' snap realization that they need to shower more attention on their daughter. Gaiman's version has a much more muted and realistic end: Coraline opens up and shows some more affection to her parents, and they respond in kind.I - an adult - enjoyed Coraline, but I think it has the right mix of adventure and honesty to make a child fall in love with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it and I'm 25 years old!!!","review":"Let me start off this review by saying that I'll be 26 in one month and I LOVED this book! It is written for ages 8 and up, but it is such a creative storyline that you won't even realize it. And it is shockingly dark for being written for such young audiences. I wish a movie based on this book was in the works!!! You will enjoy the creative illustrations almost as much as this story. Gaiman and McKean have a classic on their hands. I felt my childhood imagination coming back to me! I loved this book. I gave it minus one star because the ending was too \\"typical\\" for me, however, there was an unexpected surprising twist that went along with it and I can't be too hard on this book because it was written for 8 year olds :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coraline","review":"The title of the book is called Coraline. This book is about a girl named Coraline. She just moved to a house, with other people who live above her and below her. After leaving her world, Coraline is trying to get back. I give it a five star rating because it was a little scary. I could not put it down and could not predict how it was going to turn out. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I recommend it to fourth through six graders. The author of this book is Neil Gaiman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"The book doesn't match the movie exactly but it is still a very good book. My daughter's book report earned her an \\"A\\". A could also stand for Awesome read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"movie is better","review":"This is a cute story, but the movie is better. The movie added the character Wybie who is not in the story. I would recommend movie over book."},{"rating":"2","title":"For kids who will grow up into adults","review":"Yes, this book is spookier than most kids' books these days. That is a good thing. Kids have always liked Brothers Grimm style works, and the trend of the last couple decades of sugar-coating fairy tales have only appeared to increase the violence of teenage horror stories (witness the Friday the Thirteenth flicks, for example). As a story about a smart young girl who battles a fully imagined and quite frightening storybook villain, Coraline is top notch; and, as far as I am concerned, such stories should be far more common than they are.For a funnier, yet comparable, take on the same subject as Coraline, try The Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett, a former collaborator of the author's. Coraline and The Wee Free Men are two different takes on the subject of one young girl fighting a particular kind of reality-altering villain. Both books are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb book that will keep you thinking","review":"I saw this book at an airport and thought it looked interesting. Boy is that an understatement. Neil Gaiman takes the reader through a spooky, creepy world, even and especially for adults. There is a great deal of commentary interwoven throughout the book on how we live our lives and raises questions about how we SHOULD live our lives, but doesn't give the answers. There is so much symbolism in the book, yet it can be interpreted in many different ways. I would recommend this book to anyone, and especially to book clubs or college classes that include contemporary fiction. This is a work to buy and read over, and over, and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"My goodness, how creepy.","review":"\\"Coraline\\" is excellent, a child's book that manages to be profoundly creepy in its illustrations and its verbal imagery. I'd never realized that buttons could be quite so scary, but to think that there's a mirror world out there and that all we have to do to join it forever is to sew buttons into our eyes frightened me in a way I thought was no longer possible.I'm a huge Gaiman fan. Huge. This was better than NEVERWHERE and far darker than GOOD OMENS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings you thinking","review":"At first I was like this book is oka.

Gaiman writes so he keeps you wondering what will happen next and leaves the thrills witnin you through each word"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Honest Look at Coraline","review":"I originally read a review of \\"Coraline\\" in an article posted on the web that sited itself as belonging to some magazine or other, such as \\"Time\\". The review gushed about Gaiman's brilliance, his ability to capture both adult and young audiences with the novel, claiming it was in the tradition of such greats as Dahl or Carroll, and might even rival the popularity of J.K. Rowling and the infamous \\"Harry\\". I found absolutely no cause for such praise as this. The book does not match, in my opinion, the captivating characterization of Rowling's Potter series, nor does it touch the surrealistic beauty of Alice's Wonderland. The oompa-loompa vibe is all that remains of Dahl's style, and even that is muted to the point of boring one to tears. Harsh words, but true, nonetheless. By the end of the relatively brief novel, I was skimming pages, anxious to have finished it once and for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coraline","review":"This book was so creepy, I couldn't even finish it! I'd have nightmares every night!!! I was looking at some books in my brother's room, and even though I haven't picked it up in years, when I spotted it, it sent a shiver down my spine. My mom started reading it to me, then she refused to after reading the first few chapters, she said she could tell it was freaking me out!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Gaiman's best","review":"Not to say that Neil Gaiman is a poor writer, because he is surely one of the most imaginative and talented writers out there, but Coraline falls flat and is definitely not his best work. It is an undeveloped story with characters lacking depth. The peripheral characters (Coraline's neighbors) seem be tossed in to add some fleck of color, but add nothing to the experience. I know Gaiman seems to be exploring the children's market with other books like Wolves in the Walls (which is only worth purchasing for the illustrations, really), but his talents lie in other genres and should stick with it. There were some moments that were creepy, I admit, but this story doesn't belong in book form. (It would've made a great Twilight Zone episode). All in all, stay away from Gaiman's children's books and read the Sandman series or his other works intended for grown-ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Button Eyes? uh. .","review":"My English I class read this book last April, and no one really liked it, including me. The book isn't that catchy, it's just plain creepy. Coraline enters another dimenson through a door, which just beyond is the strangest world she's ever been in and I, a avid reader, had never read anything like. Though some people may like the children in the closet's souls locked inside marbles, the \\"mother\\" wanting Coraline to sew on button eyes, and the hand of the mother that sounds like something off the Adam's family, I (nor the seventy other kids in English I) didn't find it intresting or funny, but strange and demented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"So terrible. I had read reviews of the movie that said it brought familes together. It was just a nightmare of a novel about a girl who discovers evil in her house. And to make it worse, her parents become the victims, and she has to fight the evil alone. It's a \\"young adult\\" novel because the language is simple and the protagonist is an adolescent. But the scenes are the kind of things that haunt you and will make you afraid of your own home, your own bed. I can't believe this kind of thing has a willing audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it!!!!!!!","review":"I hate I do not like creepy things amd this is VERY creepy.

Aside from Coraline, most of the characters are flat and odd, like marionettes that someone else is playing... but it works. Coraline breaks down the barrier between what things look like and what they are. It's one of the scariest books I've ever read, but not for violence... just the horrible, lingering creeps that crawl right up your back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Neil Gaiman's best!","review":"I must say for a kids book there were a few parts of this book that were creepy, even for me. I would have a hard time reading this to a 5-8 year old but I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to any over 10. Neil Gaiman, in an interview, said that kids find the adventure in it where adults find the eerieness in it all. This is a short book but it is a really fun, creative read. I have since read this book several times and have enjoyed the book each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's Coraline. Not Caroline. Coraline.\\"","review":"In this fantastic book, Gaimon taps into nightmares most people aren't aware they had to create a truly frightening story. Most authors would be uneasy about putting children in such a high-stakes situation, but Gaiman doesn't flinch. A father himself, he knows that children are a lot more resilient that most adults give them credit for--proven by the hundreds of enthusiastic grade-school fans who have written him at his website. Unlike the Lemony Snicket books, the horrifying events portrayed here are told in a low-key, deadpan style which makes them even more effective.Also check out the unabridged audiobook, read very effectively by the author himself. The background music is wonderfully eerie, and the rat choruses are spine-tinglingly creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT read-aloud","review":"This has been an excellent read-aloud for my fifth grade classes over the last few years (as well as my own pre-teens). The descriptions of the characters and setting by Neil Gaiman are very well done. My students have learned to really use their imaginations to envision Coraline's \\"other\\" life beyond the drawing room. We were excited to hear of the movie coming out, but we were all terribly disappointed with that version....they held true to many of the \\"creepier\\" aspects, but added some scenes that took away from the true ambiance of the original story (original setting in England, so they had to remove any of the British vocabulary and settings to make it Americanized---yuck). Although a well-made 3-D movie, it just wasn't as magical as this wonderful book. I would suggest any parent get this and read it aloud to your child (10+)even if you have seen the movie (use it to compare both versions)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Alice! Coraline is here!","review":"This was the greatest book I've read in a very long time. When you read the first few pages, you think it's a very childish story, but within minutes, you're feeling chills as Neil Gaiman describes Coraline's journey in the Other World in squirming, button-eye-tapping detail. You're sure to be more than a bit creeped out when the Other Mother presents Coraline with a memorable gift that will make you hands fly to cover your eyes. It's a brief but memorable journey that will haunt your dreams. I highly recommend taking the plunge and going through that door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Product","review":"This product sold in retail stores contains a starter printer cartrige.

I should have read the commentary and reviews more carefully.I was expecting more stories of people who had defended themselves with a firearm, but this book doesn't really cover that subject. This book is about people who banded together to defend their communities against outlaws. It is not about personal protection.Most of the stories are about bank robberies and how the local citizenry thwarted them. The most recent event covered in this book occurred in the 1930's. This is primarily a history book.Although the book could have been edited better, Mr. Waters has done his research well, and he gives a good accounting of each of the covered events. If you are looking for this sort of thing, you will enjoy this book. I was looking for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loved this book!!","review":"My 11 year old son loved this book. In fact, when asked to do a book report for school on a fantasy book, he picked this. I think that he could really empathize with the characters. Having TS he knew exactly how those children felt.

It's norra lorra laffs. Lidz's book about his four (count 'em - 4, not 2!) crazy uncles and his borderline-crazy father has a Dickensian scope and a Joycian dynamic. His view is gently ironic, and propelled by pace, bite and pathos. In this movie, simplification and scaling down - plus huge Hollywood compromises and significant changes in ethnicity - lose the balance. A great opportunity lost and, ultimately, a terrible shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies aren't sopossed to put you to sleep..... or are they","review":"I am sorry refresh my memory...

Quirky is the perfect word for the characters in this cinematic bastardization of a great, moving book. The four mad uncles have been reduced to a couple of only-in-the-movies harmless eccentrics. Trying for a dark-toned comedy of familial mishap, director Diane Keaton dips into the sentimental fraudulence of the Harold and Maude crazy-people-are-more-in-touch-with-life-than-the-rest-of-us genre. But the black hole of the film is Michael (Kramer) Richards, who's opaque when trying to play a character with hidden depth. His \\"demetia\\" is weightless, and so, finally, is Unstrung Heroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Approach the Book's Genius On Any Level","review":"The psychedelic era's silliest secret agent is resurrected in a world that's moved on three decades. John Turturro (as Sidney Lidz) gets so much of the detail right, it's easy to take his resourcefulness for granted. Everything, from Sidney's velvet frock coats and frilly shirts to the casting (Andi McDowell's slinky sidekick Vanessa Kensington, scheming henchman Richards, and Watt's Basil Exposition, the Ministry Man who explains the plot) demonstrate how much Turturro, the creator of Barton Fink, enjoyed doing his homework. Someone, however, should have weeded out the dud gags and dissuaded Turturro from playing the villian (Ash) as well. Overall, it would take a stone face not to crumple at Sidney's dodgy catchphrases and irrepressible sexual desperation. \\"Shall we shag now, or shag later?\\" Soon, baby, soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe anyone could give this junk over 2 stars!","review":"This is just a fragment on what really happened!

Interestingly, the moviemakers Disneyfied Uncle Arthur into a compulsive collector of wedding-cake ornaments.

Evidently, the reality of moldering cardboard and cockroach-teeming newsprint didn't fit the director's Metropolitan Home esthetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"movies worth owning","review":"This is a great family movie! It shows real love between parents, love for children, and love for the people in our families who are somewhat different.

I highly recommend this movie for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"As nutty as lemon meringue pie","review":"Too much of a bad thing can be terrible. It's fish 4 days old, I wouldn't buy it.

The running time of 2 hours doesn't allow for much in the way of complexity of plotting but it's really the gentle humour in this that's the important thing rather than the mystery.Bill Nighy plays out-of-work actor Charles Paris who, through his friendship with Hugo (Paul Ritter), gets sucked firstly into the mahvelous-dahling world of am-dram and then into the investigation of a murder. Geraldine McEwan gives a lovely performance as Charles' mother, part dotty old lady, part leftover wild child from the bohemian world of the Swinging Sixties. The other cast members are excellent too and the script is typical BBC4 comedy time fare - unchallenging but amusing. A very pleasant way to spend two hours - recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I got this for my girl since she has her own business doing nails & she loves this product best insight on nail structure & product chemistry!

He recounts these times with a nostalgic air permeated with his delightfully self-effacing wit.The book stirrs an amazing desire to want to throw yourself in a jet and fly to Paris as Buchwald lovingly describes the food and places that shaped his trip.You may even want to read this book just for the cameos by famous writers, musicians, and politicians. It seems that Buchwald bumped into just about every 20th-century history maker during his time in Paris.

They did a great job of bringing many of their classic songs (some of which are almost 20 years old - gee, can I be getting that old? ) forward into the new millenium. So, for purposes of this review, the DVD is worth your money.But, Eurythmics fans, if you can find it, there is a concert video release of theirs from the \\"Revenge Tour\\" (Feb 14, 1987) called \\"Eurythmics Live.\\" Concert shows its age a bit in the clothing and hair styles, but D.S./A.L.'s performances (as well as their band's) is better than the \\"peacetour\\" concert.

Not surprisingly enough though. ADF, along with Cornershop, was one of the front-runners in the Asian Underground movement in England. Another noteworthy performer featured on this CD is Black Star Liner. Look for their new single \\"Superfly and Bindi.\\"Overall, this album has good quality performers who have made marks for themselves before this album even came out.

And Belmondo is terrific as the titular con artist who looted France during the 1930s. Acclaimed director Alain Resnais shepherds a consummate cast that includes Charles Boyer through this lavishly mounted saga of deception, romance, and bittersweet justice. Stephen Sondheim's big score is memorable and evokes the era as well as the moral corruption.

There is a floating quality to any good lullaby; this would settle even the wildest of kids.Track 2 is my favorite. Sounds of tiny birds seem to fly past you. I can put that track on repeat and never tire of it. Of course, never, ever listen to a cd like this while driving. If you listen to it at work, good luck at trying to look busy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey in your Mind","review":"Sheila Chandra's voice has matured into a marvelous instrument. This CD is ideal for blocking out the world and allows the listener to travel the drone deeply into an inner conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless CD","review":"I have hundreds of CD's of many different types of music, and I must say that this is one of my favorites. I have played it constantly for the past 4 years, and I've never gotten tired of it. I've listened to it more times than any other CD I own.You must have a quiet environment to listen to it, because her voice and the drones are very subtle. It is difficult to describe, because it's so different from most other music out there. The music is the drones and Sheila's voice; there are no lyrics or catchy tunes. But the album grows on you with each listen. A real jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"I think that this musician is highly overrated, and this CD in particular has been getting some good reviews even though it doesn't really do anything. Sheila's voice was used to reasonably good effect on her other albums, but here, her looping high pitch leads to some embarrassing results. Honestly, how can anyone sit through something like this without cringing?I suppose that New-Age music lovers have made it fashionable to state that they're into 'exotic Indian fare', which would explain why people rave about this singer's work even though most of it is a) unoriginal , b) boring and c) lacks content. Sure, shes pretty enough and is passable but to, like some reviewers, call her the 'find of the century' is going a bit too far. At best, this CD is silly and unnecessary and yet another attempt by Real World Records to put up obscure stuff on the shelf, package and market it well, and watch it sell by the dozen.Highly forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought I didn't like \\"ambient\\"!","review":"Normally, words like \\"ambient\\" send me fleeing to the hills in search of real music. But if you've tried some of Chandra's other experimental work (like some of \\"Quiet\\" or \\"This Sentence is True\\") and liked them, you should DEFINITELY get this one - it's probably the best of the lot. Why? It's so hard to verbalize - which fits right in with the artist's intentions, which seem to be to let you in on the raw, unanalyzed creative process. Really, this sort of thing really doesn't sound like it would appeal to me, but it's truly intoxicating listening.However, if her previous RealWorld discs stretch your patience at times, then don't go near this disk. If you aren't willing to let yourself simply become immersed in the textures for \\"uneventful\\" minutes on end, you won't last it through this disk.Now, could someone actually explain to me why other \\"ambient\\" music leaves me utterly cold?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamtime Star Journey!","review":"I have several of Sheila Chandra's albums but ABoneCroneDrone is the one I play most often.

Ms. Chandra's voice is pure magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew.","review":"It just wasn't good.

Still very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story - great romantic read!","review":"I have always enjoyed Enoch's books and this one was no exception! Vixen and Sin were actually a perfect couple. Both were pretending to be something they were not and both were actually bored with the lives they had been leading. Thrown together but not really against their will - they quickly found there was much to each others personalities than what others perceived. There is just enough intrigue in the plot to add to the romance. I really enjoyed this Enoch romance and would highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Vixen","review":"I love Suzanne Enoch's books and am anxiously awaiting the next in March - but \\"Meet Me at Midnight\\" was not only a disappointment but an annoyance beginning and ending with the heroine. The first time I read this book it was OK, the second read I threw it across the room, my own immature reaction to the childish, idiotic and uninteresting actions of Vixen. I am all for heroines that go against type - but this one didn't go in a way that made her more interesting, independent or engaging - instead I felt that I was wading through a mess of unappealing character traits that made me question the hero's sanity in liking her and rooting for someone else to appear and steal him away. Ms. Enoch is, however, still one of my favorite authors and I gave this book 2 stars simply because dispite my hatred of Vixen it was still well written structurally. I still recommend any of Ms. Enoch's other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"All is not as peaceful as it seems in the mouse kingdom","review":"Hercules is a ten-year-old who certainly doesn't live up to his weighty name: he's a human boy no taller than a mouse.

All is not as peaceful as it seems in the mouse kingdom: when Hercules discovers a deadly secret, it's up to him to save his mouse friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soul music of Egypt","review":"My title isn't a completely off-the-wall comparison: the gypsies in Egypt are a minority underclass who have managed to support their identity (and maintain their zest for life) through song and dance. This album is captivating: the songs and instrumentals sound spontaneous, but the artists are consummate musicians who give a professional while still impassioned performance. As a student of Middle Eastern dance, I've become very impatient with the techno-pop sound of much contemporary Egyptian popular music; this group goes back to its folk roots without being self-consciously \\"folksy,\\" and the result is a thoroughly enjoyable CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Egyptian","review":"Anyone who saw and loved Latcho Drom will remember the scene featuring the Musicians of the Nile playing in Egypt, watched from above by a child. Though the music is familiar to devotees of Middle Eastern culture, the Musicians are heavily influenced by their traveling Gypsy ancestry. Traces of European and Asian Gypsy music are audible on the album, though the instrumentation is predominantly native to Egypt. Strings, reeds, and percussion form a synthetic whole that lifts the vocals high above, as suggested by the cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information, good presentation,may be a classic","review":"Almost a must read for any pediatrician who manage any significant number of young children with asthma. It seemed expensive for a small book but is guaranteed to change your management of this group of patients. Only a 4 star because I probably have a little adhd and couldn't stay on task. I had to reread many sections. Also contains basic science information that is more that a practicing physician may need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Overview","review":"Excellent overview of not just a grassroots American phenomena, but a wonderful moment in time when television was local, before everything got sliced up and homogenized by the greedheads. Not everyone can be covered, and they do a nice job talking around the lack of Elvira, but this is a lot of fun. I especially liked the opening clip (it could have been Vampira, for chronology, or Zacherle, for popularity, or Svengoolie, for cult appeal, but I thought it was a nice choice that summed the whole thing up and gave it a humble face) and the title sequence, which is just grand! Good work. Now everyone go buy VIRGINIA CREEPERS on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"I really enjoyed this DVD, particularly the vintage clips of horror hosts like Vampira and Zacherle. I also liked the way they link the old hosts with the current ones, including the effect of MST3K's success. It isn't perfect, though; the producers were unable to get actual MST3K material and I would've liked even more classic clips. Still, what I got was very enjoyable and, with any luck, we may just get a \\"special edition\\" re-release someday.Highly recommended!-30-"},{"rating":"1","title":"something missing","review":"Great movie well played out.How it cannot have the SON OF SVENGOOLIE is a reason not to buy the movie.Sven has been on for nearly 30 years and is loved in Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUT WHERE IS...?","review":"sooo, a \\"best of\\" album thats missing lots of significant songs from the artists career. thats weird. not like ive ever seen that before.but seriously, why, if a record company doesnt have the funds/rights to get the artists complete collection together, do they waste their time and our money releasing it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Among others, missing one of his biggest hits....","review":"I found it very hard to believe that the people that put this \\"greatest hits\\" CD for Tevin Campbell left off several if not one of his biggest hits.

It was very realistic and offered down to earth solutions that work. I have several dozen dog training books and I found this one to be the most helpful in dealing with specific issues like housetraining and aggression problems. I lent my copy of the book to a friend and I'm need to order more copies for other friends looking for this type of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE ARE BETTER BOOKS OUT THERE","review":"I thought that I would be getting a book targeted to the specific problems that shelter dogs experience. Perhaps training advice on how to deal with issues that these special dogs may exhibit. Boy - was I wrong! Having recently saved a 4 month old puppy from a shelter I was really looking forward to learning how to make my puppy's adjustment smooth. I learned nothing from this book. Some ridiculous chapters include \\"Sex - Who Needs It\\" and \\"Will It Bite?\\" both addressing issues that really don't need an entire chapter. Of course your dog should be neutered and of course you should do your best to choose a happy playmate - not an agressive fiend. I am not a new dog owner but these chapters would make me never want a dog. I have had a much better experience with other books written on the subject. I would not recommend this for anyone looking for insight and training tips for shelter dogs who may have been abused, abandoned, be extremely submissive or agressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality book","review":"There are a lot of books like this one, sticks out for me.1 The choice of buildings has some nice surprises, although there are some books that are more complete.2 The images and drawings are well chosen and explanatory.3 The text included is way more relevant informative and readable than on most similar books4 It is well made, good cover and good quality paper.5 Alexander Tzonis is a good architecture critic, see his books about Santiago Calatrava.So this a great book for what it is, worth checking out for anyone interested in American architecture in the last 50 years.Get one for cheap and it is a great present too."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLICK!!!!","review":"IN MY OPINION THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS IN THE DISCO/R&B GENRE.

It included interesting characters, a great plot, and what I felt was an outstanding ending. I liked the many obstacles the characters had to overcome to reach their goals and in a way the sad parts of the book. Although they were sad I felt they were necessary to really make the reader feel like they were part of the book (a fellow mourner). Also, I loved the vivid descriptions Linda Sue Park gave of the beautiful setting, as well as the characters feelings and thoughts. Overall I felt that this was a great book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"(...)Reveiw of A Single Shard","review":"In 12th century Korea there is a orphan boy named Tree-ear. Ever since he was a baby he lived with a man named Crane-man under a bridge in the potter village Ch'ulp'o. Tree-ear admires one potter, Min. Tree-ear and Crane-man barely have any food or money until one day he went into Min's workplace and accidentally breaks a pot and most pay back Min by working for him but the potters wife starts to pay him with food. Tree-ear wants to learn how to make pots but Min refuses. But then he is sent on a journey to King's Court to show his master's pottery, but, little does he know this journey will change his life.This book is a good book. It starts out slow but when you start reading you really get into it. I like it because it is kind of a sad, slightly suspencing,adventerous, bed time story. People who would like adventure story with some thrilling and sad moments would love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethnic diversity beats interest","review":"I think some of the Newbery voters feel that every third or fourth year they must choose something to fill some unspoken ethnic diversity quota.

I wanted to preview this book before my children read it...A Single Shard was beautiful, with the rising of odds against a boy, his deep effort of respect to his elders, eagerness to learn, his struggle to prove himself, persevere, and eventually triumph....all because he tried to do the right thing in his situation. I didn't even mind the quick resolution given at the end of the book, because everything leading up to it was so riddled with struggle, I needed the closure! The author's notes at the end of the book are even worth reading...giving her studies on the topic and some historical facts to back up the story. This is on the top of the book list for my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"a single shard","review":"I would recommend this book to all the people because this book has mixed emotions. In the beginning you feel sorry for tree-ear and crane-man because they live under a bridge and because their poor. And you are horrified when tree-ear gets BADLY injured. But towards the end you feel good for tree ear and what he accomplished. But their you go again you are sobbing,horrified to what has happedned to a certain someone death. But on the other hand you feel good about another persons death. IM not only saying that this is a good book to read im saying this is book that gets your hopes up,this is a book that gives you a little boost when your feeling down. Lat but not least this is a book that lets YOU express who YOU are .

It is set in Korea in the mid to late 12th century.An orphan named Tree-ear is raised by a homeless man. The orphan begins working for a master potter but he is basically working just to get food for him and Crane-man, the homeless man who is raising him.There are parts of this book that made me cry--sad AND happy tears. There are also parts that surprised me, especially towards the end of the book.This book would be a great read while sunning by the pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I could bore you with a summary of this book but that would be useless since you can read other reviews.

A great character study to discuss with classroom or other young readers. Invest in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I read this summer.","review":"Linda Sue Park took me to a world with which I was totally unfamiliar, 12th century Korea. The story of Tree-ear, an orphan boy, being raised under a bridge by Crane-man is wonderful. Crane-man has a crippled leg and when his family died and he lost his home, he was forced to take up residence under a bridge. Crane-man teaches Tree-ear to survive in the world in which he lives by learning to read the world around him.Tree-ear is enthralled by the work of Master Potter Min. One day as he is admiring Min's work, he breaks a piece of pottery. Master Min requires nine days work to repay the loss. The nine days turn into a permanent position doing the heavy labor which has become difficult for Master Min. Tree-ear is ever hopeful that Min will teach him to become a potter. On his journey to the capitol city it is Crane-man's lessons that he remembers.Read the book and see what service Tree-ear performs that changes his life and the lives of those he has come to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and Thought Provoking Story of an Ancient Orphan","review":"Written in a simple and austere style, reflecting the setting itself, Ms. Park captures the essence of Korea's traditional values and weaves it into this very beautiful story of an orphan.

The Mandolin master starts off with Kiravani, a Melakartha and is an ever-touching raga, slowly he slides into a less popular yet complicated raga and a derivative of the 27th Melakartha (Sarasaangi) called NalinaKaanthi. Having touched the soft scales of this raga, he then decides to dwell deep into the complicated well and plays a very unpopular yet profound raga by name Sucharithra (a mela again), followed by the scintillating dusk raga, Revathi and finally gets back to Kiravani.

In other ways, it is exactly my kind of movie, funny with no gratutious violence or anything to embarrass you if seeing it with your friends or children.

And I would like to know who sang \\"Who is Johnny\\" and where I can get it on soundtrack.All in all, Short Circuit is, even in present years, a classic.

This movie bases itself around a piece of machinery that becomes much more. Like many movies out there it explores concepts of AI, but further more artificial emotions. Expressed in what I feel is a highly entertaining and humorous manor, it is definately worth a viewing, and perhaps owning.Of course there is the draw back, of the fact the DVD is letterbox widescreen, meaning that if you have, or plan to get a widescreen TV the quality will be short of that of an anamorphic version which appears not to exist at the time, it is the sole reason for 4 versus 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the Closed Captions?","review":"I bought the movie as a replacement for the VHS copy I recorded from HBO.

I first seen it in 1987 in summer school. that Indian guy makes me want to laugh, not to make fun of him, but because he sounds humorous and cheerful. there is a running gag in this movie and it is when Number (Johnny) 5 throws the seat out of the truck and drives off-twice. it seems funny that nobody believes that he is \\"alive\\". there is a suspense-builder in the movie and that is when Number 5 is supposedly blown up, but in reality, it is just a copycat of himself that he built. there is some cussing in it, but not every 5 minutes like some so-called PG-13 movies. an excellent movie for family viewing, provided that they don't blow a fuse from laughing so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Rules!","review":"This movie is by far the ultimate classic 80's movie.

The story is still reasonably good and entertaining (even though seeing the electronics of the day is quite amusing). However, if you do mind bad language, let me tell you that it's chock full of bad language. My wife and I ended up turning the movie off because of the language. I really don't remember it being that bad. Maybe I watched an edited version when I was a kid.To make this review concise...If your value system allows for you kids to be exposed to a lot of bad language, by all means, watch the movie. It's fairly entertaining, even though it's old.If your value system DOESN'T condone this kind of language, I'd steer far away from this.

I started watching it with my children and was very disappointed. The storyline and humor are perfect for children and youth, but they put in language that is almost as bad as you can get. They did not define a target market and stick with it. Without the language it would be a great film for families. With the language it makes it adult oriented, however I believe most adults will find it only slightly amusing.If you are sensitive to foul language, don't buy it.

I am afraid to spend money on it since it appears to have the same major failing as the DVD version (which I do have)--NO CAPTIONS. I assume that captions are not too costly or difficult since every DVD I own has them. There are several reasons why captions are helpful which I won't labor over, but I think every blu-ray should have captions and a wealth of other extras. My blu-ray player uploads my DVD's so well that I see no reason to upgrade my collection from DVDs to blu-rays unless there is offered something beyond what the DVDs have.

Pursued by the military, Number 5, as it is called, is befriended by a sweet-natured animal-loving numbskull (Ally Sheedy), the robot's reclusive inventor (Steve Guttenberg), and an offensive East Indian stereotype (Fisher Stevens). This is a very bad movie. Unlike so many other reviewers on this page, I found it to be dull and mechanical, a by-the-numbers production with a clunky and unappealing robot at its center, filled with stock characters that do and say exactly what you think they will because you've seen it all a million times before. Boo. I was shocked that the screenwriters, Brent Maddock and S.S.

This transfer also looks better than many other movies on BluRay, many of which have also come out long after Short Circuit!

This one is very low resolution and not full-size. Even when I zoomed on my TV, it did not fill the screen. My 6 year old son liked the movie anyway, but my wife and I mostly cringed at the mediocre script and incredibly dated music and hair styles. The language was very crude for a family movie.

It's an engaging, fun, and entertaining way to involve children in the basic philosophical issue of ontology. Ontology is the study of what it means to exist, or in the case of \\"Short Circuit,\\" what it means to be alive. Note René Descarte's (1596-1650) famous statement in Latin, \\"Cogito, ergo sum.\\" (I think, therefore I am.)Regarding the Blu-ray transfer quality controversy, the version I just bought, in Feb. of 2009, had a sticker on its wrapper that says, \\"New Hi-Def Transfer.\\" Although this movie's video quality is not as good as \\"The Fifth Element,\\" \\"The Fountain,\\" or \\"Ice Age: The Meltdown;\\" \\"Short Circuit\\" strikes me as being close to average for Blu-ray. One complicating factor is that much of \\"Short Circuit\\" was shot with low contrast, so inherently, its sharpness seems somewhat low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number 5 is alive!","review":"I remember our class winning a trip to see this movie when I was in elementary school and of course, we all loved it then. And now, many many years later, I still do love Short Circuit. The movie focuses on a company called NOVA that has constructed these new robots (which, surprisingly, don't look that out-of-date) but when a power surge hits while they are charging up, the robot called Number 5 comes alive and so the adventure begins. As he seeks for \\"input\\" he meets Stephanie (Ally Sheedy) a kind-hearted animal-loving woman who drives a lunch truck for a living. But when Stephanie discovers that Number 5 is alive, she does everything she can to protect him from the guys at NOVA who just want to disassemble him.

Hewson repeats tired descriptive phrases over and over again (eg. many a\\"crumbling palazzo\\"), his characters are pasteboard, the plot is tortuous and the dialogue is stilted.

Saves money, too. One serious problem: the refill bottles of the liquid soap are not readily available and haven't been since shortly after the product was introduced to the buying public. That indicates to me that something is wrong. Does the company not want us to buy the large bottles of refill? Does the company prefer that we keep forking out money to buy the dispenser with its small amount of liquid handsoap? If the latter point is indeed the case, they are really trying to get us to throw money away, in which case I will no longer purchase their product. Note that as of the date of this writing, my beloved Amazon.com says they do not have the item in stock at this time.

Soap is fine but will not buy again until they fix the dispenser. We have purchased several and it's always the same fight not to shoot soap all over the place. When you press on the lever it consistently gets stuck and you have to work it. Nothing like having to change your pants after trying to wash your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Messy Than Regular Bar Soap. Fun To Use","review":"The idea for a foaming soap is to reduce the time it takes for washing your hands. Instead of trying to work on a lather, a foaming soap is already made up of soap suds. Foaming liquid soap is generally thinner and watery, or else it will clog the mechanism to produce suds. You can buy refills in bigger containers or (shhhh..) concoct your own by mixing water and you favorite liquid soaps.Dial makes a lot of foaming soap products including Tone. A 7.5 oz bottle lasts a long time. More convenient than a regular soap for your powder room and sinks. It is also less messy than regular soaps. Generally one pump is enough to cover both hands. Just make sure that you cup your hands by the nozzle or the soap will spurt across the room. One wrong pump is all that it takes to learn how to use a foaming soap dispenser."},{"rating":"2","title":"why comics aren't just kids stuff","review":"This volume of alias really hits it's mark.

Eso no entona con la búsqueda de un amor, si no con el problema de la infidelidad que se deriva de un desamor.No la recomiendo, excepto para aquellos que quieran salir corriendo de sus relaciones actuales. Y quieran ser infieles.No digo que esté mal, pero tampoco es congruente con una historia sincera de sentimientos.Since beginning showed how broke a solid relationship between two men, how separate a couple with a new option...

Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. The 81 minutes dragged on forever thanks to the slow (literally) dialogue and tremendous overuse of dramatic pauses. Every character seemed to have to think about every word for 30 seconds before saying it. Maybe they were trying to keep from laughing. The acting was not at all engaging or convincing and it wasn't helped by a script that could have been performed in more like 30 minutes. The story had many false starts - hints of subplots that were never developed. Overall, it seemed like it was written a gushing high school boy just out of the closet and bursting with hormone-laden false romanticism.

It was predictable because you knew Everette was going to end up in bed with Chase. It was just a matter of time! In the beginning of the movie I was introduced to their son, but I kept wondering throughout the movie, \\"How did they come to have this boy?\\" \\"Was he adopted?\\" and \\"Is he a special needs child?\\" The movie is slow and boring until the end, when it presents itself with a Susan Hayward ending.

I can't say the acting was the absolute best I've ever seen, but the story was very sweet and touching. The characters were endearing and fairly well developed. The scenery was gorgeous, and the leading men were nice to look at, too.A story about a fairly mundane and one-sided relationship is one many people can relate to, and the idea of falling in love out of the blue is exciting and romantic to many of us. Do we give in to our feelings, or do we stand by our partner and do \\"the honorable thing\\"?

The author, anonymous, in describing with completely unwelcome detail the many exploits of this sex-crazed maniac, laces the book with erroneous bits of information about Catherine the Great's court and adds fascinating, made-up Russian phrases that sent me springing for my Russian-English dictionary every time (I got wise after a few chapters).

When his wife finally decides to leave him and take the kids with her, he calls Reverend Baird (who is played by the real-life Cecil Moe) and asks his advice.The low budget and sometimes unintentionally funny script is somewhat redeemed by a good performance by Michael Madsen, but in the end, the movie is too blatantly preachy. This movie is, according to the blurb on the back on the DVD, an \\"inspirational drama\\". This means \\"Christian drama\\". It was directed by Edward T. McDougal, who has made several christian films. They are what some christians would call \\"witnessing tools\\", but they really do mostly preach to the choir.

I have not read the book but having seen this movie, I will. There are too many other artists involved in this production to be singularly true to Mr. McCourt's vision of his past but I think they may have gotten much of it right and as a film on it's own, it is well written, excellently acted and does stand on its own as a thoughtful, if mournful, work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the book","review":"This movie was a good idea, but poorly done.

And the Subtle Knife ... well, all I can say is that Pullman wasn't up to his usual standard. His dialogue is choppy, most of the time stupid or completely useless. The entire book was one giant bog, leaving the reader slogging through the mud of words badly written and a plot badly thought out, until the last three chapters or so. The imagery is completely lacking, and the climatic events not so climatic. For example, I cried twice in the Golden Compass; the Subtle Knife evoked no reaction of that kind from me. In fact, the only reason why I gave this book two stars is that it continues the epic tale of \\"Golden Compass\\" and reveals some new ideas: the knife, Lyra's destiny, etc., etc. I just hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED??????!!!!!!!!","review":"When I read the Golden Compass I loved it. The plot was interesting, Lyra was intriguingand so was the concept of daimons. I was very excited to read the Subtle Knife. I was sorely disappointed.First of all, Lyra lost all trace of her personality with the arrival of Will. Second, I know good books shouldhave protagists of both genders but I thought Pan was enough. Will seemed just too boring to be interesting.Third, the anti God gist. I'm not Christian, and I have no qualms with books about fantasy magic. But after portraying Lord Arisel as the God killing hero was in very bad taste.Then the children wanting to kill children made me queasy. The blood thirstiness young children displayed towards Lyra and Will was appalling. The books shouldn't not get darker, Harry Potter as an example, but that was just wrong.In short, what could have been a wonderful series was forced to fall into despicability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely awful...","review":"Sorry, I found it confusing, boring, and uninteresting.

They make out the church to be the evil one, and while I am not of that specific religion, I think that it is simply wrong. Go ahead and disagree, but I have no intention of reading the next one. The first in the series was almost interesting, but I hated this."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS GOOD AS THE FIRST AND BEGGING FOR MORE!","review":"I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS BOOK IS OFTEN FOUND IN THE CHILDREN'S SECTION OF MOST BOOK STORES -- THE STORY AND CHARACTERS ARE VERY WELL DEVELOPED AND THE READING LEVEL IS NOT FOR SMALL CHILDREN. I COULDN'T WAIT TO READ THE SUBTLE KNIFE AND YET I RE-READ THE GOLDEN COMPASS ANYWAY JUST BEFORE DIVING INTO BOOK 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAITING","review":"THE TWO BOOKS, GOLDEN COMPASS AND THE SUBTLE KNIFE, WERE BOTH EXCELLENT BOOKS. HURRY UP WITH THE THIRD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disapointing","review":"This is most definitly not what I had expected. I agree with a previous reviewer by saying I would not be so disapointed, if the sister book, the Golden Compass wasn't so much better. It's moral ethics were thrown into oblivion. Let it teach a lesson that fantasy is good, but it's very hard to combine fantasy and this world. Now I don't want to be to hard on this book. It was very good and I read the whole thing in a week, when a book that size usually takes me a couple months. I think the biggest disapointment was in the suspence. It didn't have much till towards the end. Unlike in the Golden Compass where there was page turning suspence. However I still bought the book. I hope the next will be a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just for YA readers; conceptually brilliant","review":"The Subtle Knife is the second installment in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. While the first one, The Golden Compass, was set in a world parallel to ours, this sequel brings a new protagonist to the story set in our own world. A young boy, Will Perry, who is Lyra Belacqua's age joins this incredible story. Somewhat similar to The Lord of the Rings solely because the entire series is a journey to uncovering the mysteries, secrets, and the truth, the sequel definitely does not disappoint.Philip Pullman's talent shines in this sequel, as he captivates me with his prose and pace. This book (including The Golden Compass) shows memorable characters, exciting plot developments, and unexpected twists and turns.Conceptually brilliant, I think this will not only get praise from young adults but will captivate adults as well. I could not wait to read the last book in the trilogy, which I will write a review on too, for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after \\"The Golden Compass.\\"","review":"I found this book the most disappointing of the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy. After Lyra is introduced as such a strong girl character in the first book, it feels as though she loses some of her power in \\"The Subtle Knife.\\" Will takes over, and I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't bring myself to like this book.","review":"One the one hand, this book, like its predecessor, delivers an exciting story and an imaginary world that is weirdly compelling. On the other, it's often sloppily written and clumsily plotted. For example, I lost count of how many times in the first two books Pullman puts his characters into some tight spot, only to have them rescued by a deus ex machina arriving at the last possible second. This happened over and over again, to the point of comedy.In addition to its creaky mechanics, the book often seems to revel in suffering and violence, and its tone occasionally verges on the preachy. I was involved in this book while I was reading it, but now that I'm done I don't think I'll have the urge to pick it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't listen to others","review":"This is a good book and a good trilogy. The people that are saying these are anti Christian are being ridiculous. It's just a book. If you don't like to read about other's ideas, DON'T READ BOOKS. If a book can change your beliefs, you are WAY to easily manipulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supurb!","review":"It is very good but not quite as good as the GOLDEN COMPASS.The plot quickly devloped& what it lacked in imagination it made up for in adventure.It was very amusing when Lyra got a taste of our world.I very much liked the ending were it left you hanging & dying for more. I would defenaty recomend this to a friend.The bulding tension between good & evil gets you pumped up with adrenelen only to find it's the end of the book. The way you never know what is going to happen next makes it very exciting. I can't wait for the third book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga heats up!","review":"Pullman has improved on The Golden Compass, brilliant in its own right. The terrific story continues to develop and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The best part of this book is that it appeals to fantasy lovers and people with no imagination(me). Don't be scared off just because it is a fantasy. I was skeptical, but I enjoyed this book greatly. This is a good bet for all readers. I can't wait to read the third book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Subtle Knife is a story from a more disturbed time...","review":"The Subtle Knife, a book of intense mysterey and enchantment, is at the same time a phycological path that brings back childhood images while breaking down a reality. Sharp turns in the plot and descriptive, flowing writing entrance the reader while giving them the feeling of looking at a Chris Van Aluhsburg picture. It is a story of human nature gone awry, the seperation of worlds, and a more disturbed time than that in wich we live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I really liked the first dark materials book. It was very exciting and Pullman created a great character in Lyra. What the hell happened to her between the first book and the last 2? She suddenly hooks up with a male figure, Will, and she's suddenly a sidekick? Her deferential attitude in this book is completely at odds with her fiery persona from book 1.Also, if the whole point of these books was to prove you should think for yourself, why have the characters blindly follow this alethiometer when they don't know whose controlling it? It seemed a pretty weak plot device to me.I won't bother telling anyone not to read it, because if they read the first book they'll be too anxious to find out what happened to Lyra to listen. I know I was! Just borrow it from someone or visit a library so you don't waste the cash. It isn't one you'll reread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like this one!","review":"I liked the 1st book and when I finished reading it, I was excited to read the 2nd one. I don't know if I want to read the last book. This book left me feeling empty, confused, and the Specters gave me the creeps. Lyra wasn't the same anymore. She took a back seat to Will. The Subtle Knife doesn't make me crave for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong link in this Magical Chain.","review":"As the second book of this imaginative and intelligent fantasy series, The Subtle Knife does its job well. As a standalone book, it excels. What's with the paradoxical comparison, you ask? The other two are just so GOOD.I couldn't help but compare this series to Narnia. The usage of young characters in the parallel world archetype was made infamous by C.S. Lewis. Yet, this series is different and I think, better suited to older children.It is certainly more entertaining than most intelligent prose you'll ever find."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Contention With Harry Potter","review":"The second book in the his dark materials proves that pullman has created a story that rivals harry potter. the amazing writing combines with the fascinating storyline to make the bbok close to perfect. the new world of Cittagazze is great, and so are new characters Will Parry and Mary Malone. if you want to know about his book, here are three things about it: it is a teen reading level, is about different worlds, and ours, and has amzing charcters.I highly reccomend it to everyone, and think that pullman is as good a writer as J.K.Rowling, or even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book in the Trilogy.............and probably one of the best children's book i have ever read........","review":"as far as i can remember this book took me 2 to 3 days to finish...and tht was along time ago and thts a HUGE thing.........this book was even more gripping than the previous one with more Mysterious BEings and all the parallel worlds..........this kept me hooked till the very end.............PHILLIP PULLMAN has written probably the most IMAGINATIVE book ever which doesnot follow any OBVIOUS storyline...........its unpredictable and its ever so Un-understandable characters are worth to be discussed............."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"this is a wonderfully read edition of the book. a full cast makes the story come to life. in between there are terrible musical interludes, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sequal","review":"This book has already recieved an exorbent amount of reviews. It deserves no less. Although, this series has raised some controversy lately the basics is that this novel is well writen and unique. The worlds that Pullman has created are unlike any others. The characters are solid as well as the writing. If you have already started the trilogy then perhapse it is a given that you will finish it to it's conclusion. If you have yet to begin then now is a great time to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than its prequel,but definetely needs a good sequel!","review":"The Subtle Knife suprised me. It brought in Will, a kid looking for his father. Surprisingly, Will's father found a door to Lyra's universe from ours. Will met Lyra in Cittagaze, a bridge between Lyra's world and ours. The city is filled with adult-eating spirits, specters. Lord Asriel is also trying to kill god. This book kept my attention towards it, unlike the Golden Compass, which became boring at the middle of part 3. The Subtle Knife also had a very intriguing plot. Good job Phillip Pullman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest book I'll ever read!","review":"The Subtle Knife was one of those great books that you just had to read another page, and another page - I could never put this book down! NO part of it was dull - It was 100% non-stop excitement, filled with danger and a twist of fate. Lyra and Will made an excellent team in this bok, and it is definately worth reading over and over! I would reccomend this book to anyone above 12 years old who has a creative imagination to enjoy page after page of true writing. Philip Pullman has done it again (The Golden Compass was GREAT as well)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Subtle Knife is one of the best books I've read.","review":"Seldom is the sequel better than the original. However, in this case, I find that The Subtle Knife is infinately better than The Golden Compass. Having already introduced main characters and main ideas, Mr. Pullman can bring out ideas and philosophies that capture the imagination and spark new thoughts. The only reason I did not completely enjoy this book was because of the cliffhanger ending that left me begging for the third installment of His Dark Materials. On the whole, however, The Subtle Knife is a superbly crafted literary work suitable for almost any reader of almost any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Fulfilling in every way!

If you want a challenge read The Subtle Knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful fast paced read","review":"I thought this book was very well written and very exciting. Having heard all the controversy over the books, I felt the need to read them so that I could form my own opinion about the books. Yes, the book is very anti-religion and takes specific hits at the Catholic church, however it is still a very good book. I do not believe that it should be read by younger children as there are very violent scenes and scenes with some sexual references. However, I feel it is quite appropriate for teenagers. Parents and teens should read this book together. There are plenty of chances in the book for quality family discussions, not to mention the vocabulary in the book is actually intelligent and not made up words as was with some of the other popular young adult fiction series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"The Golden Compass Trilogy is our first time listening to audio cds, but the cast and sound-fx were amazing. The Subtle Knife is an excellent sequel to the golden compass, this is a great adventure story for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about a sequel of a book","review":"This book was at first quite different, and this made it a great sequel. Then it became, only partly, like a traditional sequel. Not in the sense of the story, because there are plenty of great new adventures with some great character development, including a key new character. I mean that it just seems to build up to the third book, maybe another reason to read it, huh? I still highly recommend it. Although I liked the first one better, this one is still five-star material."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't think that the knife was all THAT subtle...........","review":"This has to be the most BORING book I have ever read.

I put one star so you would read my review. This review I write is mostly to the ones who thought it wasn't right for people to read it. I do agree that it did bother me about the whole thing about God but it helped me realize how I was close to God. Besides that I LOVED IT. Somebody said that it was a terrifying book. Hello people this book is science fiction. And calling Will a murderer is wrong. It was the own guys fault in my opinion. Who ever hasn't read this book better go out and buy it right now. You are missing all the excitement. READ IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BESTEST BOOK THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN","review":"After reading this book I simply must say I was blown away! 'Tis the best book I have ever read in my whole life! It is so deep and vivid! The characters are vivid, you can picture every word Mr. Pullman writes! Simply breath taking! It is a sure to be classic! I wish I had a dmon! I simply can't wait for the last book in the series to come out!!!!!!!!! Usually in many books the villians seem far off and dull but you even Mrs. Coulter stands right up out of the book! In my opinion Mr. Pullman is the best author to have ever lived since J.R.R. Tolkien! This book is a sure to be classic! I have read the book over and over again, almost ten times and it never fails to amaze me! You thought the Golden Compass was grand, well wait to read The Subtle Knife? Mr. Pullman, bring on the last book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!!! a big page turner!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I can't express my feelings about this book! It's the best I've ever read! I bought \\"The Golden Compass through a book ordering program, and didn't even start reading it until a year later! Finally I did, and boy did I choose the right book! When I first saw \\"The Subtle Knife\\" I bought it with my own money in hardback (because it wasn't out in paperback) for 18 dollars! But I soon found that every penny was worth it. I loved the thrilling adventure of Lyra, Will, and her daemon Pantalaimon. I urge all to read this fantastic novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new author for me but one I'll continue reading","review":"Pullman did an excellent job with this series and particularly with the book the subtle knife. It was my favorite one. All I really have to say is that the characters were excellent. They were as real as they could get from the pages of a book. Wil was awesome. Hes just a mysterious youth with a troubling past and a knack for getting chased by the wrong crowd. He is also incredibly intelligent for his age. Later in the book he inherits the subtle knife...the ultimate weapon.Will goes on to meet the main character of the Golden Compass, Lyra, and the two start their journeys together. They are quite an interesting pair.Pullmans world is highly imaginative. It is filled with magic, intrigue, and well thought out plot and characters. AN EXCELLENT READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Great Series!","review":"The Subtle Knife by Philip Pullman Is amazing. It is and interesting fantasy novel that has tons of action.This book includes Magic, Battles, Science, And Friendship. This also a great series. The reason i would choose this book over the amber spyglass is because the amber spyglass had so much action and things going on that it got tiring. Also it was very long. The Subltle Knife is about two children, Will and Lyra, That embark on a fantastic journey that takes them through many worlds. They meets outragous enimies and allies such as angels, witchs, talking war bears, and small bug-like Gallivispian Spies. This book was great and is a must read! I Would Give It 5 STARS! ***** it is also a great series. I think it is destined to become the next Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy followup","review":"A very nice follow up. Will is a very interesting and sympathetic character and, as a mother, I wanted to embrace the poor soul and rock him for a while. However, I found the character of Lee Scorseby to be a cartoonish British person's idea about how someone from the Southern U.S. might act, a sort of Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel without the irony."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorites! Must become a classic! Info please!","review":"This book, and all books in Philip Pullman's HIS DARK MATERIALS will become instant classics! The adventures and strong emotions, the realistic characters and the strong beliefs and depth discoveries make this book one of my all time favorites! Will and Lyra travel far and wide, entering different worlds and find many friends, and dangerous enemies on their perilous journeys! But something confuses me, I understand this should just be a review, but in the first book, GOLDEN COMPASS, I had read that there were to be SEVEN or so books planned on Lyra, I'm not sure I am correct, but if someone could email me at miguel@surferz.net and give me any information on whether there are other books on Lyra coming out, and perhaps when, or if i heard wrongly, i would deeply appreciate it. THANK YOU! and enjoy HIS DARK MATERIALS"},{"rating":"2","title":"give us more Pullman!","review":"Philip Pullman must have been possessed by some spiritual power when he wrote his Dark Materials. Dust. Angels. Spectres. Zombies. Doorways into other worlds. Trepanning. Bloodmoss. Witches. The Great War of Good and Evil. The compass. The subtle knife. Pantalaimon, Lyra and Will. It is only Philip Pullman who can pull off integrating all these ideas and symbols in one excellent book, and keep us muddled as to who fall under the forces of Good, and who fall under the forces of Evil. The Subtle Knife is certainly not a disappointment after the magic of The Golden Compass. He skillfully weaves the lives of Lyra and Will together through a spell-binding storytelling of loyalty, fate, fear and friendship. And as he leaves us hanging once more at the end, we fear for their lives, and hold our breaths at the thought that they just might do each other in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"All of Phillip Pullman's books are amazing. I really enjoyed the Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, too. I can't wait for the next one.

The Subtle Knife is one of the best books I've read in my life, and the story is beautiful. Lyra storms into a new world, angry from the brutal death of her friend Roger. Then she meets Will, and before long, they become friends and learn to trust each other through thick and thin. All the while Will must serve a haunting purpose :to be the bearer of the Subtle Knife. But can he use the power of the knife to protect Lyra from deadly hands?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for fantasy readers!","review":"I thought this was a great follow up on The Golden Compass. Will Perry (the new character) was well developed through out the book. I liked how this book included some of the old characters like Lee Scoresby and Serifina Pekkala ( I was disappointed that Iorek Byrinson, one of the main characters in The Golden Compass, wasn't included).

None the less, roll on the third edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's be subtle about religion","review":"I agree that the book is well conceived and intriguing. And, whatever it says about religion, it should not be censored. But perhaps we should be asking some more pointed and difficult questions. First, the Church here is not just any church; it's the Magesterium, which means R.C. Is it good, or right, that this church is portrayed as involved almost solely in child abuse? Second, Lord Asriel is obviously Lord Israel (just switch two letters). His desire to kill God is therefore an echo of the old idea that the Jews killed Jesus. Now what is going on with these images? Censorship aside, should we support and laud them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A long book, but a quick read.","review":"This book didn't disappointment me compared to the first one.

He was also a very strong character, always helping Lyra. This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Marvelous!","review":"I just love thinking about things such as parallel dimensions, the universe and such. This book was great and I can't wait to get my hands on the third. I was just a TAD bit upset when Scoresby and Grumman had to die, but that's besides the point. I am amazed that this book was so good considering i got this at an Elementary School Book Fair. It was great. Phillip Pullman, hurry up writing, I've been without Lyra and friends for four whole days!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A merely adequate sequel with a cliffhanger ending...","review":"The story takes on a decidedly moral turn as Lyra continues the journey she began in The Golden Compass. The idea of \\"angels\\" and \\"Specters\\" as well as the tying of \\"Dust\\" to dark matter are a bit far-fetched but still fun and original. Some of the magic seems to have been lost in this sequel, but the idea of having a daemon is still charming. My love for the first book redeems my rating for the second."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best trilogy(so far)!!!!","review":"I am only 14 years old. I read the Golden Compass first when I was 11, then again when I was 12, 13, and now 14. Each time I get something new out of it. Philip Pullman has vividly described everything in this book. I would have to say my favorite part being when the computer responds to the doctor. I do believe that this is the most I ahve ever anticipated a final book to be done with. A great book that all should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comeback......but what's with the ending??","review":"I found that The Subtle Knife was very captivating and a great sequel to The Golden Compass. There was a couple of things I disliked in it though. What happened to Lyra's leadership skills? And why did it end so abruptly? Well, besides those points, The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife are my favorite books in the whole world and I can't wait for the third book. dOES ANYONE KNOW WHEN #3 COMES OUT OR AT LEAST WHAT IT'S CALLED????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some very interesting ideas","review":"It has some very interesting ideas especially on the subject of God. I think Will is a good character but I don't like how Lyra gives in to him.I am glad Mrs Coulter is back. And I like the idea of the Angels and The subtle knife.It is a very good book. Better than the golden compass. It is very gripping I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Adventure","review":"This book was even better than The Golden Compass and I really liked The Golden Compass. This one continues Lyra's story but it also brings in another main character with an interesting past as well as several other new characters and sub-plot lines.

I love listening to these books as they are read by Philip Pullman, and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written!","review":"That as well as the other books in the trilogy are a must read! Awesomely written. Great plot, character development The odd thing is that so many had made reference to this bashing Christianity and I only see that from those who are non-believers. To make the correlation between their religion and our form of Christianity is bashing Christianity in of itself. There is one reference to the Catholic church and that is from a character who is from the same world as Will. I have forgotten her name, but that was in a different world than Lyra and the tyrannical government that ruled her world. It is called Fantasy and not called a Reality based book. I loved it!. I can not think of a better fantasy writer than Philip Pullman. Beautifully written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sequel...","review":"A Great Sequel which follows on from \\"Northern Lights/The Golden Compass\\".

A series of books that I have so far enjoyed and I highly recommend to young adults of 13 and upwards and adults too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I won't write a book to review a book; I'll just say that all of the magical, interesting elements of the first book are gone in the second. The Subtle Knife is much more cynical and mean-spirited than the first. The worst fault of the book for me is that it begins to meander, you can almost tell that the author is writing while trying to decide where the story should go. I really enjoyed The Golden Compass and had high hopes for the second. I was so disappointed in the drop-off of writing that I didn't even bother to read the third book. For me, that's pretty rare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"After reading the Golden Compass (my new favorite book) I couldn't wait for the release of Subtle Knife. I got it the first day the book stores had it. After I read it, I was a little let down. I was expecting a spectacular sequel to a great peice of work, but in reality, it was a mediocre story. Minimal plot twists made it a little boring. Too bad, maybe the next book will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L","review":"To all ye open minded and unbound of heart- THIS HAS GOT TO BE SECOND TO NONE BUT IT'S SIBLINGS IN THE TRILOGY! This is a masterful weaving of soaring phrases. It has a wonderful plot with a cliff hanging edge that kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole half year it took for the Amber Spyglass to come out.And yes, I pity the poor people who consider this offensive to their religon. I am known to many friends as a recomender of top-quality, exciting, magical, fantastic, descriptive, soul-carrying master-pieces of books. And yet, one girl I know kept herself wallowed in her religon and denounced this classic for one dumb reason: \\"Oh,\\" she whined, \\"They're talking about killing god! Oh! OH! I just can't read it!\\" and so on and so forth. She doesn't know what she's missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something of a disappointment after Book 1","review":"This is certainly a solid four-star book, and approaches five stars in many ways. It is only disappointing for two reasons: beacuse it comes after a nearly perfect book, and because it is so ambitious that it sets itself up for failure. Pullman is very skilled, but he is even more ambitious. If the second two books in this series were about anything else, they would seem truly great, but in order to deal with universe-shaking topics, one needs to be a writer of universe-shaking skill, and few, if any, authors have that.Although I am somewhat disappointed by The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass, I applaud Pullman for being brave enough to attempt them. He isn't completely successful, but what writer would be? Has ANY writer ever done this successfully? Someday I will read Paradise Lost, Pullman's inspiration, to see if even it lived up to its subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Sequel","review":"This book was as good as the first one. I've found out that they're shelving these books in the adult science fiction section as well as the children's section, which at first seemed wrong, but they are fairly dark and a little graphic with the violence. Nevertheless I have thourougly enjoyed these books. This is the continuing story of Lyra who travels to another world and meets a boy named Will who is looking for his father. It follows their adventures and I personally enjoy this series because of what their war is about. But anyhoo. Go read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than the first, but good","review":"A lot of readers seem to be upset because Lyra takes the backseat in this novel to Will, a new character from a world like our own. While I did find some of Lyra's actions to be atypical of the feisty, brave girl that we met in The Golden Compass, I understand that Pullman had to introduce the character of Will to continue to flesh out the Paradise Lost parallels, and to give Lyra someone to journey with. There is a lot of death in this and the third book, and a lot of religious themes that some might find offensive or confusing (though one must remember that this is a novel, not an editorial or non-fiction piece; it is fake). I like Will and still love Lyra. I found this to be the weakest of the trilogy, but a must read to fully appreciate the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"my 11 year old son's favorite book","review":"My son liked this trilogy better than Harry Potter. Since it is also good for reading aloud, how can this be anything less than 5 stars?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book if you read the one before it.","review":"This book was as wonderful and exciting as the Golden Compass, however made many references to the past book, and did not follow up with an explanation. Though, the writing was spectacular and captivating. I read it in two days flat because I couldn't put it down, and I'm 11! However I had already read the first book. I wonder when the third book will come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book for a peson who wants a long book ,an A+++++!","review":"This book grips you from the very beginning.The descriptions are excellent, and if you liked The Golden Compass, this is the book for you.

Pullman seems virulent in his hatred of religion. There is something in his violence that makes the reader feel this is no longer fiction--he really means it. Probably he doesn't have the slightest idea that to anyone with faith this book is profoundly hurtful, to the point of causing physical pain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite of the Series","review":"This book is my favorite of the Dark Materials series. While it ties nicely with the Golden Compass; it could quite easily stand on its own"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Very entertaining and enjoyable read. Highly recommend the book, especially if you are a fan of everything that mystical and dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"The readers of the this wonderfull book are very good. A very good story that keeps your attention to the very end, and wanting book three to find out how it ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine fantasy","review":"I read this to see if the series would be good for my 10 year old grandson. I found it a bit advanced for him, more suitable for a 14 year old. If a person has an issue with the way these books question religion, they may not like them as much as I did. Well written, excellent plot, thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit Deux Ex Machina","review":"I didn't read this like 90% of the population when I was 12 it was only later when a friend gave them to me for Christmas. While I dislike the entirety of the series for it did nothing to grab me and feels like recycled atheistic arguments blended with someone taking the warhammer 40k lore a bit too seriously. The subtle knife is the worst of the series for me as it gives the characters an 'out' to every problem which in itself is a bit galling. The whole setup seems to have been created just to give a vehicle to further Pullmans agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure magick..","review":"Intoxicating. This book has a daemon all of it's own. It was almost impossible to put down, for it seems the book calls to you. Ever since i was 4 years old i used to pretend there were worlds, not unlike our own, existing on some different energy plane or realm. Someplace where everything you can imagine exists. Where you are a figment of someone's imagination, where they write myths and fables of your life. This book is pure magick.. it opens new doors inside of you, Pullman's words, paint full vibrant pictures of every scene. You Can almost feel Serafina near you. Hear the beating of the angel wings. you are there terror stricken through every attack of the Spectors, wishing you could help. You can see the sky spotted with beautiful witches, you can fly with them. Purely incandescent."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book for the open minded","review":"The Subtle Knife by Philip Pullman is the second book of his dark materials trilogy. I wouldn't say that this one is better than the first book, The Golden Compass. If you have read the first book than you pretty much know what to expect from the author. He has a big imagination, which produced a great plot with colorful characters. The second book is about how Lyra and her new friend Will, search for his father. The plot is full of twists and turns and will keep you guessing until the very last page. This is a story, which is dramatic, mysterious, an adventure and science fiction all in one package. I would recommend this book to middle school students and up because the vocabulary and plot might be too intense for younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pullman Rocks Again","review":"I found The Subtle Knife to be as engaging (if not more) that The Golden Compass. Set in another world shared between protagonist Lyra Silvertongue and newcomer, Will, we explore the creepy surroundings filled with angels (bene elim-hebrew for \\"sons of god\\")and spectors who eat out souls. The possibility of war arises with troubles of choosing allies and enemies and we await the third installment of His Dark Materials: The War of Wars which will determine who will prevail. Keep Looking for the Amber Spyglass, the last book of the incredible trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It just keeps getting better!","review":"I thought The Golden Compass was good, but this was a real page-turner! I made the mistake of putting it down, and it took me months to pick it up again. It's one of those books where you need momentum, but once you get going, you are reading it every chance you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading for Any Age","review":"I picked up the first book in this series (in the children's department, though I found later that a different edition is shelved in Sci-fi) after reading a Vanity Fair article which basically stated \\"Harry Potter, you have nothing on Phillip Pullman.\\" They were right. I liked Harry Potter, but this was something much better! It has more adult themes (though still appropriate for the middle school crowd) and is slightly dark but this tale is wonderful! It's exciting and archetypal not 'dumbed-down' as some children's books are. Any fan of J.K. Rowling, C.S. Lewis or J.R.R. Tolkien should give this trilogy a try--it has those same overarching themes and universality of tale (that of the quest) that make those books so popular. It's a book (and a series) I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I just finished the novel The Subtle Knife, and I think it is the best book I have ever read. The constant twisting plot and the suspense is enough to keep you page turning right to the end. I truly loved The Golden Comapass, but I believe that the sequal is even better! I admire Lyra and Will's courage and strength to go on. The novel made me believe in other worlds like Cittagazze and wish that I had a daemon, too. Will's theroy that the Soul-eating Specters also live in our world seems quite realistic and I think there's some connection. The end really leaves you hanging and a lot of mysteries are left unsolved. I CAN NOT WAIT UNTIL THE THIRD BOOK IS OUT!! They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but the words let you not only see it, but experience it. Philip Pullman's outstanding novel, The Subtle Knife, not only lets the reader experience it, but it touches the soul and leaves you with an amazing story you will never forget. - Erin Schulthies age 13"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous book,best book ever and I NEED VOLUME III !!!","review":"The Subtle Knife is sooo amazingly wonderful! If you have not read it,read it NOW. However, presently I am in great despair as the third book still has not been published.It is a great fantasy adventure about two courageous children who face tremendous difficulties but somehow manage to pull through.There is only one problem; at the end there is a MAJOR cliffhanger!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful,smart, and endlessly intruiging","review":"In my opinion, the Subtle Knife was a sucess on all counts. Despite what others have said, I beleive that Lyra remained true to herself and to Pan. The carefully planned polt made the reader incapable of putting the book down, with so many \\"Ohhhs,\\" and \\" so THATS the man from the cocktail party\\" instances. I would recommend this book highly to anyone. To young people, because they can so easily relate to Lyra's plight, and we can all see a little of the belligerent Will in ourselves. And for adults, it is a glimpse into not only the adolescent brilliance of the two main charachters, but also in the intelligence thay have, and in the deft way they use it to their advantage. They never question their resources, and they never condescend. They use what is needed,and maintain their pace,and in so doing, never let the reader catch their breath"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was very good, although the ending left me unsatisfide.","review":"I really liked the Golden Compass and the Subtle Knife. I'm really bummed that the next book gets out so late. I liked almost all of The Subtle Knife as much as the Golden Compass, but the ending, I think, wasn't very good. When I was finished reading The Subtle Knife I was a little depressed. The ending was not something I expected. Philip Pullman has a unique style of writing, where not everything always turns out okay. When I was done with The Subtle Knife I was discouraged to read the next book, but I'm sure Mr. Pullman will end the trilogy with a bang."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING ... UNBELIEVABLE","review":"This book is the most exciting book I have ever read. I read it when I was 9yrs old, I am now 10.

This one is a story full of fantasy,mystery,murder and practically everything else you can name!

Oh, do I hope so. Even though I did, in all honesty, think that the Golden Compass was better, this is still one of my favorite books. WHERE, in the whole entire series, does it say ONE WORD about the devil or worshipping him? Isn't Lyra, who you say is what, a liar and constant truant? stuck between defending her father, herself, and her world? Doesn't Will, the \\"heartless murderer\\", spend a large majority the time in this book feeling bad because of a \\"murder\\" that he didn't even want to committ? Would you be able to deal with their problems under the circumstances? No, I didn't think so. So next time, PLEASE, think before you humiliate yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Strike","review":"This book continues the marvellous achievement of the first, and even furthers it.This novel is probably even better than the first one. (And the Third is even better than this.) The initial characters are all back, and this time we are introduced to Will, who is an ideal companion for Lyra. Just as interesting (possibly moreso due to the fact that he has no daemon, which causes interesting discussion.) and equally well drawn.The writing is as cracking as it was in the first, and the setting is evoked really well, as is the terror felt by the people of Citagezze, and the loneliness of the place. Also, there is a wonderful juxtaposition of the evil of the spectres, and the jaded innocence of the children who are able to inhabit the world.Another wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Fast-paced and heart-thrilling this book continues right where the Subtle Knife left off. People with short boredom spans will enjoy this book as it jumps from character to character. It may seem incomplete to some of you, but pick up the third one and let all your problems be solved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, guy in San Jose, get a life!","review":"No one really cares if the book is slightly against Christianity.

To be fair, we hit harder than most backyard players who are just floating shots up high. We quickly realized we needed a better set (and a net that had smaller holes!). I ordered this set because it looked like it would stand up to some more serious play. On arrival, one racquet had a bent handle, and within 1/2 hour of play, two others were either losing their hand grips or had partially broken, and all 3 shuttlecocks were broken. We were not abusing the set at all, but were playing \\"real\\" badminton. If you're looking for something that will stand up to this type of play, look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I purchased this for a family reunion and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and ease of assembly. I have had several badminton sets and this is, by far, the best of the bunch. The net, sturdy poles, and rigging insure that you will be playing the game, not fixing the equipment.The raquettes are above average quality for games in this price range. The birds (shuttlecocks, birdies, etc.) leave something to be desired, but others are available locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good...some bad","review":"Bought this set as it was the \\"platinum\\" set. Thought it would be a good one. Right out of the gate, the birdie was getting stuck in the strings of the raquets on every 3rd or 4th hit. That was extremely frustrating and caused us to quit playing shortly after starting. On a positive note, the net and volleyball seem to be of good quality and the set up was pretty easy. Ultimately...we'd use it for badminton the most and with the raquet strings being so loose that you can't play with them, the set is very disappointing. Would love to send it back, but can't find my receipt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for attendance!","review":"This is a time saver for classroom attendance.

Instead, each song gives you just a little taste, leaving you unfulfilled. On \\"Lament\\" and \\"Sweet Pain\\" Brook's King Crimson-style guitar playing completely overwhelms Nusrat's voice -- no mean feat!That having been said, this west-meets-east collaboration has its high spots: \\"My Heart, My Life\\" is particularly good, with a throbbing heartbeat bass line and shimmering guitar setting off perhaps the most ecstatic singing on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"No waistband is a dream!","review":"With no waistband, there is still a feeling of control, but no waistband wedging into your waist and creating a roll of flesh above it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Waistband and Nice Shine a Plus!","review":"When I first bought these pantyhose last week, I thought that these were just any other pair of pantyhose.

The authors have provided excellent tips about certain locations, especially around the most popular sites. There is a bit of discussion about light and textures, but not quite enough. I spent a week there, which is not long enough to make firm opinions, but long enough to realize that there is a lot more to prepare in terms of photographic strategy than the book provides. For example, the real problem of sunrise and sunset. The horizon is almost always packed with thick clouds, so most sunsets are not what one would have imagined. I would have loved to know beforehand if there is any place where you can get a good sunset shot.The book lacks in some other areas. For example, there is very little discussion about tides, which is extremely important matter for photographing ocean coast.

In fact, much of the \\"man's world\\" that is Beat literature is balanced in this anthology. I admit, sometimes, when it comes to overviews of the American avant-garde, one is trading one whitewash for another.Anyway, this anthology devotes time to writers other than the big three of the Beats.

I wouldn't have thought that a story based around surfing and men in kilts would be anything to get terribly excited about, but the humorous aspects of the story were more than worth the weirdness.Josie teaching a bunch of old Scottish duffers to surf was probably the best part of the book, and even Connal eventually warmed up to it.Donna Kauffman is a fantastic writer with some pretty weird ideas, and this particular book is hilarious and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars Great Book!","review":"I would have given this book 5 stars but I felt the beginning was a bit slow to get into but once I did, I could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no cigar","review":"I started this book and the first red flag was the Scottish brogue dialogue that some of the characters spoke in.

Great lines from Tim Thomerson like, \\"Lady I am tough,\\" and \\"Your probably just another dizzy b**** from Melrose... Shopping all day,\\" make this flick classic.

I am stuck on song #6 (rising hall in silence), and my neighbors must be getting sick of it by now, but I am not. The third song on the cd (firetongues) is almost as good. For some reason, TD's live cd's are almost always better than their studio versions. This cd brings back some of the late 70's and early 80's TD, and confirms a long held belief of mine: that TD's music, supplanted with a dance (house) beat is just as good (I feel better) than most club music today, while still keeping the serene sound of TD. Try to imagine White Eagle with a faster back beat that doesn't wreck the song, but makes it even better. Not all the tracks are superb, but as with most TD cd's, the two or three that are really make the album.

Wolfe, with the help of Archie, Saul, Orrie, and others in the crew, must investigate the murder of a fashion model who died by eating candy from a box of poisoned chocolates.

The belt clip attachment is a little worrisome as well because it screws to the skin, and I'm not convinced that the force of it won't tear the skin after a while. The protective cover was disappointing because it's just a clear plastic sticker that you have to cut to fit.

Ravenor's first-person narrative is less than a quarter of the book i estimate, and much of the actual conflict in the novel is through other characters, understandable given ravenor's condition. I contrast this with the eisenhorn stories, where eisenhorn was the central character and all conflict (or nearly so) revolved around his personal involvement.I did find Zael whiny and rather tiresome, particularly when he couldn't get his act together after the last dream while ship was invaded...great book, waiting to receive book 2.

Very handy tool, I used it to evacuate transmission fluid out of car (Toyota V6) and it worked great. Having the suction created on the down stroke makes it easy to use along with the extended foot step. I had to do some metric conversions and mark the side of container with lines, or you could just pour in known quantities of water and mark the sides. Knowing how much liquid you removed is needed for easy exchange. Three tubes included and so far long enough for my usage. The unit advises on a 175 degree rating so I usually wait about half an hour before removal so oil has time to cool off a little, this is also advised since you are really applying a plastic tube to hot metal parts under the hood.

I wanted to test the unit before putting my faith in it, and wanted to see how thorough the vacuum was. So the Mityvac picked up all it could, and then I unplugged the oil drain bolt to see what was left....Which was surprisingly little. There was about a half cup worth of oil that the Mityvac didn't pick up. I thought that was GREAT for the money I put into it. If it serves as an indicator of things to come, it's a great buy.Note: I rated 4/5 because I haven't used it for a long time.

I warmed up the engine (who knows if it wasn't warm enough?). The hose was so short I had to hold the unit on top of the engine (very awkward to try to pump that way). I tried both tubes thinking maybe one or the other would produce a better result; neither was better than the other. In the end I just packed the unit up and sent it back. I also found it nearly impossible to remove that plug thing that joins the hose to the unit; I'm guessing dumping used oil with that plug blocking the spout would have been nightmarish as well.

It's impossible because the top of the tank leaking fluid from the excape air hole on the side because it's not meant to be placed sideways! I bought a 1/4 coupler and 12 feet of 1/4 plastic line from the hardware store and stuck the 1/4 line together(the smallest line supplied from the unit) and can finally use it. They need to make the lines 10 feet long and it would be perfect. Note: Mine never came with istructions, but I saw a review and it said to attach the bigger diameter line to the shorter line to make it longer. It wouldn't work for me because it won't seal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use with Synthetic Oil- Tool Topia not returning!","review":"I used this on my 2002 BMW and it seemed to work great, but the next time I went to use it- oil started coming out of the T-Handle where air normally is the only thing that escapes.

It sucks the entire 3.5 quarts out of my Prius in about 3 to 5 minutes. I know that it's getting nearly everything out of the pan because I put 3.5 quarts back in, and that brings the level right to the full line. You still have to change the filter, but I can catch the drips from that in a gladware container instead of a huge oil pan! If you have a European-style canister filter mounted on top of the engine, you're even better off!I have had no problems with leaks, and the vacuum is very strong. You only have to pump the air out once to drain the entire pan.If I were buying one again, I would get the model that allows you to pump fluids back out. Tipping the evacuator to fill containers for recycling can be messy, unless you're very careful. If you're buying this in order to save yourself a hassle, consider the reversible MityVac model :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK with some cars","review":"This extractor worked OK with my Volkswagen, but it did not seem to get all the oil out.

It is fairly straightforward to get it going and start pumping out oil in no time. Cleaning this up is not so easy though.Top part is not easily removable, so I used some degreaser to spray insides and rinse off. Cleaning up those hoses is not easy too and I would much rather prefer a one time use hose solution.Be careful pushing the hose inside your engine too hard. I changed oil on my Mercedes without any issues, but when I used it on my wife's Subaru small hose banded and got stuck inside the engine. I pulled it out after jerking and pulling for about 20min , but that scared me a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 2 years","review":"Worked OK when it did, which was about 2 years.

I ordered this item to change the oil in my wife's new Volvo and avoid the hassle of having to crawl under the car (it has a top mounted oil filter). The Mityvac arrived promptly with no damage; the directions were well written; and within an hour I was changing oil. About 5 pumps removed half the oil and another 5 pumps finished the process. The unit is simple but very well made and a genuine bargain at Amazon's price (with free shipping). The dealer wanted $150 for the 15K service.

The key is to use it after the engine is hot, but you have to be careful around hot parts (and FYI I'm not liable for any injury). Don't worry about the hose melting; I stuck it all the way down in the crankshaft and it was fine. The oil was drained in about 5 minutes, and got all of it out as far as I could tell (I ended up re-adding a full 4.5 quarts, which is the indicated capacity of my engine). There is no way I could have done this safely (i.e. at this oil temperature) by draining from the oil pan the old way (i.e. without a fluid evacuator). It's still a messy job, but much less so with this device.

Oil would literally flow out during a single pump. Messy.SECOND LEAK:This leak is almost as bad as the first. It occurs at the hole on the cap where the metal downpipe goes into the unit. Again, oil leaks out of it.When you combine the both leaks, it's a horrible mess! When I called Mityvac, their response made it seem like they had heard this before.

Not content to stay in a death metal pigeonhole, Paradise Lost have finally transformed themselves into the gothic rock band they have always hinted they were.Say Just Words gives the listener a taste of old Paradise Lost but do not be surprised by what else you hear. Paradise has lightened their sound on this one, preferring to move to a more mood oriented sound. They probaby saw all the copycat bands of their style and decided the time had come for a change. Certainly the new material doesn't kick with the same force as Draconian Times but it is their first step in a new direction and a welcome change for older fans. I look forward to seeing where they take this new sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrendous!!!","review":"Quite amazingly, this is a bane for old Paradise Lost fans.

You should treat it separately from their other albums since it surely is more poppy and electronic sounding. It's very catchy though, and can be described as a techno-like mix of Type O Negative and Moonspell (don't let the techno description scare you off.)

Newcomers to the band who didn't fall in love with their established sound should find something to like, however. The songwriting is above average for the genre, and the playing is far more inventive than most bands of this nature.

How will washing your hands, help you become a crtical thinker? He has one rule about tipping hotel employees. What?! Tipping hotel employees will make better student! Too many rules and they don't have to do with education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good behavior does not equal critical thinking","review":"As an educator and a parent, I was interested in finding out how to better teach my students and children to be thinkers, evaluaters, analysts, etc. Higher level cognitive skills are essential for success at school, at home, and eventually, in the \\"real world\\" of the workplace and so on. However, this book does not try to solve the question: How do we teach kids to be critical thinkers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"For New & Experienced Teachers Alike","review":"This book is incredible. I bought it because I wanted to tweak my discipline system in my classroom. I am an experienced teacher with 22 years under my belt and I needed the refreshing ideas and guidelines that Ron Clark shared from his classes. He is very realistic and shares with humor and expertise. Our kids need manners and lessons on how to get along in society. This book is very poignant for today's generation. \\"The Essential 55\\" is a grand tool for any classroom teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource for Beginning Teachers","review":"I thought this young man had an interesting story. He tells it very well, and his rules are great. This is not just for teachers though, I'd love to see parents use these rules at home.This book is an easy read and is written in everyday language.Excellent buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"This small but important book should be in the professional library of every teacher, and most certainly every teacher starting out in the profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's Scary In His Ways!","review":"Thank heavens I borrowed this from the library and didn't spend a dime on it. It's the worst book I have read to date! He is very once sided. He apparently is convinced his way is the only way. He is teaching in some of the worst areas in America, so he is missing out on the average child, the average household. Maybe he can do some good with those children, maybe they have different needs in their lives, but unfortunately he is not speaking to a large percentage of America & so many communities/children/families out there. I HAD to force myself to read this book. He comes across so self righteous I hope my children never encounter a teacher of this nature!!! I hope my children have teachers that truly care about them, their individual personalities and abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for new teachers","review":"After reading several other books similar to Ron Clark's no other book gave me the knowledge I needed to help me in the classroom. The author uses many personal situations to explain 55 things that help him in the classroom. Not only is this a MUST READ for teachers, but will help anyone in their daily lives. GREAT BOOK and fun to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I was given this book from a friend in New York who said all the teachers in New York thought it was so wonderful. All I can say is that they must not have manners in New York. This man is making money by writing a book of manners. A teacher with common sense already teaches manners. I teach in the inner city and children can't remember 5 rules let alone 55. I teach manners every day, every hour. Ron Clark is a joke. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Advice, Some Interesting Advice, Some Weird Advice","review":"The Essential 55 is an interesting book that I think both parents and teachers can get a lot out of. Ron Clark, who is apparently a highly successful teacher, has set out 55 rules of his classroom he believes are the key to his and his student's success. Some of the advice is useful, if obvious (look your teacher in the eye, address teachers with \\"sir\\" and \\"maam\\". Some of the advice is weird--like always tipping in hotels and the length of time a group of students should applaud when congratulating a fellow student. The essence of this slim book could easily be distilled into a useful Parent's Magazine article--I'm not sure it warrants an entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for educators","review":"This book, like others, is only good if you actually put into practice what he has written. With all the other NCLB materials we have, sometimes adding one more thing is tough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ron Clark is amazing!","review":"I had the wrong idea when I started this book: It had been heralded as one of those \\"life lessons\\" books that people of all ages can learn from. And in that context, the book's rigid rule set is far too simpleton for the complex world in which we live.However, once I started reading the book in its proper context, that is, as a guide on how to educate children, I found it much more enjoyable. And my admiration for Ron Clark increased with each passing page. This guy is incredible! If only my grade school teachers had been as energetic and as innovative as he is.And, frankly, his results speak for themselves: His students love him, their test scores are high, and they do their homework -- and all of this in some of the most challenging school conditions in the country.A must read if you have young children, and an interesting read if you don't have children but are interested in how one man overcame the trials and tribulations of early childhood education."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a teacher?","review":"Simply put, the stupidest, most irrelevent book on the classroom ever printed. P.S. I've been teaching 22 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essential 55 book review","review":"I am a pre-service teacher about to recieve a degree in elementary education. I am always looking for books to supplement my college training. The Essential 55 by Ron Clark is one of the first books I have found that not only offers a sound theory about how to create a positive classroom environment and how to manage that environment, but also offered specific anecdotes on HOW Mr. Clark created this environment and HOW he manages his classroom. He uses real life anecdotes from his various teaching experiences. His ideas or \\"rules\\" are for the most part, PRACTICAL and easy incorperated and implemented into any classroom. His back to basics ideas are much more realistic than an elaborate discipline system. The book is also FUNNY and full of enthusiasm. I can't wait to teach and add some of his ideas into my own classroom repetoire! It's an easy read and i HIGHLY recommed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Schooling","review":"I am a mother of 4 beautiful children who I teach in my home, along with 3 other children in our neighborhood. I was recommended this book, and I have read it with all of my \\"students.\\" I liked the book a great deal, but the children really enjoyed it more than I ever could have imagined. They have taken it upon themselves to carry out Mr. Clark's rules at the dinner table, in the way they talk to me, in the way they treat me as their mother and teacher and in their determination to complete their assignments. There is only one problem: The kids are bugging me to take them on trips like Mr. Clark did with his students! I guess I will have to combine rules #54 and #11 and make it happen! Thank you to Mr. Clark for writing a book that isn't only for teachers in the regular classroom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really inane","review":"This in NOT a book for educators. I guess it is a book for people who were raised in a cave without parents. It is insulting that this should be recommended to new teachers. How could anyone think that anyone who has been alive since childhood would not know basic manners, and many of his rules for behavior are really bizaare, for instance, no fork in your hand if you are holding a glass. His suggestions for dealing with school life are often idiotic. Imagine not speaking to other teachers when your children are in line. All I can think is that he wrote this book hoping that some ignorant administrators would recommend this book to teachers, thereby boosting his sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential 55- What a GREAT Book","review":"I am currently in college to be a future teacher and I believe that this book has helped guide me with ideas to use with my future students, more than any other teacher book could have done. I think this book is great for anyone, from learning about what manners you might want to have, to being a parent, aunt, uncle etc., maybe even a babysitter or just for being a teacher. Learning how to get children to respect you and like you, without being to lenient was one of the most important parts I believe. I say that if you want to read about some who has done wonders for students who have had trouble in the past then this is the book. He tells some of the greatest and most inspiring stories and even tells you how you should communicate with parents. I only wish I could be as great a teacher as Ron Clark is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Essential 55....","review":"The first \\"essential\\" gave me the clue that I would not like this book. Saying \\"yes sir/mam\\" does not show respect. It is how you treat a person that shows respect. To lead children to believe that a \\"yes sir\\" will get a person somewhere is wrong. I have been teaching for 28 years and in our school we are on a first name basis with our students. The interaction between teacher/student is what teaches respect. Some of the 55 essentials are worth while but most are something parents need to be teaching. Teachers have always needed to teach the parent along with the student. The 55 essentials leaves the parent(s) out of the equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ for all educators!","review":"Every person who works in education NEEDS to read this book. This book changed my life. Ron Clark shows teachers how to teach respect by giving respect. He teaches social skills and manners without being \\"preachy.\\" As a teacher who works in the inner-city, this book is the best resource I could have ever dreamed of. I rave about this book to everyone I work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential 55","review":"This book covers common sense topics, things we wish all parents taught at home. It's an easy read. Topics are discussed with humor. Good advise for creating a solid classroom community..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"This book was really hyped up and I was greatly let down. The tone of Clark's voice rings false and superficial. The book was short with little substance. On the plus side it was an easy read and occasionally entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book for teachers and parents","review":"I refer to this book in the classroom and recommend it to parents. It is a wonderful guide for life skills. I also suggest that parents and teachers get a copy of Optimal Thinking: How to be Your Best Self. Children, teachers and parents can all use Optimal Thinking to bring their best selves to every situation -- even the most difficult ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Critical Eye Gives It A Critical Look","review":"I just finished this book. Wow!!! What a marvelous understanding of what it takes to make students reach the potential that is possible within them. I stack this book up with with Bestseller Emotionally Charged Learning by Eric Schiffer as a masterpiece in learning. I respect the insights that Clark gives educators on how to parse what really work from the \\"theory's\\" out there and give students what they really need. I recommend this book to both parents and educators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Seller?","review":"I bought and read Ron Clark's book because I am an educator. I was interested because he won a great teacher award. I thought the parts that mentioned the White House visit and the Disney visit were wonderful, however, the rules Mr. Clark used, I found ridiculous. We must realize that Mr. Clark is still a fairly new teacher in the educational system. He has a lot to learn regarding the discipline of children. I was not impressed with the 55 Rules. I am surprised it was on the best seller list. As a teacher for the past eleven years, I have to say, Go with what works for you... Mr. Clark did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple. Practical.

I highly recommend this book to new and veteran teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ron Clark is a master we can learn from","review":"What a fabulous book! I read it over the weekend and gave it to my daughter. Ron Clark's rules for guiding kids in the classroom and daily life is a godsend for parents, teachers and students. I also recommend a book written by Dr. Rosalene Glickman, a teacher too, called Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self. Optimal Thinking shows all of us how simple it is to bring our best self to every situation and make the most of it. Both of these books are top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked as a follow up to his story done on film","review":"I have not yet read in detail.

Ron Clark has put his teaching experience down in such a manner that allow fellow teachers to relate. The rules he uses in his classroom are those that could be adapted to any classroom to help manage and enhance the educational experience of all children. I laughed at his experiences, because we, as teachers, have all had similar ones. I recommend this book to everyone! My students are enjoying the daily calendar and beg for me to read more out of his book each day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ron should run the school systems","review":"Ron should run the school systems. This book should be required reading for every ed major. It covers the common sense knowledge all kids need - how to answer a question, how to answer the phone, etc. Why aren't the parents teaching this stuff? If not, I'm glad Ron is around. I'd love to see him in a school board budget meeting asking the members is they are accountable for those hard-earned taxes we send them.

This book really speaks to your heart, I pass it on to other newbies as well as other accomplished teachers. It is truly an inspiration to any and every teacher that strives to make a difference in the lives of their pupils. If you ever have the chance to hear Ron Clark speak at a seminar don't pass it up. He is truly an inspiration to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Crap.","review":"I think this book should be burned. I read it as a part of an assignment for my first Theatre Education grad class, and nearly every rule he had in the book were useless for the Theatre Education classroom.

All of the information in this book is taught in any entry level college education class. Since Mr. Clark was not an education major in college, the things he learned on the fly while teaching astounded him. To an education major, they are givens. By the way, Mr. Clarke quit teaching within 2 years of receiving the Disney Teacher of the Year award to go on the book promo circuit and make more money than a dedicated teacher does.

I kept hoping, after 15, 20, 25, 45, etc. pages, that the authors would get to something of substance in regard to Hendrix's psyche, life, ambitions, shirt size, something, but it never happened.

Shannon Stewart, Brooke Berry, Nicole Van Croft, Buffy Tyler, the Bernaola twins, and Summer Altice are all gorgeous women more deserving of the crown than Brande. But we're stuck with Brande and if you're a fan of hers, you may enjoy this video. Nothing erotic here, of course, just numerous vignettes of Brande showing off her big breasts, her blonde love, and her admittedly gorgeous behind. The video does feature a nice short on Buffy Tyler. This makes it worth a viewing if not a purchase. Trust me, you'll want to plunge right into Buffy's hot pink love.

However, if you are a rock listener that likes a little salt in the mix listen well to the samples and make sure of what you are getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring","review":"The loss of both original guitarist shines through everywhere on this album. If you enjoyed anything previously done by Cold, you will probably not like this album. The melodies are generic, and the beats are dull. The only saving grace is Scooter's lyrics, but that unfortunately cannot pull this album out of the gutter.I would write more, but I don't want put more time into my review than the band spent making this album. Save your 15 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different kind of Cold...","review":"...and not a particularly great one, either. I loved Cold's first two albums (especially \\"13 Ways to Bleed Onstage\\"), \\"Year of the Spider\\" was a bit dodgy but still not bad, this album is just greatly disappointing. They used to have a cool, distinctive way of playing the whole numetal/post-grunge/post-polka/whatever the hell label you want to put on this genre, but this album is just as bland and banal as Seether, Shinedown, or any of those bands. Scooter even sounds like he's trying to sound like the singers in those bands. Sorry, but this ain't for me.But, uh, the cover art is pretty cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"sheer dissa-cold-ment","review":"Of course I bought the new album, as I love Cold and feel I would support them even if they suddenly did a rap album, but I was really dissapointed with this poor attempt at being different than other hard rock acts. Cold does not show ANY signs of being different on this album.So whenever I have the urge to put this album on, I put on their debut album instead. I think you all should too. If we all do it, hopefully Scooter will realise they had something at the first attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"people dont appreciate rock","review":"i am a HUGE rocker....and i KNOW i am right when i say, this album is cold's best yet and is one of the best releases of 2005.all the tracks on this albums are great, just buy the album you wont regret it...i guarantee a divine rock experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK!","review":"I always thought cold was a pretty rad band, and I expected this to be another hard-driving heavy album. But I was disappointed and disgusted when i found out that these punkasses deciding to lower the bar and drop to the emo level. I strongly recommend that you do NOT PURCHASE THIS ALBUM! If you are desperate for it... download it. End of story. If you dig the heavier cold, check out Chapter V by Staind, or The Stings Of Conscience by Unearth."},{"rating":"1","title":"cold goes emo","review":"I dont know what cold was trying to prove with the release of ADKOP, but it sucks. I hated YOTS, too catchy and melodic, but i thought that it was maybe just a phase. this record moves even further from the cold sound. Heavy rock is dying, and as a true blue hardrocker, it pains me to say that. It seems like everyone is jumping on the girlpants wearin popemoscreamopunk bandwagon, and cold is just another jumper. if you support hard, heavy rock, dont buy this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Comeback","review":"This is a very good album. Cold were having some issues a while back, the singer in rehab and the guitarist leaving the band for Evanescence. In my experience very few bands make albums as good as the last one. Although not quite as good as \\"Year of the Spider\\", it is still a very good album especially considering the things they've been through. My personal favorite track - \\"Ocean\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd From The Group Cold","review":"this is my 1st experience with the group cold i went and listened to the sound samples on amazon and really liked the songs and i went and bought the cd and the song samples don't do the cd justice ! every song on here was great but the best song on the album i think is the title track A Different Kind Of Pain , altho all the songs was great this is my favorite , i have never heard of cold before this won't be my last cd i buy of this group !! way to guys !! excellent cd !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"guitars are boring and simple ,the vocals were ok but most of the songs were bad.There is only about 4 good songs on this cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album was a big let-down","review":"Year of the Spider rocked, the whole album was awesome. This new album just doesn't cut it on any front. The lyrics are bad, there is no melody, there is no rhythm, and no power. It was extremely disappointing. After this album, I wonder if I want to hear any more of their stuff. This album was like another band or something... I wish it were better. They can be great if they want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE CRAP!","review":"This is the most sorry Cold album to date. If you want to hear them in their prime buy the self-titled album, or \\"13 ways\\" even the cheesy \\"Year Of The Spider\\" (the start of the decline) OWNS this! Scooter's (lead singer's) newest project \\"The Witch\\" is even worse. Rock is supposed to have guitars, and I don't even hear a bass in this entire album, the drumming is very faint at best, the vocals get annoying and whiney. PLEASE COLD GO BACK TO YOUR OLD SOUND!!!! Save your money buy something REAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cold","review":"This is the worst Cold album ever.My favorite album is the first album13 ways to bleed on stage.The secondalbum wasn't that great but now they putout this crap which has no musical talenton it at all.It's slow,weak and depressing.There is not one heavy hard rockin'songon here.I wouldn't waste my time buyingthis album.Trust me this one sucks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent effort, but a step back","review":"Given everything the band has gone through, I'm surprised they turned out such a solid release. That said, it is a step back. The lyrics (which shouldn't be affected by the changes in guitarists) are pretty cheesy on a lot of the songs. That has been a bit of a weak point with Cold, but is especially notable here. I like the new positive theme, but it could be carried out better. For instance, when Staind went more positive with \\"14 Shades of Gray\\", I felt it was done better and didn't feel as cheesy. I give 4 stars because it's still better than a lot of the stuff out there, but could use a lot of improvement (especially lyrically)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This seasoning taste great.....It reminds me of another similar seasoning on the market only alot more flavorful and the extra benefit is it's an organic product. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy! Great for veggie & pasta salads.","review":"This has become a stand-by in my kitchen over the last year or so. I can make so many super fresh tasting veggie & pasta salads by simply adding the Organic Sprinkle, sea salt, cracked pepper, and lemon juice. I can't imagine being without it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need bigger bottle.","review":"Bought this last year in a gift box for my father. He has raved about it for 12 months.

Things I have used it on in the last week: baked tofu, roasted potatoes, scrambled eggs, baked eggplant, spaghetti sauce, and the list goes on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dried spices I've ever had for salad","review":"I bought this product at our local food Co-op. Most times you take your chances buying a spice product, but I have used Bragg's products before, and knew they always have high standards, so I bought it. This stuff is freaking AWEsome. Honestly, I have a tough time eating a salad without it, I'm sure it can be used in more then just salads, but I eat a high raw food lifestyle, so salads are a big part of my that.Buy it, you will not regret it. Bragg also has a great organic olive oil. It's more expensive, but you can tell it's less refined and good quality. They are also the makers of the well known Apple Cider Vinegar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bragg Organic Sprinkle Seasoning","review":"So glad to find this product. I am always on the lookout for products to add flavor to my cooking since I have to watch my sodium intake so closely. I would highly recommend this spice combination to anyone and especially to those of us who must watch our sodium intake. I have now purchased this product again and will keep it in my pantry. You just would not believe how it can make soups and other dishes so flavorful but I think if you try it you will be very pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for intermediate origami enthusiasts","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone at an intermediate level, and maybe even talented beginners. The diagrams are given as photos, and they are all quite clear and easy to follow, excepting perhaps Beech's predilection for using patterned papers, which can become a little confusing. But he's one of the better authors out there. Incidentally, don't bother buying more than one of his books: they mostly contain the same projects in different orders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaking Eagle battles Lo lei","review":"Shaking eagle plays the role of a young revolutionary being hunted by the ching lord. Along with running away from the government he is also on the run from a crazy grandfather trying to wed off his grand daughter. A mix of comedy and great kung fu. A must see, in my mind a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could only take three discs to a desert island...","review":"...this would be one of them. Joseph Arthur is a singer/songwriter of the highest rank.To compare him to Bob Dylan (as I've read in several reviews) does credit to Arthur's lyrical power, but completely ignores his extraordinary ability to fuse subtle electronica with the power of voice and guitar.Arthur is incontrovertably a creature of the city. His lyrics dig at the inscrutable graveyard of emotions that accompany urban life and relationships.The entirety of \\"Big City Secrets\\" is extremely memorable, meticulously polished with finesse, but retains an uncommon and fiery passion. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual Survival","review":"So this is definitely an entertaining show although it is clearly heavily scripted in many sections. Each episode the \\"hunter\\" is able to miraculously kill elusive animals with makeshift hunting tools. How much luck could one guy have? I know people who haven't been able to hunt a turkey successfully with a gun let alone a homemade bow and arrow. Too funny. Another time they caught a huge eel with a sock, yes a sock, and another time took a fat wild pig with a little noose. I was laughing quite hard! But taking the show for what it is I still find it very enjoyable. And there are some decent survival skills to be gleaned here if you pay close attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pracitical survival show","review":"The contrast between the two guys gives different perspectives on priorities and skills. Sometimes it can get bloody when an animal is killed for food, but that's the reality of serious survival situations. No high tech gizmos here, the emphasis is on skills. I also highly recommend Cody's books on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"a great series about situations with two cool dudes. its to bad that dave cantebury isnt in the third season with cody1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Survival Show Ever","review":"THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME SURVIVAL SHOW EVER. CODY AND DAVE ARE A GREAT TEAM, BUT UNIQUE IN THEIR PERSONALITIES, SKILL SETS, AND THEIR PHILOSOPHIES REGARDING THE SACREDNESS OF NATURE AND ALL LIVING THINGS. THEY DO SMART AND FUNNY WITHOUT BEING \\"ENTERTAINERS\\", BECAUSE EVERYTHING THEY DO IS REAL AND GENUINE; ESPECIALLY THEIR NEGOTIATIONS IN TREACHEROUS SITUATIONS AND THEIR GOOD HUMORED REPARTEES WHEN THINGS GO WRONG, (BEES), OR ARE PARTICULARLY SCARY, (ICE). EACH SHOW IS A FIRST CLASS SEMINAR ON SURVIVAL TECHNIQUES, TRUST AND RESPECT. WE HAVE ENJOYED THE SHOW AND LEARNED SO MUCH FROM IT ALREADY. IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH. THE RIGHT TOUCH OF DANGER, ADVENTURE,AND FRIENDSHIP ALL ENTERTAINING AND INFORMATIVE; COMPLETELY HIP AND FRESH. HOPES IT'S ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS.

Anyway I found it on Amamzon adn I jumped at the opportunity to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, cute, cute.","review":"If you go in for those cute, romantic, everything-turns-out-well in the end sort of movies, this is perfect. If you don't like Hugh Grant, though, I wouldn't recommend it. Although Colin Firth is in it too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries too hard","review":"Surely there couldn't be a shallower PM than Hugh Grant's character. He doesn't have the social skills or the brain cells for the job. His crush isn't what most of us would consider love, actually. At the end of his segment she runs up to him in public and jumps on him with both legs wrapped around his waist. Look at Grant's face; he doesn't quite believe it himself.None of the relationships had time to ripen. The story tried to tie up all the segments into a nice Christmas pageant bow at the end, but it didn't quite work. And there are seriously depressing fates for 2 or 3 of these couples. Love, actually not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Previews: Be Warned","review":"Ten minutes or more of previews, and the viewer is \\"prohibited\\" from fast-forwarding, even though the option to do so is stated on the disk. Who makes these decisions? I would not have bought the disk had I known."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very heartwarming flick...","review":"Now, how many of us have actually experienced love in real life the way actors and actresses portray it in films? Love actually brings together a very potent mix of comedy and romanticism into its whole state of affairs. You get several situations in this film all of which are connected to love and that of course is the main ingredient. Set in the very English environment you get the best of everything. The characters are excellent on their own, from the prime minister of Britain to the lonely office girl downtown, to the fading rock star, love is simply all around. What makes this movie special is the down to earth element that simply decides to sell well. Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Kiera Knightly, Martine McCutcheon, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney, Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson all come together to deliver one excellent holiday movie, in a very long time, not to forget the excellent soundtrack to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect romantic/holiday mush-fest","review":"A shamelessly mushy and romantic holiday comedy clearly defines Love Actually, but that's exactly what it wants to be. As such, it completely succeeds. A charming balance of couples and storylines combined with holiday finery and lovely performances make this a real winner. You would really have to be a total grinch to not be moved by this movie. From the opening wedding to the sweet conclusion, this is one great Valentine to love and romance. The cast is great: Thompson, Firth, Grant, Linney, Nisssam are all wonderful. It will make you fall in love all over again, pine for the love that you lost, or completely depress you. A bulls eye!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a realistic film , but designed to give that impression","review":"This is a film that seems to be a comedy , but not everything always works out in life . A lot of different stories are presented to the viewer , but none outstay their welcome .The great comic writer Richard Curtis is behind this film and it's about time they let him go behind the camera , as the amount of money his scripts have made for other actors would be quite scary .This is a romantic comedy with a little bit more depth to it .You are likely to know already if you like this film as you will go by the actors in it .It's a nice little diversion with some well placed music ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl flick","review":"Good girly flick, wife really likes this one so I decided to watch it with her and wasn't dissappointed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uplifting experience","review":"I can't say enough about this movie, the cast is just fabulous. And the plot is a great twist on the classic love story. I buy it for everyone I know. Just a joy to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love...British Style","review":"Several stories about love are woven together to create a very enjoyable film. Dry, witty British humor is showcased by an amazing cast: Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant, Alan Rickman and many others. Although very funny, American audiences may gasp at this film because of the cultural differences in England. There is quite a bit of nudity, adult situations and language that may be considered offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK - for a sunday night","review":"An alright movie for a Sunday night, particuarly if you are curled up on the sofa with the 'other half' and some junk food, but not really a defining moment in cinema.One point of note for me, however, was the scene with Emma Thompson set to Joni Mitchell's incredibly poignant later version of Both Sides now. Suprisingly moving, to the point that it brought a tear to my eye! Her depiction of the mother that puts aside her feelings to ensure that her family are not affected by the heartache and betrayl she has discovered made me think of the countless times that my mother must have put on a brave face even though deep inside she may have been falling apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of a romantic comedy","review":"This film seemed to have been written by two different writers. The stories of Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson and Keira Knightley were very touching and poignant. The stud wannabe going to Wisconsin to meet girls was funny but exaggerated, Hugh Grant's story was totally unrealistic, Colin Firth didn't look remotely in love and Sarah's story seemed to have been written to evince sadness. As for the nude stand-ins..I imagine a 16 year old writer or director wanting that in a film..no other reason for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful holiday movie","review":"My husband and I watch this movie every year around Christmas time. It's hilarious and warms the heart of the season."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is love, you are better off alone","review":"This is a very decadent movie. In the movie, all the established relationhips are bad, and only the ones that have not yet developed are good. Love is enduring, fullfiling, and faithful, not betrayal. This is obviously a movie for people who are unhappy in their relationship and are looking around for something else. For me the worst is the the pretension that it is about love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This movie insulted the intelligence of everyone in attendance. The theme of it was the less you know someone, the more likely you are to fall madly in love with them. Hugh Grant's character, the prime minister of England, fell in love with a woman upon simply seeing her. That is Hollywood crap. The child that plays Liam Neeson's son is the most articulate character in the movie, and speaks clearly about his love for another 10 year old, which, if you've ever been in the presence of a 10 year old, is a bit less than realistic. I thought this movie was a spoof on romantic comedies, as I couldn't believe that even Hollywood would come up with such a far fetched tale. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"nauseating","review":"This movie is so tacky. It was easy to predict what would happen next and as it did, I cringed in my seat. Running to the airport to say \\"I Love You\\", how cliche and cheezy. I begged that it wouldn't happen but all of the extremely ridiculuous and unimaginative love scenarios broke through. Credit to Emma Thompson for her excellent role, but other than that, I was so glad when it was finally over, and then I apologized to my friend for dragging her to see such a waste of film. How ridiculuous was Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister! All he has in common with Tony Blair is that he's British."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leeease","review":"Insipid, unromantic, implausable are the mildest terms to describe this utterly uninspired piece of dreck. Leaving matters of the heart, emotional honesty and intimacy to the British is tantamount to relying on the Germans to pump out comedies. The movie is painful to watch. They have dragged every name UK actor out of a deep coma to sleepwalk through their roles. If this is the best Britain has to offer then please, don't bother. The inane political subplot is so insulting and simplistic it is a wonder that adults wrote this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No even deserve 1 star...","review":"I saw this one when it was first released. This one is soooooooo boring that I have to fast forward it to the end. I cannot believe you guys like it. What?????? Love actually (not). But there are some silly scenes which provide some amusement and nothing special at all. Not worth to buy or see.0 star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"loathed it","review":"I couldn't stand this movie. It's got a brilliant British cast but it has the feel of a soap opera, with so many storylines and smut. I don't like to see too much objectional content in a movie so if you're like me then you might want to skip this movie. Its not the great Christmas movie that it promotes itself to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not about real love","review":"This movie is perverted! I had such high expectations, since the cast consisted of some of my favorite actors and actresses. The movie was about cheating on spouses, pre-marital relations, and other totally inappropriate behavior. Anyone who thought that was love has got some serious problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast - poor in the area of nudity and language","review":"The language was horrible and the nudity was unacceptable. These two components totally distracted from the dialogue and connections that could've been made with the characters. I'm ordering an \\"edited version\\" from another company so I can actually enjoy the acting and solid story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fave christmas movie!","review":"I watch this movie every year - it puts me right in the spirit of Christmas....pain, grief, awkwardness, yearning for what you can't have and yes, love, actually.

Spend a little cash and give yourself this present, to be enjoyed for years to come :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie","review":"This movie is really fantastic. Very funny, well acted and incredibly sweet, the movie makes for an amazing Christmas movie that you can watch all year 'round.

It is definately the feel-good movie of the year. A wonderful cast, and a wonderful writer/director. The only thing I don't understand is several of the reviews comments that it had an anti-American sentiment...say huh? Did we watch the same movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love is not in my air, actually.","review":"I thought this was going to be a lot better. I'm glad that I just rented it because that's all it is good for is a watch. The only part that meant anything to me was the ending. The rest of the movie was quite bland. I do have to say there was nice casting here, but it's such a shame that they were wasted on this movie. As for the DVD extras, there was a lot of boring stuff. I went to the menu, then quickly got out of it. If you decide to watch this, rent it because I think 20.00 is steep for a movie like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining...","review":"Anyone who says Love Actually is too saccharine is simply missing the point. As it makes perfectly clear in the beginning, the premise of this movie is that \\"love actually is all around.\\" Nowadays, cynicism is too often confused with wisdom, and \\"independent\\" movies that go for the cheap \\"unhappy\\" ending are really just cheating the audience. In the movie, as in life, the characters care about being happy and are ready to put in the work to achieve happiness.There are a lot of stories going on here, so we never delve that deeply into any one of the characters. It may be simply an over-ambitious plot exercise, but I think it succeeds more than it fails. I sat through the movie with a dopey grin on my face and I was never bored. The only story-line that didn't pan out for me was the one concerning Laura Linney - but I won't spoil it.This is a sweet, funny, life-affirming film and very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to hard","review":"The movie has all the things that you would want to see at X'mas, however I felt that the plot was all over the place and that they tried to hard.. Wouldnt recommend it unless it was a rainy day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few comments about the DVD version","review":"I liked the movie enough to buy it, so there's no need for me to comment on the film itself. The DVD is what annoys me. I hate that there are previews on the disc, and I really hate that I can't go straight to the menu, I have to fast forward through these previews. That is my biggest complaint.The other thing that I really don't like is the menu graphic -- just a heart. What a terribly boring choice. A good movie, but an awful DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for diabetics...","review":"This is one of the most cloying, sickeningly precious films I think I've ever seen. If you can get through the first ten minutes without cringeing, you might actually like \\"Love, Actually.\\" If not, you're in for a sticky ride, full of so many wince-inducing \\"awwwww\\" moments that I thought I was watching the film adaptation of a line of a Hallmark cards. And for a film purporting to be about love, there isn't one single honest human emotion on display. And there hasn't been an all-star cast playing such witless wanks since Burt Reynolds and \\"The Cannonball Run.\\" Bill Nighy alone is hysterically funny, hence the two stars. \\"Love, Actually\\" is \\"Dreadful, Actually\\" in every possible way."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but...","review":"good movie, would have gotten 5 stars if they cut the porno scenes out in order to go for a rating of PG13. those scenes were very awkward and out of place... the rest of the movie and the stories and interconnections were great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yey for British movies!","review":"This is a very cute movie with great actors. I highly recommend it if you are up for a laid back, romantic comedy.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect romantic movie!!","review":"This movie has been my long-standing favorite for quite some time now. I have a penchant for British actors and movies, and Love Actually is my pinnacle.It's amazing how so many different story lines can fit together so beautifully. From the lonely book writer, the heartbroken wife, and the hormonally unstable young man, each person's struggle grabs at your heartstrings.The movie's intro alone, is enough to earn 5 stars. It still gives me goosebumps everytime I watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can \\"new\\" be damaged inside the package?","review":"I ordered this \\"new\\" DVD for the holidays, along with four others.

The cast were top rate (Hugh Grant, Colin Firth AND Alan Rickman in one film!) and the director has previously written the hits Four Weddings, Notting Hill & Bridget Jones! I have to admit though, that to get all the jokes being a Brit (which I am) helps. The one scene that made me laugh (but no one else in the movie theatre) was the bit when the aged rock star is interviewed by Ant & Deck, two v. famous kids TV presenters. In the background is a HUGE pic of the pop group Blue, which he defaces with some offensive comments about their manhood!

The biggest problem with this plethora of plots is that most of them are resolved quite poorly, or left unclear. Barely a couple of the stories kept me engaged all the way through, specially since so many of them had such a weird ending.As much expectation as we had for this chick flick, it turned out to be quite dissapointing. Save yourself the time and rent some other Hugh Grant movie. As for this one, definitely not his best or a good movie worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not witty;It's tedious","review":"I love foreign films.I get the British humor where most people dont.I like intellectual movies.But this one just stinks.Even the most talented U.K actors cant save this.Gawwwd!It is bloody awful.Gag.Only recommended for insomniacs.*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Actually","review":"After watching the previews and listening to reviews from both professionals and trusted friends I was very excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, the result did not live up to my expectations. The main problem was that there were too many plot lines. They weren't too difficult to follow, however, and that was the problem. If separated into their respective stories each plot line couldn't have taken more than 10 or 15 minutes, and you can write a decent story in that amount of time, but not a good story, and certainly not a great one.Because of the title I was expecting the movie to leave me with the warm fuzzies, but most of them left me feeling dissatisfied. I'm a big Colin Firth fan and I was grateful that at least his story was good. That saved it from my rating the movie one star. All in all, I wish I had never seen the movie. I would have been much happier with my illusion of a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreck","review":"Despite a few interesting moments, this movie is terrible.

I went to see it with one of my best friends and we weren't expecting an Oscar-worthy film...we just wanted to have fun. If you just want to have fun and not get into a really deep drama, if you want to laugh and not take yourself (or the movie) too seriously, then you should watch it. I didn't leave the theatre feeling depressed or angry, (well, maybe a little angry about having the absolutely gorgeous love interest of Hugh Grant being considered \\"fat\\"). I left the theatre feeling happy that some things worked out and I got a chance to laugh. Take it for what it is: A Hollywood money-maker. You'll like the movie much better if you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, Actually","review":"Although it is at times witty and delightfully British, it is really not a very good movie. So there is this great cast, these wonderful actors (Emma Thompson, Hugh Grqant, Laura Linney, Alan Rickman for christ's sake) employed in the most desolate, incomplete, asinine roles of their careers. There is little to no character development and few storylines reach any sort of comprehensible conclusion. Bad, so horribly bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Movie","review":"This movie was thoroughly enjoyable. I thought it was not only funny but heartwarming. The opening and closing scenes at the airport of all the people hugging - reminded me of how much we love each other and how underplayed it is. This is a movie I would watch again - it made me smile and feel good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrifyingly corny","review":"I actually found this movie frightening.I am proud to say that I was forced to see this movie on a bad date, and that otherwise I would never have even pondered subjecting myself to it. For the first time in my life I felt lucky to be a smoker, as it allowed me to gasp for breath and leave the theater a few times.Why there were talented actors in this syrupy, ludicrous and stomach turning piece of bile is beyond my comprehension. I can only rationalize it this way: Hugh Grant needed money for another prostitute, Billy Bob Thornton was on something, and Liam Neeson thought it was a parody of a romance film.Did The Blair Witch Project scare you? Wait till you see this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"all you need is love","review":"there's a good version of A Y N I L but otherwise I found the movie to be pretty boring and slow. Just fast forwarded through it. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in quality of DVD","review":"What I saw of the movie, I liked - however, the DVD had a flaw in it, so wasn't able to watch the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Brit RomCom","review":"This movie does exactly what it says on the tin. It's sugary, uncomplicated fluf, but never pretends to be anything else. As for the reviewer complaining about what he calls 'U.S' bashing - first of all this is a British movie reflecting a non U.S opinion, which makes a change from the patronising pro-US/Land of the free/God bless America tripe that Hollywood seems determined to force down everyone's throats at every turn.At the end of the day, this is an average Christmas feel good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie has a terrific cast and an interesting story-line. The movie's subtext, however, is troubling. The characters in this film are, with one or two exceptions, dysfunctional, foul-mouthed, and sex-obsessed. Hollywood (or England's equivalent) may think this is reality, but to most Americans, and I suspect most Brits, it is not. This is a flawed and disappointing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash, actually","review":"I loved Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. Nonsense, but well acted and directed. And fun. The Black Adder series can be watched over and over again for pleasure without ever going stale. All written by Richard Curtis. I didn't expect intellectually stimulating social comment - just to be entertained. But this was awful. I wanted to turn it off after 10 minutes and only watched because I couldn't believe how bad it was. I'm amazed at the positive reviews here. Have we become this stupid? What hope have we of getting decent films made when the public go overboard for this trash. It should have been good. It was a good idea. But EVERYTHING about it was bad. We should be asking for our money back, demanding a remake that took more than twenty minutes to visualise. I can suspend disbelief and enjoy a good bit of tosh with the rest of you, but I'm afraid this was BAD. SO disappointing that SO many people fell for it. Are we this desperate for distraction?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An evening well spent","review":"This movie was a collection of short stories, all loosely connected and leaving you wondering \\"what happens next?\\". I saw it twice and loved it both times. It doesn't pretend to be terribly deep, but with a stellar cast you feel like the characters are genuine. Billy Bob Thornton makes a great weasel (it's only a bit part, but boy, is he slimy!). I want to thank whoever cast it for putting all my favorite actors in one show. The storyline involving the porn stand-ins is a little startling at first, but the irony of the situation makes it worthwhile. I thought all of the stories very plausible except the one involving the young man coming to America."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing movie","review":"I've already seen this movie twice, even before it's actually been released. It is such an amazing feel good movie, with a terrific cast and a touching story line.Everyone I know who has seen it, has loved it. It's good for so many ages, and because there are so many different situations in the movie, almost everyone can relate to one of them.You'll come out of the movie knowing love is one of the most amazing emotions one can experience.So, again, an amazing movie.

I would definitely recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Actually: Love it love it love it.","review":"I saw this in the theaters in 2003 and enjoyed it immensely. I bought it on DVD in 2004 when it first came out. I took it with me to a female friend's house to watch. She asked if she could borrow to watch it again. I never got it back. I bought another copy. I took it to a friend's house....same story. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. I now have bought seven copies. That is a glowing recommendation. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"What a great movie! My adult daughter and I went to see it and almost didn't because she considered it a \\"chick flick\\", but humored her mother. Both of us were delighted with this movie.

Shows you that love is alive and well in all it's many fabulous forms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great casting!","review":"I saw this film before Christmas and loved it! What great casting, all the great contemporary British actors are it this one. Hugh Grant plays a charming somewhat Tony Blairish Prime Minister with a great message. The film is endearing, sweet, loveable and very humorous. This is definitely a purchase for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & Heatwarming","review":"This is one of those movies that you can watch over & over & feel just as good each time.

And the result is none of them are developed very well. Too bad. Because some of them were worth embelishment and some could have been dropped altogether. Can't recommend this as a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly trite and boring","review":"\\"Love Actually\\" is such a low-IQ movie that it actually insults the audience. It has everything that's wrong with today's movies -- a pretty-boy prime minister (no, Blair is not pretty, Huge Grant is), a modern-day cinderella, a stereotypical [...] man, a single father, an interracial couple -- and it tries too hard to be \\"cute.\\" None of the stories is engaging and none of the characters really captures your heart -- unless you like to be insulted by the insolence of the filmmakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Actually","review":"I don't usually like Hugh Grant, but he does a great job in this movie - very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm...","review":"It seems there is some sort of contest here between Martine McCutcheon and Keira Knightley.Well, although I am an extremely straight woman who adores men, let me cast my vote for Martine McCutcheon.Just \\"google\\" her name and you will see from top-to-bottom/back-to-front why this sexy, beautiful, vivacious woman beats out Ms. Knightley.Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Give It The Hairbrains Award","review":"This movie seemed to be more of a patchwork of poorly scripted, barely coherent flat characters. At times it seemed like a multi-cultural ad campaign put together by a dimwitted government agency that really doesn't understand any culture at all. Its sickening sentiments which substitute, mostly, for real love are a nightmare of shallow goop.It is, without a doubt, one of the worse films, with some of the best stars, that I've ever seen. One bright light was Emma Thompson. But then, she barely has to walk into a scene and she's already raised the bar for everyone involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of Crap, actually..","review":"I expected this to be an interesting romantic comedy, but it turned out to be more like a fast-paced television sitcom with a mish-mash of insignificant plots, none of which had any good characterisations. Good actors were wasted in their roles. this movie is so hackneyed, dull, stupid. the director has made movies like this 15 times already.. dont waste time and money on this one. not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity over Quality...","review":"The fact is, Love Actually gives viewers quite a few love stories, and it doesn't give the viewer time to connect. What is romantic? Romantic is seeing a couple fall in love, not 3035903509295208 couples talk about love. By the time the viewer may feel any connection to a character, a new story starts and the viewer is lost. I didn't pull one name out of this film and didn't get to connect with one character. Also, the pacing in this film is horrible. Right when a story might seem interesting, a new one starts and a new character is introduced.Love Actually tries to do too many things in a short time. The directing isn't that good and it's only saving grace is Hugh Grant. Also, a lot of the leads have no chemistry whatsoever. They just picked some top-notch stars and expected love. Sorry, but it just doesn't work that way..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and some spots humorus, but....","review":"This movie starts out kind of pleasant, but soon becomes a drama with sad endings for some, and I would never call this a comedy. Every relationship has problems, and you walk away from viewing this with a great dissapointed feeling about Emman Thompson's relationship. The Ultimate romantic comedy as stated, should say, \\"the Ultimate sad stories of relationships\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"British Christmas Tripe","review":"So..............the British now make films as badly as the Americans. I have not been this disappointed with a major studio release in years. The director took far too many characters, watered down their storylines so they had about 10 minutes screen time each, accompanied them with music of the heartstrings, and attempted to wrap it up nicely with a Christmas wreath.What an embarrassing waste of talent. The only bright spot in this film is the marvelous talent of Emma Thompson. Her crying scene, accompanied by Joni Mitchell, makes you want her to make more films! The wonderful Laura Linney, Liam Neeson and Colin Firth are all under utilized in this sad hodgepodge. Please do not read the other reviews that promise you a wonderful holiday movie. I am as sentimental as the next guy but you knew where this film was going in the first ten minutes. And even then, characters were never allowed to resolve any of their dilemmas.What drivel!

Yuck!","review":"For starters, and we were shocked at the unnecessary nudity. The lack of completion with the stories. We wanted to see this film because we like Alan Rickman. It was billed as a \\"funny, romantic comedy\\". It was anything but...Alan Rickman plays a married man who is tempted by his secretary to \\"cheat mentally\\" or at least to give her a Christmas necklace...this story ends with Rickman and Thompson (his wife) staying together \\"for the children's sake\\"? Who knows? The story line is never finished...and that was the best of the stories in this film!What a disappointment! Would give it a \\"no star\\" rating if possible, but the lowest rating is a one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"This movie is like a spoiled brat lashing out in all directions without plan, without aiming and seldom hitting anything.

It is an exquisite study of British repression with a dash of multiculturalism thrown in.Give it to everyone on your Christmas list of the people you hate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Actually Actually","review":"I went to theatre twice for this movie - something I've never done before for any movie, I bought the soundtrack immediately afterwards, and I bought the DVD first day it is available. That's how I LOVE it ACTUALLY.The movie is a romantic fantasy for mature adult, a stylish medley of many unrealistic love stories. Some people dislike it because of the unrealistic plots, but could you just lighten your \\"seriousness\\" for a moment and enjoy some heart warming fun and laughter? If you could, this movie is your best bet - superb casting, amazing music compilation. I leave the theatre with a smile, a sense of happiness - what more can you expect from a movie?Richard Curtis is THE king of romantic comedy, I loved every pieces of his work way back from the Four Weddings and a Funeral to this one.Love Actually will be a all-time Christmas classic to be viewed for generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Admittedly an Anglophile...","review":"...but don't hold that against me! That being said, I don't always like British romantic comedies. Or ANY romantic comedies for that matter. But this is a wonderful combination of different, intertwining stories and is wonderfully acted out by some of the best actors in the UK today.

No extra Hugh or Colin but the Liam Neeson father-son plotline is expanded and it becomes better understood about the Claudia Schiffer comment. Also, the installation at the art gallery is funny when you see how it came about. And egads! More naked people!Also commentaries with Hugh and Richard and videos and such round it out. definitely wrap this one up and put it under someone's tree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"Timely and well represented.

It wonderfuly blends comedy, tragedy, romance and drama into one uniquely differnt motion picture. The plot is not a simple one, so I will will give you a brief explanation of all the romantic situations entangled in this movie: 1-The new prime minister, who falls for his beautiful secretary; 2-A writer thats comes to love his Portugeese-speaking housekeeper; 3-a housewife, who belives her husband is cheating on her with another woman; 4-a young man madly in love with his best friends new wife; 5-an older man (who just recently lost his wife) helps his young stepson to \\"woo\\" the love of his life; 6-a weird Englander moves to America to have lots and lots of sex with American girls; and 7-sex-scene body doubles whose naked conversations lead to true love.Although the film is much enjoyable, it runs for a bit too long (pushing 2 and a half hours) but still is a gem. Not appropriate for teenagers under 15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally Detached","review":"Let me start by saying that the cast was impressive and that was the main reason for watching this movie. How bad could it be?This movie goes all over the place. The characters are not developed and therefore we are left empty and not caring one bit for these people. One reason I believe we don't connect is that there are way too many couples in this movie. Don't get me wrong the movie has potential but how can we possibly feel for over sixteen people when it's only a two hour movie?The only couples I feel that needed more attention were: Emma Thompson's charcter and husband, Laura Linney and the guy she had a crush on. If you watch the movie you'll understand why. Emma's character has a stronger story and Laura Linney's character had to deal with an emotionally unbalanced and needy brother. We could have seen more as to how she was going to deal with this and still have a life.All other characters were wasted and pointless. Such a great castwasted on this nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but long","review":"I saw \\"Love Actually\\" a while ago and i thought it was a good movie with one flaw: it was really long. And some of the actors bothered me. Example: Kiera Knightly. She really bothers me. On the commercials they were advertising the people in the movie like they had big roles. Like Rowan Atkinson. His name was on the cover, unlike some of the other main characters.

Therefore, I rushed to see the movie. What a disappointment! It seems to be very diluted, like a series of storylines that are best dealt with in a soap opera. What were they thinking, these capable actors? Each role is barely sketched and stereotypical. I am really sad to write this review, since I know it is going to impact their viewership, but I felt so betrayed in my affections, that I had to say it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I watched an 'edited' version...","review":"and thought the movie was interesting and entertaining. And it contained many favorite actors. Then I read an online review about the vulgar sights, scene and sayings that had been removed from the version I watched. How disappointing.

If you like to see 50-something men end up with women half their age, this is the movie for you. Maybe I'm just mad because I didn't like how the Emma Thompson bit turned out. What the heck happened?

It tries so hard to be cute and funny, stuffing over 5 different love stories into one short movie. What we get is a set of underdeveloped one dimensional characters, underdeveloped plot lines, and ultimately a very forgettable romanitc comedy. Frankly, I felt it was a waste of time and money. The only redeeming parts were Colin Firth's appearance (although he was on camera far too little) and the cute love story with the little elementary aged boy and his crush. Some stories that needed development were left to shrivel up.

I hate saying outloud to the characters in a movie \\"why don't you just say/do {insert logical suggestion here}\\". What I love about this movie is that it is sweet and sappy but not in a manner that makes me want to shove my finger down my throat afterward. The film takes a look at several different angles we see every day in relationships and not all of them are happy nor are all of them ever resolved. The humanity included, however, is what appeals to me most.Unlike critics who see this film as a dramatization of commercial Christmas at its worst combined with weak writing, I see several fun, imaginative, (even if not believable) and witty dramas tied up in a nifty little package. I love the dry humor and the music is thoughtful and appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the \\"professional critics\\"!","review":"This is such a great movie.

I'll have to talk to her.This movie was a disjointed collection of little relationships, none of which really had any magic or interest. There were random relationships thrown about without any real underlying theme or story. Many of the interactions were just plain stupid.

The \\"run after the departing girl at the last minute\\" cliche was done not once but three times. The film used old pop music top-forty hits to establish moods in a very heavy-handed, distracting, and unimaginative way. And, in addition to being insultingly anti-American, the movie was so male-oriented, it was almost misogynistic. Most of the female leads played paid servile employees of their male lovers. The women in this film NEVER say \\"NO\\" to male attentions even if the woman just married someone else. And female employees flirt with their bosses by turning their office chair towards him and spreading their legs as widely as possible. This movie has all the subtlety of a pile driver but is far less interesting to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This film insulted my intelligence. 1) The opening lines about Sept. 11th are tasteless. Why use people who were innocently murdered to make a point in a movie's screenplay? 2) At least two of the relationships in the film consist of men in positions of authority over the women and should make any thinking person rather uncomfortable; 3) The president of the United States is portrayed pretty much as a serial rapist, not only unbelievable but extremely insulting to any thinking person; 4) The storyline about the friend with the crush on his best friend's wife who then stalks her, once again, should make any thinking person extremely uncomfortable; 5) The scene in which the coworker walks out on Laura Linney's character just because she receives a phone call from her brother is just not believable and once again quite insulting to any thinking person and 6) a child would not be able to run through an airport without being either physically stopped, or, unfortunately, maybe even worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Sucks","review":"I just couldn't get into this one. It was trying to be all things to all people, and the reason i like about a boy and most of hugh grant's other movies is because they have a decidely british feel and look. That's why people like him he's very british and handsome. We don't want him in a stupid american love story thats why bridget jones diary is so good, its very very british, and thats why notting hill was good hes just the lovable brit, u have to cast him as the \\"lovable brit\\" in a british type of film or u will fail!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually Awful","review":"I enjoyed the other movies by these talented filmmakers. Noting Hill--Great. Four Weddings and a Funeral--brilliant! I am very sorry, however, that I was so high on those films that I went ahead and bought the DVD without first screening the movie on cable. There are TOO MANY characters and storylines. This means no character is given ANY depth. It's awful, cliche, and sickeningly sweet. The \\"bad\\" girl secretary is actually wearing devil horns as part of a costume in one scene--sheesh, how juvenile and obvious can you get? Are these the same minds that created the other brilliant, touching, biting movies that I loved? If so, then all I can say is that they were so busy trying to push \\"agendas\\" that they forgot how to tell a story well. Characters are left at loose ends or given ridiculously forced cheerful endings to their stories. Just awful. Waste of time and there's some really nasty attitudes toward America too. I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ONLY ME BUT:","review":"EIGHT COUPLES IN LONDON DURINF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS. SOME MAKE IT THROUGHT THE HOLIDAY CHEER AND SOME DON'T.

From start to finish it is simply one of the best. By the movie's end you will be high on life and ready to take on the world. This movie combines several different love stories in a seamless fashion. It is very unique and enduring. It is an instant treasure. You will view love differently after watching this film.

They broke the mold when they made this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not feeling it.","review":"I love all the actors in this movie but I just didn't believe any of the characters loved each other. (Except perhaps Liam Neisen and the kid) Also,despite there being a child in the film, DO NOT let your kids see this movie!

Too many characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Not only is this movie trashy, it's boring. I was amazed to find Hugh Grant & Liam Neeson in a movie without wit or energy. The promo people found the best in the movie & made it look appealing. The clips in their actual setting were the highlights of the movie. We fianlly decided we had wasted enough of our time & turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clumsy empty mess","review":"In the past, writer Richard Curtis proved a brilliant writer of witty dialog. But he's not particularly good at constructing funny situations. And he's terrible at building a passable reality or an interesting fantasy. In this movie, which is under his direction as well as his pen, he also proves to be a poor acting coach, an all-thumbs editor, a tonedeaf musical director, and, overall, just, inept.The movie is endlessly pointless. The characters are engaged in nothing serious or funny -- instead these talented people are acting through a suffocating hollywood-like porridge of boiled-down life-crisis moments. The off-target result just makes you wonder where these non-people came from. The movie is not sweet. It's not funny. It offers such badly drawn cartoons of life, that it achieves no mood at all, nothing of which I could approve or disapprove."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I love Hugh Grant and was looking forward to seeing this film.

They actually rented this film for my nursing-home patients to watch not knowing the adult content!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can they cheapen the idea of love anymore?","review":"Okay, I love most british films, most romantic comedies, and find often something redeeming in the ones I don't. This movie is a huge disappointment. I was drawn in by the great actors, but I wonder what drew them in. This movie has weak story lines, mostly unlikeable characters and uses every opportunity to include foul language, sex and nudity it can. The effectual message? Love Actually is Cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much distraction","review":"I had heard so much that was good about this movie, that we went ahead and purchased it to watch together on Valentine's day. What a shocker! First, there are just too many storylines to keep up with, and then there is the sex... if your idea of a romantic comedy includes sex and sexual innuendo, then this is for you. I found the scenes with the porn stars to be offensive and unnecessary. The references to sex, and even with a young boy being sexually obsessed with a girl, was just too much for me.And then there is the language. Again, if you can get around the F-bomb being dropped every five minutes, then you'll love this movie. I understand that maybe the British have different standards for use of language then some of us, but this made it just horrible to listen to, much less watch.I would say we made it about less than an hour into the movie before we turned it off.I think this could have been done in a way that was much more tasteful."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow; too many plots, not enough substance","review":"I guess the point of this movie was supposed to be Love Overload, sending women into an overdose of estrogen with every romantic turn. Any one of these plots might have made an interesting movie, but each is chopped down into something about as substantial as a 30-second commercial. Most romantic movies only ask you to endure one or two cheesy gimmicks, but by the time I saw a marriage proposal accepted between two people who barely knew each other at all, I had reached the end of my rope, and I realized that none of this was anything like real romance.Without disdain, I can advise that if you're into the cutesy shmaltzy stuff then you may love this movie. The actors are superb with what little they've been given. (LIAM NEESON MARRY ME!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, Actually","review":"Richard Curtis and Hugh Grant collaborate again in this light, somewhat sentimental, romantic comedy. The film features a great cast which includes Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney and an especially hilarious performance by Bill Nighy. The movie is set at Christmastime and follows the sometimes interconnected lives of numerous couples. This isn't great art and isn't meant to be. It is, however, really good entertainment and a nice way to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight and overly contrived, but enjoyable nonetheless","review":"I'm not usually a big fan of romantic comedies, but I enjoyed \\"Love Actually\\" nonetheless, mostly because the performances by the various actors were entertaining and the pacing was brisk enough that I didn't get bored even though the movie is over two hours long. There are perhaps too many story lines, but overall this is a good choice if you like British humor and don't mind romantic cliches. I give this a low 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please, don't tell the guys...","review":"but I really like this movie.

I was sorry that alan rickman did not have a bigger part. I was glad that he wasn't \\"on the make\\" in the beginning of this film and that he did regret what he did.

She was thrilled to get it as one of her xmas presents and has watched it a few times, already -- once with me. It is a great movie, albeit, leaning to the chick-flick genre.

Can't go wrong with this film, unless you have a heart of stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be ready to leave happy!!","review":"** I am adding this paragraph after reading all the bad reviews and the people who are hyper critical. This movie is JUST a movie. It is a romantic comedy which means you can't take anything too seriously. If you leave a movie feeling entertained or you think humorously about it again the next day then it was a success. I definitely thought about Love Actually again and again. So don't let the critics control you- make your own decision. It WAS AND IS FUN!!!Now here's my original review- This was by far the best movie I have seen all year. It was delightful the way they intertwined the several different love stories. It made it very fun to see how they would all relate to eachother. This was a fun movie that really was uplifting and encouraging. It also reminds you how it felt when you first fell in love or maybe were waiting for someone to notice you!

The sexual portions and foul language were not enjoyable. I was told this was a great movie and it could have been one of those you want to watch often.

For Americans it can be somewhat interesting challenge to follow for it's British sensitivities, but the point of the movie is well played out. The part of the Prime Minister was a bit overdone, but the love interest very enjoyable to watch. Also, the acting and delivery of the 'couple' that couldn't speak each other's language was well played. The skits about the couple who were nude standins didn't make much sense. But overall if the director wanted to give us a positive feeling about love and relationships, I think he achieved his goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this movie.

For those of us who prefer not to watch porn, we don't appreciate the filmmaker's attempt to insert it here under the guise of a sight gag. It's still offensive. Also disappointing was the storyline with a stepfather and young son constantly talking very explicitly about sex. Beyond inappropriate and utterly depressing.

The British always curse and put down awful performers like Hugh Grant but never seem to pick on he's incredibly crap acting, the man sucks.

Only in America, the Christmas movies are mostly actually not objectionable.All the characters are stupid. Colin Firth adores a woman who cheats on him with his own brother, how stupid is that?

I was begining to enjoy some of the other stories but why do you have to \\"porn it up\\"?We went to see this movie because of the excellent actors, to bad for them they have to be associated with this material.I really hope nobody buys this DVD so that hollywood sees that people are more interested in less ephimeral things.Go see the PASSION instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and anti-American","review":"Is it funny or charming?

What a mistake. Once I did finally view this gem I was blown alway. This all star cast puts together a multifaceted love story, with comedy to spare. Intertwining characters and story lines, plus it's strong overall theme, made this movie almost perfect. This shouldn't have been much of a surprise due to my admiration of other movies written by Richard Curtis. But I digress, this is a great couples movie, which both men and women will enjoy. I guarantee it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If it makes me cry, it's a winner!","review":"I had read mixed reviews on this movie and was unsure about purchasing it, but I did anyways!

The film flits between different 'romances' but the chemistry between the actors on screen is zero. Its all very predictable, OF COURSE certain people get together at the end, yawn. And what was with that waste-of-space storyline of the man who loved the black man's wife, that wasn't finished, nothing happened with it!I've given it 2 stars not 1 because of the (albeit sparse) funny scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually loved this movie!","review":"i thoght this movie was so fun! i went and saw it with my mom (because i'm just 14) and she loved it too. it has alot of nudeity in so its not the best if you want to take your kids. and the plot line is so cool, because all of the storys are some how connected, so that makes it really cool. ohh, and also, see this movie if your a hugh grant fan;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one.","review":"This is one of those movies that you really want to like, because it's always on the cusp of being funny...but then isn't.

Having said that, let me say this: I really enjoyed this movie. A sort of three ring circus, it follows a number of relationships from unrequited love ( a man who loves a friend's wife), puppy love (an absolutely charming depiction of a schoolboy crush), lost love ( a woman who can't follow through on her attraction to the office hunk), found love ( a housekeeper who doesn't speak his language), and the love of a true friend ( A burned out rock star who discovers his real love). There's more, and done really surprisingly well given all that's going on. Hugh Grant does what is perhaps his best smaller part as the Prime Minister who realizes his love for an unlikely staffer.I realize that this is a cliche, but this is a movie destined to become a Christmas standard.

With an all star cast, 'Love Actually' takes us on a charming light-hearted jaunt through the festive season in the lives of a widely diverse selection of characters.The all star cast delivers a pitch perfect performance of a humourous tale of secret love and, for the most part, happy endings. Some of the more cold-hearted reviewers accuse it of being overly sappy, however these criticisms are misguided and irrelevant. 'Love Actually' makes no pretensions at being a 'hard hitting' or 'gritty' film. Instead it succeeds at being a heartwarming, festive tale admirably.Although 'Love Actually' was released as a christmas film, it is suitable to be watched at any time of year alongside your better half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infatuation Actually","review":"Well I just saw this movie after having heard gazillions of times how good this movie is.

I couldn't understand what this story, or mix of stories had to do with love. I realize I'm old-fashioned, but I am so disappointed that anyone would believe the ideas presented here are healthy, happy concepts of real love. I'm so weary of films with gratuitous, meaningless sex and meaningless stories. We never looked at the rating beforehand, since this was presented as a Christmas movie. An R-rated Christmas movie? If you want a warm Christmas movie, try the old black and white stories; you will be more likely to find a little more real warmth and love, and maybe a bit of real Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chic-flick","review":"I watched this movie on some airline flight, and I thought it was a excellent movie. It's funny, witty, invocative, whatever that means. I love Hugh Jackman (the prime minister) in this film- it's just so classic him! One of the funniest parts is the British guy who has no luck in love in England, so for the holdiays travels to America to \\"break the curse\\"- and it does to great comedic effect! Wish that would happen to me! :) I am not sure if you need this movie in your collection (hence the 4 stars) but it's definately worth a watch, unless you get depressed always seeing others finding love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting but Very Antifeminist","review":"I don't mean to be deliberately narrow-minded when I say this movie made my skin crawl. I went into the theatre excited to see Emma Thompson in a new film role and I left extremely angry at the limited roles women play in this film. They're all seen through the lens of the male and this angered me particularly.Love portrayed in this film is not \\"love actually.\\" It's still love according to Hollywood. The lovers are all beautiful physically. Their situations are idealized--even Emma Thompson's, whose husband cheats on her--and characterization is nil.Skip this movie and watch \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start lousy substance","review":"I went to the theatre to see this with my mother-in-law. The beginning was nice. Starts off reminding us to get refreshed in human nature by going to the airport and watching the people at the arrival gate. Then you had to follow 5 different story lines. The love interest had the language of a merchant marine. One couple (they are porn star body doubles)meets in a vulgar display of acting out sex scenes, it was embarrassing at best. We were very disappointed. We felt it had such comic potential, ruined by the disgusting content, unnecessarily added in our opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ain't that good.","review":"Before I sat down to watch this film I wasn't really expecting much and what I got was what I expected. Love Actually is over-long-I was bored by One hour and thirty minutes, it could've been rapped up- it is far too sentimental, Andrew Lincoln? Cheesey! The beginning was so unthoughtful, making a speech about the Two Towers.

It's a far cry from Four Weddings and a Funeral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed","review":"This movie disappointed me greatly. I love Hugh Grant, but this movie hurt me. It was slow and not heart-warming and romantic. The only part I adored was Hugh Grant, dancing around the Palace. Other than that, I loathed the Porno actors scenes and the Guy who liked his best friends wife. The entire movie was a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like poo","review":"My girlfriend rented this movie, and it's one of the worst I've seen. Hugh Grant is a terrible actor and I knew that this movie would blow right when I saw that he was in it.This movie doesn't really have a set story or setting. It's just an annoying back-and-forth flick between different people's love life. I am very upset that I actually sat through this horrid film."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked, actually","review":"a bitter disappointment. like getting coal for christmas. the plot was flatter than the DVD itself, and the characters were cliches with british accents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it, actually","review":"Maybe I missed something, but what exactly was this movie about? None of the characters were ever on scene long enough for me to develop any empathy toward them, none of them were drawn with the slightest bit of realism or depth (except for maybe the washed-up singer), and none of the situations were the slightest bit believable.The entire sequence with the \\"prime minister\\" meeting the \\"president\\" was utterly pointless and added nothing to the movie. But then, that pretty much describes every other scene so I guess it fit right in.Like \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" this movie was pointless, meandering, unfocused drivel and a complete waste of film. I'd give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Actually Widescreen Edition","review":"One of the great Holiday movies that will be a classic. Fun, heartwarming and loads of great stars. A 5 star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basically Charming","review":"Love Actually presents a series of charming tales underscoring the variety and persistence of love. As the plot unfolds new love is contrasted with old love and lust with betrayal. Some scenes are taken to believable excess but most remain in the romantic comedy reality. If you watch closely I bet you find the love you have, the love you once had, or the love you long for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Romantic Christmas Gift","review":"\\"Love Actually\\" is set in London during the Christmas season. I highly recommend this DVD as a perfect gift for that special someone on your list. Filmed with a talented ensemble cast, it is romantic, upbeat, sometimes irreverent and largely entertaining. If you enjoyed \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" or \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" you will enjoy this film. By the way, a search on Froogle, Google's bargain sniffing search engine, just now says Amazon has the lowest price on this DVD. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Classic","review":"This is a well done moving, with intertwining characters that engage with one another yet their storylines do not intersect.

But, I felt like the characters were not fleshed out as much as I wished. I felt like I was left hanging because I wanted more out of these people. Yes, there are some really funny parts to this film. But with so many actors and so much action going on, I wish there was fewer to concetrate on and as I say, more to be fleshed out.Personally, I would perfer Bridget Jones Diary over this and even some Sense and Sensibilty or even Emma with basically the same actors in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well . . .","review":"another reviewer said this is very percussive without much melody. True. I love highly percussive IDM but this is only interesting enough to listen to once straight through. As soon as you're done listening you've forgotten what you've heard. Everyone is annoying and disturbing (and part of the reason I returned the disc) where a guy says over and over again: \\"I want to kill everyone, Satan is good, Satan is our pal.\\" Maybe it was funny in The 'Burbs but taken out its context and radomly placed in a song makes it disturbing and completely unneccessary. Miss June is the only awesome track and I found I played that over and over again but the rest is mediorce at best.Rumor has it that this is aphex twin. If so, shame on you Richard. If not, then you'll do better picking up an aphex twin disc. And hey reviewer down below, leave Warp records alone. Obviously you like mediorce music like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars For Astrobotnia","review":"I'm not the biggest fan of IDM, which is electronic music with ambient melodies combined with harsh, manipulated, drum-loops, but when it comes to Rephlex, I usually give it a try. Unlike the crap Warp Records have been releasing for the past two years, Astrobotnia (who was thought to be Aphex Twin, but is actually a lesser-known artist, Ovuca) three albums are engrossing, often leaving the listener in a state of awe. I like the first LP best though, unfortunatly Parts 2 & 3 don't live up to this one. But this is truly an amazing album, coming from a mediocre artist distributed by a corny record label that releases anything that sounds \\"weird\\" rather than analyzing the music's material, they focus on the \\"weird\\"ness, the drums and all. Thus everything they've put out by once excellent artists have failed to please...anyone's ears. This label I'm referring to is Warp records, but I'm surprized and extremely glad that Astrobotnia did not give in to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother with this one","review":"Yet another attempt to try and make a Darkman sequel, this one is worse than the second.Vosloo returns while Fahey is the bad guy and is horrible at it.

I have since seen Darkman II, which I liked less because I liked the villian less. Mr. Fahey in Darkman III is much more versatile; he convinced me--until I actually took time to consider it--that he was Darkman in disguise, so different was his demeanor in those instances. His growing insanity was quite believable as well. Mr. Vosloo was also quite good in his role. His concern for his enemy's family seemed quite genuine."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool hero made bad","review":"I AM A DARKMAN FAN I HAVE ALL THE MOVIES AND ALSO THE COMIC BOOKS BUT I HAVE TO SAY THIS AND DARKMAN 2 ARE HORRIBLE WHEN COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL.ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS DIRECT TO VIDEO CAN GET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot hot movie!!","review":"Playboy's EROS collection keeps getting hotter. This release is a great movie for fans of them. Of course, the plot is kind useless. But if you're into soft core sex scenes with some incredibly hot women, then this one is for you.

There are so many other cozy mysteries that are much better written and with a main character you actually like. I should have stopped near the beginning when Emma Lord, a reporter, was actually allowed to wonder in to the crime scene alone, have her small town photographer take photos of the dead bodies, and then to make it even more ridiculous, she appears to be the only one in town who knows how to count because she then alerts the sheriff that there are actually four bodies instead of three. Good grief. Not even close to being believable, but then again she is not even close to being likeable nor is this book close to being readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nemesis Indeed","review":"I've read all the books in Daheim's Alpine series and loved each of them . . . up until this one. The plot of Alpine Nemesis was great and the storyline, well developed, but the ending was unexpected, uncharacteristic, and downright depressing. Daheim's audience is probably ninety percent women, most of whom read for the sheer pleasure of escape from the realities of life. What was Daheim thinking when she wrote this book? I do not recommend Alpine Nemesis, and am very reluctant to read Daheim's next book in the series for fear that it'll be a downer like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one","review":"I love this series!

This is actually a daily devotional using Jesus words as the caption to each writing. It gets one star not because it's a terrible book (I didn't read it), but because the title suggests something else AND because the publisher doesn't tell you what it really is in the description. Yes, it is free. But then again lots of religious books written by those wanting to espouse religious ideas are free. I was looking for Jesus....not one of his followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Tapes are very difficult to follow. They are done in a very fast monotone.

Yungchen Lhamo has a voice that one will not easily forget. She is truly unique and, to the best of my current knowledge, one of the only women who has made a recording of Tibetan chants and prayers.

Accompanied by the chant recited by the Monk, the CD creates a unique and somewhat mysterical/nostalgic feeling that deeply and completely touches your soul.

It was a time of segregation and hard lives. Richard Wright writes about the roughness he had as a child through Johnny, and how scary things could be. It all makes the book more meaningful and well written. I think this book is a good read because it is based actually times in history. Although this book is very short, (it includes an Afterwords) it is packed with emotion and feelings that make you think and wonder. IMO, this is a well-written book, that could be a bit longer, and a bit more into detail like other books written by Richard Wright.Its worth reading and buying, 4 stars! -D.T."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"Overall I liked \\"Rite of passage.\\" I thought it was a pretty good book, and would recommend it to any upper level middle school age kids. The only reason I say you should be a little older, is that younger children may not be able to understand the idea the book is trying to give.

The story was very good. The wording was put a little too simply, but it was an overall good book. It kept me interested, and I didn't put it down until I was done. The only problem was that it was very short, and ended too abruptly. The story didn't exactly end. I would have liked to hear more about what happens to The Moochers.

The story is very vague, the direction is weak, and the film as such lacks consistence. A level which only belongs to debut films.A typical Danish film, for good and for worse, but especially for worse. Mediocre acting, except of course by Sofie Grbl who, no matter how tiny a role she is given, just does not posess the talent of adapting.A disappointing film whose only good sides are Iben Hjejle, Jesper Asholt, my favourite psychopath Torben Jensen, and a few OK jokes here and there thanks to author Anders Thomas Jensen.By the way: What word in the 'Dogma 95' has Sren Kragh-Jacobsen followed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"Earth Crisis doing a Misfits cover??

This is the Misfits we're discussing not the freaking Descendants. I felt like throwing up after listening to NOFX's \\"Last Caress\\" (albeit I did just eat a huge meal, but it still sucked). The one bright spot in a generally regretable purchase was 108's \\"Death Comes Ripping,\\" which really demonstrated the frustation those lyrics warrant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This is simply the best book on the mass media that I have read. It does a terrific job of covering academic research while maintaining its appeal to a general audience. The chapter on the effects of the media are powerful examples of what good sociology can be. If you want to increase your understanding of the internal workings of media industries and the effects of the mass media on the individual and society, you couldn't make a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"This scale is completely inaccurate.

The Sackett and Chic Bowdrie series are my absolute favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I watch it over and over..it is that good","review":"I bought this movie about 7 years ago and I still think it is one of the best westerns. Mickey Rourke is excellent (as usual) and so is the rest of the cast. I especially like the scenery and the way the movie shows us a dirty, dusty trail that makes it more enjoyable than watching a bunch of guys riding around the country in CLEAN clothes. That just is not as believeable since you cannot possibly stay clean in that environement.It is somewhat violent but again that adds to the realism. I have the VHS tape and just bought a DVD to upgrade.ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Western","review":"This is a damn good movie. The story's awesome and Rourke's character is a badass. It drags in some spots, but overall this is probably the coolest western since TOMBSTONE. The stylized direction by Geoff Murphy(YOUNG GUNS 2) is real effective. Check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly packaged","review":"The plastic tension disk in the center was broken, allowed the pieces as well as the DVD to slide about inside the sealed case.

It got confusing in so many parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it weren't so","review":"I had high hopes for this book - in particular trying to find a new series to read to my kids (ages 7 and 8). The problem is that the book is written in that self-indulgent, quirky style that a number of recent British authors (esp. of children's books - e.g. Pure Dead Magic) seem to find cute. Filled with non-sequitors and long asides that don't add much to the storyline, the book did not hold my kids' interest well. I suppose other readers might this writing style interesting, but I think it's a cheap gimmick that takes away from spinning a intriguing yarn that could capture a kid's imagination. What was particularly notable was the difference in the level of interest/attention my kids had for this book in comparison with the one we had finish prior: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl - a book that they really enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A House Called Awful End","review":"I was sorry to have wasted my time with this book. I thought it'd be a fun, whimsical book, something like a cross between Roald Dahl and Lemony Snicket, both of whom I adore. Unfortunately, this one is just...too random, has no apparent plot, and is just ultimately dull. There are so many storylines, each one more absurd than the next, and everything's everywhere and disjointed and Ardagh just tried too hard to be funny and failed miserably. It was a pointless book, all 2D characters with nothing to keep them or their situations interesting. There was certainly potential for a plot, but nope, nothing. Just a frustratingly pointless, plotless read. Not a fan, not a fan at all.Rating: 1/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and full of Adventure - by: BCE","review":"This story takes place sometime long ago.

Ann Raimes has masterfully crafted a chart of common transfer errors from the foreign language into English. Though I use this chart infrequently, the fact that Keys HAS such a chart is indicitave of the in-depth treatment that Ms. Raimes accords each topic.In addition, I like the tabbed references in the spiral-bound edition.

The album would be worth buying for \\"Don't You Want Me\\" alone. The song is an 80's (and all time) classic with its film noir lyrics and rich synthesizers. One might think of the album as a one-song wonder, but that is hardly the case. Other great tracks include \\"The Sound Of The Crowd\\", \\"Get Carter\\", \\"Things That Dreams Are Made Of\\", \\"Love Action\\" & \\"Seconds\\".

Worth having in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synth-pop masterpiece","review":"This album was just so right for its time. Kraftwerk, Bowie, Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder and Gary Numan had been paving the way in using the synthesizer in popular music, so the tuneful synth-pop of Human League's third album was received with open arms. The fashion magazine cover perfectly captures the atmosphere of rock's early 80s 'new romanticism'. After all these years, the synth & drum machine novelty has worn off, but this album remains a masterpiece on account of the quality of the songs. Phil Oakey's voice is perfectly framed by the female vocals and the arrangements are great. My favorites include the soaring Open Your Heart, the solemn lament Seconds, plus The Sound Of The Crowd, Do Or Die, Love Action and Don't You Want Me.

Listening to a cd for the sake hearing one song over and over, hot damn. Reading reviews by other people, I get an odd overview of the album. It is the best album to come out of the eighties, because it has one good song. That one song being \\"Don't you want me\\", which nearly 25 years later is still overplayed.

Also, the poster came in great condition, and was shipped quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but still excellent","review":"The two best DVD performances of the Verdi Requiem are those of Karajan (from 1967) and Abbado (the recent Berlin version). Guttenberg leads a less virtuosic ensemble but still captures the excitement and grandeur of this work. His quartet of soloists is excellent (although less stellar than Karajan's); Pamela Coburn's shimmering soprano is the standout of the group. The quality of picture and sound is less spectacular than Abbado's but superior to Karajan's. If you love this music enough that you must have more than one version, I suggest that you make this DVD number three on your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Verdi, hate this version","review":"If you love the Verdi Requiem I believe that you, like me, will be disappointed with this version. It surprised me to hear a spinkling of wrong, or fractured, notes in prominent spots. Rehearing these passages is like walking with a pebble in your shoe - it gets more and more annoying - even painful. Considering the DVD recording medium and the date of recording, it is also woefully poor quality. Stick to one of the older recordings and you stand a better chance of being satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Heinlein's Best","review":"Long before Robert Heinlein turned his considerable talents to 500-page discussions of marriage and incest in the Howard Family, he had reached the peak of his powers with his so-called \\"juveniles.\\" These were stories of regular, identifiable young people thrust into some of the most imaginative and exciting adventures in all of science fiction. Tunnel in the Sky is perhaps the best, and most memorable, of these works. You'll remember this book years after you read it, from the vivid portrayal of the protagonist's first night on a wild, alien planet, to the eminently satisfying end of this deeply engaging story. Heinlein makes you feel as if you were there for every moment of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his good ones.","review":"With Heinlein there are two sorts of books, the ones aimed at teenage boys with lots of action and good hard sci fi, and the waffley semi religious strange ones he wrote in later life. Personally I liked both styles. Anyway this book is of the former sort, ideal for younger readers, but I enjoyed it too as this was one of the early gem's I missed in my youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Heinlein Juvenile Success","review":"This is a Heinlen Juvenile that is not set in the 1940s SF Solar System. Instead Heinlein uses \\"Star Gate\\" style technology, without Ancient Egyptian mumbo-jumbo, to send humanity to planets surrounding alien stars. The basic story is about some young people marooned unexpectedly while on a field trip.There is a resemblance to _Lord of the Flies_ but Heinlein is a much better writer with a sunnier, although still not too sunny, view of human nature.The central character seemed annoying in some respects the first time I read this. However, his good qualities overshadow his flaws. Now I realize that he is fairly consciously creating his own flaws. He is a young man with heroic goals and those goals twist his character somewhat.This story predates the \\"Star Gate\\" film or TV shows but it is likely that Heinlein didn't \\"invent\\" the technology either. It is a very tempting idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Heinlein","review":"The more Heinlein I read the more I see how much modern sci-fi is dirivitive of his work.He is often called the Grandmaster of sci-fi, I submit he should instead be thought of as the Grand Father of modern sci-fi.In this work, a number of school kids go to a far off unknown planet as the final exam in their survival course, their method of travel is the Star Gate. SG1 of Atlantis, take your pick, this is the origin of that whole thing as far as I can see.The story itself is FANTASTIC, survival and troubles when things go wrong, people pulling together and sometimes apart. I was torn about the ending, but I suppose no matter which way he chose to end it, you might root for it to have gone the other way - If you have read it, you know what I mean, if you havent, then read it, and you will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Sci-Fi","review":"I truly enjoyed this book for it's fluid story telling and the use of concepts of travelling to other worlds (to name just one). It sometimes moved too fast for me, though, with new characters and names to keep track of. Some characters were introduced early on only to reappear later with little significance to the story. The ending was also a little bit of a let down. It seemed too quick and unexpected. A very good book overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a teenage boy, it doesn't get much better than this.","review":"This is classic sci-fi/adventure for the adolescent reader. The futuristic setting, the action/survival theme, even a hint of sexual tension -- what more could a teenage boy want in a book? And if it sounds as if I'm being tongue-in-cheek, I'm really not. I loved this book as a teen, and got a lot of enjoyment reading it again a couple of decades later."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Science Fiction.","review":"A MUST read for science fiction fanatics around the world. Fast paced and suspenceful, this book wll capture you as it did me. This book is the exact definition of the genre: Sciece Fiction. I read this book over the christmas holidays, and literally, I could no put this book down. But there was one point which consequently lost that fifth star, the ending. he ending I thought did not work well with the rest of the book. The plot was intense while they fought of a horde of pack hunting aliens, but then humans came and just sent everyone home. But still my greatest regards go to Henlein, for writing this masterpeice of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Grandad!","review":"24 years ago my grandad gave me this book. It was my first Heinlein. I can't remember how many times I've read it but I'm on my third copy. It's a simple tale of survival. Like Starship Troopers, family and friends play an important role and the way the characters develop is inspiring.I've read and re-read all of Mr Heinlein's published works, he is so easy to read. I hope this classic tale does not fall under some action movie director's axe like Troopers. The story is perfect as it is and does not need to be re-told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tunnel in the Sky","review":"My teacher, Mr. Fassold, read this book to us in my seventh grade class, and I'm glad he did. Normally I don't read science fiction books like this, but I had no choice. The book is about this kid in the future enrolled in advanced survial. He is a senior in high school enrolled in a college class. After somestrange events he finds that he must survive on his own without help longer then was expected.I thought Robert Heinlein was very clever with his complete turn around of the plot and the universe he creates. I also admired the way the book is just as good now, as it was fifty years ago.I would recomend this to anyone to anyone looking for a good read, regardless of the genres you normally read. The book is funny and it's characters are lively. This is one of the best books I have ever read and now I finally understand the saying, \\"I just couldn't put the book down.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast, enjoyable, memorable read","review":"I have not read this book in a very long time, but I remember it as being a favorite from the first time that I picked it up at the age of 12 or so.The book is about a group of students in a survival class who get stranded on the planet where they were supposed to be living for only a few weeks as a test. The way their group evolves into a little society was very interesting (and not nearly as dark as what happens in a similar situation in The Lord of Flies).

It was as if the book had been written by an eighth grader. Save your money and do not buy this book. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This book was awful. The plot was modest, but the characterizations and dialogue were third-rate. I was hoping to find that Heinlein (and sci fi) would be a whole new genre to explore, but if this represents the highest quality, it'll be a short exploration. I'm worried now about the other three of his I bought at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classroom Novel to Teach Government","review":"After reading the book every year for the past 36 years I finally designed a junior high government teaching unit for the book. The book was a hit with my students. I read the book aloud in the beginning so that I could hook my reluctant readers. Also by guiding kids though the science in the science fiction it got me past the genre bias.The story allows students to evaluate the development of the city-state from a government stand point and from a civilization's cultural universals.This book provides much of the same conversation starters as Lord of the Flies, but without the darkness and the stilted language. In addition, the success of the city-state allows for deep discussion on the determination of the label \\"civilization\\".If you are interested in the novel for your class you may email me and I'll send everything that I used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pics and short, clear explanations.","review":"If you are interested in astronomy but don't want to read a text book about it, this is a great book for you.

He really puts his heart into his music. I Think that his songs make you think about different situations in life such as sexual affairs and friendships. He's got a great beat to his music it's got a hip-hop, rap, r&b, twist. I think that anyone who likes rap and r&b should take the time to listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, hard-to-find movie but definitely PAL format","review":"I had seen this movie years ago and it is just fantastic for a mature viewer. (Not offensive to Catholic truths, a \\"living biography\\" of St. Teresa of Avila. I say \\"mature viewer\\" because it portrays the sinners as definite, explicit sinners). The acting is just top-rate! Being a mini-series, the film highlights St. Teresa's life, so it may be helpful to be familiar with her story in order to follow the episodes as they skip a little time and place from one to the next.I was delighted to find \\"Teresa de Jesus\\" available to purchase on DVD and risked doing so despite the conflicting reports of playable or not playable on US players. However, for myself, NONE of our players (four of them, mostly Sony), could play this PAL-format DVD.However, it IS playable on my Apple computer, thankfully.Perhaps this will help you decide whether to buy this PAL version of this masterpiece of cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding,ola has staying power","review":"it is about time.you are long over due ola,super job keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Friendly Transaction","review":"Seller was so honest and helpful in completing transaction.

It sounds to me like the remastering tech/eng has a case of high frequency burn out as the highs (esp in the area of 4 to 8 khz) are insanely boosted, the stereo image is poor and the much too heavy compression is just plain old WRONG! The drums are non existant. This is one of those Remasters where you would be better off to get either the 1980's CD release or get the CD called \\"The Other Side of Japan\\" as it has most of the best tracks from this album.

The book often seems disjointed and repetitive. It lacks polish and feels more like an undergrad term paper than a serious, analytical work. The information is interesting, but it lacks any serious examination of the policies these women pursued and it has serious omissions. It sticks with women in Congress, but fails to examine other powerful women such as Madeline Albright, Sandra Day O'Connor, or Ruth Baider Ginsberg. In the end, the book seems myopic in its approach and fails to show any evolution in the role of women in politics over time.

It does come with a belt clip, but who wants to carry something that big on they're belt? Why not switch to a PDA phone then? Watch your fingers too! This thing clamps shut pretty good and can pinch your fingers! It will not fit on a Palm cradle for charging.It is the best protection out there for the Zire 71. It's nice to be able to slide the camera out of the case, but you have to watch out not to slid the whole Palm out of the case. It is well secured in the protective case, but it can be pushed out when flipping up the camera part.In the long run, I would recommend this case over all the other's because of it's sturdiness.

You cannot fit an encased Zire 71 into the hotsync cradle. The thin foam padding also seems to push the Zire 71 a little out of alignment with the cutout slot for the Universal Connector, so I'm not sure if you could plug in a free cable into the bottom of an encased PDA (though I haven't tested that)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This small investment has saved my palm many times over","review":"I use my Zire 71 as a Real Estate Key for my life as a Real Estate agent and as a drug reference guide in my life as a health care professional.

I have had my Zire 71 for just over two years and it has survived every fall. It has had a couch dropped on it. It has been run over by inumerable office chairs.

This book has inspired millions of people to communicate effectively with their babies through nurturing touch.Far more than a how-to book about infant massage; this book touches on how nurturing touch supports bonding, attachment and communication between parents/caregivers and their babies. With adaptations for parents of babies born prematurely and those with special needs, this book speaks to all families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"This is a great book on baby massage. I started giving my son massage when he was having gas issues. the techniques in this book worked on helping to relieve his gas and get it moving.Now that he is no longer having these issues we have continued using the massage techniques - it calms him and gives us a great bonding experience. I highly recommend this to all new moms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The first half was a little dull to me. I was already convinced that I wanted to do infant massage, so I didn't need her to explain to me why it's important, but I am glad she included it for those people who aren't sure if infant massage is the right thing to do or not.The actual explanation of the massage techniques, I think, are great. She talks about what to do with each technique and also includes pictures, which is very helpful. I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of all times","review":"I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it, and I have seen it so many times now I couldn't even tell you how many! This has to be the best movie of all times, it will make you laugh and cry! Teddy, Vern, Chris, and Gordy will touch and bring back memories of all the friends you have had in your life, and it makes you think of things you and your best friends done when you were a kid, I would tell everyone to watch this movie, and to buy it, I own a copy and its the best movie I ever bought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best EVER!","review":"This film is amazing.

I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"River Phoenix is awesome.","review":"Now this is a good movie.I particularly enjoyed watching River Phoenix play the role of Chris Chambers.Chris was someone who I feel I could level with.River Phoenix seemed down to earth in that movie.I have not seen his other movies,but,he is still on my Top 10 list of favorite actors.Yes,I understand that he died six years ago.But,even though he's dead,he's still a heck of an actor.I also thought that the older boys in the movie were funny.They were a**holes, but,they did make me laugh.Especially when they were playing mailbox baseball.This movie is great.I would give it 10 stars,but five is the maximum on this site.I welcome email from anyone who wants to comment on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The F words where great.","review":"I loved the movie.

Just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite movie","review":"This movie is definitely the best I've ever watched in my life: it's true, moving, simply beautiful. The actors are amazing, in spite of their young age (I especially want to underline River Phoenix's performance), and the story and everything are just great. I don't know much about movies or stuff, and I'm Italian, so it's even more difficult for me to express what \\"Stand by me\\" means to me, but believe me when I say that you absolutely have to watch it. You'll fall in love with it, forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"I have never seen the DVD version of this movie, but I saw it on TV and taped it.

I am the same age as the characters and although I am a girl, I can relate to all of them. No matter how old I get, I will always love the movie and the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie, but sad...","review":"I think the movie, Stand By Me, is an excellent movie. It's excellent because it contains some things a movie should. It contains friendship, adventure, life, drama, and heart.This movie is about of course 4 friends who come of age in the summer in the 1950s. In this movie, I think you learn a thing or two about what really matters and how things can change. The ending is good, but I thought it was a little sad. I understand that this is a coming of age movie, but usually coming of age movies and books usually have a factor which changes and new things come about from this.This movie was wonderfully made. So see Stand By Me, and you'll see what I mean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T GET TO WATCH IT...","review":"I WISH THEY HAD A SEPARATE RATING SCALE FOR SHIPPING FROM THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

What you have are 4 losers who go in search of a dead body so that they can get onto the televison nightly news and become \\"Celebrities\\". This shows you how sensitive these four kids are. Then to show their delicate sensibilities each one takes his turn at bawling his eyes out. This movie stars the late River Phoenix who was a very Health Conscious guy. He didn't smoke or eat meat but he did like heroin which led to his demise. Sadly both Stephen King and the director of this trash Rob Reiner have confused the experience of adoloescent with a \\"Sensitivity Training Workshop\\". And by the way how come everybody in the audience expels blueberry pies? Did they all have the same thing for lunch as the guys in the Pie Eating Contest?I give this movie 5 stars because the Oregon Vistas are quite nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stand By Me lies down","review":"Four 12-year-old boys go searching for a dead body. When they find it, they have to fight off a group of older boys. Not much of a story, though I guess it's not meant to be, but rather a study of the four boys. One is smart, another is a take-charge type, the third is an odd-man out pudgy type, and the fourth is the victim of a psychotic father and not too bright. The problem is that one minute the kids sound like slob-mouthed 12 year olds and the next like adults in an O'Neill drama analyzing their \\"ruined\\" lives. Not very believable--or it tries too hard to be and fails, which is worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk Away From This One","review":"I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this was absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen; sloppy with the sort of sentimentality that passes for art these days, it was predictable and contrived. Although you'll be tempted to watch it with pubescent kids (being a rite of passage movie, supposedly), be aware that you will be inundated with gratuitous profanity; not a line is uttered without adornment by the \\"s\\" or \\"f\\" word (the latter not even historically accurate, since no one said \\"f\\" in the '50s). Amid all the unpleasantness, there's a particularly unpleasant mass vomiting scene (this is our comic relief, if you wish to react like a savvy movie-goer by snickering appreciatively at this point in the movie). I cringed the entire two hours. It's beyond me how the critics \\"stood by\\" this quacker, unless it was out of misplaced affection for the fledgling director. Choose another."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding.","review":"This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other. When does that ever happen? The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids. What 12 yr. old worries about \\"..never getting out of this small town.\\"?I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense. I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entire Movie is with director's commintary!","review":"If you don't already have this movie....don't get this DVD...you can't watch the movie without Rob Reiner's voice in the background. There isn't an option to just watch the movie. Luckily I had the VHS tape...I thought I would like to have to the DVD, but its just extra things to have...no movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie but horrible sound quality","review":"Stand By Me is a great movie with solid performances all around including several future stars like Kiefer Sutherland and River Phoenix, in one of his final roles. It is truly a excellent adaptation of Stephen King's \\"The Body\\". However, I can't believe they even bother making DVDs (especially \\"Deluxe\\" editions) without including a 5.1 dolby digital audio track or even better, a DTS digital audio track. This edition of the movie only qualifies as a 2 star because of the ridiculous mono soundtrack. What were they thinking? What a joke, the soundtrack CD has better quality sound! A fun movie which would have been 4 stars with a decent audio transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-Ray looks fabulous","review":"My gosh this BR edition is fabulous, it looks beautiful, it really does. The special features are nice as well, the documentary about the film with the interviews really puts you into the mindset of how they got the performances and how much this film means to them as well as us, since this is such a nice experience to watch a well-crafted, touching film like this.

The interaction between four boys on a search for a dead body during the late 1950s makes this film a classic!I had to laugh my head off at numerous parts of the movie - WIDE LOAD, THE LEACHES, THE PENNY COLLECTION HIDDEN UNDER THE HOUSE, SICK BALLS - THAT IS THE DOG SCENE - are just a few to mention. Then there are the serious parts of the move too.The movie captures much of the essance of what kids are like between 6th and 7th grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezes up in my blu ray player","review":"The movie, the story, is great, I have seen this film before. But I wish I would have bought the DVD or the Blu ray + DVD combo (if it exists), instead of just the blu ray. Lesson learned, I am of the mind to buy more combos of BluRay+DVD from now on.Tried to watch this last night, played a few minutes then froze up in my blu ray player. I checked the disc, surface was pristine, no finger grease or smudges, came right out of the blu ray case.

It is one one of my all time favorites. I would recomend that if you haven't seen this movie yet then you should as soon as possible. Phoenix, Wheaton, Feldman, and O'Connell are great when they work together. This is the best movie of all time. Everyone should see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BottomLine- A good movie for laughs and for fun","review":"Stand By Me is an AWESOME movie. One of my few favorites! This movie is about 4 boys who go out looking for the dead body of a boy their age. Thru their 2 day trip, they learn a lot about eachother. BUT the movie has a lot of funny stuff and stuff you'd expect a group of young boys to be. Ya gotta see it and then love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best friendship movie ever!","review":"This is by far, the best movie ever about childhood friendships. It's got everything-laughs, tears, dead body. I really enjoyed watching it because it sees through the eyes of four adolescent boys, which most films don't do. The plot is intriguing and the characters have strength and integrity. I adored \\"Stand By Me\\" as I'm sure a lot of others did. The best River Pheonix movie in which he will mostly be remembered. Kudos to Rob Reiner for such a good, entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was one of the greatest movies that I've ever seen!","review":"I saw this movie on TV one night and I loved it so much. So the next day, I went out and rented it and for the week I had it, I watched it about 12 times and i just thought it was a great movie that I can relate to and I thought it was a very interesting, well made movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the actor's commentary?","review":"Would it have been so difficult to get the three remaining leads together to provide a commentary track? You're better off getting an older edition of the same movie at your favorite big-box store for $9.44. I seem to recall the soundtrack CD was only 30-some minutes long (those old songs were pretty short) so if they're going to include an audio CD, why not the WHOLE soundtrack? Seems like a rip-off to me; too bad the studio phoned it in, rather than actually make a worthwhile product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for kids","review":"I thought that this would be a great movie to watch with our 12 year old, since it is based on that age of kid, and I remember the story fondly. I found out quickly that it is not appropriate for this age group. All of the swear words used frequently, smoking, etc. After shutting it off and watching something else with the kids, mommy and I watched it and enjoyed it tremendously. I do remember the short story, or novelette titled \\"The Body\\" (Stephen King) being slightly better than the movie, but this is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DONT KNOW WHY......","review":"TECHNICHALLY THIS IS A EXCELLANT FILM,I DIDNT LIKE IT.A STORY ABOUT A GROUP OF YOUG FRIENDS WHO GO ON A ADVENTURE TO FIND A DEAD BODY OUT OF CURIOSITY.I FOUND THE FILM TO BE BITTY,AND TIRESOME.I WOULDNT WATCH IT AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching look at growing up","review":"\\"Stand By Me\\" is one of those simple movies that take a penetrating look at joys and sorrows of teen life. The film's basic concept doesn't exactly sound appealing, (four boys in search of a corpse) but I was pleasantly surprised with it's humourous and often moving portrayal of boys slowly evolving, mentally and emotionally. It doesn't for one moment seem artificial and unnatural, it is charged with every day emotions such as curiosity, fear, happiness, sadness, and finally, understanding. The performances by the four lead actors are excellent, especially Will Wheaton and River Phoenix. Definitely a film worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Probably one of the best shows for young teens to watch about friendship and the mischief of the 50-60's. Kids were so innocent then."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should watch it!!!","review":"I like a story which was written by Stephen King, and \\"Stand By Me\\" is the favorite one. I like characters; Vern, Gordie, Chris, and Teddy. Thay are really cute, and they are a symbol or emblem of teen. So we can feel same as them, and we can feel same as ourselves. That's why this movie is loved by people from every country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid Movie with Adult Content","review":"Stand by Me is a necessary viewing film because it highlights the impact our youth had on our adult lives. In addition, the values of friendship, loyalty, perseverance and bravery are hallmarks of the film. It comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Stand by Me\\"--a must-see!!!","review":"I ordered the DVD of the movie, \\"Stand By Me\\". I had seen this movie in the theater, back in the '80s, with my sister, Eva Cassidy---the wonderful singer who died in 1996 from cancer......Eva and I LOVED this movie, and us watching it together in the theater is a wonderful memory I will have forever.......This movie delves deeply into the hearts, minds, and souls of these youngsters. It is at times funny, and then heart-breaking, and most people who watch this movie will recall their own childhoods.This movie is one you will want to watch again and again, which is why I bought the DVD in the first place!This movie was directed by Rob Reiner, and was based on a story by Stephen King--need I say more?!!!Buy this for yourself--you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dedicada a la nostalgia de nuestra niñez","review":"Es una pelicula que revive la inocencia de nuestra niñez vista con nostalgia y ganas de volver a aquellos años que pasaron"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This movie was a good coming of age film. I thought the characters were well developed and the train scene kicked!!! All of the background the characters had made it seem realistic. Even if it's rated R, I think everyone needs to see it. It's what real filmaking is all about. No sex, No drugs, No guns, just honest to goodness movie magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT FILM THAT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES","review":"A fun and delightful film about four friends that go on a campng trip to find a dead body, morbid as this may sound, this film is about becoming a man. There's plenty of laughs and adventures (dodging a train, a pond of leeches, and confrontations). Also the superb acting talents of the four youngboys, including the late River Phoenix. A great film for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with hot River Phoenix to top it all off.","review":"This is a really great movie. I've seen it like a hundred times and still love seeing it and River's sexy body. It is really funny and sweet. Anyone who has not seen it definetely must see it.

It is, has been, and will always be my favorite. It posesses the perfect balances of humour and tears. I read in a previous review that someone was disappointed by it on account of the foul language used. First of all, it must be taken into consideration that that is the way they would have talked anyway and any alteration in that respect on the part of the director would have made the film inaccurate. Secondly, the same reviewer mentioned that this was a children's movie. I have to disagree. It may be about children, but I certainly don't think that they were the intended audience. River Phoenix does a phonomenal job in this film and it is a must see!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"When I first saw Stand By Me, I was 12yrs old, and I fell in love with it. Two years later I read the story, \\"The Body\\" which the movie is based on. The story is written by the very talented Stephen King. It's about 4 boys who go on a journey to find the dead body of a missing child. While on their journey they encounter a junkyard dog, an exciting train chase, and the discovery of friendship. Although, the book was better, the movie is still a cassic that one will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"The body is a great film","review":"The body is one of the best movies. When I first saw the movie I was probably about 12 and I was very scared. Now I saw it the second time and I think it's a great movie. The film reminds me of the good old days in my life. The easy time and the adventure with my friends. I recommend this film to everyone who in the heart stays a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of Fantastic!","review":"My favourite movie of alltime, once you have overlooked the predictability of your typical teenage rites of passage film, it is remarkably enjoyable with well thought out characters, an outragouesly funny-at-times plot-line and Jerry O'Connell.

Jerry O'Connell and Cory Feldman round out the troupe in search of overnight fame. (I still laugh when I hear \\"I cherish these moments\\" as delivered by Feldman.)The movie itself is a fantastic tale, a book that was wonderfully transported to the big screen. I highly recommend the movie. The DVD, however, was greatly less than expected.When I get a DVD, I expect crystal clear sound and a big-theater quality image... This is not to be had here.

Was the language in this film really necassary?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stand by Me - A memoir to a shooting star that's fallen","review":"In short - this movie is a must have for any and every River Phoenix fan! His character (Chris Chambers) reflects the long-forgotten myth we've all experienced at one point in our lives called a 'child's innocense', and his portrayal of accepting neglect, rejection, prejudice, and ultimate fate at such a young age, would drive any person to think twice the next time they thought of judging a troubled 'kid'. Even if you don't like or know River Phoenix, I highly recommend this movie to any adult/young adult with that lingering 'big kid' inside of em'! Two thumbs up, and six stars - 5 for the movie, and 1 special one for River:) (Rest in Peace)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible journey","review":"I once read somewhere that Stephen King said every time he watches this movie, he gets [ticked] off at River Phoenix for dying so young and tragically. It is easy to understand why. Phoenix's outstanding performance sparkles in this movie and reminds us what a talent the world lost. In addition, the brilliant performances by the rest of the lead actors (Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland) make this movie a must-see for any person, especially teenagers. It is a glorious story that will make you laugh, cry, and sit back and remember what it was like to be young and determined to make your place in the world. One of the best movies ever made! Rob Reiner and Stephen King and all the actors have given us a wonderful gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly enjoyable masterpeice!","review":"Well acted, well adapted from the Stephen King novella, well shot, well written, well produced, and well directed + done.

It has been since I first saw it as a 10 year old boy. It was the first dvd I purchased back in 2001. Needless to say, I was excited to see the release of a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" at a local store. I snatched it up figuring it would be worth the $20 and was excited to check out any new features.What a bummer. The included booklet is a weak credit list. It offers no new insight into the making of the movie. The soundtrack is cut short from the original and the dvd is the same one released 5 years ago. I would've at least expected them to remaster at 5.1 surround but that wasn't even done. For a huge fan of the movie I felt really misled by the packaging and wish I would've checked here before I bought it. If you're looking to buy it, do yourself a favor and get the 2000 release and download the soundtrack for a $10 savings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio-CD used - Ashra - The Virgin Years","review":"The article reached me in the described condition (mint) with a nearly lightspeed shipping from the US to Germany ;).

And you can forget about storing a larger 'Lupah' type watch in this box, if you want to use the display pillows. Whoever designed this box obviously didn't take watch size into consideration.

Their new work isn't as great as the old stuff, but I still think it is a very nice produced work. I am glad they tried doing something different, but didn't really lose much of their previous sound. It is more rock, and that is how they intended it to be. A bit more political too? Anyway, it took me a while to get into this album, but after a few listens I was set. My favorites are Reminders, Ruin (really cratchy inbetween rock and electro :)), Stand Up (probably the most catchy dancey track on this album, it was also their single), and Delete (this one's so hard, but it's good). It's really a well rounded album I think, go check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't stomach this one","review":"What drew me to Stromkern was the electonics and the strings they used.

They ALL LOVE playing with this toy. The biggest problem is deciding to let them keep going around, or to let them cross the finish line and start over. This track is not any less durable than any other race track out there. And the fact that it is pink and motorized with lots of options for where to stop and what to do, keeps the kids entertained for a while. Sometimes they will make up their own design and others they just use the normal configuration. We highly recommend this toy to anyone looking for something ACTIVE for their little pink ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!!","review":"I have never written a bad review for a toy before but this one made me so frustrated, I just had to! This LOOKS like a lot of fun.... but the assembly directions are terrible (there even is one extra part). It took over an hour just to put this together. If you move it a centimeter, the whole thing falls apart (if you ever got it together in the first place). It is just junk... the pieces do not lock together so they literally are just sitting together.We also had a defective part in that one of the cars kept falling off the track and would not go.Also, the seller we bought it through (on Amazon) was Toysintexas. Their customer service was awful and basically refused to return the item even though it was clearly defective. Luckily, Amazon came through with their A-Z Guarantee and gave us a merchandise credit, otherwise we would have been out of luck.Don't buy this, no matter how fun it looks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and poor assembly instructions, buy my niece loves it...","review":"This thing is an exercise in frustration for my sister, who has to continually rebuild it. Now that my brother-in-law and I puzzled over the incomprehensible instructions for 4 hours on Christmas day... that's not too big a deal, but the first time, it was really awful. The factory sent this partially assembled, and one part was in backwards.... the instructions, mostly poorly drawn diagrams were no help. Because it was the \\"it\\" toy of the season, and my niece really loves it, we put up with it, but unless it is specifically requested by a child, I'd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs MAJOR improvements","review":"My daughter received this for Christmas and it looked like a cute concept. The problems started when we opened the box and realized the instructions (or lack of) was just a diagram where you had to figure out where to put the pieces. The track is very flimsy and the supports that come with it don't stay together.Once we got it together, my daughter had fun playing with it... but I had to keep putting tracks together and supports back in place because it kept coming apart as she played with it. She wasn't playing very rough with it, but it's just cheaply made.The little pieces are pretty much useless except for the little shopping bags that stick to the cars.It's a really cute concept but I wish they tracks were made alittle better!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME, MONEY AND AGGREVATION!","review":"I had read the negative reviews on this product but my daughter really wanted it for Christmas, so I bought it. I figured, like all Polly stuff, a little super glue would help keep it together and she could enjoy it. WRONG. We returned it the day after Christmas. All Polly stuff is flimsy and poorly made, but this is the worst of the evils. The buttons to launch the cars didn't even work. Save yourself the time and energy, and your child the frustration and DON'T BUY THIS TOY! Mattel should be ashamed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor engineering - flimsy - too many parts - instructions poor","review":"Yet another poorly designed toy. Extremely flimsy, pieces fit together very poorly causing car to stop mid-track or fail to pass through various gates and openings.

Pre-assembled parts work very poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 4 year old daughter loves this toy!","review":"We are so glad we bought this toy! My daughter loves cars but she is also very girlie. Our daughter has an older brother and has always been intrigued by his stuff, but not dare play with it. Now she finally has a race car set that is all her own and appeals to her girlie side as well.The track needs to be built by an adult to be assembled properly. It is simple enough to put together. It is not as sturdy as hot wheels track but it also hasn't fallen apart either. Its definitely a cool toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Just another reason to try to get my daughter not to play with Polly and her friends. The track takes for too long to put together, comes apart very easily, far too many parts for a simple track. Mall feature is within the tracks and unaccessable for any play. Overall design looks great, but not fun for her to play alone or with friends.It falls apart with the slightest movement and what child does not try to move their toys? Only value was in the cars, she likes them and would love to be able to buy more than the 2 that come with the track. She plays with the cars with her doll house and actually asked me to put the racetrack back in the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinsy construction, lots of work for adults, fun for kids","review":"Can't believe this cheap toy has become so expensive. My girls liked the idea of it, but the connectors were weak, so the track often fell apart mid-use. The motor that drove the \\"car escalator\\" was fairly loud, and talk about sexist - but that's another matter entirely.That said, we gave it away last year to another little girl who was thrilled to have it. And believe it or not, I kind of miss this toy - and putting it together time and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Returned","review":"This is the worst Christmas gift my kids have ever gotten.

Piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"We bought this last year for our 5 yr.olds Santa present. We could not get it to work. The idea is good- for girls.. But it is worthless and made my daughter cry because it would not stay together.Later this year we bought a Darda race track- for B-day present and to make up for the the dissapointment this one made... Easier to put together, (ask a ten year old to do it- us adults forget as we get older and instructions are confusing).. And actually works, without batteries. Even though it was not pink and purple, she loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating piece of JUNK!","review":"My daughter Pleaded for this toy last Christmas and received it from a family member. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to put together and STAY together.

They were SO excited about it (having seen the commercials of course) and they seem to like it but we (Mom and Dad) hate it.The pieces are flimsy, especially the track supports. Even the slightest bump will have the track pieces separating and the supports falling off. The escalator feature is fun for the most part, but again, if the set up is bumped it dislodges the drive mechanism and the escalator won't go.Needless to say, either Mom or Dad has to be nearby to re-set the pieces every two minutes.The teeny accessories are useless and the girls haven't even attempted to play with them.This toy is very cheaply made, and a big disappointment from a major toy manufacturer such as Mattel. It might be on your little girl's wishlist, but I'd steer clear of this one if I were you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage...","review":"So disappointed! My girls - 4 and 7 - were so excited about getting this toy but it's a piece of grabage!

It took my husband an hour to put it together, and the slightest movement makes the whole thing fall apart. You can't even turn it or the tracks separate and the pieces come crumbling down. My daughter (5 years) asked if she could play with it in the living room - so I tried to very carefully carry it - it was like starting over again.Honestly, I was not expecting a really high quality toy here, but it is horrible. I am considering throwing it in the box and sending it to Mattell.The \\"race\\" idea gets old after about 10 minutes and she just played with the Polly Pocket girls on her bed after that. So save your money and save yourself some aggrevation and just buy a little playset and some pink hotwheels.Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter's favorite toy","review":"I got this toy for my daughter this past Christmas and it is still her favorite toy. Some of the other reviews complain that the track falls apart as soon as you touch it. Obviously this is the first race track they have ever owned.

The ersatz soul-funk that made the first album such a guilty pleasure has been replaced by steely rock guitars (\\"Automatic Gun\\") and voyeuristic, off-kilter pop that ineffectively steals from new wave (\\"Love is Infectious\\"), Bowie (\\"Suburban Berlin\\") and even reggae! (\\"...Rhodesia\\") As usual, the musicianship and arrangements are superb but this is the sound of an unhappy and unsure band. The final track takes a slow piano coda from Erik Satie (something which would happen on the the next two albums to far better effect) and points the band to its future, but it doesn't rescue the overall collection from sounding forced and pouty. An obscure alternative indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understated but frightfully clever humor","review":"The cartoons in this book aren't the sort that tickle your funny bone with a tire iron.

One of Metallica's best albums!","review":"I cannot see why so many people dislike \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\". They are Metallica's best albums. Sure, they don't sound like \\"Master Of Puppets\\" or \\"And Justice For All\\", but you probably should have guessed that it would have to change sooner or later. Band's should mature and that's what Metallica has done. (\\"Load\\" and) \\"Reload\\" features some of Metallica's best material. Such as the raw power of \\"Fuel\\", the slick guitar riffs of \\"Slither\\", \\"Bad Seed\\", and \\"Attitude\\", and the somewhat anthemic \\"Prince Charming\\". Sellouts? I think not. So they finally have huge commercial success. What's wrong with that? Metallica can still blow any band out of the water today. \\"Reload\\" keeps that true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psh.....","review":"I still remember that, after the release of this album, I had the sneaking suspiscion that Metallica had run out of steam (thank God Garage Inc. and S&M; delayed those thoughts). I liked \\"Fuel\\", \\"The Unforgiven II\\", and \\"Fixxxer\\", but the rest are throwaways in my eyes. I mean, what the hell was up with the retarted moaning at the end of \\"The Memory Remains\\"? It would've been a halfway-decent song without it; the S&M; version definitely kills the one here.I can't really recommend this to anyone besides the diehard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing I miss about the 80's is Metallica","review":"In my opinion, its not about how heavy you are, or how fast and in perfect timing you keep with your bandmates, its about the reason you are doing it all for. Why your putting the thing together in the first place. I purchased this album with the intention of giving Metallica another chance after skipping several of their current releases. That said, it is obvious what this album is about. Commercial success (excuse me while I gag). What was Metallica initially about? Why were they so great throughout the 80s? Because it was being done for the kids. Money changes people, even the best people. Nothing rings truer with this band. And that said, I pose this question to you Jaymz, what about the kidz? Money and fame are a shallow substitute for perhaps the most important reason of all for playing in the first place: being a kid and sharing your greatness with other kidz. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Load Of Crap","review":"I like Metallica. As I've said before I consider myself an open-minded music fan, so therefore I am not afraid to say when albums and songs stink - even when they are done by artists I like.

Many claim that the album features good songwriting and originality and that if Metallica kept producing thrash albums they would get repetitive. This album is repetitive not only in and of itself(Reload, as in Load again), but features little diversion from mediocrity among its own songs. The only stand out song is the riling The Unforgiven II. Working off a theme from the Black album, a powerful and original song is composed that's surprisingly effective. The rest of the album is stale. Fuel is much weaker than it first appears and The Memory Remains, while creepy, isn't technical nor is it well-written. I liked Low Man's Lyric, but it isn't Metallica. If you look at this album as though it was released by another band, it shines a little, but like Load, reality tarnishes it heavily. Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING","review":"The transformation that surrounded James, Kirk, Lars and Newsted is something really amazing, something to be studied by scholars !! How a band changes direction so hardly and begin to being so commercial, is almost unbeliavable. I have nothing against trying new approaches, but Metallica later albuns are so heartless, formulatic, Kirk Hammett is playing his worst ever, Lars drums seems a machine, so boring it is. As for James, he still can write some of the best riffs around, but I think he's guarding them somewhere ....

This CD (the follow up to Load), continues to show Metallica's growth, while still remaining to their metal roots. Metallica will always be heavy metal, they just have the talent AND the guts to try new things with it. They can pull it off easily. Of course! Would you expect any thing less from them? So, to wrap it all up, you need to buy this album NOW or else your life will never be complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reload is worth buying!","review":"Reload from Metallica is a rock/h. metal CD which is almost THE BEST.

Sorry Metallica fans this record bores me to death..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but worth having","review":"Alot of people would say that Load was a disappointment but was still better than Reload. I would have to say that Reload is the better album, myself, though. Yes, I'll admit, I said that Reload was a shame on Metallica when I first heard the few songs that I heard on it, but my cousin told me that it was good if you actually listen to it, so I did and realized that it really was. Sure, it's not Master of Puppets, or any of their old hardcore stuff, but it's a great album and deserves it's credit. Besides, I really don't think you would want to create the same-old-same-old-style music, now, would you? Reload just happened to be something different. Give it a try, you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Horrible Cover, Good Music Though","review":"The only real complaint I have about Reload is that it wasn't sold as the second disc of a Load / Reload double cd. Not only would it have been more economical, it would have made more sense. Reload is another one that had to grow on me (more like it crept up on me). After Load, I was expecting the unexpected. I was not disappointed! Songs like \\"Fuel\\" \\"Bad Seed\\", \\"Devil's Dance\\", and \\"Better Than You\\" hit my eardrums like battering rams! \\"Unforgiven 2\\" and \\"the Memory Remains\\" got the radio airplay, without being total commercial garbage. My personal favorite was \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\". \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" is an odd little tune that comes across like Bob Dylan on ludes. \\"Slither\\", \\"Carpe Diem Baby\\", and \\"Fixxxer\\" were hard for me to get used to, but I did! \\"Prince Charming\\" and \\"Attitude\\" clanged around in my brain until I finally surrendered to their assault! All in all, a good, mixed box of weirdness and surprises..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternica Part Deux","review":"Although slightly better than Load (of...) it still lacks killer riffs, and speed, which is good, if you like The Cranberries. Not recommended if you like \\"Puppets\\" or \\"Justice\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than \\"Load\\"","review":"Although nothing near as good as the first three albums. For Re-Load, the Metallica boys stuck a bit closer to what they know- load, fast, in-your-face metal music. Fewer of the songs sounded overly experimental or out of place.Not to mention, I love Maryanne Faithful in \\"The Memory Remains.\\" I also think that \\"Fuel\\" is quite possibly one of the best songs for driving really fast to.This CD is a great addition to any Metallica fan's collection and complements many of the bands talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this album","review":"Metallica, or shall we say Bon Jovi, has betrayed a whole generation of metalliheads, by putting out a crappy album like RELOAD. It lacks passion, power, and it sounds like Rolling Stones... The biggest insult was when I heard \\"Attitude\\", a disgusting song, that shows how low the band, that was all about attitude, has fallen. This is the the album that someone is going to have on his cd rack together with Green Day, Bush and Fiona Apple.METALLICA SHOULD QUIT NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"it ok","review":"This cd doesnt totally suck, but its not great. I started out listening to the black album, which I thought was cool, but then I listened to the older stufff, and that kicked @$$! This and Load are too mellow compared to the old albums... but compared to some other crap that we hear on the radio, they're not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Metallica?","review":"Someone has definately kidnapped the Metallica of old because Reload is not them. Have they become extinct in metal and reborn in the lust of money? Fuel is the only song I can even say \\"eh\\" to. Not a bad song but give me a break. The only people that listen to them now are the top 40 idiots that will swallow anything the radio dishes out to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please, someone call 9-1-1!!! Stop the bleeding!!!","review":"No, not sell outs, just doing things different. And, doing them very bad. I thought Load was some kind of cruel, sick, bad joke... but, then there was this. And the nightmare continued. It's just not Metallica. Maybe it's a Samson and Delilah thing. If they grow their hair back, will they return to their hard rocking dominance? Can they ever regroup, literally, and claw their way back to the top where they used to be. \\"Fuel\\" is ok, Unforgiven II is preposterous and The Memory Remains is just wierd music.

If that's the way Metallica wants to go, fine, but i am not going to walk in their shadow and pick up the pieces of what was a great and talented band by buying their albums anymore. A shame that this happened, I would love to see them go back to their roots, MOP, Justice, and Lightning. I haven't listened to ANY Metallica since this CD came out, i guess we all grow up, except some just grow down. Again i must say, a shame that this had to happen, four years for Load, and nothing but pain and agony, and now insult to injury just piles on, I won't even get into Garage Inc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it all end this way?","review":"Do all bands wither away in time?This album sounds so empty compared to \\"The Black Album\\" and earlier titles...Listen to the songs...

The first time I listened to it, I liked it better than Load, which had some good points, I thought. This album is a little more raw, grimy, but less creative, perhaps. Then, I just stopped listening to it-- I felt a bit betrayed by the country(!) licks on Unforgiven II. There was a time when I wouldn't have given it anything better than 2 stars.However, I just finished listening to it from start to finish, for probably the first time ever. There are some questionable lyrics. There are too many YEEEAAAHs. But, I think for the most part, their new sound *works* here, and if a different band released this CD, they would've caught a lot less crap than MetallicA did for putting it out.For the record, I think Fixxxer is definately the best song on either Load or ReLoad-- Listen to it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica's the greatest of all time","review":"If anyone would happen to buy a CD, it would happen to be Metallica's Reload. It is the best CD I have ever listen to. There are two songs on the ReLoad CD that you ought to listen to. The two songs are \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Unforgiven II\\". Another good one is Memory Remains. Jason Newsted and Lars Ullrich do such a good job with their music with Metallica. Those are my favorite songs from Metallica's Reload, because they are the best songs I have ever listened to, and they rock so much! I hope Metallica goes on and makes a bigger name with themselves in the music business"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica is Awesome, and will be for years to come!","review":"Any CD that Metallica releases is awesome. I don't care if it is not as hard as their old stuff, it is still great. The two different types of music truely show how talented this band is.

Everything they release is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE cd made by a sell-out band.","review":"Since the famous ''Black Album'' Metallica has just going down the streets, they've forgoten how to make fast and agressive music as the same goes to how to make brilhiant guitar solos... nowadays Metallica turned to an almost POP band...

It's a shame..., F**k Metallica."},{"rating":"2","title":"...This Album Is GREAT!","review":"... This is one of greatest cds, definately a gem from Metallica. They don't come much better then this one. All of the songs are awesome, and this cd is great! People are saying that the album is bad filler, and Metallica were sell-outs for making this album and Load. Well people, just because you change your sound, it doesn't mean you're selling out. The album may have a much different feel than other works of Metallica, but it is still an awesome record. I am a true cd reviewer becuase I look at the album, and take it for what it IS. Not what it isn't, could have, or should have been. And I know this \\"ReLoad\\" IS a great album.1.Fuel 9.5/102.The Memory Remains 10/103.Devils Dance 8.5/104.The Unforgiven II 10/105.Better Than You 8.5/106.Slither 8.5/107.Carpe Diem Baby 9/108.Bad Seed 10/109.Where The Wild Things Are 7.5/1010.Prince Charming 9.5/1011.Low Man's Lyric 10/1012.Attitude 10/1013.Fixxxer 10+ + + +/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but only if you keep an open mind","review":"I liked this album better than \\"Load.\\" Granted, it bears little resemblance to Metallica's earlier, more popular stuff, but \\"Reload\\" is still a pretty good album. I think the backlash to the Loads partly lies in the fact that there were several years in between \\"Metallica\\" and \\"Load\\"; I suppose most people were expecting \\"Load\\" to be another \\"Metallica.\\" But if you keep an open mind, you will surely enjoy \\"Reload\\" at least a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this?","review":"This album seemed to be forced. It just wasn't them. They made songs like \\"One\\", \\"Fight fire w/ fire\\" and \\"Battery\\", then they make this poor excuse for a heavy metal album. By the way, I DO NOT CARE THAT THEY CHANGED THIER LOOKS! Just because a person gets thier hair cut and blah blah blah, doesn't mean a damn thing to me. Load was a good album, this is the weakest metal album I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is so good I though I'd review it again.","review":"Metallica was and still is the best band around. Whos to say that they must play \\"heavy metal\\"? Metallica has created thier own genre of music, call it...Metallica. Any band can come up with songs, but it takes a real band like Metallica to create songs that sound like no other song or band out there. For those of you without this CD, BUY IT! Fuel, Memory Remains, and Unforgiven 2 play on the radio, but I say all the songs have or had the potential to be a single. Slither, Prince Charming, Bad Seed, Attitude, and Low Mans Lyric is still pretty good stuff. Maybe some of you don't like this material, but in a recent interview on MTV's FANatic, James was asked what his favorite songs were. He said Fuel, Carpe Diem Baby, and Fixxxer. Those are 3 from Reload right there. Don't overlook this album, its one of thier best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The songs that weren't good enough for \\"Load\\"","review":"This album contains the songs that weren't considered good enough to be included on \\"Load\\". Whereas there were a couple of songs on \\"Load\\" that I thought were okay, I didn't like a single one of these.If you're new to Metallica, I recommend \\"Master Of Puppets\\" or \\"Ride The Lightning\\".I have to add though: does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get me started","review":"Ever had that feeling when you really like a band so much, you'll get the new album when it comes out and you're trying really hard to like it, making yourself think you do, but you wonder why it's so hard? That's exactly how I felt about Reload when I was 16. Young and stupid. Times change, and so do people, so if the late 90s were characterized by nu metal and alternative rock, that was your bait for corporate opportunities. Only after 3-4 years of obnoxious overplayed preppy alternative songs on the radio, especially off of this album, I decided to give up on Metallica and traded in all my CDs at the used record store. I still like to thrash all around and act like a maniac every once in a while, but I also appreciate some artistic value in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is worse than Load!!Too bad I had to give it a star!!!!","review":"This is an alternitive album. Where are the blistering riffs? Where are the thundering chords? Where has the Heavy Metal gone??? This was such a waste of my money!! When I think of the other CD's I could've bought it makes me cry!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This release is a joke!","review":"What happened to the days when you could listen to a Metallica cd over and over and it sounded as fresh the first time as the last i.e. Ride the Lightning, Master. This release is as week as Load! Metallica is rakin in on the profits from you and I the fans that are taking chances on garbage like this.Megadeth is where its at!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Face-It Alternica is not Metallica","review":"Ok some angry fans dash the new Metallica for not being \\"as heavy\\" but this is not the *real* reason we are so pissed off. The reason is that there is no musical value in the new music. Old hits like \\"Fade to Black\\" and \\"Sanatarium\\" were slow and on the softer side but didn't smell of trite pop garbage. Face it... although the Justice and Black album were *decent* I am still of the opinion that Metallica just isn't talented enough to write good songs without their cornerstone CLIFF BURTON. Metallica died with this man-- May Metallica and Cliff Rest in Peace and may God smite these imposters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"This album really, really sucks.It's a shame, because Metallica used to be cutting edge, unique, but with the last two releases they're now just like so many other ho-hum bands.Complacency, perhaps?My advice? Crank up Puppets and remember the good ol' days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I listened to it once and thought that it was garbage. I thought to myself, \\"Well, maybe that's not fair. Perhaps I should listen a few more times before passing such a harsh judgement.\\" So I listened a couple more times and decided that my first impression was spot on. The CD is not worth the money that I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this album ZERO stars, I would","review":"Metallica has become a dim shadow of their former self. Yes, yes, I've heard all of the talk about musical maturity, however, Metallica has lost any edge they once had. Honestly, I doubt they'll ever regain it. Unforgiven 2 may be the saddest blow of all, revisiting and revising a truly great track, and turning it into something that the Metallica of old would have snubbed from b-side status. Hetfield has gone the way of the almighty dollar, and the only unforgiven sin is this last and worthless album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second biggest dissapointment in music history...","review":"The only worse dissapointment was their previous album, \\"Load,\\" but that was a better album than this piece of garbage. A person who likes this CD is one who is very inexperienced in music, I've noticed this many times. Take a look at what we have here: James' quickly worsening voice, terrible song and sound production, solos that are NEVER unique, the same bluesy type riffs in every song, and NO emotion in any of the songs. They got all the money they need from \\"the black album,\\" so why the hell don't they just stop writing music? They've already ruined their legendary status and are wasting our time (us being the fans that were with them from the beginning)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-hearted.","review":"The problem with this album is that it meanders from first to last track without doing much. \\"Fuel\\" is hardly the heavy headbanger the unschooled in metal make it out to be. The main riff is 2 notes, and James sounds uninspired. I find that people still call Metallica a \\"heavy metal\\" band is laughable. These are the same people who can't stand bands like Iced Earth or Blind Guardian, who are leading the new wave of metal, because they're \\"too heavy.\\" Heavy metal should blow you away. No matter how loud I turn up this album, it still doesn't blow me away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica tops themselves","review":"Yes, Metallica does the impossible. They release an album that sucks even worse than Load did. Have they totally run out of ideas? What's next, Sanitarium part eight? Master of Puppets part nine (The Master Takes Manhattan)? I guess the creativity well just ran dry. Geez, next thing you know they're gonna do covers of old Bob Seeger songs (Oh, wait...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the deal Metallica?","review":"I've been listening to thrash and speed metal for a long time now and this is Metallica's worst album. It's as if they took all their old fans, told them to get lost, and got alternative fans! I tried to listen to it with an open mind but it still sucks no matter what. James Hetfield lost his growl and some of the guitar riffs sound like country! What's more, Kirk Hamett's guitar solos are horrible! Metallica really lost their touch with this one. I doubt they will ever be able to put out a good album again. If you really liked Lightning, Puppets etc., I doubt you will like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know what you positive folks are talking about","review":"This album is not only a let down for Metallica fans, its a let down for music in general. I have been a Metallica for many many years and this is obviously the worst, even worse than Load, which at least had a couple decent tunes. Its a bad album by music standards as well, I put it right up there with Gruntruck's wreck of a first album. The album is unlistenable too. St. Anger is ok, at least they are raw and aggressive like the old days in the music. Reload is just plain Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not soft, it just sucks!","review":"My problem with this album is not that musically it's not as heavy as Master of Puppets, it oblivously isn't and wasn't intended to be. Everyone that whines about Metallica's new musical direction, well, I might agree the new music isn't as good as their clasic stuff, but if you can't deal with that then don't whine about it, just listen to their old stuff and stop buying new Metallica. That said, they can still make good music: I absoutely loved Load. I judge an album by how many great songs there are and Load definitely had it's share, so Metallica can still rock even post-Puppets. The problem is that Reload really is all the stuff (barring the great song The Memory Remains) that wasn't good enough to be included on Load. I still think Metallica is great band, they just made a horrible album. If you like Metallica you'll probably still buy this, but if you are new to the band, buy all their other stuff and spare yourself the horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did Metallica cut their hair and change the music pace?\`","review":"IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY THEY CUT THEIR HAIR!

This, in my opinion, is not Metallica. Whilst the 'Black Album' changed Metallica's standing within the genre, it still echoed their musical brilliance. This, however, does not bare considering. 'Load' was pretty appalling in comparison to the afore mentioned album, but this, I feel, has lowered the standards. There are people that will testify that this is creativity, and that fans of early Metallica cannot handle this. I believe the real truth is that we do indeed recognise that this is a change of direction, it is just that it is not very good; awful in fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica should \\"Re-Load\\" itself!","review":"The term of \\"shallowness\\" is the best way to describe this album. There isn't much more that I can say about this. I couldn't catch anything while listening this cr@p called \\"load/reload\\". The main reason is that this album doesn't have any musical direction. The overall sum of the songs on this album is Zero.After buying \\"reload\\" (Big Mistake) after listening to it for 2-3 times I throwed it away and returned to my pre-Black collection.For me \\"Justice for All\\" was Metallica's last real record. The following titles simply don't mean anything to me.I rate Metallica albums as follow:#1- Master of Puppets #2- Ride the Lightning #3- And Justice for All #4- Kill'em All -------------------------------------"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WORST Metallica Album","review":"Load comes in at a close second though. After doing the Black Album, metallica suddenly decided that they weren't going to work as hard at making quality music, the results are albums such as this one and it's predecessor, \\"Load.\\" There are a few okay songs on the album. 'Fuel' is real good, 'Unforgiven II' is okay, and 'The Memory Remains' is borderline. If you want a basic, heavy kind of rock album, then buy this one, or maybe 'Load.' If you want high quality, well thought out songs, get any metallica album of the pre-Load (1983-1996) era. My personal recommendation is \\"And Justice for All,\\" all the others are equally excellent. Get it together Metallica and put out some QUALITY music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember Master of Puppets?","review":"This isn't Metallica, these are evil clones who are here to make one hit wonders like the Spice Girls, BSB, and Savage Garden look good. ...And Justice for all this isn't. \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" is the only halfway decent song on the album (which is odd because it goes at 3mph). Even \\"Load\\", their other sellout album, had 2 great Metalla-esque songs that kept hope alive for great music (\\"Hero of the Day\\" and \\"King Nothing\\"), but now this album has killed them.

The lyrics are also more intellogent than ever before--one more reason no rock fan should be caught without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Get Over It!","review":"Ifind it hard to believe that people would start to dislike Metallica because they decided to grow in their musical styles and tastes. After awhile, a band becomes stale and plain if they don't do anything new with themselves. On Load, ReLoad, and Garage Inc, Metallica proves that they are a band with depth and originality, often times sounding completely unlike their older selves; and, people, this is GOOD. A band shouldn't keep the same sound forever; I mean, The Beatles weren't exactly singing \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" in 1967, were they? Change is good, people. Change shows talent. Learn to live with it, and even enjoy it! Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound quality, same style as Load","review":"Songs from this album and Load were all written during the same period of time, thus have similar style. Some killer cuts on this one are Devils Dance and Fuel. Unforgiven2 is kind of a low point. Doesn't really match up to the original unforgiven. Fixxxer is somewhat of a continuation of the Outlaw Torn. Really good as well. If you liked Load, you'll like this one. If you hate this album, find something more productive to do than complain about it hoping Metallica will answer your prayers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not another one!","review":"I heard Load and I thought it was bad and then I heard this! This cd just plain sucks! I wouldn't use it for a cup holster. Don't get me wrong, I like Metallica and I have all their good music but give me a break. I think all they are doing is just selling their name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Something Else","review":"This album has let me down and Metallica are bastards. Do not buy this CD!!!! I know that this may not get posted as it breaks the rules but DON'T LET FUEL TRICK YOU!!!! The album opens up with Fuel and that IS a good song, one of the best metal songs that I have ever heard. But the rest? They're not brilliant. Prince Charming tends to grow on you a bit, as do most of the songs, but if your compare this to something like Nevermind by Nirvana, Bone To Pick by the Gone Jackals, Live After Death by Iron Maiden, or indeed, all the other Metallica albums, you'll be sorely disappointed. Get one the other albums I mentioned. Now? Well, now I'm off to buy Metallica (oddly enough, by Metallica) and take Re-Load back. Just see if you can get an MP3 of Fuel or something, as that song IS good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone, never has been.","review":"Metallica have time and time again done what they wanted when they wanted. Why stop now? Sure they sell every seat in the house when they come to town. This CD is the perfect exapmle of why that is so. It has the same attitude, guts, and a sheer in-your-face edge that many longtime Metallica fans (if they are true fans) have come to know and will appreciate and understand. Just because their sound changes, that doesn't mean that they have. Tracks like Bad Seed, Fuel, and Devil's Dance are laden with hooks that ensnare the listener. Being the yang to Load's yin, ReLoad is from the same general direction as its predecessor. It's okay that their new sound has made many longtime fans cry foul and abandon these metal juggernauts; Metallica were never out to please everyone, anyway. They just wanted to play, and if you're along for the ride, that was cool. They're just doing what they want when they want. There's nothing wrong with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"RELOAD...","review":"Reload. That's exactly what Metallica needs to do. These days, one of the greatest bands of all time sounds as if they are on drugs. Perhaps they should change their name to \\"METHallica.\\" I put this on par with Load, which means this one triple bogeys the hole. I have an idea: run out, buy some sandpaper, and rub this CD down. You'll end up with a $15 coaster, but it sure beats listening to it. I never said this before, but they've not only lost a fan, they've SOLD OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish you could give negative ratings","review":"Oh boy, here we go again. This album is marginally better than Load, and really stinks to high heaven if your a fan of their real music, but, like most other real fans, it doesn't stop us from buying the albums. I'm sick and tired of this ****, the past 3 albums have been nothing but commercialized, self-serving... I guess buying each new album thinking maybe it will kick *** again is stupid, actually i know its stupid after listening to this. When I first listened to this with my friends, we laughed at most of the lyrics. There's no emotion, no speed, and worst of all, not a drop of metal in this entire album. I think I could walk up to James and smack him, and he'd play a country riff and sing \\"yeah, yeah!\\" instead of fighting back. This band is very close to losing a real fan. Luckily, the old **** still kicks ***."},{"rating":"1","title":"And now they will suck forever!!!!!!","review":"This is the worst album that I will not listen in my life! This guys should change the bands name to \\"Sissylica\\". In case you don't know, Metallica's last album as a band was \\"..and justice for all\\".

With phrases like \\"Be not afraid\\" it's no wonder this album sucks. Ok, \\"Fuel\\" what the hell is this song, all it does is describe how fuel works in an engine, HOW IS THIS A SONG??? \\"The Memory Remains\\" this is a song about NOTHING, they just took a bunch of words that rhymed that mean nothing together. \\"Unfogiven II\\"? WHAT?!?!?!? a sequil to a freakin' song? this just proves metallica is using the success of previous songs to their moneymaking advantage. \\"Better than you\\" no, I don't think so, I still haven't sold out. If you agree with me try some good bands like Samael, Black Sababth, Pantera, Fear Factory, Type O Negative etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh terrible!","review":"Metallica has not made a good album since And Justice For All. Even the Black Album has a few forgettable songs and those are becoming more and more prominent in each subsequent album. Master of Puppets is my benchmark and they have fallen far from that peak. Load is just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not the very worst of metallica but pretty darn close","review":"Let me just say this album is on the very edge of not worth having. King Nothing is about the only descent song on here. Unforgiven 2 is junk in comparison to the great song unforgiven was on their Black album. there might be one more descent song on the album i forgot to mention. I might go to a pawn shop and by a 3 dollar copy just to see what i missed the off the first time i bought it but from what i remember this album was a true sellout metallica disapointment. I'm sorry James and Lars if you hate me for saying this but THE TRUTH HURTS, and if you hate me then too bad Cliff defenitely don't hate me cause i praised your band back when you played your true style. If you ever get out of this new age conforming junky sound then i will consider you a worthy band like i once did when i considered you my favorite band of all time Like i did back when you were true to Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Not as good as Metallicas other albums but not bad! People say this is a bad Metallica album but its not. Yes I know ts not the \\"Black Album\\", or \\"....And Justice For All\\" but this is a great album. with songs like \\"Fuel\\", \\"The Memory Remains\\", \\"Devils Dance\\", \\"The Unforgiven II\\" and \\"Attatude\\" how could you not like this album! The rest of the songs on the album are all right but these are the true gems! This is not for fans of the 'Trash' Metallica. But if you want a great Hard Rock album, then this is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ain't Right...","review":"So, Metallica tried somthing new, and they called sell-outs. However, they did not sell out, they got old. And, in some cases that can be just as bad. Re-Load has two good songs on it. Fuel and Memory Remains. What is really eerie, is the Re-Load and Load, are Metallica's version of GNR's Use Your Illusion albums. Ballads laiden with riffs from hell. As I said Garage Inc. This sore thumb of an album signifies the loosning of Metallica's unearthly hold of this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"fuel is the best","review":"i simply cannot believe that people dont like this album...i love it. fuel is one of the best metallica songs ever. ill admit that this album doesnt compare to the black album, but it is great. just remember, hair does make music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly more popular than LOAD","review":"But only AS good!Tracks like Low Man's Lyric continue in the change of attitued which was dominant in Load whereas Fuel and Unforgiven II (favorite on the album) show the band still clinging to their roots. If you were not a fan of Load (as many of you clearly were not) then there isn't much point in buying this. However, if, like me, you accepted the pace change and appreciated the aforementioned album then this should be ideal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Load, seriously underrated","review":"Although against popular belief, this is actually a pretty darn good album. To those that hate this, did you even listen to the whole thing? Fuel, Unforgiven II, Devil's Dance, Prince Charming, and Attitude are all great tracks. Sure, it has it's oddities, like Low Man's Lyric, but overall it's a great CD. Not for those looking for the good old Metal, but although it's different dosen't mean it's bad. If you're a starting Metallica fan, get something else, like Master of Puppets."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very recent Metallica fan","review":"In just the last 18 months I have become a HUGE Metallica fan. One of the reasons is this album. Reload at times sounds like its predecessor Load, but overall it is a very different album in style and sound. Both albums are great. Hetfield's voice on cuts like Fuel, Where the Wild Things Are, and Devil's Dance reaches out and grabs you by the throat. Hammet's solos and Ulrich's drumming are superb. This album is very different from the Black Album, but both are great in their own individual way. The word I think of when I listen to Metallica is VISCERAL...their music reaches in and pulls out your guts! If you like rock music with cognitive style but also a backbone of steel, Reload, Load, and the Black Album are for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened on this one guys.","review":"Ok....i have Been A Hardcore Metallica fan since 1987.Everything that they have released Ive liked, Even Load.I tried my hardest to like this album but just couldnt.I forced Myself to listen to it Hoping it would grow on me...but it just didnt.Although the album has 4 good songs on it they are \\"Unforgiven 2\\",\\"Low Mans Lyric\\",\\"Fuel\\" and what I consider the best track on the album\\"Fixxer\\"It just doesnt hold up to there past albums,Its like this is the album they put together from stuff thaT they had thrown away in the black album and load sessions.Dont get me wrong though...I still have Much respect for Metallica and I support them Not matter what they did.Im Looking forward to there next Album \\"St.Anger\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rock Gods Remain","review":"Metallica is still the greatest band in the world today. This album proves their ability to totally rock in different styles. It's obvious that the fans who say that Metallica's \\"sold out\\" don't really care for their artistry. \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" are just a chance for Metallica to play music that influenced them, like Hetfield being a Waylon Jennings fan, and Hammett learning everything he knew about the guitar from blues-rock guitarist Joe Satriani. With songs like \\"The Memory Remains\\", \\"The Unforgiven II\\", \\"Bad Seed\\", \\"Fuel\\", \\"Attitude\\", and \\"Low Man's Lyric\\", this album is a MUST for any TRUE Metallica fan!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I GIVE THEM A GREAT RE-VIEW","review":"My favorite song is Prince Charming.

An A or A+ album","review":"I thought this was a great album. Though it isnt as heavy metal-thrash music that long time Metallica fans have been used to over the years, Metallica is still rockin. People werent very pleased with Load but I think ReLoad is a very Metallica-like album. Definatly Black Album material. Although some self proclaimed True Metallica fans dont care for ReLoad, it just shows that they are not true fans after all. Any real fan would be open to any changes that a band decided to make. I wasnt very happy with Load myself but I still went out and bought ReLoad the day it came out and I was very plaesed. I thought WOW, this is a real bounce back from Load. I am very proud of this album. I have been a fan since the 1983 debut Kill em All and as of the release of this album, I still am. Best songs- Fixxer, Fuel, Slither, Memory Remains, Unforgiven II"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Metallica get soft!","review":"Okay, when I say they get soft, they are never the less harder then many other groups. But for a Metallica CD Reload is very soft. Metallica started with Speed-Metal in 1983 and have developed to a very good blues-rock band. The songs on Reload are slower and more melodic than the ones on Load. In some songs you even find country elements. Hardcore Metallica-fans maybe don't like this sound but I'm happy that Metallica dare something with their new album and don't delivre the same as last time. If you buy Reload you won't regret it.(I'm sorry for my bad English!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"more crap","review":"Just when you think Metallica couldn't find a new way to cover up how much they suck, they do. Let's see; put out a double disc of covers and something that was already released, then we could have a symphony behind us, then we could jump on the Alternative band wagon. What can we do now? Lets release the crap that wasn't good enough to put on our last album! Yeah! Our fans will put out money on anything that falls out of our back end! This is why I stopped being a fan a long time ago and have since sold everything I owned that was Metallica. It's sad when all a band wants to do is make money and not care about the product they put before the fans. I wasn't fooled by this. After the black album, they should've quit because what made this a great band left a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me poo give me fire hey let's light a turd on fire.oooh","review":"This album is ::Expletive deleted::.

Maybe St Anger is the feeling that most die-hard fans have.I never even listened to this but just listened to what others were saying about it. Rubbish.The main reason I wrote this review is because these guy's are like Christianity. At first there was a lot to believe in. Now the people are standing up and saying wait a minute there is nothing to believe in. False idols. Just think how these guys would have been etched in the history of Rock had they stopped after the Black Album.

The last decent album was the Black Album, Load was alright. This one was a dud. Only a couple of songs that really showed any origionality. They go for the classic rock feel, which is fine, but they suck at it. The one thing I will give them is trying to be different, but there doing it in a mainstream way, which is not different. When this album came out I kissed goodbye to the Master of Puppets days.Kirt Hammet's solos have always been uninspiring, but there even uninspiring to fans of metallica on this album, which is alot to say. Hetfield grabs E F E F by the throat and really doesn't come up with but a couple of new interesting riffs. Lars, is, well, hitting the drum as he always had. The bass player is alright, but no Cliff Burton is he."},{"rating":"2","title":"RELOAD the METALLICA","review":"well this isn't master of puppets or ride the lightning or any of those great albums of theirs from the 80's but its a lot more than i expected when i bought this. maybe better than load or even the black album, which I'm not too big a fan of. very strong album and good except maybe for low mans lyric. i suggest buying this one, if you like metallica, at least their 90s music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"I posted a review calling \\"load\\" the worst Heavy Metal record ever recorded.I have to take that back because this one is worse.Not one song on this record will go down as a Metallica Classic, (but that is to be expected as they have not written any classic songs since And Justice for All)and not unlike the joke of an albumn \\"Load\\"... not one good song.I hope one day Metallica will see the error of their ways and Give Metallica back to the People who made them.Dont waste your Money on this or any Metallica CD after ...And Justice for all...not because of the Napster thing...but because they just arent any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallidud is more like it","review":"After I listened to Load (which came out in '96) I thought that they were going into a more slower paced and more relaxing style of music, for their later career. When I heard about Reload I thought it would be another CD like Load. I was devistated on how much this album [stunk]. Im not joking, this album is a piece of Horse ... I cant believe that Metallica, the greatest rock band on the planet could actually bring them selves to this garbage. This is by far the worst CD that I have ever attemped to listen to by Metallica. I strongly suggest that you do not buy this worthless [stuff]. If you want heavy metal metallica, I suggest you start off with RIDE THE LIGHTNING or MASTER OF PUPPETS. If you are looking for a softer side of Metallica you should maybe get THE BLACK ALBUM or LOAD (preferably the Black album)."},{"rating":"1","title":"METALICA SHOULD HAVE RETIRED AFTER THE BLACK ALBUM!!!!","review":"Metallica went from bad (Load) to really bad (Reload) to just plain awful (St. Anger).METALICA SHOULD HAVE RETIRED AFTER THE BLACK ALBUM!!!!James Hetfield began to sound as if he had blown out his vocal cords back in 1991.Between them suing their fans or listening to Lars big mouth or the band just plain old selling out they lost me as a fan.I used to have every Metallica album on tape and then on CD and I was listening to them when it wasn't cool to be a Metallica fan.These guys used to rock but now they just rely on their name to sucker people into buying their albums.Don't buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound of Diarrhea","review":"Do not buy Load/Reload/St. Anger if you're a metal fan.

This album is definately not metallica at their finest, yea it did have a few hits, Fuel, The Memory Remains, The Unforgiven II, these are all great summer songs, but they are not the Metallica songs your used to hearing, some songs like Fuel and Better Than You are speeding but lack that of the METAL attitude. If you like slow songs, there are a couple good ones on here, Low Man's Lyric and The Unforgiven II, but dont forget that this isnt a METAL album, its alternative. I dot know why METALLICA went this way but i believe its mainly the fault of that fat ass Bob Rock. Im sure James, Jason, Lars and Kirk arent especially pleased with the outcome of this album and the peoples responses. Then again, it does have the METALLICA label on it so again, I give it four stars.........not their best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really disappointed.","review":"Advice to buyers: I am sure that You should not buy this album!

This song ruined a great music from their best disc ever. Shame upon Metallica for doing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and lacking creativity!","review":"First of all, I don't think of Metallica of a band that has sold out. However, when you are as one dimensional as Metallica is, eventually your creativity if gone. \\"Load\\" had its moments, but \\"Reload\\" is bad. The best song is \\"Low Man's Lyric\\". There are several songs that have cool parts, but nothing on this cd is what I would call a Metallica classic. Compare: Ride The Lightning has probably 5 classics out of 8. Master Of Puppets has 8 for 8. AJ4A has 2 or 3 for 9. Black Album has 6 out of 12. Load 3 for 14. Reload bats .000. Like I said before, this is a one dimensional band and you can only do the same thing over and over for so long. Metallica is smart though, 'cause they realize that is what sell. Examples of this include AC/DC and Aerosmith."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Apology.","review":"I really like Reload, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. This album rocks, and reminds me of a heavier version of AC/DC. I really like the faster rockers here and prefer them over the more experimental songs. I'll put them into three catagories.Favorites: Devil's Dance, Better Than You, Carpe Diem Baby, Wild Things, Prince Charming, and Fixxxer-my personal favorite on Reload(LOVE IT!).Pretty Good: Fuel, Memory Remains (press skip at the 3:30 mark), Slither, Bad Seed, Attitude.Okay, but don't do anything for me personally: Unforgiven II, Low Man's Lyric.This CD has plenty of heavy riffing and is well produced. I listen to it often. It took me longer to get into Load, but I like that almost as well now, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallica's worst album","review":"There are about 4 decent songs here, none of them really great.

They have put out some of the most memorable metal of the 80's through 1991. Load completely left me out in the cold. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard it. How could they do it?! What utter garbage. Reload wasn't much better. It's just a heavy version of Load, nothing more. To be honest, some of the songs were okay. I personally thought Fuel was decent but I think \\"Where the Wild Things are\\" is the best track on the entire album (strictly my opinion). Overall, the album is a dud from beginning to end, showing little of the musical finesse and power that is evident in their previous works. Fortunately, I haven't bought this album or Load. I borrowed it from a friend first. I wasn't going to waste money on something that could be a major disappointment. Turns out I was right. I think I'll wait until they get their collective act together before I buy any new original material from them. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh joy!","review":"How generous of James and Lars to give us a CD comprised of songs that weren't good enough to make it onto the original \\"Load\\".

I used to LOVE Metallica, I mean, it was scary! I bought all of their import CD's, T-shirts, bumper stickers, you name it, I had it! Now, about the music...it sucks! Slow, boring rifs that have no real character or originality & vocals that show that Jamie isn't really concerned with sounding sincere or angry.

I remember SO many fans commenting how let down they were when this disc first came out. It's not so terrible,it's just nothing to get all tanked up about. Some of the tracks here,I thought were okay,are \\"The Memory Remains\\" (love the video where Marianne Faithfull makes an appearance-now THAT'S semi-original),\\"The Unforgiven II\\",the melodic \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" and \\"Bad Seed\\". Not the worst metal release I've ever heard,by any means. Take my advise,buy a used copy of this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not metal...then what is it?","review":"This is not metal. This is hard rock. YES there is a difference. But I like the new sound. This cd has some good songs on it like Fuel, which starts fast and has some cool lyrics. The Memmory Remains is good too but not as good as Fuel. James' voice sounds higher at the beginning, it takes him a while to get in the groove, and it's not really set up to be a great vocal. And whats with the \\"na na na na na\\" THATS NOT JAMES!!!!!! The Unforgiven II is definitely the high point on this cd. Great lyrics and great tune. Follows up The Unforgiven I perfectly. Attitude is one of the heaviest thats another high point, and Devil's Dance isn't too bad. Overall, I think this cd is underrated and doesn't get the credit it deserves.

Only a few songs such as Fixxer, Where the Wild Things Are, and Better Than You are likable. Unforgiven 2 is decent, but way too repetitive. And where are the guitar solos man? What the f#@%!!!!

Thats the way metal is supposed to be. 80s metal will always rule, and saying that I will continue to listen to underground 90s metal, not the 'popular' metal like this type of Metallica, or Korn(#@!!#*).... but you do have to admit.. if a band can change their style and still sell, then they must be something to notice.... I think Metallica is a great band, but they just dont make the music I listen to anymore"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LYRICS??","review":"what happened to the music? the lyrics? the guitar rising above all with a solo that brings tears to your eyes? all is lost, for what, for this??? metallica PLEASE stop this crap! i'm a metallica fun, i must say i won't stay one if another reload comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for not changing band's name+1 star for effort=2stars","review":"Not their best.I'd say their worst.I wish I never bought and listened to this piece of ALTERNICA.I guess their next one will sound like BACKSTREETBOYS or something, what a pitty, they were so great...(METALLICA, I mean)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened??","review":"After first hearing \\"until it sleeps\\", the first single off load, I didnt' really have a clue metallica went down hill. But then I heard Load, and Reload (uncreative name too,) and nearly burst into tears. What happened guys?? I gave this album 2 stars because it's a helluva lot better that that other s**t they play on mtv (and the radio, for that matter), but that is not saying much. They took out everything that made the old metallica good. AND THEY WON A DAMN GRAMMY FOR IT????? Just goes to show you were mainstream music is headed- only one band deserved an award (ok 2, if you count manson, and even HE's gone down hill) and that is RAMMSTEIN. It's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"METALLICA NEEDS TO PULL THIER HEAD OUT OF THIER - - - ES","review":"I ONLY HAVE ONE COMMENT TO MAKE ON THIS ALBUM. METALLICA PUT OUT A GREAT ALBUM A FEW YEARS AGO WITH METALLICA \\"BLACK\\" OR \\"SUBTITLED\\"WHATEVER IT WAS CALLED. THEY HAD GREAT SONGS SUCH AS SAD BUT TRUE, WHEREVER I MAY ROAM, NOTHING ELSE MATTERS, MYFRIEND OF MISERY AND SO ON, OH AND I FORGOT UNFORGIVEN. I DIDN'T FORGET IT I JUST WISH THE BAND WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN TO REMAKE IT, THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE TO RUIN A GREAT SONG LIKE THAT. WELL THAT REMAKE IS MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT BESIDES THE ENTIRE ALBUM OF \\"RELOAD\\" AND LETS NOT FORGET THAT PITTIFUL EXCUSE OF AN ALBUM \\"LOAD\\". HOPEFULLY \\"GARAGE INC.\\" BRINGS THEM BACK TO RULING AND AWAY FROM SUCKING!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at the running time","review":"Roughly half of these songs are good to terrific. (\\"Unforgiven II\\" is way, way up there. The first one was clearly for practice.) They comprise 30-40 minutes of very enjoyable music. In ye olden days, that's how long an \\"LP\\" ran. So consider the other half-hour of less compelling stuff on here to be a bunch of B-sides thrown in for free and stop your bitching already."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could anyone say this is no good?!?!","review":"First off I am a huge metallica fan of the old days and I still believe Master of Pupetts and Ride the Lightning still rule metal but that does not mean there is no room for an album like REload. This album is alot simpler than any other album metallica has done even when compared to load. It is just a compilation of great enjoyable songs with the almighty metallica feel to it. REload is not for people that like to bang their heads against walls when listening to music, it is for the people that approach music with an open mind and enjoy the music for all its worth. The Unforgiven 2 which is track 4 on this album is timeless and a great song all round. Dont listen to all this hype surrounding metallica just buy this ablum! Isn't anyone starting to catch on that people are always TRYING to find a reason to hate metallica. They are the BEST BAND IN THE WORLD PERIOD! I will end it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album....I'm a Metallica fan, what did u expect!","review":"I am not in the camp that believes that Metallica sold out, but I am not that crazy about some of their new, more mellow music. I enjoyed this album. \\"Fuel\\", \\"The Memory Remains\\", \\"Devil's Dance\\", \\"The Unforgiven 2\\", \\"Better Than You\\", \\"Carpe Diem Baby\\", and \\"Prince Charming\\" are songs that I love. The rest of the album is just ok. Not a must have, but worth picking up for the true Metallica fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Metallica album !","review":"Metallica WAS my favourite band .That is until the released the LOAD, RELOAD series! If I could ,I would give a different name on the bands name on their two last \\"junk \\" albums.Is not the fact that the music is not good.Is simply not a Metallica sound.Its softer , lighter , with less and less meaning (deep meaning)From their oldest albums like \\"master of puppets \\" or \\"ride the lightning\\" Metallica had created a legend , a status , and now they are just trying to destroy it by creating this kind of mixted up -confused -meaningless -with no grace albums.If I was a member of the band and I would like to continue produce records , I would change the name from Metallica to something else.Its a Sin to use the same name on these LOAD RELOAD stuff.For regular bands this would be a great album.For metallica Its way below medium, and way out of track.If you are a real fan of Metallica , dont buy anything having the word \\"load\\" or\\"reload \\" on it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster and Uninspired","review":"Whether or not Metallica sold out following \\"...And Justice for All\\" is debatable, but the fact of the matter is that this group no longer has the fire that drove them to produce their brilliant earlier works. Reload is the emobodiment of Metallica's newfound complacency. They don't push that extra ten percent, and it shows in the bland rythm sections and inconsequential lyrics. Metallica must have got bitten by the alt rock bug pretty badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb driving rock!","review":"This cd gets slated all the time, i can understand why, and i wouldn't recommend any early metallica fan to buy it. Metallica were stadium rock cheese, although awesome songwriters the content was only ever going to appeal to...how can i put this? Halfwits including me ha ha! Look at reload from the point of view of being a debut album from an unknown band, everyone would be raving about them! I certainly was it has some kind of coolness to it, like getting in your car on a hot summers day and putting your shades on type thing! Fuel really does make you drive faster and harder!. Jaymz voice sounds more accomplished and matured, while the group as a whole are as tight as ever. If you drive a lot in the heat buy it ha ha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bland but the well known songs rock.","review":"This is albums starts out with about 3 or 4 really cool songs but then goes downhill from there.The only good songs on it are the ones they play on the radio.And Unforgiven 2 was never a big hit because it SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!I think this is a waste of money to buy an album with only 3 or 4 decent songs.What happened to making great albums like Master Of Puppets,And Justice For All and The Black Album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Metallica's best albums for their unconventional fans","review":"This album is one my fav Metallica albums. not only metallica finally broke the \\"trash rock\\" sterotype, but at the same time proved that they can be musicians as well as a heavy metal band.To enjoy this album, most of all you need a good music system to hear each sound, and comperhand the lyrics. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!! Dont care what anyone says about this album.","review":"My favortite metallica album, has my favorite solos, lyrics, and Metallica is on the cover why wouldnt u want it. The solos are amazing and thoughtfull on this cd, Kirk Hammett is GOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE SUB-PAR MATERIAL FROM METALLICA","review":"THIS ALBUM DELIVERS MORE OF THE SAME SUB-PAR MATERIAL THAT WAS ON ''LOAD''. LIKE ''LOAD'', THE ALBUM STARTS OFF WELL. BUT, AFTER ABOUT THE FIRST 6 TRACKS OR SO, THE ALBUM JUST LOSES MUCH OF ITS EXCITEMENT. THIS IS METALLICA'S LOWEST ALBUM TO DATE. ''FUEL'' SURE DOES ROCK, THOUGH."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Hetfield is the garth of the cool generation","review":"Jaymz is the biggest hero ever, gotta love his b-bender souped up telecaster, its blues based geetar at its redneck best, if only songs like disposable heros or creeping death were written in this way, its like too heavy the other way man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll spell it out for you","review":"................SELL-OUTS................... Don't buy this cd these people don't know what there talking about. As is apparent by the cds they buy: Megadeath, Korn, Nirvana(no taste here) and tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as always","review":"Metallica has done it again! For fans, this is definitely worth owning. Killer drums by Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield kicks on guitar. Check out songs 1 and 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Because it is the lowest available","review":"I don't think Metallica should use the prefix \\"Metal\\" in their name anymore. This is more like \\"Grungtalica\\" or worse \\"Post-Grungetalica\\" or the more popular title \\"Alternica.\\" This title is not even metal, with the exception of the only good song \\"Fuel.\\" If you want to get a good metal/thrash album, get Metallica's first four albums. If you really want something from the \\"nineties,\\" get Countdown to Extinction by Megadeth or get the Pantera albums. Even the Iron maiden albums with Blaze Bayle are ten times better than this garbage. Just do yourself a favor and do NOT get this album. If you really want Fuel, buy it on I-tunes or download it or something, just don't buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica has matured, but they can still kick some @$$","review":"Anyone who is familiar with Metallica's earlier recordings can tell that the band has been through somewhat of a metamorphosis. They have gone from being strictly heavy metal to playing a wide variety of songs. Tracks such as \\"Fuel\\" remind the listener of the Metallica of old, while \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" and other songs have exposed the band's more mature side. Perhaps the band members have been affected by the passing years and the realization that there might not be much more time to start a family. My review sucked (I don't know what to write.) Re-Load was not one of Metallica's best albums, but it still spends plenty of time in my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-Load review","review":"Great CD for any metal listener. A must-have for the Metallica fan library. I liked Load just a bit more (hence a 5 star rating from me), although Load and Re-Load were actually originally slated to be a combined 2 cd set. Solid Metallica 'hooks' and great jamming rhythms and melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!!!!","review":"This is a good CD, but it is far from being the best Metallica's album!!! But this is a beautiful album version!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 good song","review":"Reload with st anger is their worst albums. I cant decide which is the worst. This album has songs that i hate to hear. I cant find the melody in this album. I like only the Fixer and a little bit Fuel and The memory remains. But the other songs are so bad that i cant even say that i just don't like the album -> i just hate this album."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=g("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,O)):p("",!0)])}const R=d(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-9675fb8f"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/1.md","filePath":"guide/1.md"}'),L={name:"guide/1.md"},P=Object.assign(L,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{W as __pageData,P as default};
