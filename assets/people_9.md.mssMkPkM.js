Nina is my absolute fave character in the series and her 'three-part comic tautology rule' is sooo cool!

Even when you see some action, they are not very impressive at all, except for the part where a young female asks two guys to teach their kung fu techniques, but you only see this section very briefly. Most of the time, all the characters do in this film was talk, talk, talk, and then talk stragies some more. I don't even think at the end of this film, you get to find out whether or not they actually did freee the prince and the prisoner.

It demonstrates how years after we exit our school aged years, we can look back and identify the teachers who used their talents to mold us as students into responsible, caring, and empathetic adults. There's no mention of test scores but what teachers provided was invaluable and not easily measured. Thundersoul should be seen by a wide audience since it's message holds so much more insight than the more popular Waiting for Superman. It demonstrates how Superman does exist in classrooms across our nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"I really liked this book. in fact I was looking for such a book that discusses mystics for my children.

The one that is still working does not have the strength to do the closet, so it isn't as strong as the Sharper Image brand. (on the other hand, Sharper Image doesn't sell them anymore, which is why I went looking) If they work these are wonderful, leaving the closet smelling very clean.

Those of you who are real poison fans know what I mean. However, on a musical note, this incarnation is so far above what they are with CC,it's almost rediculous. The band seems real energized, with something to prove,among the legions of crappy,\\"one word noun\\" bands that kind of knocked them off the chart for a short time. This relies heavily on native Tongue, which is fine with me. \\"until you suffer some\\" and \\"7days over you\\" are stellar tracks which they should be playing today.

It is impossible to hear the guitars or Bret when he hits a high note. I know with Bret and his 1/3 octive range high note don't happen often. And who is that really fat guy on base...oh it it a very bloated Bobby Dahl. On the upside, Brets hairpiece never falls off, it never sweats either. It does not help that the song selection is heavy on the worst songs from an album that no one cares about."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a real Poison","review":"I am a big fan of Poison. But after I watching this DVD, just feel very disappointment. Kotzen didn't show a good attitude in Posion, he totally can not play C.C.'s solo. In the other words, he didn't put any emotion and feeling in C.C.'s guitar playing part. Terrible feeling in every Poison's famous songs... And the guitar tone is not right, I can not hear the good feeling bright tone from Kotzen's guitars. He only play good in solo of his songs. So, Kotzen didn't melt into the band, still play his own things. And the sad thing is, Bret still needed to say again and again about \\"big welcome to Kotzen, thanks Kotzen...\\" Kotzen was the worst member in this DVD, and didn't worth any good word!If you want to see Bret and others, you can buy it. If you love C.C., don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD, bad, DVD!","review":"First, I just want to say that I haven't bought this DVD or saw it. I am a Poison fan though.

It's told in run-on, inarticulate sentences, as if in the voices of its characters, the abused lackeys of a hideous Franquista latifundia. If the masters are portrayed as morally grotesque, so in their own way are the 'santos' (the oppressed countryfolk), most of them physically or mentally deformed, filthy, stupefied, 'Tierra Sin Pan'-like. They are at least in touch with the natural world -- but so is the worst of the masters, who is obsessed with hunting. (This \\"señorito\\" seems to be in part the author, who was a hunting fanatic too.) Did such people really inhabit Spain in 1981?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faded, but Not Forgotten","review":"Faded Glory will appeal to aviation enthusiasts looking for pictures of airliners in schemes of the 1970s and 1980s. What makes this book worthwhile is that the author has included numerous pictures of small and obscure airlines, such as Simbair, Air Caribbean, and Arista International. Also noteworthy is that practically all of the airlines depicted have either folded or were merged with larger carriers. Had this book been published a few years later, I am sure Pan Am and Eastern would have been included as well.Most of the pictures are of decent quality, though a few do spread onto two pages. For each picture, Mr. Morton also includes an annotation of the history of the airline, though only basic information on the aircraft itself.All in all, as an airliner buff, I enjoy looking at the pictures and find the book to be highly worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Order From This Merchant","review":"Never received the order.

I needed a good reading list. I found much more in Book Savvy. I loved the delightful subject matter categories; the succinct, clever synopses; the listing of other books by the same author, even movie references. I'm intrigued by the book journal idea, too, since I have taken notes about wine and cigars! Best of all, Ms Katona's book, especially the riveting autobiographical part, re-inspired me about how wonderful the written word is in this day and age of TV and cell phones, and how it is never too late to self-educate.

I've used the Avent one many years ago, but am now using Dr Brown's bottles and worried that they wouldn't fit.I've been using the new sterilizer for a month now and am very happy with it. In response to previous reviewers' concerns:* Yes, there is a brown scum sometimes builds up, but like all appliances, it should be cleaned regularly and I think it says more about the quality of the water than the unit...I use boiled water to minimize build up.* The 8oz Dr Brown's bottle WILL fit with a little ingenuity. I don't use the top level but balance the teats etc on the bottle divider instead, and place the straws upside down in the middle bottle holder, caps on the lowest level. I sterilize less bottles so all the other bits & pieces will fit in - usually just do 4 bottles at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a month","review":"The sterilizer worked pretty well for about a month.

WRONG. With this sterilizer you have to sterilize the sterilizer before you can load the bottles in... so that's about 13 minutes, then you can put all the bottles and accessories in, then wait another 13 minutes, then you have to clean the sterilizer. It takes about half and hour to sterilize one load of bottles and accessories. If that's not bad enough mine broke after only 3 uses. Do not buy this sterilizer!

Alicia and Jake both had their inner conflicts to work out, yet both were willing to work through them. The book didn't get hung up on character neuroses, which was a nice change. Although it felt at times like Jake kept making the same brash mistakes with Alicia, at other times he did seem to really be trying, and I also enjoyed his relationship with his troubled son.The sexual relationship between Alicia and Jake was nicely done. A very compelling read that was hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"very different story line","review":"Davidson does a good job depicting a man and child with grave emotional pain and the strong woman who helps them put their lives together. this is not nobel prize stuff but it surely is a story that in the 1860's could very well have been true...and that is heartwrenching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel needed more editing","review":"Davidson is definitely not a Jodie Thomas or Maggie Osborne. Pick up one of their novels instead if you'd like to read well-written American historicals. Davidson's dialog needs help. The characters' conversations were strange. They jump from subject to subject, read each other's minds, and never finish thoughts - very frustrating to read. The story drags on an extra 100 pages, not interesting enough to keep you wanting to go on. The idea of a wheel-chair bound hero was provocative, but his transformation wasn't done well. I lost interest in him half way through. Only read Redemption if you are completely out of reading material. In fact, reread an old Thomas or Osborne novel instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely useless, wasted my money","review":"total press board junk, directions were non-existent with the exception of some scurrilous diagrams how this may go together.

I didn't know better when I picked this book off the shelf and was confused and disturbed by the content. I am not of this world but of the heavenly realm, and this sickeningly worldly, new-age dribble left me quite queasy. It's one thing to name a book The Wedding Vows of the New Age Movement.

In addition to that, she has some other troubles going on, her crush who does not know she exists, or does he? And throw in a scheming nerd and an annoying younger brother!

Well, like so many movies I watched when I was younger, I've forgotten how inappropriate (language, nudity, etc.) the movies could be. So we didn't get into this film more than a few minutes before the F-bomb was dropped and there was close-to-full nudity. My son was out of the room at the moment, so I was able to halt the showing.The point is that PG is a crap shoot.

But this piece of garbage was so cheesy, unfunny and pointless. The acting was terrible and I ended up having to fast forward bits of it so it would hurry up and finish. If you're the kind of person who finds stereotypical Asian characters funny and will laugh hysterically at the words Long Duk Dong, then buy this movie. If you actually have a brain, however, give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an acceptable PG movie!!","review":"Warning! If you are careful about selecting movies that are appropriately rated for your kids, don't buy this one! It carries a PG rating, but by today's standards, it should be R, based on language and nudity. We had to turn it off. If you think anything goes in today's world, then go ahead and buy. I have nothing else to say about this movie, because it was stopped after 15 minutes or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some pretty off color teen stuff here","review":"In contrast toThe Breakfast Clubthis Molly Ringwald movie is pretty tasteless at times:1) one dollar to see her panties in the boy's bathroom2) sister getting high on muscle relaxants at her wedding3) house trashing seniors party4) sex with a drunken girl by a strangerAll in the name of humor I guess, but this is not a family movie.I really didn't like it and I usually do like good teen movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie gets a 5. DVD gets a 3.","review":"Yes - the DVD quality isn't great. Yes - soundtrack is altered. That aside, this is John Hughes' crowning glory in movie making.The premise is great. The execution is even better. The cast pulls it all of spectacularly (could the casting for the grandparents be any better?). The screenplay is great. The entire movie is quotable (ask any and all of my friends). Even the site gags (Joan Cusak getting a drink of water or dancing) are hilarious.The pain of high school should be half as fun as this movie makes it seem to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"-","review":"I LOVE this movie. This movie couldn't have come out at a better time. I was right in the middle of my teen years and probably saw it everytime it ran on cable in the summer of 85. There were so many things I could relate to in this movie. I have to say however that I was VERY disappointed in the VHS release because most of the music had been changed. I understand it had to do with licensing and money but come on, the music is also what made this movie great. How do you go in and change a movie once the whole world has seen it? Its kind a rip off and makes you feel John Hughes didnt care much about preserving his movies original form and integrity. I think that was just wrong. I was really hoping the DVD version would have had all the original music now come to find it doesnt. I wont be buying this one. Why even bother to release it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie But Ridiculous Price","review":"\\"16 Candles\\" is a classic 80's teen movie. In the days before teen movies became formulaic gross-out clones of one another, this film invented more quotable lines than can be listed in a single review. The disappointing thing about this DVD, aside from the inexplicably high price, is the fact that it offers no extras whatsoever, unless you count widescreen. I would pay more for this DVD than many films out there simply because I consider it a classic, but without even a couple of interviews thrown in (how hard would it be to get The Donger to sit down for fifteen minutes?), I wouldn't front the cash for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sixteen Candles","review":"I really love this movie and ordered but I have not yet received this item. I have been waiting for several weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is my 2nd favorite movie of all time. If you were born in the late 60s or the 70s, there's no way you wouldn't enjoy this movie. I've seen it at least 15 times and continue to watch it every chance that I get.I mean really, come on ladies; JAKE RYAN...is there anything better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the soundtrack?!!","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies, and I bought this video because my old copy had worn out. After watching 10 minutes of the new copy, I felt physically ill. The entire soundtrack's been changed! No \\"Love of the Common People\\", no \\"Happy Birthday\\". I couldn't watch any further. Some moron has butchered this film, and I'd return this copy if I could. If you've never seen the original version of this film then go ahead and buy it because the actual film is great and you won't notice the difference in the music. But to anyone who has seen it before, find an original copy. Watching this version will make you sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD's Music is not the same...","review":"During the 80s, many of us had seen this movie about a hundred times. Either on cable or renting it. So we KNOW the music, we know which songs come when.Unfortunately this DVD does not have the same music..some of it has even been removed entirely (like the scene where everyone is getting into their cars to get to the wedding).Until a special edition comes out with all the original music, I'd definitely skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelieveably, the VHS version is better!","review":"Boy, did Universal Home Video drop the ball on this one...\\"Sixteen Candles\\" may not be the most disappointing DVD release ever (that would be, hands down, National Lampoon's Vacation) but it's close! The only thing that saves it is the widescreen format. What's up with the mono soundtrack? It sounds like it's coming from a 1950 am radio! Even the VHS version was mastered in stereo. And c'mon, there must have been some deleted scenes or extra footage they could've thrown into the mix!Of course, this excellent '80s teen comedy stands up very well on its own, but it's still insulting that it gets such shoddy treatment. Even Universal's similarly no-frills \\"Weird Science\\" DVD was at least mastered in surround sound.Unless you're a complete nut for the film, I recommend you wait for the inevitable special edition to come out. In the meantime, turn on your TV...it's on cable constantly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make you feel good!","review":"Sixteen Candles is a great movie for people who aren't popular.Maybe because that's the situation Samantha is in. This is a great movie just when you feel like nobody cares about you or just for something to make you laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars if tape quality was better!","review":"I love this movie and if it was soley on the movie this would get 5+ stars, but after watching this only three times my tape is crappy and the sound sucks.

I hope that the DVD version comes back as I'd like to have a better quality version of this great 80's film that can make me laughe when I need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect to get your movie","review":"I am still waiting for my movie.

Too many filthy and dirty words.If the Hollywood had skipped those bad words, it would have been a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the good ol' days","review":"When I was younger, I would watch Sixteen Candles on \\"regular\\" t.v. (no cable) to just hear a song - True by Spandeau Ballet. I realized that i never watched the real version of the movie so on a whim i decided to add this to my collection. I'm so glad I did. I still love the scene at the dance but it was so much better to get this edition with all the behind the scenes info and interviews from the cast. It seemed especially timely after seeing the Molly Ringwald & others honoring John Hughes at the Oscars this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 Candles","review":"Everything was and is great. Product came on time. The quality is as expected, which is fine. Basicly, No Issues.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello! Hot stuff!","review":"In my opinion this movie is probably one of the best movies of the 80's. Long Duck Dong partly stole the show & The Geek was well played. I say people who didn't like it don't know comedy. But for those of you who do and haven't seen it rent it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Forgot Your Birthday!","review":"My sister got me this movie for my sixteenth birthday. She knows how much I love actress Molly Ringwald and all eighties movies. It was perfect because that year my mom forgot my birthday, which is how the movie starts... and then continues, creating the worst sixteenth birthday that a girl could imagine. It reminded me of how bad my birthday could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be Rated R","review":"Like most thirty-something females, this film is a cult classic - Or should I say was. This particular DVD release is not the same edit they released in the theaters or to TV. Beware, within the first 15 min, you hear an f-bomb, s-bomb, a few other mild swears, and frontal female nudity for more than a few seconds. I only wish we would have known this before we'd hyped it up to our 12 and 13 year old daughter and son for family movie night...A little embarrassed to say the least. As read in previous reviews, most of the music that became popular with the film originally, got canned due to outrageous licensing fees on this version and is not present on this product. Steer clear. Look for the Theatrical release, if one exists. Shame on Universal for squeaking this one by. Consumers remember things like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sixteen candles","review":"DVD was so scratched up....couldn't watch it. I tried to clean it, but the DVD would not play the entire way through"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I recently ordered the movie for my teenage daughter, she loves it. The order was easy to place and by expediting the shipping on the product I was able to recieve it before we went away on vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap DVD?","review":"Although I love the film, I can't comment on SC Flashback Edition.Why? Because it won't play in my DVD player.The store clerk was nice enough to swap the defective DVD with another, but I experienced the exact same problem.Two thumbs down for this cheap product."},{"rating":"1","title":"best left in the past","review":"I was disappointed when I received this dvd. It advertised as having the original soundtrack, but it does not. It's just not as good as I remember. Perhaps I have matured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the past","review":"The movie was as I remembered, except I was able to actually hear the whole movie without the dubbing from tv stations. The movie is alittle of all of us when we were younger. I also bought Pretty in Pink and am looking forward to buying The Breakfast Club."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ideal Flick For Teens","review":"All I can say is that I've been obsessed with John Hughes and his films for fours years now and I'm in love with \\"Sixteen Candles\\". This film paints an incredibly acurate portraite of high school in the 80's while adding some fantasy into the mix. Samantha Baker is an incredibly downt-to-earth, normal teenager who's in love with the hottest, most popular boy in school. Of course he's taken by the beautiful blonde and the only boy who seems to be interested is Farmer Ted, the hopeless Geek. This movie has some excellent moments and will definately entertain you. There are tons of other hillarious characters that essentuate the story beautifuly. I love Jake Ryan, and I think Anthony Michael Hall did an awesome job in this movie. See this movie it's tons of fun and will give you a laugh. Long live Hughes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite teen movie","review":"This was John Hughes at his best. \\"Sixteen Candles\\" is a classic teen movie and it set the precedent for numerous imitators and copy-kats. Yet, this movie is absolutely untouchable. I don't think I know anyone who hasn't seen it and doesn't love it. I highly recommend this movie as a must for your collection. I would have given it 5 stars because the movie in itself is excellent, but I was highly disappointed with the quality of the DVD. There aren't any special features and the sound is horrible. I would have liked to see an interview with the cast and the director. Maybe a couple of deleted scenes. Something! I don't even think there was a trailer. I was also disappointed because there is another version of the movie made for the numerous runs on television. There aren't any huge glaring differences, but there are a few additional scenes. I hope they eventually put out special editions of all the Hughes teen classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-release Sixteen Candles","review":"John Hughes movies were a staple of the 80's. I believe that he deserves some respect. I rented Sixteen Candles a few years ago, and fell in love with it all over again. I had my chance to buy a copy of the DVD, but I passed on it, and its a mistake I have regretted ever since. Now if you want a copy of this classic teen angst film you have to pay an upwards of $50.00. I think this is ridiculous, and I told Universal this when I wrote requesting them to re-release this title again. However their answer was this \\"We have no plans to release this title in the future\\". Any of you out there that really want to see this title with a stereo soundtrack and extras (and believe me there are some) then write to Universal and complain please. This movie captures the teen years with such brilliant, unlike the teen movies of today, this movie has heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"some music rescored! -(original music not in this copy)","review":"ripoff-- score helped make the movie-- the original soundtrack not on copy i purchased and the rescored music stupid-- initial school scene- going to the church in cars, one ex., and beware it makes a difference--and audio bad and some addit. dialogue added,i think- !buy a used copy! with the original soundtrack-- i got ripped off, very disappointed! -- says on box rescored! it should be noted when reviewing movie at site!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISGRACE!

Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and Wierd Science are totally essential forany 80's Teen Film fan. Here are my gripes about these releases. First the picture quality is grainy and fuzzy onSixteen Candles and not much better on the others.Next the sound is horrible! DTS? How could they considerthis to be 5.1 surround when I didn't hear a peep out ofmy back speakers? I thought I would be hearing the brilliantNew Wave soundtrack in DTS surround. It's not! I thought the DTS logo on the back of the box assured a degree of quality. I'll certainly be careful on my next purchases. LastlyThere were no inserts in the box. I don't need a booklet, buta chapter listing would've been nice. I wonder how John Hughes feels about these crappy re-issues? Ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie-even though I am young","review":"Ok ppl....if u have never seen this see it soon!! I will admit that I am young but I LOVE this movie!! AMH and Molly Ringwald did a GREAT job...I love all of the songs on the soundtrack. It describes some of the stuff that goes on in and around my high school today. So if you haven't seen it your missing a great laugh!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST of the BEST","review":"In my mind this is the all time best '80's movie. It is classic '80's with classic music(in the original version), classic lines and with Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall what more could you want. It brings back fond memories, I think we have all been there at one time or another. You can not get any better than Sixteen Candles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Now I Have A Place To Put My Hand!\\"","review":"What can I add about this great film, apart from the fact that it took SOOOOO long to get it back on DVD? It's a true landmark for anyone coming of age in the '80s and a great document to show your kids our criminal dress sense at the time! No one could have played Samantha but Molly Ringwald, but the whole cast is a masterstroke: Michael Schoeffling as dreamboat Jake, Anthony Michael Hall as Farmer Ted, Gedde Watanabe as Long Duk Dong (\\"Automobile?...\\"), Justin Henry as Samantha's bratty little brother, all Samantha's relatives were brilliant (especially Blanche Baker as her older sister after she takes four muscle relaxers on the day of her wedding), and John and Joan Cusack (in a back brace!).

Molly Ringwald and the Brat Pack are some of the best actors and actresses. The humorous side of their personalities can solve any problem. I strongly reccommend this movie. It is easy to relate to Samantha in this movie because we all know what is was like to be a teenager and have to deal with these situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this version","review":"I love this movie, but not this version. Buy a different edition than this. It's okay if you just want to watch the movie. I don't like the extra features at all. People who had nothing to do with the movie were talking about it. The features were not special. Buy this movie, but not this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, where's my commentary?","review":"For a movie that was an 80's staple and one that is in constant, popular rotation, the lack of detail given to this DVD is staggering. Many of us grown and raised in the 80's would have paid a pretty penny for a well-done, packed collector's edition of this movie. No trailer or featurettes either? Ugh.That said and written, Molly Ringwald is the queen of 80's teen comedy. In this sad age of \\"Fast and Furious\\" and other atrocious sequels, it's nice to look back and hail the glory of John Hughes and the glory that was Shermerr, Illinois. Where have you gone, Jake Ryan - our nation turns it's lonely eyes to you"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Soundtrack was STOLEN!","review":"Although this is one of my favorites from the '80's, I've seen it so many times, I can't get past the new soundtrack.

There are several that are excellent for teaching beginners as well as more advanced students. I have found that this new dictionary by Gallaudet Press meets the criteria for an excellent resource for new and seasoned signers. I have found that the ease of the pictures were very helpful for my students to comprehend the handshapes and motion of the signs. Moreover, the DVD was very good to show how the signs were made by demonstration. I recommend this dictionary and the wonderful DVD to be used within public schools and college level classrooms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product!","review":"I bought this during the time I was taking a ASL class in college. A super addition to my textbook and very simple to use. Each sign is accompanied by a word or phrase that explains the sign (ie, once a month, never, happy). Sign pictures are clear and easy to understand. A full vocabulary index in the back of the book makes finding the correct sign quick. The book was accompanied by a DVD, but I've not used that yet- the book itself is very helpful! When trying to find a particular word, I turn to this book before I turn to my textbook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Not everything in the video matches the pictures in the book.

The pictures are clear, and the words are logically grouped. It even includes some local/regional signs. The best feature is the disc that comes with it. You type the word, and the sign come up on the screen, in the form of a video clip. They use many signers, so you get to see how different people shape their hands. Also, it includes advanced sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book is better.","review":"Another book is better than the Gallaudet Dictionary of American Sign Language. The better book is the Random House Webster's American Sign Language Dictionary, Unabridged. It contains dictionary definitions for the words you are looking up, an explanation of the reason why the sign is the way it is, and a written explanaition of how to make the sign. None of these features are in the Gallaudet Dictionary.At first I did not understand the value of the dictionary definitions in the Random House Dictionary. But then I realized that some English words have very different meanings which are represented by completely different signs. For Example, the word \\"country\\" can mean a foreign state or a rural location. Those two meanings have are represented by two different signs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the DVD","review":"We purchased a copy of this title for our library and were disappointed to learn that the DVD cannot be played in a standard DVD player (connected to a television set), but must be played in a computer DVD drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"very simple, not a lot of words","review":"I am learning to sign and have purchased several books. This one is by far the worse. There are no directions for the movement of the signs, not any description or definitions of the signs. The pictures and words are simple.

Wake of the Flood is as well produced as the other remastered releases I've gotten so far but it has no major hits. It's a record that was made while the band was trying to find it's way after Pigpen's death. It's truely for the serious Dead Head.

People sometimes say they reached their peak with these two earlier albums and it was all downhill from there. Not so. The songs on WAKE OF THE FLOOD may not be as immediately catchy as \\"Truckin'\\" or \\"Uncle John's Band\\", but they have their own strange appeal and hold up to hundreds of listenings. I must single out the long Bob Weir-John Barlow song \\"Weather Report Suite\\" as my favorite track. It is one of the most unbelievably beautiful songs I have ever heard. If you already have the LP, you should get this CD just for the alternative solo demo of this song, with just Bob Weir singing and playing acoustic guitar in his unique style. It is literally worth the price of the whole CD (kind of cliche, I know, but when you hear it you'll agree!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the underated Dead Albums","review":"At the time this album was released I believe it was generally underrated by many. It went to the \\"cut out bin\\" at my local record store in a matter of months.Being strapped for cash and a price of $1.99 meant this lp joined my collection and got alot of play time back in the day.This is all great material from Eyes of the World to Stella Blue. There isn't a bad cut on this album and its just as much of a listening joy for me now as it was over 30 years ago.Add in the extra tracks (which are always a treat on a Dead CD) and you've got a wonderful addition to your inventory."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to have in your collection","review":"Simply put, the moment I heard this from front to back, I had to make it part of my Dead Collection.Better late than never!

I had never heard of Lullacry before I saw this cd here, and took a chance. In some ways the gamble paid off, in others I found that this disk fell short. While Lullacry are surely talented musicians, and I do HATE to admit this, I think that bands like Evanescence (unjustly bashed) and the incomparable Lacuna Coil have jaded me to subpar musical stylings. While not as orchestral as Fallen nor as in-your-face raw as Comalies, Crucify My Heart is still a good album. While it falls closer to the pop side of rock, every song on CMH has some charm.

If you have a Notebook, like i do, then you put the green cable into the headphone jack not the microphone jack. Took me a few minutes to figure that one out...duhSound quality: Awesome! Great!

This was a problem that some people had written about in other reviews online.All in all, I would buy these speakers for no more that $75, which you can find good deals if you spend a little time looking, and if you don't mind if they only will last you around two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This baby rocks HARD!","review":"My original set up was a Cambridge Soundworks Megaworks 210D, a super-excellent 2.1 system.

I carefully opened the box and removed some of the plastic bags. This was my second attempt with Logitech speakers. I put everything together on my worktable before committing the behemoth base unit's final destination.

I love my bass-hitting music and even turn it up so that I can hear my music from my bedroom while I'm in the shower. The bass has been blasted so loud with bass-test songs that shelves have emptied themselves all over my floor as well as multiple drinks having fallen off of my desk. This system located upstairs on the second floor makes the support columns located outside of my house by the front door vibrate when it is at 3/4 volume with bass all the way up. This is by far worth the 100$ and I was surprised to find out it has 200w RMS. I had been thinking it was atleast 500w RMS.GREAT BUY! However, if you're a parent expecting to get any sleep do not buy it for your child, your house will shake."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mids","review":"I'm really disappointed with this system. It is no good for music. The mids to low-mids are really weak and the high-mids to highs are over saturated. It gives a metallic/shrill quality to the sound. I couldn't stand it. Also, there is an awful hum coming from the amplifier even with the power off. It's not loud but just loud enough to make me unplug the system. I also have a 3 year old Logitec z-5300 and an 11 year old Panasonic SAAK29; both way better. They have a full, warm sound to them and the bass is much tighter (especially on the Panasonic.) I guess I should not have expected so much out of such a cheap system; my other 2 systems each cost more than twice as much. This was not what I expected, so I'm giving the Z-2300 to my little sister. I'll use my old Panasonic SAAK29 for now and maybe I'll pick up the new Corsair SP2500."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, Great System","review":"Sounds awesome.

Even though I never complain about their music, or crying babies. But hey, they can't help it if they're jealous of my sound system.I was going to get a home theater system, but I tested a few in store, and none compared to this computer speaker set.Gave it a 4 because I never did know why the first pair stopped working after only a few years.Highly recommend for music lovers!

Installation was extremely easy and hassle free, everything connects to the subwoofer so there is relatively little hassle with cables and such. The sound so far as I can tell is great, very crisp and the bass from the woofer is great and really adds the the overall music experience. The volume controller is real easy as well and has a separate control for the bass so you can adjust from zero to full on bass sound. The connector is great as well and is easy and doesn't require any specific MP3 player type it's just a simple headphone jack and the cable is plenty long meaning you can hook it up to the back of a tower and still have the volume controller sitting right on your desktop. Great speakers at great price and more proof that BOSE does stand for Buy Other Sound Equipment, who needs them anyway the best value is Logitech without a doubt!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty nice speakers","review":"Pretty good speakers. I was expecting way too much when I got these so was dissappointed at first. Didn't seem powerful enough and sounded too \\"tinny\\" with too much treble. Then I compared them to my dads $800 dollar system. The logitechs have a nice clean sound to them(better than my dads). Not as good as Bose but consider the cost difference (mine were only around one hundred dollars delivered). The satellites DO distort at very high levels although some people claim they don't. The bass can be too much for me but it did NOT seem to distort unlike the satellites. They do sound just average at lower levels but turn them up and you should be satisfied considering they are only a computer speaker. I would recommend these if you can find a good price. I sold them to my cousin but am now kind of regretting it after listening to them again at his house. May buy another pair at christmas time prices.

I have adjusted equilizer settings but still not perfect.So I remembered I had old Bose satelites from yrs back as part of a set of accoustimas setup. For a trial, I hooked them up to the sub instead of the included satelites and all problems resolved. The mids that bose provide shine through and the xtra bass is gone. Now perfect for 2.1 setup.

I had to admit that the sound was not as good as the old one. It was good, but NOT AS GOOD. Thus, I researched upgraded speakers for our computer. After doing a lot of checking, it seemed like a reasonable choice was this Logitech system, but until you really hear it for yourself, you cannot be positive of your choice.

My first set lasted me three years without any problems. However, they were killed when my roommates decided to keep them at full volume for 5 hours for a recent party of ours. That being said, these three year old speakers cranked out a huge amount of sound (enough for 50 people to dance to) before only the left speaker kicked it. The great thing about it though? These speakers are cheap enough that replacing them wasn't a huge issue. On top of that I have been impressed with their sound quality. It isn't the greatest for critical listening for classical music, but for gaming and movies it is amazing. The bass is great and the tone quality is perfect.

The subwoofer is huge and heavy! Speakers can be cranked up to be very loud with very little distortion. I do find the mid range muddled as others have reported and helped somewhat by adjusting the equalizer in the application. The remote is a very nice feature - on/off, bass, and volume at the fingertips.I give these speakers 5 stars as it matched exactly the reviews and my expectations.

All working great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome","review":"Great speaker with awesome quality. I don't even turn the speaker pass 1/4 volume cause it's so loud. The sound quality is crystal clear with huge bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best you'll get for the price","review":"I could get detailed, but it's not necessary. The bottom line: You're not going to get a better system for the price. For what you're paying your getting a system that competes with a tier above it. It won't compete with a $600 system, but it's still very good.It's not perfect, the mids are slightly lacking. The bass however is fantastic. It's loud, it's clear. It's very good. It's well built, it's heavy (35lb box).You get what you pay for, in this case you get a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This system rocks","review":"Pretty much everything i wanted in a sound system....loud, distortion free, amazing bass....nothing to complain about....get one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great speaker","review":"Bought this couple of weeks back. Great sound, no trouble yet.I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is hip-hop-only speakers. Avoid if you're going to listen to something different.","review":"Just want to say that the bass is extremely good, soft, clear, and strong... too strong.The problem is that although the sub woofer is great, the other two small-sized speakers cannot cope with high frequencies with the same level of success. However, if you try to bring these high-freqs up, your bass will become a disaster. And there is no easy way to balance your bass and your high freqs, even with the external bass regulator.There is no middle-frequencies at all. I didn't hear anything and, as in the case of high-freqs, if I try to bring them up nothing happens. Looks like there is no real hardware to output anything except bass.I don't really understand how this kind of speakers happened to be so high in the rating. How can people listen to them at all. They just change the output so much.P.S.: I was using EMU 0202 audio interface and Sony MDR-EX71 headphones as reference, so this is not a sound card problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected, and expectations were high!","review":"My boyfriend had mentioned he wanted these, so I bought them as a gift for his birthday. They are definitely worth the money! The sound quality is crisp and clear, with the base not overpowering. Even on the next floor in the house you can still hear the lyrics perfectly. We can hear them throughout the house and never have to turn the volume up past halfway. The only surprise was opening the box and realizing just how large the subwoofer is. Luckily, we have the room for it - but if you think you might be limited on space, please realize that its pretty large, comparative to the speakers. However, the result you get out of it is great. I would recommend these speakers to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Speakers!","review":"I love these speakers! They sound better than alot of the surround systems out there. So if your desk space is limited and you want really good sound and bass, you cant go wrong with these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent speakers with deep base and crisp treble","review":"These speakers are the best pick for a person who likes to hear quality sound, be it gaming or music. The base and the treble are perfect and for the price, I don't say that they are a steal but they certainly exceed the expectations by a LOT. I also like how they connect to the PC headphone jack and you can play music from nearly any MP3 player and get the output through this system! five stars to THX!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These speakers rock the house!","review":"I picked these up at Best Buy for [..]150 for a big house party we were throwing. I was more than pleased when I plugged these in!The subwoofer is extraordinary! We put the speakers in the basement of our 3 bedroom house, and you can feel the bass anywhere in the house! The whole floor vibrates, and my roommate's posters fell off his wall.These speakers are absolutely perfect if you need big volume and big bass, but they also are great for watching T.V. and listening to everything from Lil Wayne to Mendelssohn.At 90[..], these are a steal!If for any reason I ever have to buy another set of speakers, I will buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"theater pipe organ sound","review":"If you want to put your speaker through it's paces, you got to listen to CD quality theater pipe organ; it will blow your mind or blow your speakers. No other instrument produces bass as strong as the theater organ, and my z-2300 do a pretty good job if I'm careful with the settings on my EQ. You have to be careful with the theater organ bass on any sub except subs like the Carver True Sub which is almost undestructable, but the cost is way, way up there. For the money I have no complaints. I'm thinking about buying another z-2300 and run both off my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers, great price!","review":"I bought these speakers about a month ago and I couldn't be happier! I love the wired remote. It comes with an on/off button (mute), volume control, a headphone jack and bass volume. My parents have an older model and the bass control is on the back of the subwoofer. Kind of an inconvient place to put it. It's nice that the Z-2300 has it right in front of you.Some people say that the subwoofer is too big, but I think it's just fine. It is a little bigger than a lot of others that I've seen, but it fits nicely under my desk out of the way. I don't see the problem. And I doubt you'll mind when you see how much bass this thing pumps out!I highly recommend these speakers. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound!","review":"This is my second set of these that i have purchased and completely satisifed! I don't need the extra surround speakers and these do the job better than most others. If you like to enjoy music or movies on your comuter these are great! I have one set for my desk top and the other set in my bed room for the lap top. I recommend these to anyone that wants to ditch the $30 set of speakers they might have or even for their first set of upgrades. Well worth the money and would buy a third set if i ever feel the need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super..","review":"I bought it one month ago...I am very happy with sound quality, performance ...really enjoying it.....however only things bother me is remote system which is not of good quality.. still i would recommend it for music lovers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, The Five Stars Are Right!","review":"After much muddling around over considering a stereo I decided to just get nice speakers for the computer where all of my music is digitally stored.All I can say is the five star reviews are correct, this set is freaking awesome, especially for the money.Beautiful sound, loud make the folks downstairs say what the hell is that power!"},{"rating":"2","title":"100%","review":"EXTREMELY pleased with quality of speakers.

Would recommend, and would buy again!elizabeth, RN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great product","review":"I had tried out multiple computer speakers in stores, and when my friend picked these up, it sealed the deal. The clarity and quality of the satellite speakers blew my mind, as they can crank out a great deal of bass. Add that to the sub, and youve got one hell of a product. Even when its turned up to high levels, there is no feedback or distortion in the sound quality.

Since I bought these speakers, I have had to keep the bass at the minimum setting to prevent getting complaints from my neighbors. The bass is pure and natural, the mids and highs are perfect. I spent nearly $4000 on my car stereo for clean and clear sound, and I still LOVE the sound from these speakers...after 5 years of owning them.I have no complaints about these speakers, and highly recommend them, if they still make them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still pounding","review":"Not as awesome as surround but this setup has great sound.Had a problem with the first one about 9 months in, the left channel went out.

DON'T!!! i never got the other ones i was about to settle with (PHILIPS MMS430G 2.1 Speaker) not sure if i would have been dissapointed though since i love their MCM 530 stereo, but thats another review... 5 stars all around"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned 3 of them --- significant quality-control issues.","review":"I've been through three of these units in the past couple weeks (thanks, Amazon, for your no-hassle return policy). Two of them put out a low-level, but nonetheless audible 60hz hum when you turned them on --- probably a bad power supply. The third one worked well for a week or so, then the left channel stopped working.They sound good, when they work, but Logitec clearly has quality-control issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until they break","review":"What people say on here is true... Very nice speakers for the value, unless they break on you. I've had to return two of these so far; on the first set, the left channel stopped working, on the second set, the same thing happened... except this time it was the actual satellite speaker. I never overdrive my speakers... I bought this for casual listening to substitute my studio set-up. Always unplugged when not in use, never sat/put stuff on the sub, never plugged it into something when it was on, never turned it up past 100W, never tugged on the cables... the fuse is still in tact.Like I said, it's great when it works, just hope you don't run into problems. Returning it is easy hassle free if you do... but I'm still unhappy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA Logitech x-2300","review":"My Logitech Z-2300 arrived DOA.

I have reordered a another and we'll see if it works. Until then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your wimpy computer speakers...Big Sound, Great Value","review":"Love them! For the money you can't beat them for BIG SOUND. If you love lots (I mean LOTS) of base then this is the package for you!

The sub puts out a smooth and solid base for anything you're listening too, while the 2 satellites pump out a surprising amount of power. In fact, I'm going to take back that midrange comment and say that it can be fixed if you know 2 ounces about equalization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub, amazing, satellite speakers, not so much.","review":"the sub is insane, just wondering why logitech didn't put as much effort into the satellites.one of the satellites didn't even work when i got it.i'm sending it back and getting a new one, hopefully it'll be better on the next go round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost too much bass!","review":"Easy and intuitive hookup. Sub is a little tall compared to my old one and it does have black heat radiating fins on the backside but it looks clean. The remote controller is such a nice feature to have because now I have my speakers behind my monitors I don't need to leave them in view to always plug in headphones or change volume or bend down to change the bass it's all right there. Fired it up in my two bedroom condo and was quickly adjusting the equalizer to try and bring the bass down some because I don't want to rattle the neighbors paintings off their walls LOL. Just out of the box but so far so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lower your expectations. Desktop units are no good.","review":"I expected good sound but was disappointed to find what appeared to be a normal set of cheap computer speakers attached to a large sub. Sub sounds good, desktops units do not. If you are not sure, buy them somewhere else so that they can be returned without too much hassle. After spending this money, I am now looking at a decent set of bookshelf speakers (real ones, not this computer crap) to replace the desktop units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Controller from the start","review":"I purchased this gift for my gf. After installation, we both felt the bass was overwhelming. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of bass but this was to the point it would hurt our ears. It was a constant humming.I speculate that the bass knob is most likely stuck on the max + bass position. The neutral and negative - bass setting does not change/lower the bass. I visited my local Best Buy to test out their floor sample and clearly their bass knob works. There isn't constant bass; you're allowed the vary the bass control.My question now is how do I get a new controller? I blame myself for not taking care of this immediately since 4 months have already passed. Do I take this up with Amazon or Logitech? Any help will be appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a wise decision. The Logitech Z2300 was returned.","review":"Returned Logitech Z-2300, static, both speakers, hum in sub.

I call back and got an English speacker this time who claimed they never recieved my proof of purchase(why send a return label?) and that I needed to return the the defective speackers first. Amazon isn't exactly down the street from me and I raised hell! I had faxed over what they had requested and my understanding was I would sent back defective product once I recieveed the new speakers.

I spent several hours doing research on good speakers and the Logitec Z-2300 were always getting great reviews.

The subwoofer is very powerful and I actually turn it down to around 40% when I'm playing low volume.The only down side is once you get them up past 50% volume, you can hear static in the satellite speakers. Once you turn the volume back down, the sound is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are really good speakers","review":"I was very surprised by the weight of the box as I lifted it from the front porch. This is a substantial product. The bass unit is massive and so is the sound. This is better than the last version of the Logitech unit, as the satellites have two speakers each and the central unit is more robust. This speaker system is an outstanding value. Clean and crisp with bass that will keep the family awake if you want. Nice cental control unit with separate bass and volume controls. As good as something priced as twice as much...would buy from Logitech again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great speakers for the price","review":"these speakers are great. the Sound quality sometimes gets a little muddy but only just noticeably. the wired remote is a nice feature. my last speakers broke because those controls were on the satellite.All in all this is one of the best deals out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"logitech z2300","review":"the skinny;arrived fast from amazoneasy set- upspeaker wires to shortsubwoofer is largesound better at higher volumeglad I bought them, they sound great"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sounds OK when it works","review":"I had a problem with this unit right out of the box.

The bass is outstanding which is to be expected as the subwoofer is huge, and the highs are very crisp, and clear, but there is no midrange. This makes the audio sound hollow if you are listening to any music with a lot of midrange, ie rock and roll. They sound great for hip hop, or techno, but anything guitar heavy will suffer.I'm not an audiophile with a stereo system that costs thousands of dollars.

I am NOT an audiosnob, but I do know what sounds good! Please tell me what more you expect for $100.00???This is, in my opinion, the bees knees in PC speaker offerings.

The sound is crisp and clear (at least to my untrained but music loving ears)and the adjustable bass conrtrol can make it so your sub can hit with bass so low you can feel it in your chest. Perfect for you if you like music ,watch movies or want to want to entertain. I have and would recommend these speakers to anyone in the market for new set of 2.1s. Be warned though: these are loud - almost too loud if you like music with deep bass and you live in a home with shared walls. The available headphone jack is very convienient. Also the sub itself is quite large- at least 12'high 12'wide and 16'deep. Overall I couldn't be happier with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"The speakers are great!!!The sub is a little big,so if you don't have alot of room this system is not for you.Sounds like a home theater system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers for the price!","review":"I received these speakers about a month ago and have been using them as computer speakers at my desk in an apartment. They're definitely loud enough to function as entertainment center speakers, but my reason for purchasing them was for power and clarity. I use them 95% of the time for music, from ambient/classical to hard rock. The subwoofer packs a punch (though I suggest keeping the sub setting below 12 o clock if you're EQ'ing through your music player). The satellites are a bit on the treble-y side, but a little EQ'ing takes care of that. As with any speaker, they sounded a little harsh for the first 2 weeks of break in, but now are sweet and distinct. Great pair of speakers from a great company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set","review":"I bought these for my girlfriend. I currently have the Bose Companion 2.

Easily of equal sound quality, but capable of being much louder, and also much more capable in terms of bass and such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for a great price","review":"Purchased this product used and it came in great shape. Sound is very nice and quite capable. Only gripe would be the short length of the cable that links the controller to the sub. This is however, easily fixed with a 15pin serial extension cable ($6 @ Fry's). This opens up a lot more options for sub placement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speakers are nothing short of AMAZING.","review":"After much deliberation, I chose these speakers over the Klipsch GMX 2.1 speakers. My roommate has those [Klipsch ones] and they are very solid speakers - great volume, high wattage, sub is nice and powerful. These speakers got pretty much the same reviews. Needless to say, these speakers sound AWESOME. Bass is veeery powerful. I love the wired remote - you can easily control volume and woofer volume and it has a headphone jack. Speakers have cool black grills that can come off to reveal the tweeters. As for sound - they have incredible volume (200 Watts RMS) and sound great whether listening to classical, hip-hop/rap, or rock. If you can front the money, these are the best 2.1 speakers out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Piñata 25's Review","review":"RESULTS OF EACH AND EVERY SINGLE UNIT DIFFER; Written on 12/3/2010BIASED Pros:- amazing price of 200 watts of RMS for $110 > X; fantastic power- great lows (bass)- volume control with remote- clear sound up to around 64% on the master volume of the remoteSOMEWHAT UNBIASED Pros:- removable anti-dust covers for speakersBIASED Cons:- mids aren't that loud- blue light from remote may get annoyingSOMEWHAT UNBIASED Cons:- distortion starts at around 65-70% on the master volume of the remote- sub woofer has a black body and silver grill instead of one silver part as seen on the images"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! No replacement cables available","review":"My cat chewed throught the cable for the wired remote last night.

I think that is ridiculous. That's the last product I'll buy from Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech REALLY sucks!","review":"I bought this speaker system about three years ago.

The system has great amplification, and is probably more than I will ever need in my home office - a 12x14 foot room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great value","review":"these speakers are loud, clear and very balanced for the pricetag. i recently replaced my 400 watt band-pass subwoofer stereo that i used for home entertainment purposes with these speakers, and am very satisfied with them.I notice some low-frequency hum with certain devices, but that is probably due to the fact that i have a four-way audio splitter hooked up to it and more length of cable than is required in most cases. not to mention the fact that some connections are 1/8th inch split to stereo rca, which is unavoidable if u wish to use these for uses other than just computer. furthermore, im no audio expert and may have had my input volume too low or something.All in all, a great price (i paid 125-135 between shipping and tax, i forget exactly) for a small, loud, great quality sound system."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed","review":"So far I've bought two sets of these, and loved them both. For the price it can't be beat. Even on 1/3 volume, these things are pretty damn loud. The bass sounds fantastic, and they are much more clear than the Z-523's, and are worth the extra amount of cash. For any of you comparing the Klipsch ProMedia's, look away.. Cnet gave these much better reviews, and not to mention the ProMedia's are overpriced. Hell, get two sets of the Z2300's for only a little bit more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy hitting bass","review":"After much review of other speaker systems I found this one being the best bang for the buck. The bass hits nice and hard in my computer room. Shakes everything on the walls hahaha. Sound quality is pretty good. With a good sound card you can get this system sounding pretty nice. Thinking about buying a second one now just because."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice speakers","review":"Just bought these speakers to go with a new computer. These speakers are a huge step up from my old 2.1 speakers. These speakers do a very good job at making it seem like there are more speakers hiding somewhere. It replicates surround sound as good as some older Altec Lansing 4.1 speakers where as this Logitech set is just 2.1. The controls are very easy to use. Forget cheap speakers, it pays to spend a little more because you get a lot more in return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I don't know much about speakers but I do know these sound great and are a bargain. They can get very loud, and still sound crisp! The bass is pretty intense, it makes things fall off my desk! Good size, fit on my small dorm room desk, great for school, work, or home! The included AV jacks make them a great buy for gamers as well! Definitely would recommend these to anyone who is looking for great speakers and doesn't want to spend money on surround sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few months of light use","review":"First of all, do not buy this if you live in an apartment. Your neighbors will hate you if you turn the bass nob slightly above the minimum. If you turn it to the maximum I imagine they will call the police (and you will lose your hearing). The sub-woofer is just obnoxious, that's the best word I have for it. It weighs about 30 lbs and comes with its own heat sink.There is a buzzing sound when no music is playing. It's annoying enough that I turn it off when I'm not playing anything.One satellite speaker broke after a few months of light usage. I'm currently working with Logitech warranty and thankfully, this model is discontinued so they might send me a different model as replacement.The only redeeming feature is the sound quality. Even with the bass turned all the way down, the sound coming out is great, but expected from a >$100 set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Bass and highs but nothing in between.","review":"These did not sound good. I know that other reviewers liked them which is why I purchased them, but these just would not do and I sent them back. I suppose maybe these would work for video games, but not listening to music or watching movies. There was good bass and highs above 3k, but there wasn't much in between. These sounded very tinny and cold.After sending these back, I spent twice the money and went with the Companion 3 system which sounds much, MUCH better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for the price","review":"Great sound. Easy setup and controls: Power, volume and bass. Main speakers are compact and attractive. This unit delivers exceptionally high quality sound for such small main speakers.There is a musical chime to remind you to turn off the speakers after you turn off the P.C.To obtain additional cooling for the sub woofer, if necessary, please see my review of the Vornado Flippi V6.This may be helpful if the space available under the desk is less than is recommended for all sides of the sub woofer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointed - And No, I Don't Work For A Competitor","review":"I bought these because of what seemed like good reviews and very good pricing. What a mistake. They offer muffled, muddy, boomy sound. All they do well is that they are loud. I got rid of them within a week, giving them away, and simply taking a loss. Their replacement, the Bose Companion 3, Series II, cost $249, but was worth every penny. If you want good, clean, crisp sound, don't buy these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaker purchase","review":"Great speakers for the money. I shopped these at the local mall and other internet sites and this was a great deal. The sound quality is great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST THERE IS--DEEP BASS","review":"I've had these superb speakers for three years--they are the BEST! Modern music calls for DEEP BASS--this is wonderful as it fills the room with sound. I recommend these so highly. For your ipod player, I recommend also the Creature speakers, but leave the LOGITECH for your biggest rooms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"These speakers have decent mid range sound. The bass is flat and boomy, not tight at all. I previously had klipsch pro-media and they were many many times better. I wish the klipsch's lasted longer than 8 years..I would have never made the mistake of buying these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Z-2300","review":"Great range of sound with a thumping sub-woofer. My Wife keeps telling me to turn the bass down. The wired remote control can stay right by your computer and you can adjust the volumn and bass there. No negatives. I leave the volumn all the way up on my computer for the best sound.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Surprise","review":"The Logitech Z-2300 system is everything the reviewers who liked this product claimed. The sound quality is above my expectations especially when streaming classical music. Connecting it to a lap top was a breeze and took less than 10 minutes. Most of that time was unpacking it. In addition, it has power to be heard throughout the house (if you desire) and the speakers handle the volume with little distortion.I highly recommend this product - it's an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performance, good value","review":"If you want loud, buy it. If you want quality acoustics with wide range of frequency response mainly for listening to good music, buy something else. This set is purely for watching movies and playing games and maybe turn your living room into a disco. It's very very powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Speakers , Over Priced and Over Rated !","review":"I am not sure why this speakers so highly rated on Amazon or on CNET. I purchased them, thinking sound will be clear and crisp but I am very disappointed with these expensive and average speakers. I regret this purchase.There is no midrange and all you hear is big boomy bass from subwoofer. If you lower the subwoofer, you will realize that you paid too much for these speakers. I tried all the Settings with my Creative Platinum Sound card but nothing impressed me.This is my last logitech purchase, I guess. I have altec lansing speakers on other PC and clearly you hear the difference as how crisp and clean sound those have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow these speakers are LOUD.","review":"For the past 2 years I've been using Creative Gigaworks T40 2.0 Speakers with my macbook pro, and although they sound really good I missed some good thumping bass. Well I think I have enough bass to shake half my apartment building. The sub is HUGE and I have to adjust the bass output so it won't shake me the entire time music is playing. They do sound good with excellent bass, but they come nowhere close to the quality of sound reproduction(highs and mids) of the T40s(has 2 med woofers and 1 tweeter each). So how did I fix this issue? I used a 3.5mm splitter from the audio out to both sets of speakers and it sounds awesome. If you like loud bass shaking sound (and annoy/get back at your neighbor) then these are the speakers for you. If you want high quality sound these may disappoint you, unless you can find a work around like I did. If you do find the highs lacking in iTunes I recommend using the treble booster setting in the equalizer to balance the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best speackers I've ever heard.","review":"Let me just say that these are the best speackers I've heard, ever.Not only do they sound awsome, but setting them up was extremely easy, to. Now, keep in mind that I'm blind, and most of the time I need some kind of help setting things up. But not with this. I felt around on the back and right away I knew where everything went.When I plugged the speackers in for the first time, I wasn't expecting the sound it came out with. Oh, no. I was expecting them to sound like the old ones I had. The ones I had, sounded pretty good. These, without a doubt kicks their butt.I tried playing different songs and I was so happy with the sound I got every time. I haven't tried it with movies but I'm sure I'm going to be just as happy as I was with my music.These speackers were worth every penny and I am so happy that I got them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Speakers I've ever owned!","review":"I have had these speakers for over three years and have had no problems. Awesome sound quality and dependable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers - Oustanding Quality from Logitech","review":"I'm very impressed with the high quality of these speakers. I own a set of Klipsch's Promedia 2.1 speaker system at work and I must admit that these speakers almost beat out the Klipsch speaker system.The Sub-woofer has very accurate bass and the Tweeter/Mid combo speakers sound perfect and clear. Once we adjusted everything to our tastes, the music sounds amazing. Definitely a great deal if you're looking for a great sounding system for your office.I highly recommend that if you are considering a different pair of speakers due to pricing concerns that you reconsider. Since you won't need to turn the volume up too loud, there will be less stress on the system and as a result, it should last longer. Logitech has always produced high quality systems if you are willing to spend a little more. We've never gone wrong buying quality equipment at a good price and this system is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitecth Z-2300 very good","review":"I thoroughly researched computer speakers before buying and this product was consistently highly rated by consumers and experts alike.

Awesome deal, Great quality and unbelievable sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Speakers","review":"Wow. These speakers are insanity. When I want to blast music, I turn it up and rock out, although, with these speakers, blasting volume is only half way. The bass is also crazy. Very minor distortion except with crappy songs taken off cheap online sites and the such. Also extremely powerful. Don't let the satellite size fool you, these can pump out some serious sound. As for the mids, I have to agree that they are a little weak, but remember these are not $1000-5000 speakers. Plus, it is nothing your basic iPod or iTunes equalizer, or any equalizer for that matter, can't fix. If you want speakers, (and this, for sure, can not be limited to only computer speakers)and want some serious power behind them, I recommend you get these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control Issues","review":"The system was awesome for the first 5 minutes, and then the right speaker stopped working.

Too bad they don't tell you about the 10% THD part until you BUY THEM and read the specifications. I listened to these for about an hour, playing a variety of music CD's and just couldn't take it anymore. I should have known better to expect quality sound from speakers at this price. Sorry Logitech, if this is the best you can do, it's not good enough. Kudos to Amazon! They took them back and refunded my money quickly. I'll gladly buy more stuff in the future, just not these speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bass","review":"As my previous Logitech Z5300e, this Z2300e has the same problem.The bass is too loud and it bothers too much.I controlled the sound card, the equalizer and even that it was too loud.No clear voices.I returned the Z5300e speakers.And this Z2300e speaker I will change for Bose companion 2. I tested it and I can appreciate the difference.If you like a deafening bass you can buy this Z2300e Speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sub looked USED","review":"I purchased these Logitechs for a relative of mine. When we opened the box to set them up I immediately noticed a large scuff mark on top of the sub. It appeared to be used. I don't know if it was a refurb or a return, but it sure looked used. I am very disappointed with this. I recently purchased a Linksys router for the same relative and it had scratches on the top of it. The \\"install the software first warning sticker\\" that normally is covering the ports was off and stuck to the inside of the product literature. Someone also had scribbled on the product literature with a black permanent marker. I am not happy about this. I expect more from Amazon. A new item does not look like this.

I plugged in the remote to the sub-woofer, plugged the sub into the outlet, and nothing came on. I flipped the switch on the sub and the remote multiple times and nothing would come on, I even tried plugging them into different outlets. I called Newegg for a refund RMA, packed the speakers up and sent them back. I since then researched the problem with these speakers and found out the wired remote is very cheap and breaks easily, Logitech does not sell replacements. Avoid these speakers at all costs.I am now looking at the M-Audio AV30 speakers, which sound far superior to the Z-2300, and for that matter any PC speakers on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible noise","review":"I was happy with this Logitech Z-2300 for six months. Now, I am upset and disapppointed. The left speaker is making static noise and it's very disturbing. Next time, I will buy a set of speakers that are not from Logitech. I don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from the Logitech Z-2300 2.1 Speaker System","review":"Our son helped us buy the Logitech Z-2300 2.1 Speaker System and we just didn't realize how humongous the subwoofer actually is. It won't fit under our computer desk without removing the printer, which is impractical. Our current speaker system is old but has a much smaller subwoofer. Many modern subwoofers are small enough to fit under computer desks. That's what they are for. When we try to contact Amazon and type in our order number, we are switched to the Buy.com website. The Buy.com website doesn't have instructions for returning the speaker system, much less a way to get a return authorization number. Most companies Amazon deals with are much more user friendly. We have used other Logitech products for years and mistakenly thought that any seller of their products would also be user friendly. Not so! Stay away from the Logitech Z-2300 2.1 Speaker System and the Amazon/Buy.com tag team as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapomatic","review":"Not a good product at all. At low volume levels the volume seems to be coming more from the right, but when you turn it up it rebalances. Also, the sound quality isn't as great at the $60 Altec Lansings I bought at the same time for someone else in my office.Overall- Great for your teenager who will blast it at full volume on a rap song."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst purchase from Amazon till date..though not Amazon's fault","review":"After reading and spendign a week researching i ordered the z2300 from amazon for 130. The item was promptly delivered within 2 days. I carried the heavy box to my place and placed it in the center of my small apartment room with several friends and family overlooking. I was so excited to show off my new purchase as i had made such hype for it. Setup was very very simple, but imagine my surprise when i unhooked my existing 2.1 speakers and hooked on this one. The sound was worse than my existing one. Cranking up the volume to almost full began to show signs of sound and the sub started to show signs of working when it was 100%. I think it is defective..full bass and 40% volume just barely gives some bass. Exact same setup gives too much sound with my older cheap 2.1 speakers. This has to go back. 200w heavy bass system...i think not. Or maybe its just unlucky me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Arguably the BEST 2.1 speakers I have heard (and I have heard a lot).

Unless you're more of a \\"looks\\" person and don't care much for sound!If you want a GOOD 2.1 and don't mind spending 75-100 bucks ... BUY THESE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Giant Subwoofer...","review":"This product is a college student's best friend. With a subwoofer the size of a small pet, you'll shake the walls and let everyone in the dorm know who's the king of base. The peripheral speakers offer excellent quality as well. An adapter cable is included that allows DVD players, PS2's, etc. to feed sound input directly into the speakers. Since the sound quality of these speakers will dwarf the generic ones found in most TV sets, this functionality makes these speakers especially great for movie nights or whatever. All and all, this product has proven to give quality and functionality that one would not expect to find in its price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"z2300","review":"after you get the bass adjusted these are very good speakers for a small apt or room. in fact if you do not need loud music they are fine for most homes. the bass is solid down to @40hz and the mids are open and clean. the highs are a bit cold and harsh but it is hardly noticeable at normal listening levels. to get good clean sound you will need to tweak the frequency response curve significantly. i think you would need at least a CD level sound card with at least a 10 band frequency equalizer to get the most from these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"These are a great set of speakers for the price. I was also considering the klipsch 2.1 ultra speakers. The logitechs seem more reliable and have more bass. The logitechs have a 2 year warrenty vs. 1 year for the klipsch. The klipsch tend to die after a year leaving you out of luck. It seems that people are complaining about the midtones of the logitechs. To be honest they are not great but they are not horrible either, they are average. Keep in mind these speakers are mainly for bass type sound such as rap, techno, and video games.The only other speakers I would suggest is the 5500's by logitech. That is only if you want to spend the extra money. The 5500's are simply the best pc speakers available if you are into rap,techno,and gaming. For the budget shopper, the 2300's are the best value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thunder on the desktop!","review":"The Logitech Z-2300 is a fantastic sound system for your desktop computer.

I'll be a sad little man when/if they ever go out."},{"rating":"1","title":"These get old fast.","review":"I had these speakers for three months and was tricking myself into believing the hype. There is no balance between the tweeters and the ridiculously large subwoofer (it weighs 30 pounds!) I found myself turning down the bass all the way and constantly fiddling with the equalizer. I could never get the sound to mesh and always had what sounded like tin cans on my desk and a monster somewhere in the room. The listening experience gets tiring because of the poor range and if you consider yourself interested in Music at all these speakers will disappoint. Try and find an alternative that is more balanced with regards to Treble and Bass. Good luck on the search because it should not stop here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few Complaints, but a Great System Nevertheless","review":"By far, these z-2300 are one of the best 2.1 systems out there. For those who want the BEST sound, these are the way to go. My roommate has the klipsch 2.1. Essentially, they are identical, though one has a slightly more watts in the speakers (the logitech), one has more power in the sub (klispch). Either way, the $50 price difference makes these SUCH a better buy. Got it in 3 day, too Ordered on Tuesday, arrived actually on thursday, and picked up on friday).Minor Complaints:-The satellite wires are not as long as hope, along with the wires to the control pod.-There is a slight lack of midrange (like some people say), but just go to your iTunes or whatever and increase the 1k and 2k frequency a notch or two in the equalizer.-Not wall-mountable :(For the price ($69.99 + free shipping), it definitely cannot be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Cant beat price. good sound quality.

No distortion at max levels at low levels at any level. any perceived flaws are offset by the fact I have pounded these speakers for over 4 years with only gain in audio quality. commercial grade. nuff said. buy yesterday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Base, lacking in high end","review":"For the money, this system is powerful and will fill a room with music with great base. I like jazz music and have found the treble to be lacking. I listened to this system side by side with a Geneva XL system in my house recently. Now the Geneva is $2000. I felt this system held its own in a sound comparison, although the high end missed sublte parts of the music. Overall, for the money, it is a strong performer. The base and volume adjustment is also convenient.I did have problems with the small tweeters fading in and out sinc day one. I have just lived with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Z-2300 was a steal","review":"The system was well worth more than it's price. I looked at Fry's at Christmas time and they didn't have squat. I'm so glad I saved my money for the best value the Logitec Z-2300. My Soul Oldies have never sounded better. Rich bass woofer, that adjusts to all music types! The twin desktop speakers sound better than the overpriced ones that I currently have. My kids are even turning off the rapp and rockin' to the oldies. A must for true sound doctors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like money","review":"Bought these speakers a few months ago for my college dorm room. love the amount of bass this sub puts out, literally shakes my room and the two floors above me. hits highs and lows with perfection and clear true audio. for the price this package is a steal. well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value computer speakers \\".\\"","review":"These are simply the best computer speakers I have ever experienced.

So if you can't afford a good component system don't take it out on this little trio. No it doesn't have the greatest mid's, and yes it's hard wired BUT for a hundred bucks you can't expect it to produce a frequency response of a pair of high end monitors..........that's for your component system you apparently can't afford! NOW if you want a nice solid sounding little 2.1 COMPUTER system this will do the trick just fine. As others have said already it is for a close installation because of limited cord length but for the bucks you won't find anything out there better and if you do then buy it and quit whining about the lack of studio quality mid's."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed after 6 months","review":"Speakers sounded amazing at first.. I was very pleased with the sound quality . . But after about 6 Months the left speaker started to sound funny. Then after 7 months the left speaker totally stopped working.. So after messing around and plugging the left speaker into the right speaker input i realized that the speaker sounds fine. . It is the input on the back of the subwoofer, not the speaker that is the root of the problem. It just totally stopped sending sound. total crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE AMESOME MIGHT OF THESE SPEAKERS. EVERY SONG I LISTEN TO IS LIKE HEARING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. THERE ARE SO MANY BEAUTIFUL DETAILS IN THE MUSIC WHICH I COULD NEVER HEAR UNTIL NOW. NOT TO MENTION, THESE SPEAKERS ARE LOUD ENOUGH TO FILL MY ENTIRE 3 BEDROOM APARTMENT WITH BEAUTIFUL SOUND, NOT TO MENTION SHAKE THE WALLS .Here's a tip: If the bass is too loud for you, turn the bass dial all the way down on the remote and turn the bass down a little on your computer equalizer. That should do the trick and also prevent your neighbor's from trying to kill you.UPDATE: I changed this review from 5 stars to 2 stars. About a year after purchase, one of the speakers started buzzed whenever I play loud music. It makes it annoying and distracting. It' still under 2 year warranty, but it's a pain to ship to them so I haven't gotten it fixed yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product at great price","review":"I spend several hours a day workering at my computer in my home office and wanted to upgrade my computer speakers. After reading reviews on various products I decided to purchase a Logitech Z-2300 2.1 speaker system because it is well tested product with uniformly excellant reviews in computer mags. I also read the customer rating reviews for computer speakers (that are invariably favorable regardless of the product) to have an idea about other purchasers experiences and can report that this system was just what I expected and in my opinion deserves 5 stars.It arrived well packed, and is easy to set up. One last point about your computer system, I have a decent sound card and the sound is great, but have no idea about sound quality with mother board intergrated sound.

She can now identify and say the names of about 80% of the book, which she uses in everyday life. Her vocabulary is way above where she should be at her age, and I think looking at this book with her has helped alot! She did manage to rip a few of the pages out of it, but that's no surprise seeing she is only a toddler. Another great thing about it is the pictures. They are real pictures that a child will see from day to day, not cartoons or drawings like you see in most books for this age. If you have problems with your child sitting still long enough for you to read a regular book like I do, this one makes a great alternative because it is all interactive and will likely hold your child's attention longer. This book is a must have for all children of preschool age!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiral binding is NOT a good idea for little fingers...","review":"I'm giving this book 1 star with great sadness because my 13-month-old loves it. However, the spiral binding is a terrible idea. We have some of the other Priddy Bicknell books, and they've held up just fine. For 13 months, she's actually very careful. But even adults have some problems with spiral bindings (think of those photo albums with pages starting to tear out), so it was no great surprise when some of the pages ripped. And because of the binding, you can't tape them back in. If you want to read this with your child, fine, but what kid doesn't want to turn the pages herself?? Either plan to replace this---FREQUENTLY---or buy some of the other Priddy books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocabulary explosion","review":"If you read this book with your little one for only a few weeks they will learn all of the words in the book.

While being touted as a sci-fi novel, this book is actually a weird view of Christianity involving aliens. It made no sense and I was confused from page 1. The character names were unrealistic. The entire vision of the novel seems distorted by a blind-eyed world view. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about sci-fi. It cannot be compared to any futuristic novels in the sense of \\"this could actually happen\\". I was extremely disappointed.Whoever compared it to the great author Stephen King must be kidding!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This story was an incredible yawn. At it's best, it's a imaginative try at shoving religion down the reader's throat. \\"Stephen King\\" would enjoy? I think not.

Also, I am fully aware by reading the newspaper when this book was first published, that Jim McLean is her husband. Nice try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long read, but time well spent.","review":"I read this book because I am a big fan of Ken Blanchard and I was not let down. I could only take the book in small doses, taking over a month to read.

His courage, insight, and moral strength, are all revealed in this engaging translation.A must-have translation that outshines the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic of Aurelius and Finally a Majestic Translation","review":"Diminish outside forces that perturb the mind and soul! Aurelius's stoic philosophy is indeed a wise one but with this translation it is even more encompassing. It is only the will in a human that can be judged and controlled, everything else is beyond and should not effect emotions. To think that the Meditations were not even meant for anyone beside the Roman ruler himself, this translation is simple yet to the point without any embellishments, just the way Aurelius would have liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title - No, you give the review a title.","review":"More people would rate transactions if you (Amazon) didn't force customers to write a mini-essay before the upload was accepted.

Tale being the key word here. Although I can not account for all of his stories I can account for the ones that took place in my hometown. Some of the portrayals of people I know and have known my entire life are innacurate and down right offensive in many respects. His opinion of a lifestyle I was raised in and continue to be a part of is one of someone who totally missed the mark in his short lived experience with \\"The Life.\\" It's not only offensive to the people it's writtewn about but to anyone who has chosen the lifestyle he so wrongly describes. But if you are looking for a well written book of tales, then read it, but if you are looking for an accurate representaion of a true way of life, pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Up With Dreams & Reality","review":"I related very much with this book as I had very similar dreams as Clay. I also followed my dreams through college and finally faced with the real world let them go. But I have never regretted taking that path as did Clay.

Musically his voice is terrible and his rhymes are decent but sometimes weak, being on Psychopathic he mentions hatchets like every other verse. Guest appearances are no different from anything else on Psy, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Twiztid, Insane Clon Posse and believe it or not underground rapper Paris on the track \\"Ghetto Neighbors\\". Other Noteable Tracks are \\"Sticky Icky Situations\\" which sprise suprise is about smoking weed. Esham did a great job but Blaze and Violent J were weak. Then theres \\"In The City\\" which is an Eagles cover. Word to the wise, if you're trying to convince your fan base your a horrorcore gangster, dont cover The Eagles. So juggalos will say this review didn't help them but it dosnt matter because this is a real review. If your a juggalo youll like it, if you're an average rap fan, don't buy it, its terrible and is basically rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Esham is best thing about this album","review":"Esham is the best thing on this album. He shreds a nice long verse in Sticky Icky Situation. ABK has a really bad lisp. I don't think ABK has the skills to be a staying power on Psy. He will become a guest artist exlusively on Blaze's projects. It's nice to have a new Psy album, but they could have tightened up alot of the hooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical \\"Juggalo\\" release","review":"This, to me, is just another ... addition from another ICP protégé. Twiztid is the only other Psychopathic artist I have any respect for. At least their first release, Mostasteless, was uninfected by the \\"juggalo\\" sound. Artists like Blaze, Zug Izland, and the most current, ABK, just seem to be nothing more than protégés of ICP. Blaze's and ABK's raps are so simple and redundant they just insult the intelligence of the listener. Basically, about this album, all you need is to download one song and play it over and over again and you'll get the album. Here's an example that prooves ABK, like Blaze and Zug, is completely influenced by ICP. He has a song on this album called \\"Your Neden's Haunted.\\" The word neden is a word ICP came up with. The artists on Psychopathic really need to get their own style. Personally, I think every album released by Psychopathic doesn't have anything to do with the particular artist, it's just shameless self promotion by ICP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"This album shows the true \\"juggalo\\" sound. I like the songs Sticky Icky situations + its nice that Esham, Violent J, and Madrox were in that song, and ya nedens haunted is funny, and it proves a point. If your just gettin in to psychopathic records, I reccomend you try The Amazing Jeckel Brothers, or The Wraith : Shangri-La by Insane Clown Posse, or Mostasteless, or The Green Book by Twiztid. The only negative things about this album are his speach impedimate, and he talks to much abou his indian background, but hey I guess its his album, any way when your in to psychopathic, and know ICP, Twiztid, Blaze, ABK, KMK, etc... pick up this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf was this pile of sxxt","review":"Violent j and everyone else at psychopathic are grate at one thing thats marketing cause no i repeat no other label would be able to sell this garbage this guy cannot rap in the least he has a lisp for f$$k sakes any one i dont care if your a juggalo are what that buys this sxxt if you bump this in public i feel sorry for you mabye icp would revert back to the good olde days of the jeckal bros if they stopped wasting all there time signing no talent fxxk wads like this douche bag"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Juggalo Flava!","review":"ABK totally tears it up in this album! He is probabaly the best rapper in the Psychopathic family. The best thing is that the album is not watered down at all. Mike P did a great job on the production of this one. I think it is a much better product than the Blaze album. The guest appearances include some of the best lyrics to date from everybody. But they are not on every track so you really get a feel for what ABK is capable of. The best ones are from Esham. I am really excited to see what Esham has to offer in the future. The best tracks are Ghetto Neighbor, Hated me, Come out to play, While you were sleeping, and Gang related.

Most of the cast seem to be having a great time but too many jokes fall flat. Neither Gibson and Foster seem to have a clue playing Western characters. Like Billy Crystal in City Slickers with none of the irony. The film is lighthearted with chuck wagon loads of old TV western cliches. Guns being shot off peoples hands, Mel rescuing a run-away stagecoach, and a Royal Flush winning hand. Yawn. (Which shows how brilliant Spielberg was in Raiders of the Lost Ark, bringing a fresh variation to a tired action sequence.) Its all done by the numbers with no inspiration. If you're looking for a film about clever slight of hand and humourous double crosses you're better off watching The Sting with Newman and Redford.The movie was a great re-union of old TV western stars, country singers, and modern actors. I wish they remembered to make a movie worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie rocks but the DVD [doesn't]!!","review":"Now don't get me wrong, the movie was great.

Probably a bit of inspiration to the makers of Rounders as this movie was a bit more comedy than actual reflection on the game of Poker.Richard Donner and Mel Gibson are a team made in heaven. Mel Gibson always in good form, is the card shark on his way to winning a large poker competition...The early Western version of the WSOP. The problem is that he keeps running into people who in one way or another, don't want him to get there. Regarded as the best Poker player in the West, Maverick must outmanuveur a cunning temptress (Jodie Foster/Annabelle Bransford), a jealous degenerate cheat (Alfred Moline/Angel) and the host of the game and all around scalliwag (James Coburn/Commodore). The cast is on form and the action is always engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maverick, Gibson's Best","review":"I enjoyed this movie (although three hours long) and thought it to be very funny.

After you watched this movie, I'd bet YOU would want to be in the wild west, that's how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maverick Rocks","review":"If anyone saw the recent movie Shangai Noon, and you liked it, there is a better movie than that. It is called Maverick. Maverick is one of the best movies out there. You might think of it as a cheesy western before seeing it, like I thought it would be, but it is not. It is one the greatest rides you'll take in front of your tv sets in a long time. You see a new side of Mel Gibsons humor. And some of Jodie Foster's even a little too. The funniest person that steals the show, has got to be Ghramn Green as the indian. I didnt know how funny an actor he could be.

The price is very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY A DELIGHT!","review":"This is one of the greatest westerns I've ever seen. Mel Gibson proves that he can pull off playing an actor who doesn't fight every twenty or so minutes (he tried with HAMLET, but that didn't work out well at all). Jodie Foster is brilliant and sexy as Annabelle, and James Garner is also funny. One of the things that I found interesting is that Country music singers pop up in unexpected places. Clint Black plays one of the card players found cheating, and thrown off the boat. Waylon Jennings plays one that illeagly carries a gun with him (Kathy Mattea plays his wife in the scene). Also making appearences are Tracy Lawerence, Radney Foster, and Vince Gill and his ex-wife. If you like entertainment, westerns, or just good clean fun, then you need to see this film from the director of the LETHAL WEAPON films and CONSPIRACY THEORY. Also look for Danny Glover in a surprise appearence. YEEEEHAAAWWW!

There are all sorts of \\"nods\\" to the Western genre and all the \\"old\\" actors who played characters on the old TV and film Westerns.

Feynman didn't consider his books to be autobiographies; they were \\"Adventures of a curious character.\\" They were a few hilarious events picked from his long, full life.Gleick's book covers many of the hilarious aspects, but also covers the painful and formative aspects. Also curiously missing from Feynman's books were his science. Feynman wrote about his adventures, Gleick covered the adventures, the disasters, and the science.Brilliant, enthralling reading. Highly recommending to anyone who enjoyed Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Which is, in turn, recommended to anyone who likes funny stories. It reads fast, BTW.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very tough read","review":"The author rambles on, jumping back and forth in time, between completely unrelated subjects. Just when it begins to get interesting, we jump back in time to some boring and irrelevant story of childhood, then when we come back, we are on a different story... ? It's good because it's about Feynman, but the writing is just terrible. I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on Feynman's own books instead","review":"I almost stopped reading this book after the first few chapters- very dry reading, and the author repeatedly goes for 2-3 pages without even mentioning Feynman, instead going off on a tangent about some other person involved with quantum theory. Not a good thing to do in a biography.You might as well just stick to Feynman's own books, \\"Surely You're Joking\\" and \\"What Do You Care\\", rather than pay to read this guy paraphrasing them both in this book. A few different anecdotes here and there, but not many. Often times you can't tell if Gleick is quoting something Feynman said himself, or some other person did, without turning to the notes in the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"no no no... i am not in a particularly bad mood. it is a plain fact that the book is neither based on extensive reseach or that it is well written. gleick is known for his bestseller \`\`chaos: making a new science''. it was a good book. but that does not mean (of course) this book, too, is good. gleick traces what was already presented in \`\`surely, you're joking, mr. feynman'' and its sequel. in effect, he not only traces them, he simply repeats them (in longer sentences).a much better biography is jagdish mehra's."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever seen.","review":"This book is so bad that I didn't make it past the first few pages. Another reviewer here agrees with me that this book gets off to a very bad start immediately when he says, \\"I almost gave it up after the first couple chapters, but finally made it through it all.\\"The problem I have with this book is that the author describes events in Feynman's life in a way that could not possibly allow the reader to get a proper sense of the events. It is like he is combining different events into the same dissusion. Totally distroying the context of the events. Anyone who has read the other great Feynman books that are out there will cringe when they attempt to read this book. If you have never read a book about Feynman, do no start with this one. Start with \\"Surly you're jokeing Mr. Feynman.\\" This book is legendary for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum...","review":"I read Genius for a college literature course. I thought the book was pretty boring. Some of the personal stories of Richard Feynman were interesting, but there were very few of them compaired to the remainder of the book. Other parts were intensely boring. Most of the book contained theories of physics. A pretty silly concept considering this is a biography!Overall I'd say this book was rather pointless. If you're a physicist or fan of physics (I prefer biology, myself) go ahead and read it. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance Personified","review":"There are a number of books about, and by, Richard Feynman. James Gleick's telling of the genius that was Feynman is the best by far. For most of us 'normal' people, this is the closest we will get to insight-fully understanding a restless mind whose approach to figuring impossible things out was a wonderful combination of logic and quantum leaps of brilliance. A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Account","review":"Mr. Gleick's 1992 biography of Richard Feynman is an informative and enlightening journey through not just the life of the subject, but through the exciting world of physics from the early 20th century through the 1980's. While the first 100 pages were a tough read, the remainder was a reward; Feynman's brilliance and brutal honesty are on full display. Mr. Gleick does a nice job also of providing ample background on Feynman's colleagues/competitors/mentors, etc. and provides pretty clear explanations of the concepts brought to life by Feynman & Co. As a biography, this work is first-rate and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb example of how even a genius is human.","review":"The book is one of the best biographies of Feynman, it motivated me to find out more about this great man of science. I was really drawn to the human side of Feynman. I was a bit disappointed that the book ended with what seemed to be a cursory look at his later years. I would have liked to learn more about his outlook on life, science, religion, etc in the latter part of his career. I enjoyed the book immensely"},{"rating":"2","title":"Think you're bright. Read GENIUS and be humbled by Feynman.","review":"The magic and GENIOUS of Richard Feynman willinspire you, humor you, and awaken you to thewonderful world of physics. I couldn't put itdown.

What more isthere?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive guide","review":"There are many books by and about Feynman. The quality of Gleick's research and writing makes this book more comprehensive than any other biography on Feynman and this book also explains many complex physics ideas and concepts in simple language. This book energises the lover of physics and bestows the ability to understand high level concepts to the layman. By all accounts this is what Feynman was about and this book is essential reading for both physicists and couch-scientists. Incidentally the only people I've met who don't like the book are physicists who don't like Feynman all that much! For everyone else, enjoy. I have 3 copies and I'm keeping every single one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just the life of Feynman, but Feynman's view of life.","review":"A man as brilliantly lucid as Richard Feynman deserves a biography equally brilliant and lucid. James Gleick achieves this. And though Richard Feynman is painted in human tones, the reader still experiences the mystique which surrounded this legend of science.Some of the most enjoyable sections of this book deal not with physics or biography, but Feynman's philosophy and refreshingly rational worldview.This book is a testament to the power and beauty of a great intellect, in its all its humanity.My only reservation with this otherwise astounding book is that it was, at times, a bit too glowing and not critical enough. Feynman is presented as a scientific hero, but as we all know too well, even heros are not without their faults. As for these, as Feynman himself said, \\"it does no harm to the mystery to know a little about it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clean fun","review":"DiRT is one of those games that come around every so often that gets the balance between fun and progression just right. By introducing different event types as you progress through the long career mode the developers keep the game interesting and encourage you to keep going. The various vehicle types also cover a wide spectrum and have very distinct handling styles which keep you on your toes when switching between the different events.A nice little feature that is worth a mention is the engaging way that the game keeps you entertained during loading sequences by showing a rotating selection of your game related statistics (most rolls, longest slide etc).Overall a great driving game that I've found myself playing more than the other recent large release in this genreForza Motorsport 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arcade upgraded","review":"Very good Graphics and handling for an arcade game, fun for a pro gamer and racing fan. better played with racewheel. 10++ for my taste.

The default difficulty is just right for me that I average 2nd overall and usually finish a race on first or second try. Damaging your car is also fun. Lots of parts come off he car until you see the engine and the wheels falls off. Many different view points. I especially like driving the slow support trucks, which you can magically get it to right side up if you're tipped over 90% as long as the side doesn't touch the ground haha. Buggies are fun too. The super car uphill climbs are also great, you can feel the speed. Graphics is one of the most amazing for the XBox. I would say this is way better than Sony's MotorStorm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great off-road racing","review":"I love racing games but had only ever played one off-road racer before. Decided to try it again and am happy I did. The game has very good graphics and decent sound as well. The career mode is my favorite style of play, being able to try different kinds of racing, tracks and vehicles one race after another keeps the racing fresh.The championship mode is also good, having to race more than one race to take the title is challenging when you set your vehicle up before the first race and can't change after that and the second race may have a totally different surface to race on. Having to fix damage in between races can be tricky as well since you only have 60 minutes to spend on several repairs, you may have to let some things slide.The game is quite a lot of fun overall and I recommend it to anyone that loves racing games, plus you can't beat the reduced price now either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more out of this.","review":"I'm a big fan of Nascar, World of Outlaws, and Motocross so I'm always on the lookout for a good racing game. However, this game is mediocre at best and quickly becomes boring. The graphics are beautiful but that is about all this game has going for it. There just isn't enough head to head racing. Most of the game consists of point to point racing on empty dirt roads in time trial competitions. The truck races are my favorite but there just aren't enough of them in the game. If the game was all truck racing then I would probably like it much more. I played this game really heavy for about a week, but I quit pretty quickly after that. I just wasn't having fun. After all isn't the point of playing games having a good time? This game is boring. I'll take Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo over this any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Menus give me a headache","review":"The menu system in this game is simply horrible. In order to make it flashy & cool looking, the programmers used a menu system which shows the text flying up out of the background at high speed, hovering for a second & then flying forward at you through the camera.Then while youre waiting for the game to load (which takes awhile) it uses the same flashy flying 3-d text nonsense to flash stats at you. Every menu in the game uses this annoying system, and theres no way to choose a less headache-inducing menu system.It may be a great game, i dont know, since i can never play it for more than 1/2 an hour without getting a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Title-silly book","review":"This reminds me of a book report I turned in in 4th grade, and as I recall, I got a D-.

There is so much material in the vaults from these shows, that this just doesnt cut it. Now, If you DONT own the Fillmore Concerts, this is still the best version available and the one you should get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Album, Poor Packaging, Could have beem better","review":"One of the best live albums of all time, I was hoping for more when they released this as a Hybrid 5.1 SACD.1) Its now 2 cds again. And you would think they would have 2 seperate holders for the cds. They just piled them on top one another.2) The surround sounds don't use the backs enough. I think the quality of the recording hinders the effectiveness of surround sound. I never feel like I am at the concert, unlike other surround sound discs.Update:I had a problem with the back speakers on my stereo.Now, it sounds like the audience is behind you.I now feel like I am at the concert. It's amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best live rock and roll album ever - bar none!","review":"Five stars is not enough for this record! When I was 13, I bought the original double LP when it came out for something ridiculous like $5.47. I'm now on my fourth (or fifth?) copy and it's still one of the first albums I reach for when I want to hear something special. God! What possessed those boys on those two nights? The whole was definitely greater than the sum of it's parts. If you don't own it, buy it, cherish it, and be glad the tape machines were running so the rest of us could get to hear it.

The Allmans had toured prior to this as the Allman JOys and Hour Glass. This lp is brilliant for its takes of the blues cuts and its improvisational style but not really surprising . They had indeed paid their dues and it shows with the cuts Whippin Post , Liz Reed, Statesboro Blues and more . They also have a cut on Isle of Wight and Atlanta live Lp. They were very hot doing these cuts and are now getting the acclaim that at first was hard to come by and sometimes forgotten after the deaths of Duane and Berry Oakley. For the new fan look for Dickie Betts solo lps such as Atlanta Burning Down as he said \\"the closest thing to winning is losin and sometimes it gets so confusin\\". Very good music.

Then I said, \\"No way! They're getting a lot of airplay on the radio and even Miley Cyrus likes them... they're real southern rock!\\" and they all started guffawing and ROFL'ing at me. This old hippie with a long white beard and ponytail told the bartender to play some Allman Brothers to show \\"this kid what real southern rock is\\". Needless to say I hated it! The guitar playing is boring, the songs are WAY too long and the singer sounds like a redneck.. for real southern rock check out Kings Of Leon, Kid Rock, Carrie Underwood, Garth Brooks and Taylor Swift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to its reputation","review":"Believe all the praise you've heard about this live set, because it's truly one of the best live albums ever. The Allman Brothers jam to perfection on blistering numbers that rival and surpass their studio counterparts.

Afficianados of live albums should find this gem worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"SACD music","review":"OK, I'll start off by saying I am real biased FOR this receording. I used to work at the Fillmore East and I was there for the weekend this concert was recorded. If you're an Allman Brothers fan there is no reason to have to convince you that this has some of the best live songs ever recorded. The band was hot and tight. One thing I loved was getting the long jams that are very different than the studio equivalents, if any. The Allman Brothers defined Southern Rock.For the SACD abilities... The original recording was mastered by Tom Dowd and he had a hand on the SACD too. The only adjustments I make are when I want to emphasize something. Otherwise it's clean, open and mellow. At times you realy feel to be in the audience.This recording is must for any Allman Brothers fan.

The songs that appeal to most listeners may well be Pride and Bad, but the pure emotion Bono rings out of \\"Elvis Presley and America\\" can't be denied. It is one of my favorite U2 tracks of all time. The Edge and Adam sound amazingly in sync with Larry throughout the cd, yet it sounds more like a comfortable jam session rather than a cd of take after take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Forgettable","review":"The songs on this CD are just not as captivating as on other releases such as Achtung Baby. The rhythms are fairly interesting, however the song structure relies on a simple chord structure. Therefore, no matter how creative The Edge may be, the songs just are not well developed. The title track, Wire, and Bad are probably the strongest tracks here and they are not overly fabulous. Promenade is a bit incomplete and Fourth Of July sounds like mere filler. The tone is a bit too angry for me over the course of the CD although others might not mind anger too much. For my money, I'll choose Achtung Baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable album...","review":"Even after 15 years, I still listen to this CD one in a while.

But U2 (along with R.E.M., the Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam and Nirvana) gave me proof that alt-rock wasn't a total loss. And The Unforgettable Fire is a hell of an album. Highlights include Pride (In the Name of Love) - one of my favorite U2 songs, and certainly one of their best hits; chilling anti-drug ballad Bad; A Sort of Homecoming; the experimental Wire (a good showcase for Brian Eno's production) and the title song. I don't think I'll spin Elvis Presley and America, Promenade, or 4th of July again, and this is nowhere near the level that The Joshua Tree reached.

But listen to the shimmering and pulsing bell-like tone of the acoustic guitars which Eno invented...And the vocal/lyric Bono laid on top of the instrumental was completely improvised (its recording was captured in their film about the making of this album). They took a chance on releasing this song because of its unconventional, \\"ambient\\" feel--it's meant to draw you in, not compel your attention (I think the Edge's minimal & chiming style was influenced by a record Eno produced a few years earlier--\\"Ambient 3: Day of Radiance\\" by hammered dulcimer player Laraaji)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Debut with the Eno/Lanois team.","review":"The Unforgettable Fire is a fair album but not U2's best.

Jay-z and Linkin Park are polar opposites, but considering that, the music they made together is pretty good. It's something new despite it being just remixed songs. Give it a try, it's not bad not bad at all. In fact it's amazing.*A previous reviewer commented that Mike had made completely new lyrics in \\"Points Of Authority / 99 Problems / One Step Closer.\\" That's not completely true. All he did was rap a verse that was in the original \\"99 Problems\\" by Jay-z. He changed the point of view so instead of it being in first person view it's in third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who woulda thought?","review":"I'm impressed. Not gonna lie. I absolutely love Linkin Park. They're one of my favorite bands and always will be and this cd helped that much more. I'm mostly into all rock and all kinds of it. I go from Linkin Park, to Slipknot, to Mudvayne, to Sevendust, and then to Incubus, Hoobastank, Creed, Crossfade, and even Matchbox 20...weird I knowI'm not to big into rap or hip-hop. Jay-Z just happens to be one of the few rappers that I don't think are too bad. Lucky me.These guys are mix masters! Especially when it came to the mix of Dirt Off Your Shoulders and Lying From You. This song is just pure mix talent and it blew me away. All of the songs are awesome. My favorites are Dirt Off Your Shoulders/Lying From You, Izzo/In The End, and obviously Points of Authority/99 Problems/One Step CloserThe only thing that kept it from getting 5 stars was that there isn't enough songs.

This is in my opinion one of the few cd's out there just justify the purchase. even if it is just to enjoy the fusion of teo unlike, but highly complementary artists from the last decade.The dvd is a great bonus that shows the studio process that brings these artists together and honestly, there is not one single weak track throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geat mash up CD","review":"Jay-Z mixed with Linkin Park what an amazing idea and I am glad they did it.

They have rehashed their old stuff way too many times for me to actually sit up and take notice. They have now become too mainstream and concerned about money and this has ultimately cost most of the public's respect both on this side and across the Atlantic.Songs like \\"99 Problems/Points of Authority/One Step Closer\\" are worth a listen but pretty soon you'll be craving for more of what they have become successful for. Does the likes of \\"Hybrid Theory\\" ring any bells to you?I was a fan of Linkin Park, now I'm yearning for the old days where they weren't so mainstream. I won't be holding my breath for their next offering it'll probably be just another album full of recycled old stuff from the good old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?!?!?","review":"Let's get one thing out of the way...Linkin Park is the best rock band in existence and Jay-Z is some loser rapper who is just trying to steal someone else's talent to make more $$mula$$. These songs are HORRIBLE. I'd rather listen to elevator music or the crap they play when they put you on hold. i don't actually OWN the CD, but i heard some of it from my friend who likes rap. RAP IS CRAP...Jay-Z steals every song with little to no singing of Chester and Mike. The classic Linkin Park stuff is ruined by Jay-Z's annoying voice and low-talent lyrics. I just hope LP doesn't do something stupid like this again and that their next CD blows everything else away. Linkin Park...ROCK ON. Jay-Z...get a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Linkin Park's worst","review":"I wasn't expecting very much from this album but what I heard was total garbage. It just doesn't work.

Most of the songs they combine barely relate to each other at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"Look just buy Meteora and Hybrid Theory from Linkin Park. Now if you only listen to rap then you'll probably just buy to this album. The point is that this is pretty much the same thing as the normal songs except in the middle they'll cut and put in part of a Jay Z song or vice versa.

The styles of each artist compliment eachother nicely, and they feel like actual songs instead of remixes.If you like either Jay-Z or Linkin Park, it's worth it. I bought it when it was first released and I still listen to it this very day. This is an underrated effort in the \\"Mash-up\\" genre, that proves the potential of the style. If it wasn't so short I would call it a rounded unique musical album, but due to its length it still a remix/ep album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Reanimation not a butchery enough?","review":"I'm with everyone who wonders what the hell happened to Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory was solid gold; Reanimation was anywhere from slight improvement (Crawling) to absolute butchery (In The End) of the same songs. Now LP has apparently decided that Reanimation wasn't enough of a mockery of their music, so they sent their songs to one of the most awful rappers in the world to be crapped all over and mutilated even more. WHY?!? WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO DESERVE THIS?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay-Z & Linkin Park. Just isn't worth it.","review":"Jay-Z is a rapper. Linkin Park \\" raps \\". They try to; better said. A pro. rapper mixed with a mediocore? I don't think so. Song like \\" Jigga What? \\" shouldn't be mixed with rock. \\"Dirt off Ya Shoulder\\" ? Again, I don't think so. Although I did like Numb/Encore this just isn't worth it. If you want rap, buy a Wu-Tang Clan cd. If you want rock, get Korn or Puddle of Mudd."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"I think collaborations like this are stupid and pointless.

He has some tight songs, for sure... but Linkin Park is music for idiots. Why take a pretty good track like \\"Big Pimpin\\" and ruin it with LP? What do you expect when you take a song thats already half-crappy like \\"Izzo\\" and put the worst representation of modern rock behind it? Sure, an improvement for Linkin Park, but does Jay-Z really want his name attached to this piece of dung? Too late for second guesses, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW COULD THEY DO SUCH A THING?!","review":"I was a Linkin Park fan for a while, but then got into heavier stuff like: SYSTEM OF A DOWN, KORN, and DISTURBED.

This is the worst \\"music\\" anyone could hear...They took GREAT songs and made them into monstroseties! It is just downright WRONG to hear Numb all MESSED UP and LAODED with profanity! That was a prestine and happy song....Now it is tainted with EVIL!! No one get this lest you acquire a curse!! These are surley dark days...Linkin Park has betrayed me and all its fans!

But this untalented work of earsplitting noise is saturated with \\"selloutism\\". Again, Linkin Park's previous albums (with the exception of Reanimation and Live in Texas) were actually worth listening to. Jay-Z was always crap so we can skip that.

I thought it was a good CD, find out for yourself, and check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"High energy, good mix of styles but short","review":"Every song on this album should be played LOUD. It is a great high energy mix of both styles. The album can get you hyped up fast. They work really well together and actually mix well, not something I can say for most rock or rap artists music. I enjoy both Jay Z and Linkin Park separatley but really liked this partnership project, MORE than listening to them separatley. I find I get bored with a whole ablum of one or the other.Unfortunatley the album is only 5 or 6 songs long, and at a hefty price at that. That is the reason for my 4 stars and not 5. I wish for the $26 I saw this album selling for at retail stores that more was included. However if there was no more good material to be had, then I am happy they didn't waste their time filling in the album with junk. Every song on this is REALLY good, I just wouldn't pay $26 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Nice","review":"As a fan of both of the genres of music combined in this recording and the artists themselves, I love this album.

Second the songs are so different from the other songs they sang without Jay-Z (even though they are just remixes) that it doesn't even seem like LP wrote them. Most of these song are basically remixes with Jay-Z singing most of the lyrics. If you are a LP fan then don't get this CD, it will change your mind anout LP , in a bad way, just wait for their next CD (hopefully without anyone else)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Jay-Z? WHY?!?!?!","review":"Out of ANY band in the world, dumb MTV had to choose Jay-Z! ANY band would have been better! It would even be better if LP teamed up with AC/DC. (That wouldn't be bad actually) JZ is always singing he is a pimp... NO HE ISNT! He is loser rapper who THINKS all the ladies love him. Also, when they mashed up the songs, the songs lost all meening. These are some lyrics for One Step Closer and 99 problemsEverything you say to me, 99 problems and a bitch aint one.Do you understand those words? I don't... Unfortunitly, I own the CD, but do yourself a favor and don't buy it.

The concept itself didn't entirely appeal to me, either. The LP disc \\"Reanimation\\" had much the same effect on me, so if one enjoyed that, they will likely appreciate this work, as well.A lot of the music was Jay-Z rapping over LP's tracks, not really my scene altogether. But, again, others may enjoy this more. I personally would opt for \\"Meteora\\" or \\"Hybrid Theory\\" over this particular one.I think the thing that irritated me most was that when mixing the songs, there was little connection between the LP lyrics, and the Jay-Z lyrics. Connecting any work written by the former with the song \\"Big Pimpin'\\" seems extremely out there on a thematic level.I did like the \\"99 problems/One step closer\\" connection, however. That is why i have given this album 2 out of 5. I'm sure it is well worth the purchase for others, however, it is not my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh waste of money","review":"Linkin Park is an awesome band but this album is a lot heavier on the rap side rather than rock. Here's how I rate their songs:1. Dirt Off Your Shoulder/Lying From You-4/5 I like the heavy guitar songs in this song more than the rapping.2. Big Pimpin'/Papercut-1/5 Geez this is the worst and most annoying song I ever heard3. Jigga What/Faint-2/5 Decent. Gets good once the faint music kicks in.4. Numb/Encore-4/5 This song is actually pretty good. Nice music.5. Izzo/In The End-1/5 The reanimation version of In the end wasn't good and this mash up isn't any better6.

Even though there is six songs, which they shoulda made more, they are all sweet. I recommend this cd to everyone. The best song is jigga what/ faint. It sounds so tight. Encore/Numb is good too. More artist should do this and blend there music together, but I recommend better bands like 311!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"for those of you with an appreciation for all types of music this is a really good album.

LP/JZ ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"Personally I'm not a fan of rap perfromers such as Jay-Z, still like LP's style. But mixed with LP's beats and lyrics this is worth listening. Some parts of this release are spectacular and both performers complement each other very nicely. However only there are only 6 tracks. Other parts with only rap-style beats and Jay-Z's voice alone don't sound so attractive.Overall: recommended if you either like LP or Jay-Z."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is unreal...","review":"Wow, surprised is not even the word to describe what I felt when I heard of the mash-up. This CD I can literally listen to two of my favorite songs at once. As a big fan of Jay-z, and Linkin Park to another degree, this idea was heaven.

Numb/Encore was good as well, however Izzo/Faint was rather dismal and the only thing that keeps me from scoring this a fat 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"can i get an encore.....more more more","review":"The Cd is bananas. Brilliant. The only knock is that it's too short but it leaves the fan thirsting for more. Numb/Encore and Jigga What/Faint are weaved seamlessly into perfection.

If you didn't like these particular songs spearate, before the mix then you probably wont like them now."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad this Album is","review":"This album is the worst Linkin Park Album ever.

There were only six songs, and now this CD is left unlistened to inside my CD case. I do not reccomend this to LP fans. Instead, get Hybrid Theory or Meteora"},{"rating":"1","title":"should not have been done","review":"I have sat and listened to this all the way through now at least 10 times as I drove from Sacramento, California to Vancouver, Washington. So I would say that I have given it a fair listen. What is the most interesting is the contrast in talent between Linkin Park and Jay-z. It wouldn't be anywhere near as noticeable if they weren't paired together like this. Every time Jay-z jumps in it's as if the music just trips over itself and dies. Linkin park is very good. It's strong, well written, emotional, rock n' roll with other genres thrown in here and there with little rap and a little electronica. But when it switches to just rap it's as if all the life was sucked out of the song. I do not understand why Jay-z is as popular as he is. He's just not very good. I will be returning this. Hopefully Linkin Park will be releasing a new cd soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is anyones (but the nerds below me) worse nightmare.

By singing, I mean Jay-Z crooning about his \\"hoez, blingz, n' thuhg lief\\", and those two whiny retards crying out Korn and Limp Bizkit B-sides, with an added \\"industrial\\" touch to it, just so its extra catchy and can be played in a DDR machine.I could go on, but I probally already gave 200+ Inuyasha f@gs heart attacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay Z - go away!","review":"Linkin Park is my favorite band.

I was very excited to buy this CD; once I listened to it I was extremely disappointed. The songs have been shredded and turned into who can be the biggest pimp. I was saddened at the use of foul language; one of the reasons I kept buying Linkin Park CDs was that they expressed thimselves without explicit lyrics.

I know many will disregard my review because I dislike hip-hop, but i must tell you, Linkin Park had Hip-Hop before, and I liked it, so I thought this wouldn't be different. This is not only a bad cd, it's just stupid. Why combine Jay-Z and make more rap to your already rap-metal genre? And why do they continue to take the same songs, and make remixes (hence, Reanimation(sucked)). I'm not saying you won't enjoy this, but... listen to it!

They didn't even attempt to match the moods or lyrical content of the songs. This music is completely ridiculous and anyone with half a brain would realize the idiocy of it.

I try to use the classic Northern Spy since it taste great and is so huge that 4 or 5 will make a pie. Yes, the core is so big that some seeds may be left, but they are easily cut out. I haven't noticed the thin slice issue and like the ability to use one, two or three of the modes as needed. Incidentally, it peels so fast that microdrops of juice shoot into the air and I prefer to use it outside or cover it with a towel inside to avoid sticky floors.

It's like during the whole movie, all you hear is dogs whining, and loud poor-sounding music. If I wouldn't have read the book before, I would have never gotten the plot.

The book is written from the dog's perspective. The movie is more from Heston's position. The plot was changed. The characters in the scenes were incorrect.

Call of the Wild is not the worst movie, but the quality of the dvd is very aweful like it is an archaic film which affects enjoyment of the movie. This movie is very similar to White fang : the wolf/dog, a loyal companion of the human, people saying the wolf/dog is vicious, accidently finding gold, a character falling into the ice lake and running around the fire to keep warm, enemies attacking the cabin and also lighting it on fire, wolf/dog parts with main character but reunites several times.

This is the probably the best of Cream's 4 albums. The classic Sunshine Of Your Love is the best song on the album. It was just one of those songs that totally changed music. Cream was the first real hard rock band. SWLABR(She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow) has nonsense lyrics but what a great riff. Strange Brew and Tales Of Brave Ulysses are also great classics with a psychedelic twist. The blues of Take It Back, Blue Condition, and Mother's Lament reflect Cream's really soulful side. None of the extended jams like on their first album and really no weak or tiring songs. This is one of the classic albums of 1967. A definite winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remaster ripp-off","review":"I can't believe this. just recieved Disraeli Gears remasters.

I rate this as their fnest work, as the power trio took music to a new plateau, which, in my opinion is what great bands such as Cream succeed in doing. Clapton's wailing, bluesy guitar work is superb here, especially on Sunshine of Your Love and Tales of Brave Ulysses. Jack Bruce proves why he is probably the greatest bassist that rock has ever seen, while also demonstrating a wonderful vocal talent as well. Ginger Baker plays the drums masterfully as well with double kicks galore. This is the band that paved the way for wannabes like Led Zeppelin to follow but never quite reach the infinitely high musical plateau reached by the power trio during the two short years in which they forever changed music."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest rock LP's of all time","review":"This is a well-conceived vinyl reissue of Cream's iconic Disraeli Gears album.Sound is well-defined with very good imaging.

The book is a no-holds-barred look at how the JCS and DOD messed up the Vietnam war. The author says that the war was not lost on the battlefield, or on the campuses or streets, or in the press but right in Washington. He backs his claim with solid evidence. A courageous book written by a career army officer. As a retired officer and Vietnam vet I admire the author's honesty.

Pure nonsense, those guys in the ivory tower didn't understand the nature of the war anymore than the author does. Much like the Germans after WWI, this stabbed in the back theory is a little old and counter-productive. LeMay and the rest of those WW II dreamers were completely ignorant of the political and nationalistic forces at work in Vietnam. Following their suggestions would have only escalated the war to include China. Those fools were even talking about using nukes. Was establishing a South Vietnam worth all that?

Although they would seek to expand on their sound with later albums(BEAUTY STAB most notably--their most Roxy Music sounding album. \\"That was then, this is now\\" is probably the closest clone of \\"All I want is you\\" and \\"Out of the blue\\" of all of their songs), this is the album where it all came together.

This book is helpful to give the caregiver a different perspective on AD and it's nice to know that you're not alone in your struggles. It also reminds you that others have it worse than you do. I recommend this book for anyone who has elderly relatives, with the increased incidence of AD the chances are pretty good/bad that a relative will suffer from it.

I highly recommend this book for anyone who is dealing with the care of someone who has dementia or alzheiners - not everything will apply, but so many useful tips, bits of information and things to think ahead about..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I just got Abe's Exoddus for Christmas, the movie clips are very good, and funny (Some are also a bit sad.). The game play is even better than Abe's Oddysee. The gamespeak/character speak is much better. I like being able to possess most of the other inhabitants now, and the best thing is being able to have more than one Mudokon follow you at a time.

It sounds dreamy, breathy, smexy, indie-rock, all melded together perfectly. Everything seems to work (Even the occasional screaming in the background). It sounds balanced, moving, and fun.They sing entirely in French and while I can't understand it, it sounds beautiful. I've heard though that once you find out what the lyrics really mean, that you won't like the songs so much. The titles of the songs kind of are a tip-off though. Urine infection, cancer, tourettes syndrome, hallucinations, schizophrenia, death, and bipolar disorder (those are the ones easiest to figure out.)Just a side note though, I put the actual CD into a regular CD case after I finally managed to get it out. (Because it probably took me half an hour to get out.) It's easier this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forty Years with Sourdough Jack","review":"I\`ve been using Sourdough Jack\`s little book, with pleasure and benefit, since 1966.

It also had a little pack of sourdough starter, stapled inside the front cover. The descendants of that bit of yeast are still going strong and giving culinary pleasure to family and friends here in Australia.I\`ve always enjoyed Jack\`s racey and folksey style.

This, by far, is the WORST textbook I've seen in my 5 years of college career. Look I am not bitter and I am a good student with a 3.9 GPA.I will back up my reasons why this book is bad. The illustrations do not come with legends or labels. Readers are suppoed to guess what the white circle, black squares, green circles stand for. Plus the authors only give a very sketchy introduction to the diseases and they don't explains anything well enough for you to understand the questions.

In my opinion, this is better for younger kids who don't want a more sophisticated game. But there are a lot of fun mini-games included, so it is definitely interesting. The music is okay, but nothing to write home about. The graphics are okay for a playstation 1 game, and the sound effects are good. However, the camera angle can be a little tricky, but once you remember which key moves the camera you should be fine.The story behind it is what I find the most interesting.

Great video quality and storage capacity.> The biggest drawback is the lack of software upgrades and the lack of customer support.**** BEWARE *** I don't think they have upgraded the firmware in years and this is a huge issue because the old sync software is now obsolete and I cannot get my Windows XP Pro OS to read the device. So I basically lost the music I had on there, though I am holding on to the device in case I find a way to recover the music files.> The i-tunes sync software and how it syncs and manages playlists BLOWS AWAY ANY COMPETITION including the Creative Zen software because as I said, Creative software is obsolete and useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick up this album!!","review":"I had never heard of these guys until I went to a concert at my church.

It's an outstanding overview of the subject at the heart of National Geographic -- photography. The images created through specialized cameras, such as infrared, photomicrography, electrophotography, high speed and more, truly do reveal the unseen realms in our world. Although I would credit Alexander Scourby as NG's best narrator (\\"The Sharks,\\" \\"The Superliners\\"), Richard Basehart's reading of the flawless script is captivating. William Goldstein's feature film-quality music score adds the high gloss varnish to what might otherwise be a fairly routine docucmentary. The music sparkles and punctuates each scene with a whole new level of interest. If this were a feature film, I'd buy the soundtrack album in a heartbeat. If you only have one National Geographic Special in your library, one that can be enjoyed by just about anyone at any age, \\"The Invisible World\\" is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video for children","review":"I saw this video as a child of 13 or 14 years.

You need a return merchandise authorization from Maxtor. You have to ship the drive back to Maxtor at your cost. They will then send you a replacement unit.

I figured that the company would charge an outrageous price for a replacement, but was shocked when they told me that they do not have a replacement. Furthermore, they were not able to provide me with a technical description of the cord so that I could try to buy it elsewhere. They were able to tell me that no current models use the same cord, however.I bought this drive for long-term storage/backup.

If I hadn't already bought the whole series I would have stopped reading after the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's all the hoopla about?","review":"I have read alot of books in my lifetime and can't quite understand how these books get such high reviews. The first book was ok., a little boring but I thought it would pick up in the second book. Wrong... it just got more boring, \\"Mother Night\\"! If I had to read that expression one more time I think I'll barf.This is a book where almost nothing happens and the characters are so flat and boring except of coarse Dameon who is the White Knight/ Don Wan of the story. Oh well they have pretty covers and they look good in my collection. At least they are good for something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 2nd book in the series","review":"This second entry into the Dark Jewels trilogy was just as good as the first. The characters were a bit toned down (i.e. Saetan) and not as much dark violence was shown. The character development of Jaenelle was excellent, and poor Daemon took a distant backseat in this entry. However, due to the ending of this book, Daemon should be back in full in the third and final book. Lucivar was much more fully developed, and sometimes his antics made me outright laugh. Can't wait for the third book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live the Darkness...","review":"And so the saga continues. What was begun in Daughter of the Blood grows to maturity in this second stunning chapter in the web of Story. As engrossing as the first book, Heir to the Shadows will wrap its dark wings around your heart and become a part of you. No one who has read this book and truly experienced all it has to offer remains unchanged by that contact. It sings to one's soul and touches the deepest parts of the human psyche with understanding while simultaneously racing toward the triumph of Witch and the return of love and honor to a world that desperately needs their touch again. The characters live again in this story, almost more real than reality itself. Laughing and crying with them, one feels as if one is a part of their world, separate from the mundane details of this terrestrial orb. Jaenelle, Daemon, and all the rest will become members of your family, in spirit and in your heart. Do you believe in Witch?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark characters and intriguing plots!","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed this book, and although it is rather overshadowed by Daughter, it is nevertheless a near-masterpiece. Mrs. Bishop's caste of characters, who are sympathetic without being composed of the classic hero combination of \\"sweetness and light\\" are an absolute delight to get to know. I would have liked for Daemon to play a greater role in the plot, but the substitution of Lucivar is more than acceptable. If Queen is up to the standard of these two books, we can surely expect to be seeing Anne Bishop's new works on all of our \\"Favorite Books\\" lists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very humorous and involving","review":"I think this was a great middle book, and although I didn't like it as much as Daughter of the Blood, hey, middle books of trilogies are hard. Ms. Bishop has to follow up on the first and set up for the concluding novel, which I think she did a wonderful job of. I was disappointed that Daemon didn't have much written from his point of view since he was insane, and when he finally got out of the Twisted Kingdom, the book just smack ended!! I'm EXTREMELY impatient for Queen of Darkness to come out, and I'll definitely buy it as soon as it's available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are the good guys so unbelievable stupid?","review":"I'm giving up on reading this book - and the main reason is that the good guys just are too stupid (when that serves to prolong the story) and don't work together/help each other enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can it be? FINALLY!!!!?","review":"Well, guys it is finally almost in our hot little hands. Heir to the Shadows is almost to the shipping stage, and the saga of Jaenelle and Daemon and Saetan(et al) Is ready to continue. If this is even half as good as Daughter of the Blood(and Anne assures me that it is) We are all in for a treat... oh and for those of you out there like me, who haven't even gotten their hands on this one yet and already want the the third one, there is hope Anne was already working on it last year when I asked. Let us all pray, and beg and plead...... until we get all three."},{"rating":"2","title":"#2 just aren't as good","review":"Have you ever noticed that the \\"second\\" in any series is usually not as good as either the \\"first\\" or the \\"third\\"? It is the same with this series by Anne Bishop. The negativity of the society, the hostility between men and women, all of this is cranked up in the second book. The characters seem more disjointed, more confused -- and well they could be given what has happened and is happening to them. I just didn't get as into the characters as the first or third book enticed me to be. The third book however will make little sense without the second so you should read it if you are a fan of the series. Indeed if you plan to read \\"The Invisible Ring\\" I recommend the trilogy first because it will explain the culture better and allow you to be more a part of that adverture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly disappointing....","review":"I loved Daughter of the Blood, read it over and over (well, certain passages, at least) and have been eager and waiting the next. The day I got it, I read it in its entirety and found myself very disappointed. The characters seem to lose who they were and become an entirely different person, the whole book could be tightened up significantly, a lot of loose ends go no where. I find myself hoping for the final book to prove to myself that this second book was just a mistake - just Anne Bishop trying to turn in something from the deadline. Bottom line: Read Daughter of the Blood again if you want a truly good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"this book and the other two in the series are some of the best books i have ever read. i can't stop reading them, and every time i do i notice something fascinating that i hadn't noticed before. you really do have to check this author out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath Taking","review":"I loved this the second installment of the Blood Jewels Trilogy. I couldn't put it down. What I found the most fascinating in this book was the relationship between Jaenelle and Lucivar.

I loved this book from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was an o.k. book","review":"This book was good, I mean I read in about a day, it really gripped me, however it skipped around too much. Pointless things happened in the book like that battle against the Jhinkas, there was no point to that. And Janelle has soooo many friend, you can't keep track of them all. But never the less, I liked the book and I can't wait for Queen of the Darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the middle chapter of a story","review":"I know lots of people are upset that this book is \\"not as good as Daughter ofthe Blood\\" but everyone has to remember... this is the middle of the story. Instead of looking at the books as single novels... see them as installments of a LARGER novel. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Good, though sometimes problematic","review":"I picked the prequel on a lark, in spite of teh cover and the odd introduction. I found a book where super-powerful characters are also interesting, and often quite weak in their own ways. Unlike many, many other fantasy series, there are very strong characters, world-killing magicians and such, who are interesting. Very few authors have managed to make good supre-magician tales--and this is one of them. I do have a few quibbles. Mainly, I found Saetan's character very weak and miscast. 50000 year old demons of great power and experience should be intelligent. It bothered me to see him acting like a fool. However, the story was good, and I can only think of a few other fantasies that have been anywhere near as consistently interesting. And sensuous--and not sexual. All together an enjoyable mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice middle book","review":"I truly enjoy Daughter of the Blood. Yes it's lighter than the first book, but it's a welcome break from all the \\"uncle\\" plot. Daemon is missing, but you get to know Lucivar and Saetan. It does a good job setting up the last book.Now it has much have gore or angst as the other two books but it ups fill in the reletionships needed for the \\"queen\\". It worth the read, I know. My copy is falling apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is wonderful!","review":"My friend suggested that I read these books, and I immediately became hooked.

It is very poor for this use. It might not even work on a one piece wood door. Main problem; the track is not stiff enough. It flexes, sometimes 3\\", the door bounces and the flex gets worse. BTW; the door is smooth and balanced. The 25 year old opener had no difficulty. This may be a typical problem for openers that must have a segmented track for packaging. I would have purchased a solid track opener locally but they cost twice what this one was from Amazon. Also if I had followed the geometry instructed the motor end would be less than 6' above the floor.

The floppy \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" is long overdue in pathos. \\"Cocaine\\" is a Cale rip-off, and sustains it's greatness only in Clapton's stunning live performances - not his dull studio work. The appaling \\"Lay down Sally\\" (written by later Shakespear's Sister Marcella Detroit, who luckily matured into a great songwriter) ompa-pa's itself into sheer boredom. \\"Mean Old Frisco\\" and \\"Peaches and Diesel\\" is by far the album's greatest tracks.

He knows how to please the majority with his consistently pleasant, middle of the road music. Recommended for casual, curious, or hard core Clapton fans (who probably already have a copy). His strong cover of J.J. Cale's 'Cocaine', and his two self-penned songs, the beautiful and earnest 'Wonderful Tonight' and the toe tappin', knee slappin' 'Lay Down Sally' (co-written with bandmates, Marcy Levy and George Terry) are reason enough to purchase the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLOWHAND FINALLY GETS THE THUMBS UP TRANSFER FROM MFSL!","review":"Originally released in '77 I never quite got off on this release. But now I know why... The problem had resided in the originalreleases transfer. No matter how I tried to dig this release on all the PGD formats I gave up until now. Mofi has totally overhauled this album and as a ULTRADISC II gold CD I can finally hear why I was totally disappointed in the first place. First allthe vocals have perfect clarity listen to the harmonies on \\"Wonderful Tonight\\". The guitars have crunch and a slight surrealisticairy quality to them checkout \\"Cocaine\\" and once again \\"Wonderful Tonight\\".

The other discs are securely in the side of the sleeves. All were in the right place, no free floaters or glue residue, so that's been fixed at least! HOWEVER, one of the sleeves FELL OUT! Complete with a nasty glue edge waiting to muck up whatever it touched! Unacceptable. I hope I just got a defective one (contacting amazon for a replacent, and I'd it's the same story I'll just get a refund), and this isn't indicative of the manufacturing process.The good news is that the DVD-A sounds fantastic, nice imaging and detail.

It channels the wires to make sure they aren't in your way when you're using the mount. It's also very sturdy, which means that once you've installed it, anyone using it will be able to swing it and pull it with very little fear of something going wrong (within reason, of course).Peerless makes incredible mounts, and this one is no exception, like the PLA50 below it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS NOT WHAT U THINK","review":"Seriously this game is a disgrace!

I'm not a history major or anything, so I don't really know how accurate the setting was, but that is not really what drew me into the story. I found the characters quirky, and my only complaint with them was that the heroine, Tabrizia, was both a bit too naive, and too stubborn.

It's not worth it - even if the side effects may be rare (but I gotta tell you, I do not have a lot of allergies and my skin is not that sensitive)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Connie's Christmas CD, whatever the title, is a classic. A beautiful compilation of Christmas songs sung by this great singer. In Connie's long career, it is a shame that she recorded only one Christmas LP. With her penchant for languages and her international fame and talent, a Christmas CD consisting of songs from around the world would have been a triumph. Just think, Connie singing Silent Night in German, Io Bambino in Italian, etc. Connie's Christmas hit, Baby's First Christmas, was not included in the original Christmas LP as the LP was recorded a few years before the hit. It has been included on some later CD compilations of her Christmas music. I believe the original Christmas LP was recorded in the summer of 1959 at the famed Abbey Road studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS EDITION OF FRANCIS CHRISTMAS CD","review":"The old saying goes you get what you pay for. I ordered this cheap-reissue version of Connie Francis' Christmas CD (Hallmark label) thinking I was getting a bargain. You're not! First off, for some reason the sound is monophonic when I know the album was originally issued on LP in stereo and reissued on other CD labels in stereo (and not electronic stereo either). The song order is incorrect on the CD when compared to the little insert. On top of that, for mono sound it isnt' very well mastered or clear.You're better off with an earlier reissue from a different label -- unfortunately many are not in print and you'll pay premium prices for second-hand copies here on on Ebay. Perhaps someone else can note if the Zyx or Indie Europe reissue is at least in stereo. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst vacuum in the world!!!!!","review":"We have had this vacuum for about 10 months...it is the worst!!

It has not worked properly ever since we got it. It has been in for repairs three times and it still does not vacuum more than one room in our house without shutting itself off. I will NEVER purchase another Bissel product again in my life, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible vacuum","review":"This vacuum does not suck anything up! It worked for maybe a month or two, and that was it. Now, though there are no clogs and a clean filter, this wont even pick up visible dirt that I can move with my foot! Total waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the money","review":"My old Dirt Devil (will never buy again) finally died a painful death, and I got the Lift-Off Revolution Pet to replace it. My criteria for a vacuum were: bagless, pet hair brush, attachements, carpet size adjustment and replaceable belt. Found a surprisingly high amount of vacuums have really low ratings, but this one looked promising. Was rated high here and elsewhere. Have to agree, it works great.Why didn't I give it 5 stars? To me, 5 stars is perfect, and I could find enough nit-picky things with this vacuum to say it's not perfect. One of the $500 Dysons would be near 5 stars, but then it's $500. Got this for $169 at Target (Amazon link), and well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful....","review":"This is the most horrible vac I have ever owned. I used this less than 10 times with 1 dog and 1 cat and it lost its suction, the filters had to be cleaned constantly, and the dirt conatiner is sooooo small. It is also terribly dusty when you try to clean out any of the other filters. While cleaning today it basically backfired and left my in a cloud of dust.....Fortunately I was able to take it back to the store. Don't buy this- its awful!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle","review":"I bought this vacuum a year ago and it has been to the shop about 4 times now. We have almost paid as much in repair as we paid in price! We have also had to fix it ourselves on many occasions. It is not able to handle our animals fur and the canister is very small. It clogs constantly and even the guy we brought it to for repair said it was not worth buying. I am now looking for a Dyson to see if that works. All this been said, I do have 4 animals and I vacuum every day, but I still think that this is not a good product. I have always used Hoover in the past and I found them much better, I just thought I'd try this one out, but sadly to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought it and the first week it was great. The longer I use it however, the worse the suction gets. Even when you clean the filters (all of them) its still poor. The suction on mine got so bad it wouldn't even turn the pet brush attachment. I finally took it apart to clean the tube from the tank to hose and it worked a little better, even though there was nothing much there!?! Not sure why that worked. Also, I hate the mess when you empty the container plus it holds next to nothing. Go with a bag or if you are lucky and building a house get a Central vacuum!! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Vac","review":"My wife decided to buy this vac since we have three dogs. It has been one of the worst vacuums I have ever owned.

Cleans awesome, very powerful suction, and you can detach the canister to clean ceiling fans & hard to reach areas. It powers itself off if filter is dirty to prevent overheating and damage to motor which is how my last vacume died. You can remove and clean every part on the vacume including filters and tank. Simply the best vacume on the market for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse vaccuum I ever had","review":"There are so many things I don't like about this vacuum I don't know where to begin. Its heavy. It's attachments are small and cheaply made. I ordered a separate floor attachment for my bare floors but I still have to stoop over to use it and the tube collapses whenever I put any pressure on it. And because the hose is too short, I end up pulling the whole vacuum over in the floor. It is dirty and dust accumulates all over the outside of it. I usually end up vacuuming the outside of the vacuum. When you change the filters, do it outside. As far as the canister lifting off, I wish they had just put wheels on it and I could just use it as a real canister vacuum. I guess I will end up buying another vacuum because this one is virtually useless to me but I won't get a Bissell again. My other vacuums have lasted at least 10 years. My one star is for the motor. It does have incredible suction. Its so good that it ate the binding off my rug!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed...","review":"I read tons of reviews for this vacuum before I purchased it, and everyone loved it... except me! I don't have any pets, but thought it would be great for any carpet since it picks up pet hair, but I was very under whelmed. Pros - it's easy to put together. Cons - didn't work as well as I expected. It had mediocre suction. I ended up returning it and purchasing the Bissell Velocity. LOVE IT MUCH BETTER. Cool purple color, picked up so much debris and fuzzies off my carpet, I had to empty the canister 4 times (and I'm not that dirty!). So my assessment is no-go on the Pet Vac. I love the lift-off feature, makes it great to carry around and light!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great vacuum!","review":"I have had this vacuum for over a year in a house with wall-to-wall carpet and 3 dogs. I am always amazed at how much fine-particle dust I empty after I use it. The bagless situation is great for reducing costs over time, b/c you do not have to keep buying bags. However, for allergy sufferers, you may want to get a vacuum with a bag so the dust does not fly everywhere when you're emptying it. (It does have THREE separate dust filters, including a HEPA filter, for when the vacuum is in use, which is great.) I also love the feature that allows canister of the vacuum to disconnect from the body so you can use it similarly to a hand-vac. The only thing I have a complaint about is that when you use the hose with the canister still attached to the vacuum body, the entire vacuum body will fall over very easily (and sometimes hit you if you're in the way) if you extend the hose too far. Other than that, great vacuum. I'm not sorry I bought it, even after a year of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable, no, cool features yes, but wortless in the end","review":"We bought this in November of 2005 and with in 90 days the front roller had to be replaced. It does clean well when it works, but we use it about once a month, so that means we are on the 15th or so use of it and it just gave up the ghost totally. I would say stay away from this thing unless you can buy it for $30 or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information","review":"This book offers nothing to someone remotely familiar with environmental issues.

The environmental doom message they purvey seems uninfluenced by their failure to get their previous prophecies right. And their suggested solutions seem to have learned nothing from the success of market economics. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Read\\"","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone eligible to vote, and is even more of a \\"must read\\" for anyone in a policymaking position. Many of us are aware that there are serious environmental problems and that the Bush Administration is only exacerbating them, but the Ehrlichs lay out in chilling detail the many-fronted assault on the environment being perpetrated in the name of \\"progress.\\" For that matter, they make it clear that if we don't make major changes to the structure of incentives across the board in our society, we will be leaving our grandchildren to deal with a nightmare. While some of the suggestions thrown out in the final chapters may be radical, thinking outside the box is long overdue. It is my hope that this book will stimulate a debate that will at long last lead to real change so that we can go forward to a sustainable society."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a biggggg waste of money!","review":"I beat this game in about an hour.

The rest of the 28 minutes is theater trailers. The movie features the talents of Debbie Rochon, Susan Ellen White, Christine Cavilier, and Lisa Ann Duval. The blonde you see on the video cover is not in the movie and some of the pictures on the back of the video box were not in the movie. I can tell you right now the nudity is in the D+ area and that is being nice. If you are going to be naked then be naked. The actresses if you want to call them that start off with skimpy clothing then strip down. The stripping takes forever and you have less than a minute of nudity. Also there is no plot to this movie. I guess the whole movie was written on a napkin. The sound is horrible and the narrator made it only worse. With him out of the picture, good ten or fifteen minutes of the movie could have been deleted. This video was neither a scream nor truly naked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference","review":"I too bought this book for a college lit course, but now that I am a teacher, I find that I use it far more than my Norton's Anthology, or any of my other African-American Anthologies.

It finally caught up to me and I was ticketed b/c the Pop didn't go off until the cop was already waving me off to the side of the road. To top it off, the on/off button malfunctioned all of the time until it finally won't even come on anymore.

I was not ready for this band. Not only is their amazing musicianship with each one of them the energy comes though the speakers and grabs you. Dennis Chambers takes some of the most interesting drums solos I've ever heard. Bona bass playing is scary. Bona plays these blasing lines and is smiling and bouning all over the stage. Between Chambers and Bona you almost forget its a Stern DVD, but Stern's playing covers all bases from sparce delayed intro's to full crank fire breathing fusion. Amazing band.The only trouble with the DVD it's only five songs and you'll want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jazz/fusion stuff","review":"Im a big fan of Mike Stern, and was pleased to see this dvd release.

This would be a helpful book to any student of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not very thick, but GREAT for Stallone information.","review":"I was writing a term paper about the artistry of Stallone, and found this book in my school library. I have since decided to buy my own copy, as this is probably one of the most informative books I have found about Stallone. The book is not very thick, probably around 96 pages in all, but is loaded with information on how Stallone started out as an actor-writer-director, how he wrote and sold Rocky, as well as other neat facts concerning the filming of Rocky. And, since the book was written by Stallone himself, you won't get any gossip or unfounded rumors about the star in this printing.Again, the book is really a souvenir book intended to be a companion to the first Rocky film, but despite that, it should be on any movie buff or filmmaker's shelf. In fact, I have enjoyed this book so much that I plan on buying a copy for myself, just to read when I need inspiration to reach my goals.Buy this book.

The story is a positive, uplifting one that ephasizes loyalty, faithfulness, unconditional love and the estimation of the value of others. While the story is truly inspiring, the acting is mediocre at best. It soon becomes obvious that the Noni juice industry has funded the film - some parts have the feel of an infomercial. Fortunately, they are brief and do not detract much from the basic message of the film. So, if you are a persnickety perfectionist, look elsewhere. However, if you can live with imperfection to view an enjoyable, endearing tale set in the South Pacific, it's worth purchasing. Our family found it worthy of more than one viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandma send this one to us...Love, Maddy/Nathan/Jackie&Luke","review":"As a mother, wife & grandmother, I just watched this movie on a commercial flight of all places.

Personally, I believe the passion is more important then the message. If you believe what you believe, believe it with everything in you. That is what this band does.

However, the fact that he then truly raped her shortly after disgusted me. I almost stopped reading right then. These characters had very little chemistry - all they did was bicker and yell, yet they somehow fall in love? I like romance in my romance novels - sweet words from the hero, a tender kiss here and there. Seems like every sexual encounter in this book had some sort of violence attached to it.Some people obviously like this type of \\"romance\\" but it was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hated It!!","review":"I don't like cruel, ruthless heroes who rape someone to get even with their enemy no matter how awful the enemy is. I don't like heroines who cry and moan rape and abuse but try to instigate the hero forcing themself on them again. This is pretty much what this book was. The hero imprisons and rapes the heroine, later on she is attracted to him and tries to instigates these sexual advances while still calling it force. The characters did not make any sense and the plot ran in circles until the conclusion. Needless to say, I won't be wasting my money on Shannon Drake again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Accessory for the EGT 700","review":"I am using this as a replacement tip for the original one that came with the EGT 700 Butane soldering Iron which i've had for over 10yrs. Yes the tip lasted for ten years until recently when i dropped the soldering iron on the ground on the tip and it started deteriorating every time i used it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound quality, nice DVD features","review":"The songs easily get five out of five. But if you're reading this, chances are you already know all of the songs. The mix and the novelty of the DVD format gets four stars.Sometimes it's a bit distracting hearing these songs in a way that differs from how I've heard them for the last 28 years. The mix is obviously different, and separating the channels so much makes for a different overall sound. But I enjoy it. The sound is clear, rich, and powerful. I wish that more DVD audio titles were available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this seller? Poor customer service unable to return item","review":"I received 2 children's watches. The Nike Triax Sweeper does not run and it looks like a used item, dirty band and label is partially torn off the back of the face of the watch. I tried x3 to contact this seller by using the tools at Amazon, unsuccessfully. There was only a rote email response stating it was being reviewed. I called 201 604 3656 to no avail. Message machine. Do not recommend this seller!!!Rate a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me cold","review":"My first read of a Masterson book, and I am not sure I will pursue his others. The premise is an interesting one, but I found most of the characters unsympathetic -- including the main one, Jim Rook. The writing wasn't a complete turn-off, but did get annoying in spots. As for the hands-on-the-frozen-rail episode, Mr. Masterson obviously doesn't believe that less is more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get an editor","review":"I've only read one other book by Masterton and was very impressed with it. Walkers was a very intertaining story, so when I saw this I thought I'd give it a try. The story itself isn't too bad, kind of predictable, but O.K. However about halfway through the story the whole suspense factor is shot. Everything is given away and the rest of the book is just clean up. One thing that really bothered me was the total lack of proofreading in the story. There were so many typos and obvious errors it made the story hard to read at times. There is absolutely no punctuation in the story. Ever Mr. is Mr and every contraction is without it's apostrophe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but was hoping for more live footage","review":"Overall this DVD was very enjoyable. Since it's the only Rhapsody DVD available I can't complain too much but what really irks me is that I was hoping it would contain a complete concert. As a fan in the USA who has not had the chance to see Rhapsody live I was looking forward to the complete concert experience. The behind the scenes footage is interesting but I would've preferred it to have been treated as bonus footage accompanying a concert performance.It's obvious this DVD was influenced a lot by label mate, Joey DeMaio of Manowar fame. The format is very similar to the Manowar DVD's. That's not necessarily a bad thing if there were other DVD's to choose from but alas I believe I'll have to keep waiting to see the real thing. I may have to schedule a European vacation soon if I can't satisfy my live Rhapsody cravings here in the States."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the New Jersey Based Band, but British Techno","review":"This was a listing for a band called \\"Smithereens\\" and the album 1234. This is not the new jersey based band \\"The Smithereens\\" whose first full album was Especially For You. \\"Smithereens\\" is a british 80's pop synth group, and a low average one at that. Nothing memorable on it.Here is the tracklisting for this albumTracks: 1.) You is a Guarantee 2.) For Love 3.) Promiscious 4.) Speed of Life 5.) Time Ticks Tragedy 6.) Just Enuf 7.)

That why I'm awarding it just 4 stars.It's great, pefect, a gem, but definitely not for newbbies.If you are not a Vangelis specialist (I mean if you just like one or two songs by Vangelis) you rather buy Voices, or Spiral, or Direct, or Reprise, or... but never Soil Festivities.In my honest opinion you should know Vangelis, at least a little, before daving into this album.On the other hand, if you feel you are ready for Vangelis not-so-well-known stuff, then don't hessitate, this album's amazing from the very cover to the most inner parts. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vangelis meets Philip Glass","review":"If you love Vangelis's subtle rhythms, powerful voice/music blend, and emotive harmony, then this album is not for you. The best way to describe this work is \\"Vangelis meets Philip Glass!\\" \\"Soil Festivities\\" is a minimalist piece; it lacks the potent combination power and majesty that characterizes Vangelis's \\"Voices,\\" \\"Oceanic,\\" or \\"Heaven and Hell.\\" The music is lugubrious, and makes me wonder if Vangelis had a bout of insomnia that led him to write \\"Soil Festivities\\" as a palliative for his sleeplessness.Don't bother buying this piece unless you have trouble sleeping or want to do me a favor and purchase my copy. If you really want to add to your collection of Vangelis, then I recommend the works I have already mentioned or his collaborative music with Jon Anderson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterwork stood test of time","review":"The consensus among the reviews is pure love, I can see that much. But the most amazing thing about this masterwork of both composition and sound design is that it dates from 1984. In the intervening years, very few recordings have measured up to the high bar set by Soil Festivities. Frank van Bogaert has tried and missed; Mike Oldfield pretty much succeeded a couple of times (most clearly with Songs From Distant Earth). But that's about it, I would say. Vangelis himself matched it only once or twice since then. This is truly the \\"Beethoven's 5th\\" of electronic new age--or whatever it is. It is a genre-bending combination of plodding minimalism and soaring neoromanticism and avant-garde that will forever stand alone.Incidentally, the original LP is labeled with 5 movements like the CD, but the 5th movement clearly has two parts internally. This has led some to believe that there are supposed to be 6 movements labeled."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of its kind","review":"If you are looking for one of the best ambiant music ever maid, this one is for you. The opening track is amazing, as are movement 2 and 4.Movement 3 and 5 are the weakest of the album but they're not bad at all.Go outside on a dark summer night, far away from the city and watch the stars and put this cd in your car stereo, you'll be on another world.Great work Vangelis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great visuals, but truly \\"silent\\"","review":"I am always nervous when I purchase a copy of a silent film that those who remastered it would have chosen an inappropriate musical accompaniment. Imagine my disappointment when I learned that this fine Chaplin film had absolutely NO sound. Even in the Nickelodeons there would at least be a wheezy pump-organ to supply some sort of music to go with the action.

I could play it 3 times a day for 10 years straight and still not tire of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Hardcore ABB Fans","review":"It's nice when you come across the rare reissues that actually have unreleased material included. This version of Eat A Peach is a gem--70 previously unheard minutes of Fillmore concerts--need I say more? Sure, there are a few performance clinkers here and there (after all, these were rejected in favor of what appears on the classic Fillmore album), but the most remarkable aspect of these performances is noticing how improvised these songs really were--most of the soloing consists of different licks than heard on the original. And the sound is superb--as good or better than the double Fillmore Concerts CD package. Another winner from the vaults of the ABB!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragedy Breeds Magic","review":"After the death of Duane, the band reconvened and came up with this, another very strong album. When it was originally released on vinyl it was a two record set, but it is condensed on to one for the CD release. The album consists of new studio material and live material recorded prior to Duane Allman's death. More Allman classics appear on this one, \\"Ain't Wastin Time No More\\", \\"Melissa\\" (which now my be better known from a cell phone commercial), \\"One Way Out\\". The band gets close to proggy on the all instrumental \\"Les Breres In A Minor\\". The centerpiece of the album is the 30 plus minute \\"Mountain Jam\\" a live recording that once again focus on the rambling twin guitar jams of Betts and Allman. Every \\"jam band\\" that is around today owes a debt to The Allman Brothers who did it all first back in the day. The album closes with \\"Blue Sky\\" a breezy little Dickey Betts number and \\"Little Martha\\" an acoustic duet with Betts and Allman. Killer stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary","review":"The greatest American band at their peak-new studio recordings and the last sessions with Duane.More great Fillmore East performances make this one of the all-time great albums.\\"Melissa\\" alone makes it worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Ever Produced!","review":"Since I am a HUGE ABB fan all I can do is rave about this album. It displays the band at its pinnacle. With brother Duane and Gregg together, the band puts forth a magnificent performance showing their true originality and mastery of blues and rock. It is one of the few albums too where one can experience the guitar virtuosity of the late Duane Allman. What also makes this album stand out is the recording of \\"Mountain Jam\\" which embodies the true ABB feeling and free-spirited play. This album is an essential part of any music lover's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat A Peach","review":"I downloaded this as a MP3 album from Amazon when it was on the $5 album special. I really prefer the tangible quality of a CD because I'm a collector, but if it's $5 vs $10 or more I can do with the download. I'm old enough to remember seeing the Allman Brothers Band while all the original players were still living. Eat A Peach was so named from Duane's response to an interviewer's question: \\"How are you helping the revolution?\\" Allman replied: \\"There ain't no revolution, only evolution, but every time I'm in Georgia I 'eat a peach' for peace.\\" I hadn't listened to the album for a number of years (I owned it on vinyl only) and I am was pleasantly surprised at how fresh it still sounds all these years later. This album, and it's predecessors, are the Allman Brothers at their peak. All the tracks are good. If you like Southern rock, this album should be in your collection and on your play list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"\\"Go on downtime baby and find somebody to love...

I was only familiar with Melissa and bought it because of that one song. I did not realize how good this group was. I was surprised that the southern rock extended guitar work captured me as much as it did. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improving a near perfect record","review":"How do you improve something like eat a peach. Add a second disc of the Allman Brothers legendary performance at the closing of the Fillmore on 6/27/71. Long available in trading circles, this version is a blinder. If you already own EAP (as most Allman Bros fanatics do) the thing to do may be to download the bonus disc from ITunes, but if you don't own EAP, get this version-well worth the extra cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Allman Brothers Album","review":"Excluding the various \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections, this is simply the best Allman Brothers album. Released just after the tragic death of guitarist Duane Allman, the band hit a peak that it would never again attain. The tracks are as varied as the half-hour plus \\"Mountain Jam\\" and the two minute Duane Allman instrumental \\"Little Martha.\\" Well known cuts include raidio faves \\"Melissa\\" and the awesome \\"Blue Sky.\\" A great rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ABB and the Dead will always be compared, but...","review":"I think some of you are getting the wrong idea when you talk about critics comparing the ABB with the Grateful Dead.

It borrows liberally from Fillmore: \`\`One Way Out\\", \`\`Trouble No More\\", and the interminable \`\`Mountain Jam\\". The remaining tracks on \`\`Eat A Peach\\" are almost uniformly classics: \`\`Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\", \`\`Melissa\\", \`\`Stand Back\\", \`\`Blue Sky\\" and \`\`Little Martha\\". For those tracks alone, this disc is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wear the t-shirt...'nuff said","review":"A while back I was leaving an ABB concert, stoked, and passed a vendor selling \\"Eat A Peach\\" t-shirts. He had one left, it was in my size, and I bought it. I normally don't wear t-shirts advertizing things (shouldn't they be paying me to wear it?) but I'll wear my Eat a Peach t-shirt -- and I get constant reactions from people when I do.How does one explain \\"Eat A Peach\\"? How does one explain cultural revolution? Because in the South in 1972 this _was_ cultural revolution. You can give all the sociology and history and gossip that you want, but in the end its the music. A great band suffering a body blow. Putting studio and live tracks together to get it done. A cd that doesn't split \\"Mountain Jam\\" in two like my worn out records do. Blues covers, country originals, country-jazz?, a lost brother, and an acoustic guitar duet to close.

I bought the product not knowing it was not going to work on my I MAC. I learned a very valuable lesson. I reccommend that anyone wanting to buy boxed software online should double check what they are getting. The price was also excessive and should have given me the clue not to buy it.

A mere shadow of the far superior Civilization (pick any incarnation). Why would anyone want to sit and watch people chop wood and carry carcass meat around the screen?

The contributions of Phil Lesh on this album are exciting and invaluable to the arrangement and feel of many of the songs on this album. Scarlet Begonias and Unbroken Chain are worth the purchase price of this album. The eerie yet calming voice of Garcia on China Doll shows that even in the studio the Dead were artists to be reckoned with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Score!","review":"This album was actually quite hard to find for a long time, but not anymore. Now we get the original 8 classic tracks nicely remastered, and with 7 bonus tracks. This is a personal favorite of mine, and sometimes I think even better than \\"American Beauty\\". Included are the excellent jams \\"US Blues\\" and \\"Loose Lucy\\", the softies \\"China Doll\\" and \\"Ship Of Fools\\", and my favorites \\"Scarlet Begonias\\" and the spacey \\"Unbroken Chain\\". The extras here are outtakes/demos of \\"Loose Lucy\\", \\"Pride Of Cucamonga\\", and \\"Unbroken Chain\\", plus live versions of \\"Scarlet Begonias\\", \\"Money Money\\", \\"Wave That Flag\\", AND \\"Let It Rock\\".

Literally the second night I used it a periodic strange screeching noise would come and go(which is what the previous one did as well). It wakes you up with a start and is very very annoying!

We were getting worried that the CD player might just die, so we thought this white noise machine would do. I was worried about the volume when I ordered it, but other reviews made me think it would be loud enough. NOT TRUE. This thing won't block out ANY NOISE. The puny little speaker is just not big enough. We'll just buy another CD player I guess. The rain sound is also very disappointing and just sounds like crackling sounds. Extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Periodically makes loud thud sounds","review":"My only real problem with this product is that it will periodically, about every 20 min, make a thud sound that is so loud it wakes me up. Useless for a sleep aid because of this. I've read another review where it complained about a \\"screeching\\" sound. What is the point of making a noise maker for sleep if it's going to wake you up every 20 min?

The Homedics is in my daughters bedroom, we bought tbe Dex for our bedroom. I liked the variety of sounds that came on the Dex. However, the sound quality on the Dex is pretty terrible. The speaker makes this crackling sound when you use some of the sound combinations. On ours, the night crickets and rain especially sound awful. The brook and the wind sound fine, as does the ocean. But on the Homedics, all of the sounds are nice and clear. Both products are the same amount, I would go with the Homedics as it sounds a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume not loud enough.","review":"It's easy to use, but my main complaint with this item is that the volume is simply not loud enough for me. I have had many noise machines over the years, and have never encountered one with such weak top volume. If you can place it directly by your head on a bed-side stand, it might be acceptable. But it simply doesn't produce enough volume to fill a room or mask many noises. Disappointing.For something in this price range, but with much greater volume, I would recommend the HoMedics SS-2000 instead:HoMedics SS-2000 Sound Spa Relaxation Sound Machine with 6 Nature Sounds, SilverIt's smaller, louder, AND cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"mom to be","review":"I received this for my baby shower recently and just set it up in the baby's room.

I wish I would have kept the box and the paperwork - I would have been nice to return it for a refund instead of throwing our twenty-some dollars into the garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broke almost immediately","review":"First child, very colicky! We tried everything to soothe our daughter to sleep, and knew white noise calmed her. I found this machine, read some of the good reviews and thought for $20, I'd give it a try.The sounds of ocean, rain and brook were really only the good sounds...and the machine worked great for about a week, but then would shut off after about 5 seconds every time since. Having suffered 8 weeks of sleepless nights, this machine gave me a short window of rest and hope, only to yank the rug out from under me again. Though our daughter now sleeps mostly through the night, I still try the machine every night in the hopes it will just WORK..."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great in the beginning","review":"I completely agree with the other reviewer who had trouble because I had exactly the same problem. This item worked great for a few weeks, the baby loved it! Unfortunately it started shutting off after only moments of use and everytime I turned it back on I had to turn the volume back up. There is definitely a manufacturing problem since I'm not the only one to have this problem. The idea is great and if it worked the way it did in the beginning, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"The sound sleeper doesn't play soothing sounds. All the sounds almost sound alike. The sounds are awful, not much like the real thing - not clear sounds. To me it sounds like a bunch of static on most of them. Listen to it in the store before you buy it if you can. Definitely not worth $20!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"This machine was a disappointment. I got it for my sons' room. They like the ocean sound and it seems to be adequate for them. I find that the volume is wimpy. Every time you turn it on, you have to pump a button to bring the volume up to the max which is only medium in my opinion. It only maintains the type of sound, not the volume. You also have to be carfeul turning it on to not push it all the way to the timed setting. This will turn it off after a period of time. The first setting on the on/off switch will leave it on until you turn it off, but my sons cannot turn it on carefully enough to avoid that second timed setting. It has not stopped working after well over a year, but I still don't like it very much. I need another one for another room and I will be looking for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"He can sleep all night now","review":"This product is really great. It is an inexpensive white noise maker to help baby sleep. I like that I can plug it in and it runs all night. Now when my son wakes at night he can settle himself back to sleep and it also helps him nap longer during the day. The only negative is that it does not remember your standard settings every time you turn it on. Each time you turn it on the volume is on low and the sound is the ocean. Also, if you have a power outage, the battery backup will kick in, however, not before the sound resets to low volume ocean sounds.I will say that I think I sleep better hearing the \\"rain\\" over the monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"best sound machine we have found yet!!","review":"We have tried many sound machines and this one is the best so far.

No way to tell what volume level you are at anyway.Has a silly \\"demo mode\\" button on back that is too easy to push on and sound only plays for a handful of seconds. Imagine doing all of this with a newborn baby in your arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Des baby sleeping aid","review":"Item worked for 30 seconds then stopped working.

The baby liked it so I was happy. Then it would only turn on for about 5 seconds and shut off. The return on this was easy, got a new one in 2 days. We'll see how long this one lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY quiet, broke within one month","review":"I would normally not write a review but I want to offer other buyers the chance to buy a more expensive, louder & better white noise machine. I bought this after reading reviews that it was pretty quiet. I thought the cheapest would work since it's for my baby's room & I didn't think the volume would be much of an issue. But this machine is VERY quiet. You really need to be able to amp up the volume a lot more and it needs a better, fuller sound.After using it for a month, it broke. It won't stay on for more than one minute.I would urge you to spend the extra $20 and buy a better product. In the end, you'll be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Loud Enough","review":"Sounds are good, but the volume does not get loud enough to drown out any background noise. I ended up getting a SleepMate because all I wanted was loud white noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it, try the other brand","review":"I received this for my baby shower and it's not worth it. If I would have been given the receipt, I would have returned it. The sounds could be better and the worse part is that it doesn't seem to get very loud even when the volume is turned all the way up. The other brand seems to have more features for the same price and I read no complaints about the volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Great-At First!","review":"This is an update to the review written in september 2003.I am the original writer of that review in which I stated this was a good product. It was at first!!!! My son loved the sounds this product had and so did I. It offered so much variety. Well that all changed when the product stopped working correctly. It seemed to be stuck in demo mode.It would play for 30 seconds and shut off.We thought maybe the batteries needed to be replaced so we changed them. Didn't work! We connected the adapter. Didn't work! We also fiddled with the switch to try to be sure it was in regular mode and not demo.Still not working for more than 30 seconds at a time. This would be a great product for everyone if it would work correctly. Maybe we just got a bad one! Be aware though that this may happen again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The volume is so low...it's worthless!!","review":"I always read the reviews before I purchase an item and these reviews were pretty good besides the reviews on the volume. I thought twice about ordering it, but read a review that said the volume was absolutely fine and it was NOT an issue so I bought it...BIG MISTAKE! I have a 15 month old and we have hardwood floors so you can really hear everything in her room. This machine is useless...it's so quiet you can BARELY hear that it is even on!?! The volume have an \\"up\\" button and a \\"down\\" button and I continuously pressed the \\"down\\" button waiting for the volume to increase, but it was no use. This was a definite fail and I will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sounds, not loud enough","review":"I have had many sound machines and can't sleep without one... I got this for my infant and couldn't have been more disappointed - the sounds are digital and repeat in an awkward way that is noticeable and annoying if you are trying to fall asleep (I've tried to use it for myself at times and have been in with her often obviously!) - it makes it harder to fall asleep! I wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for Busy Household","review":"This has helped my daughter sleep through the sounds of a busy household. Love the adapter so it doesn't eat batteries. Volume is great. Just wish it had the classic \\"white noise\\" -- the closest I get is putting it on the wind setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!!!","review":"I purchased this item and was very disappointed with its performance. The white noise sounds are not very loud. The secondary sounds include sea gulls, buoys, and thunder. These sounds are not calming as a sound sleeper product title suggests. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"I had it about a week when loud crackling noises started sputtering from the speaker. This was to help my newborn sleep. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could change one thing....","review":"If I could change one thing about this sound machine: I would make the volume control a dial that you can turn up and down instead of the 'up' and 'down' buttons to push (this just makes it a bit more difficult to know when you've reached the loudest setting). That said, it's been wonderful 'white noise' for us - great for our baby...she sleeps with the ocean waves all night...ahhh, sleeping by the beach. And the size of this machine is great for travel - just toss it in the suitcase and go...handy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just what we were looking for","review":"It does come up a bit short on the volume like most reviews say, not being in a busy area, thats not a problem for us, but could see how it could annoy some. Great option of sounds,the fact that you can run it all night (no auto shut off) is perfect, the option of plugging in or batteries great, its not too big so you can travel with it, and cant beat that price. All in all, very nice little sound machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY Too Quiet","review":"This is a terrible sound machine. It's far too quiet to mask any household noises. It's so quiet that I have to lie perfectly still in order to even be able to tell that it's on. No exaggeration--The highest volume setting is quiet as a whisper. It's an absolute waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better products out there...","review":"We purchased this while expecting my first child, and as soon as it arrived I knew that we would not be satisfied with the product. Once you set it for what you want, you have to reset it every time you turn it back on. The volume lowers to almost inaudible, and it does not resort back to the last setting. My son sleeps with the rain sound, so EVERY time I turn it on I have to set it to rain and turn the volume all the way up to even come close to drowning out noises outside his room. This may not seem significant, but considering every time he goes down for a nap, or for the night, it adds up. We have the tranquil moments sound machine in our room from Brookstone and we will be spending the extra money and purchasing the baby version of this for our next child that we are currently expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good features, poor construction","review":"Unit has a good selection of features, but the logic on my unit failed within a week, and could not be resurected (no cause I can guess at either). And the way the unit is built, it cannot (or would be very hard) to take apart to poke at the guts and check for anything loose. So it gets a \\"1\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound quality","review":"Very poor sound quality. Very artificial sounds. Volume does not go very loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed my original review.","review":"Another update - 1/23/2013. We've now lost 3 tracks to horrible screeching and/or crackling sounds so I knocked another star off. Again.I originally posted 5 stars for this sound machine but I've changed my mind. We've been using it for just 4 months. It was great in the beginning but a couple of weeks ago the sound we were using started to make screeching noises in the middle of the night. We switched to another sound and it stopped but we can't use our favorite anymore. Hopefully, just the one digital track is damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"My unit was too low in volume to be usable","review":"The unit I got was useless. Its volume would not go above a whisper, even when I upped the volume control to the max. I attibute this to a defect in the unit. From the variation of reviews here, it seems some of these things are fine volume-wise, while others, like mine, are unusable. If this is the case, it's a toss of the dice whether the one you get will work. I now have to go to the hassle of sending mine back. And by the way, it looks as if it was used before and then repacked. I\\"m sorry but I can't recommend a substitute. I've got to go back to square one in my research for an economical but effective noise generator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great White Noise Machine","review":"I am a light sleeper since having my children and this noise machine has been my lifesaver. Before I got it I would always run a fan at night, even in the Winter. It made my husband nuts. I bought my kids a white noise machine with a night light, and finally figured I should have one too. I like this model the best because it can run all night and has a sound I like (wind). My only complaint is that it's not quite as loud as I would like, but I tried a few different machines before settling on this one. I actually just ordered a second one since my original one stopped working after 2+ years and after we got back from a road trip where it was in a duffel bag and got kind of beat up. I don't think it was because of poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Ease of Use","review":"This product requires that each time it is used that the desired sound and volume must be set. It does not remember your previous selections. There are better choices for those that want to use it nightly and do not want to have to set the volume and sound each night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot live without this","review":"I bought this after having twins. Since they were born, we have used it EVERY night. I like that you can combine sounds. From the time they were born until about a year ago (they are 3) they listened to the womb noise. Now they like the ocean with the buoy. I would recommend this to anyone!! I slept better tnan ever when I could hear this on the monitor!! You will not be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too quiet","review":"This was way too quiet, even on it's loudest setting. My infant didn't benefit from it at all. The sounds are fine, and not too repetative as with some machines, but even in a small room (really small) I found it too quiet to be effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"surviving life with a colicky baby","review":"After two months of little sleep and many failed attemps to get my colicky baby to stop crying I bought the DEX Sound Sleeper. I didn't think that it would work, since nothing else had. But to my surprise (and my husband's) it did. I can now lay her down for naps and bedtime in her bassinnet with the \\"womb\\" setting on and she sleeps. It has really helped to get her on a schedule. My 18 month old was an easy baby, so this has been tough to deal with, but not now. My newborn is awake a lot more and not crying as much when she is. During the day, I can set her in her vibrating bouncy seat, womb sound playing and she's a happy camper and I can play with her sister or even get some house work done. Plus, I'm getting sleep at night, which makes Mommy happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Baby Gift!!!!","review":"This is by far the best baby gift I received. Not only does it put our son to sleep, but us as well. I wish I would have found it months ago when our daughter was having trouble sleeping through the night because of the train whistle that blows near our new house.My son was also just in the hospital for 10 days and this was great to help him sleep and block out all of the beeps and buzzes of the monitors and alarms. All of the doctors and nurses kept commenting how great it was.It doesn't get super loud, but I think if it did it would have less of a calming effect. It is perfect for an infant - especially the womb sounds.Love it!!!!!!! And I will be buying it for my friends who are pregnant too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with it, but had to return one first.","review":"We have been using an electric fan in our daughter's room to filter out background noise, but feared it would burn out. I read the online reviews for this product and thought I'd try it out. The first one I got from the store did not go loud enough, and after a few minutes would fade out completely (on the continuous mode). If I gave it a tap, it would come back on, but faintly. I took it back and tried another one, and this one works perfectly. On the highest volume it definitely blocks background noises, but isn't so loud it's disruptive. It doesn't fade out, and goes all night like a champ. We love it, but Dex might need to do a little more QC to get the sound issues worked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible un-natural sounds.","review":"The idea is there... BUT the sounds just sound so fake! I tried to sleep to this last night and i wanted to throw it out the window. I don't expect my infant to like it. Horrible noises. The volume goes pretty loud for a quiet infants room, but when you turn it up the horrible fake noises sound even worse! This is going back tomorrow. I guess i will continue my search!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate description","review":"Evidently the description of this product needs updating. It will not work on batteries. The instructions with the machine state \\"The demo mode and batteries are intended for display and shipping purposes only.\\" I've tried several times and have not been able to get it to work with batteries. Guess this is one reason the settings will not hold when you turn it off. Have to set your preferences and volume each time you turn it on. Probably would not have purchased if I had known this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Volume","review":"Having previously purchased a sound maker (which is no longer sold) for our 2 1/2 year old son, I was eager to purchase a similar sound machine for our newborn. I am very disappointed in this product. While it has many sound choices and options, it is barly loud enough to be heard across the room. I would suggest another product. The sound volume is the entire reason I use the product...to keep the little darlings sleeping even when the doorbell rings!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price, good concept, poor sound quality","review":"Great product except for one major flaw....it doesn't go loud enough to hear! We have another noise machine that my 3 year old uses, but we took this one on a trip to use in the hotel. She spent more time telling me she couldn't hear it and that it wasn't on than sleeping! Hotel room was pretty small and quiet so I cannot imagine trying to use this in a house with normal noises and having any success! I love being able to combine the sounds to customize the sound and the option to leave it on all the time or by a timer, but if she can't hear it it wont work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it's weight in GOLD!!!!!!!","review":"Our 3 month old daughter has not slept a wink unless someone was holding her since birth! I bought this today and she has slept in her cribe for an hour. And she is still sleeping!!!!

She had colic and reflux--it seemed to soothe her some at night during those first trying months! Now she is 10 months old and takes every nap and goes to bed every night listening to the sound of the ocean and thunder. Only product I have found where you can mix and match the sounds. I love it because it is small/portable. I take it to my mom's when she stays there. This is our second child, first child sleeps to a CD. This item is so much easier to carry with you when you travel or even to the babysitters--it is small, can run on batteris or plug in. I just love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dex sound machine","review":"Works great for a year. Our family is addicted to sound machines. There is one in every room.

The homedics are still going strong even though they are dusty and old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough","review":"We owned a Brookstone noisemaker for several years. It broke and we looked to replace it. This noisemaker makes the same noises as our old noisemaker but it is very quiet. It is not effective in cancelling out distracting noises. I am going to try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Machine","review":"I was disappointed with the product. First it doesn't have white noise and its not very loud at all. If you are buying to help block out other noise for your baby to sleep I would not recommend this. If its for an older child to have some smoothing sounds to sleep with than its fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough and not soothing","review":"I was very disappointed with this sound machine and ended up exchanging it for the Marpac sound conditioner for my infant's room and my toddler's room in order to drown out each other's nightly disturbances. The DEX does have a lot of selections, but my husband and I thought only 3 of them were soothing--the white noise, the ocean and the wind. But the volume of the ocean sound was not constant and we thought it might actually wake our baby instead of drowning out household noises. The sound of the gulls, thunderstorm and some of the others were just plain annoying, not soothing at all. We tried combining some of the sounds, as it suggests, but it would just switch turns with two different sounds rather than playing them both simultaneously. Also, it's not loud enough and this is ultimately why we returned it. We are very satisfied with the Marpac, which sounds like a mixture between white noise and a fan blowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke in 1 month","review":"At first it worked fine, did a great job. Then after ~3 weeks, the sound started to go to static and cut in and out. One week later it was completely non-functional. We used a voltage meter to check if the motherboard was dead (maybe we could still run it from batteries?) and discovered that this device needed a 9 volt transformer. We got a 12 volt transformer in the box, which of course fried the electronics in short order.Not our mistake, but we are left with a useless piece of plastic. Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my colicky baby!","review":"My daughter had colic starting at about a week old. We got this when she was about six weeks and it really seemed to help her sleep. There are many options of sounds and you can also mix sounds together, for example seagulls with the ocean. It is great that it plugs in, we don't have any batteries in ours right now, but there is that capability as well. I researched several other sound machines but I'm glad we chose this one. It's a good value for your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No White Noise Button! Not Loud Enough! Sucks Batteries","review":"This machine does not go loud enough and sucks batteries. Also, this machine does not have a white noise button, and it was advertised as having white noise. We bought this one and a Homedics soundspa because we know some babies like different sounds and we know that different machines make different sounds. Our little one prefers the white noise sound and the Homedics SoundSpa. This machine does have a wind noise that sounds similar, so we took it to the babysitter's and we let her use it there since he's not there often. Don't waste your money - get the Homedics SoundSpa. Its a little more expensive, but worth it in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sound is Way Too Low","review":"We have had this for 2 weeks, and though we have not had problems with it, the VOLUME IS WAY TOO LOW. You can hardly hear it on the loudest setting. This is so very disappointing, as we need a machine like this to keep our baby asleep at night. The only sound that doesn't hiss on the loudest setting is the WIND, so that is what we have been using. I wish I had spent my money on a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound Machine","review":"This is definitely not worth $50-at the very most $10. The sound was terribly low and you could hear every move with it on the highest level! I am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend buying it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great as a sleep machine. Wish it didn't reset on power outage","review":"This is a great little machine. Sure an iphone or other radio could do the job but, sometimes it's nice to have a dedicated device that does one thing and does it well. The only complaint I have (which is small actually) is that I do wish it would continue playing the same sound after a power outage. At it is, it defaults to the first sound when the power returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound device for kids and adults","review":"The quality and variety of the sounds are great. There are cheaper versions but it's worth the few extra dollars to have sounds that are actually soothing as opposed to strange. It has a number of settings (timed, continuous, combining sounds, even womb sounds). There are sounds I thought would be annoying (like bells) but they turned out to be oddly soothing. I bought it for the womb sounds, but never used it because I liked the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"This machines is way too quite","review":"This machines is way too quite, you can barely hear it at its loudest volumes.

Either way for the price I would recommend another products."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality sound","review":"I guess I got what I paid for...not much. Scratchy, static...

Spend more and be pleased with your purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Oh my gosh, this is by far the worst sound machine I have ever seen. It comes with batteries and so you would think that it would run on batteries but they are only for shipping and the demo mode...makes no sense to me. the buttons do not wok properly, you have to mash them several times to make the connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY QUIET","review":"If, after reading all of these reviews, you have some doubts about the volume please don't buy this! Its extremely quiet. Very very quiet. And I just don't understand why they wouldn't give you more flexibility with the volume. Its such an easy thing to put into a unit. There are about four volume settings on this. The highest is just extremely weak.I just had to return mine. I wanted it to work so badly; but the volume problem is unavoidable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working in two weeks","review":"I used it for baby's naptime and nighttime, and it was working good. I didn't use all sorts of sounds, just rain sound worked fine. After using for two weeks it suddenly stopped making sound. It was operated as instructed in users manual, not in demo mode, and I used plug in, not batteries. So I contacted the company by email. The receptionist responded asking what happened and I described exactly what happened. After about a month, no response, so I inquired the status. The receptionist answered that they are processing request and replacement parts would be shipped to me. So I waited. Still no parts after four months. I could have returned it to amazon before the return window closed. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a month","review":"I liked this when it worked.

Unfortunate since I did like the noise it made."},{"rating":"1","title":"for toddler's room...not great","review":"I like the variations of sounds and that you can combine them. Most, however, have, as someone else said, distractingly short loops. I actually like \\"Rain,\\" but many others keep me up at night through his monitor. My son would play with it for an hour if I let him. But it is very quiet and not good for covering other noises, which is kind of the purpose as far as we're concerned. Also, the volume control buttons are annoying slow to adjust."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE PRODUCT!","review":"This item broke after about a week of use.

I just wish it went louder. We use these in our younger two children's rooms. We use it so we don't have to tip toe throughout the rest of the house when they are asleep. However, they are not loud enough to drown out our sounds. Our son is a heavy sleeper so it's fine for him, but our daughter is a light sleeper and this is not loud enough for her room."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound sleeper not so great","review":"I bought the sound sleeper because I had been running a humidifier in my girls' room for 3 months so that they would not wake eachother up at night, and also so that my baby could nap in a noisy house without being disturbed. I wanted to replace the humidifier with a noise machine, but did not want to pay an arm and a leg for it. The Sound Sleeper did have a decent variety of sounds, although not the white noise I was hoping for. Using the wind setting that my older daughter said was the only one she liked, I was hoping would give ample background noise for the room. The Sound Sleeper could be turned loud enough but at the maximum volume (which I found necessary), the noise distorted to an extend that I found it extremely distracting just to be able to hear it through my baby monitor. My baby did not sleep well the night that I used it and the next day I went back to the humidifier. The only reason I did not return it was, frankly, laziness. That was my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be great if you could hear it...","review":"The AC adaptor and sound selections are great, but the sound is way too low, even on the highest level.

Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"After reading some neg comments abt this I wasn't sure what to expect but all I can say is - get it and you won't be sorry. Works great - DOES have plenty of volume contrary to some reports and is easy to use"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough","review":"I bought this yesterday to replace a noise machine I have that uses just batteries. I used this one for a night but am returning it today. It doesn't get nearly loud enough to block out any noise. I would prefer to just keep buying batteries so the machine is loud enough rather than use this one that doesn't block any sound. Not sure why you would need so many choices in sounds either. That just seems to be an extra for no reason. My baby uses one sound (ocean) and I don't think would benefit from switching that with other noises. The only benefit to this machine is that you can plug it in. That's not good enough to use it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"I just bought this today for myself and tried to take a nap with it. The volume was fine on mine but the most soothing sound for me (the rain), was obviously recorded using a water pump. There are a lot little annoying sounds that kept waking me up. It might be somewhat relaxing for settling down but not staying asleep since extra \\"random\\" sounds come in every couple of seconds with each option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak sound","review":"Maybe this device is for newborns only, and maybe we waited too late to try it out on our 4 month old. But this thing is not loud enough, and the choices for sound are weak, pathetic attempts at recreating nature. And Thunder? Why would you include that? The only reason it didn't scare our baby is because it can't get loud enough. I'm going to return this thing, with a vengeance. I'll keep looking, but I wonder if there's nothing better than good ol' static on the AM dial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Volume resets to lowest","review":"We've had two of these (lost the first after two years) and have been satisfied overall, but find it annoying that everytime you turn the machine off it resets the volume to the lowest setting and you must click repeatedly up until you think it is as high as you can go (it is basically useless at any lower volume). And there is no volume indicator, just your ears:("},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Sounds","review":"I bought this for my wife who can't sleep without some white noise in the background. Some reviewers have mentioned that the volume is lacking. It is not super loud and will not overcome loud noises in the background; however, we've found it to be more than adequate for providing a sleep environment. We particularly like the small size. This will make it possible for us to take it on trips for use in hotels. It also runs on batteries so you could take it on camping trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds are awful","review":"We bought this to replace the other faulty sound machine we had for our daughter. I was excited to get it and was so disappointed when I turned it on. Other reviewers mentioned this but the volume is awful. It is very low at it's loudest. The other issue is the sound quality. My daughter sleeps with the \\"rain\\" noise and this rain sound sounds canned and almost like static. It's awful. The only redeeming quality is that the design is nice. However, design or not, it's not really functional. I am returning this asap. So disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't run on batteries","review":"This device does not really operate on battery power. It does have a battery compartment and it seems like it should work under battery power but apparently the battery operation only works when the unit is set to demo mode. Demo mode only plays the sound you select for 10 seconds. I don't know about anyone else, but my kids take longer than 10 seconds to fall asleep so therefore I consider it inoperable using batteries. Otherwise, unit seems to sound OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRRRRRRRRRReat!","review":"I love, love, love this item. I have had it for about a year and it has been a lifesaver, especially when we sleep away from home and it would normally be near impossible to get my two year old to go to bed. It gives him a little peice of home to make him feel comfortable and it helps to block out any noise going on outside the bedroom. I don't think my husband and I would be able to watch movies after our son is sleeping without this because he is the type of child who absolutely will not sleep if he thinks there is something going on without him. It's great. There are so many sounds and combinations to choose from. the sounds are clear, soothing, and they get loud enough to mask outside noise. I love it so much, I'm going to get one for my room!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Quiet","review":"This wouldn't go loud enough to actually drown out noises outside our daughter's room which was the entire point of getting her a white noise machine. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can barely hear the noise on this machine","review":"The maximum noise level on this machine is very low.

It is a distractingly short loop; bad sound quality. Also arrived broken - volume control would not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too quiet","review":"The sounds are nice and I like the fact that you can combine sounds, like thunder and rain. Problem is that it's just way too quiet. If you're trying to block out other sounds then you want it, but if you just need a little something to soothe you then it's very nice. It's fun for playing pretend with the kids too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Junk","review":"This is a low cost item......Perhaps made in a third world nation....Very low volume, had to place it almnost next to my ear to hear it.

This was a great investment and I wish I had it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"It helped my baby stay asleep","review":"My son was a very light sleeper and any little noise would wake him up. I bought this thinking that it wouldn't work but was worth a try. It actually did help him to stay asleep. He would sleep for hours at a time as long as the machine was on. It actually helped me to relax too bc we slept in the same room. I don't like things hanging on this crib so I liked that this machine can be put anywhere.I put it on the floor under his bassinet then on a short stool next to his crib. I haven't had to use it lately but I keep it close by just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Piece of Machinery @ very low cost...","review":"I bought this product for my goddaughter who was having a tough time adjusting to sleeping in her crib. As soon as we laid her down in the crib, and set the unit to the womb sound... I believe that in a matter of 3 minutes, she was down for the count! = )I use this machine to lay her down with when I sit for my girlfriend, and never have a fear of any amount of fussing from my goddaughter which of course is less stress on her and on me!Great machine to have for all young children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough - I should have listened to the reviewers","review":"I returned this product after using it for 1 night in my 2-year old's room. I agree with the other reviewers who complained about the volume. I had it on the highest volume and I needed it to go up 1 or 2 more notches. If you want something that can block outdoor noises such as loud birds or trash trucks in the morning, or indoor noises such as siblings in the same room, then I don't recommend purchasing this product. On the plus side, the product is very light, would be easy to travel with, and has a large selection of sounds, if those features are important to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voulme is so SOFT that it's absurd.","review":"I had read the reviews for this noisemaker, and had heard that somepeople had complained the volume was too soft - however, there seemed to be enough reviews to the contrary to give me the confidence to buy this.I can not stress this enough. This. product. is. barely. audible.On it's highest volume, it's practically useless.I will be returning this immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but...it's very quiet!","review":"We bought this for our 16 month old to try to wean her off of the fan we had been using for white noise. However we were very disappointed by the volume of this sound machine. The sounds are great, but it's simply very quiet and doesn't cover up normal household noises outside her bedroom door.I would not recommend this product for this reason alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the noise?!?!?!","review":"Pretty simple, this simply isn't loud enough. Not that I want to turn my nursery into a rock concert, but the volume on this simply doesn't go very high. We bought this because it was highly rated, now I have to go buy a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better options out there","review":"Wish I listened to other reviews before purchasing. The sound quality is terrible, you can here the tick tick looping of the effects. Broke after 2 days, where only one sound would work. Sent it back and bought a Sound Oasis model for $20 more than this one. So much better. My baby slept 3 hours longer than usual the first night. My advice is to spend a bit more for a Sound Oasis model, they are worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing beats a fan!","review":"I love having a fan on in the room when I am sleeping, but bringing home a preemie in January meant I had to turn off the fan for a while. So I bought this, and it's OK. I use it, but I wish I had a different one.My biggest gripe is that I have to constantly set it to the settings I want, each night. I use the same settings every time, the same noise, volume, etc, and yet I have to reset those every night. I wish it would start on the last settings you had. It only takes a couple seconds, but it's annoying!I use the wind sound for white noise, it works OK.In all, I could have bought a simpler one, but there are so many out there, I finally just picked one. Now that it's warmer, I'm going back to the fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"8 years and still working perfectly!","review":"We bought this unit 8 years ago for my baby boy... now he's 8-1/2 years old and still loves his \\"wave machine\\". I never found certain sounds useful since it's to annoying to hear the sound loop's repeat point. It can unnerve a person trying to relax. BUT, the wave is one of the best wave sounds of many I've listened to. (The brook and wind are fine too).As for durability... this unit has taken drops from a highboy in the \\"baby room\\" and from it's current place on my big boy's desk. It still works and looks like new. Batteries last decently long... perhaps replacing them every few months. We use it every night! A great price and sounds MUCH better than others we tried for 4-5 times the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound machine - we purchased a second one!","review":"We love this sound machine so much we bought two - one for each of our boys' rooms (a newborn and a toddler). We set it on \\"continuous/rain\\" and use it every night and at every nap. The small size of the machine makes it easy to bring with us wherever we go, so our boys can have a familiar sound if we need to put them down to sleep in an unfamiliar environment. I suppose it could be a little louder, but it seems to be sufficient for our boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, but getting returned","review":"I love the concept behind this. My son uses a white noise machine to fall asleep and we wanted one for our baby due next month. I liked what I read about being able to mix sounds. First of all, you can only mix certain sounds together - not whatever you want. But, the real reason this is getting returned is that it is way too quiet. Even at it's loudest, there is no way it will block out noises. My husband and I could whisper near it when it was on full volume, and still hear each other just fine. This one goes back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $20, key shortcomings","review":"I have three of these for my three kids' rooms. After a while they begin to whine when on the wind setting which is the only one which has steady sound. Also the volume doesn't go high enough. I'm buying three new ones and throwing these away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough, one broke immediately","review":"Well, I am still using one unit I bought because I like the rain setting for my 2 month old but I have concerns. I inadvertantly purchased two units, the first is still working but is not able to reach volumes to initially calm my infant, and it lacks a true \\"white noise\\" setting or a \\"fan\\" setting, which I hoped it would have. It occaisionally makes a loud popping sound, too. The secound unit stopped working immediately (after 2 uses of 20 minutes each)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it! NO VOLUME!","review":"Even on maximum volume this machine is so quiet that it is completely useless.Ambient noise in the room completely drowned it out. I returned it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough to be effective","review":"I have used noise machines for all three of my kids for years. When my 3 year olds \\"noise\\" finally gave out he chose this one off of Amazon. sadly it is not nearly loud enough to be effective. I am returning it and will go with the more expensive but more effective Graco model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, portable and decent sound quality","review":"We've had this white noise maker for almost 2 years now which is impressive considering the price. It is wonderful to travel with -- it's been all over the country with us. My only complaint is that now that we have a second child, I wish we could increase the volume just a little bit more. Over all though, we've been very satisfied with this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough","review":"I am a mother who swears by sound machines. I purched this machine and it is too soft. Our other machines are much louder and more effective. the homedics one is a better choice"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can hear a pin drop when this is on....","review":"Ok, perhaps you can't hear a pin drop, but the highest volume on this machine is still pretty quiet. On second thought, that may be a good thing since the sound choices on this unit are all pretty unpleasant - very mechanical sounding at best, and the \\"womb\\" choice sounds like the background to an alien invasion movie or something. I am totally disapointed with this cheap looking, low quality item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit didn't work","review":"I took the Sound Sleeper out of the box, put it in normal mode, and plugged it into the wall. The sound that came out of the Sound Sleeper was so quiet it could hardly be heard. I tried to turn up the volume using the volume control but it had no effect on performance. In my opinion, it is terrible quality control when a new unit doesn't work. I would never order from this company again. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"More sounds but not more expensive","review":"This product is not very expensive but supports quite a few sounds. Unlike others I have researched this one also gives you the ability to combine 2 selected sounds or a random combination of sounds, which makes it more interesting. It has basic volume control and on/off switch and a 60min timer mode that is helpful to turn off, especially if running on batteries. Missing features in addition that would be nice to have would be to be able to set the timer minutes before shutoff, and alarm features that could wake you up to the nature sounds. It is for babies but adults can enjoy the sounds too. The volume could be louder too, especially if in areas with ambient sound, but is adequate for our needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"We bought this for our 2 year old to fall asleep to and she loves it! It works really great to provide her with a pleasant constant sound, which is helpful now that we have a newborn crying at odd hours. I especially like the fact that you can leave the sound on all night, as opposed to having to set a timer, like on other white noise machines.I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product!","review":"This is a wonderful sound machine that my two-year-old could not sleep without. I also like the fact that you can use electricity or batteries to run it. That makes it extremely convenient for taking with us anywhere! The combo feature is great. It allows you to find the perfect sounds to induce sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"great sound options - way too quiet","review":"I love that you can mix and match sounds with this sound soother - my girls like the womb sounds particularly. However, this thing is not even CLOSE to being loud enough to qualify as white noise. You have to put the thing directly into an infant's crib (making the cord a choking hazard) in order for them to even hear it. If you are like me and need the white noise to keep your baby from waking up from other sounds in the house, you need something a lot louder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough","review":"Bought it for my 9 months old's nursery room to drown out other noises in the house in the evening. It's not loud enough at all even with the highest volume setting, so I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad, it broke","review":"This worked well for us. I bought it for my twin toddlers' room after the birth of my new baby.It kept the twins from being woke up by the baby. It also seemed to help at nap time. I used it every day for almost 4 months, until today. It stays on for about 3 seconds, then shuts off. I tried everything, and it just does not work anymore.I read the reviews before, hoped I wouldn't get a lemon. But it seems that even the good ones break.I strongly recommend trying something else.The return policy stinks, not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now my Mom wants one too!","review":"I chose to purchase this sound maker for my kids, 3 & 1, because it was one of the best rated and still within my budget. It works great for the kids and while visiting my mom she used it over night and decided she was going to get one too. There are two things I wish it did, play music and gradually quiet before turning off. The more expensive brands did that but I didn't want to pay $70 for them. So, for the money, it works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not loud enough, bum ac adapter","review":"I received this in the mail today, unfortunately it's already back in the box for return. I bought it to help my baby sleep and block out the noises in the house from her room. I plugged it in and tried to set it down and it immediately turned off. I tried again and touched the AC adapter cord and it cut off again. When I was able to get it to stay on for longer than a few seconds, the loudest volume setting was way too low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked","review":"We received this product as a gift for our new baby and were very excited to try it out since we have heard great things about white noise. However, after switching the product from demo into normal mode and plugging it in there was no change. The noises only run for 3-5 seconds as if it was stuck in demo mode. We have tried a million different things to get it to work and finally just gave up. I would return it but it was a gift so it is going into the garbage. Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite disappointing","review":"I rarely write a review but this item really upsets me. I researched before buying. Maybe that's why I am more disappointed than usual. Of course sleepless because of baby wouldn't stay asleep didn't help me to be calm either. This machine broke down after one and half month of use! The machine turned on, just to stop after 5 seconds! It's so annoying. Why not just stop working completely!? To add to the complain, is the sound level being very low. I have to put it on a chair closely next to her crib for it to work ok. We still need to tip toe around the room and ask people not to ring the door bell, ect. Lousy product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Sleep Machine","review":"My husband has slept with a noisy CPAP machine since 1992. When it broke, and couldn't be fixed, we had to buy a new one. It's quiet! That might sound like a good thing, but I was used to the \\"white noise.\\" I bought this machine, and it works wonderfully. There are a lot of different sounds, but I have picked out the one that sounds the most like white noise to me. The volume of the sound can easily be raised or lowered - it's great! I would buy this again. P.S. It has a timer on it that I don't care for, so if you don't want to time your sounds, be sure you don't push the button all the way up to the timer."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for babies/toddlers","review":"I finally bought this after searching for something cheaper. My almost 2 year old has had my TIMEX sound/cd alarm clock since she was born and i decided it was time to get something just for her.this has a variety of sounds and works great to drown out noise after she goes to sleep.the only thing that i don't like about it is that after you turn it off and then turn it on again you have to click the sound you want. it doesn't stay on wind noise even though that is the one i always use. not a hug deal, just one more step. my husband didn't notice and surprisingly one night she slept through the default one which i think is a stream/river type sound.anyway, this is a great find and you can't beat the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Bought this for my daughter over a year ago.

Our personal favorite is Ocean & Bouy.I love that you can run it all night, just in case your little one starts to get up during the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This sound machine is too quiet to even make it worth owning.

No good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too quiet","review":"I bought this for white noise to help me sleep.(I usually use a fan on low, but mine had died and none of the stores were carrying fans as they are a \\"seasonal\\" item.)I wanted to love this, with the different sound options, but it was just too quiet. :(Not sure it would be enough white noise to keep a baby to sleep either."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEX Products /sound Sleeper SS-01","review":"Perfect replacement for a white noise maker we had that stopped working.

The reason I put played in quotes is the game was a slug. It seemed to stop to load every three seconds or so. I don't whether it was an issue with my system, but something can definitely be said about a game which loads constantly. Even if the game did work on my computer, I still would not like it. I lknow this because I played a working version (it still loaded too often) at another person's house. There is no storyline and no character involovment. I like a little story to follow along.

Net connections were smooth at 100 ping.Unreal Tournament, on the other hand, chugged even on 512x384 with lowest detail settings, and had choppy net play. That's really disappointing considering UT had far more gameplay innovations and cooler features (I love Domination).The bottom line is: unless you have a 128MB PIII-600 with a Voodoo 3000 (or better), don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah humbug","review":"I got both UT and Q3A for christmas and was more excited to play UT.

Not that all Quakers are but, it is often the case (although it has gone the other way as well) Some one said \\"Unreal Tournament, on the other hand, chugged even on 512x384 with lowest detail settings, and had choppy net play.\\" which is HIGHLY unusual as I can run it in 800x600 at lightening speed on my horrible video card and p2 450 w/128RAM. and netplay is EXTREMELY fast even on my horrible ISP/56kmodem. The modes and levels are excellent and highly original. finding secrets is somewhat challenging but not especially and quite a treat. the shield belt in DMGalleon for instance.

You can't fail to be impressed with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice game, but overrated","review":"Well, I can't deny that this game is a good 3d action first person shooting game, but I didn't enjoyed this game so much. And even though there was a good variety of game features, none of them seemed interesting to me, and the graphics wasn't so cool compared to quake 3. Weapons; probably one of the best variety of weapons for this kinda game, but the sounds [were lacking]. And the lightning effects wasn't so impressive. Bots, cool AL, very impressive; better than Q3. Deathmatch, not so good. Assult and Domination wasn't so fun either. Team Deathmatch and Capture the flag were the best game features in my opinion. Anyways, I'm giving this game one star because this game is too overrated. Anyways, it's a good game; I just don't like this game so much, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible game!","review":"I don't know what everyone else sees in this game and why they consider it so addicting and cool, it, like Quake 3 is just mindless shooting only leaving you angry.

If your looking for another good deathmatch style game, this one fits the bill. This game also has a cool stats feature. Infogrames set up a server that keeps all your stats (kills, deaths, items, frag per hour). I like this feature, it gives you another reason to stay addicted to the game.The other game plays: CTF, Assault, and Domination give the game of good mix and all of the types have many online servers to play on with people actually on them playing.In addition, the graphics on the game are quite nice too. The maps and player models are different from other 1st person shooters. The game runs well, I haven't had any problems. The weapon selection is also good and different, which I like.Overall, this game is worth the money, you won't be disappointed with this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's get to the point....","review":"Okay, if you're reading this you must be considering to buy this game. I'm not going to go into all this technical stuff cause everyone has pretty much covered it. For the price right now, it's really cheap and worth it. If you're a fan of shooters, get this game. It's up there with Counter-strike and they are both good games in a different way. Even if you don't play online or have a slow connection, the bots are amazingly realistic and fun. Even playing the solo tournaments are fun cause they give you different challenges. I highly recommend this game and it's money well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game, but not for Windows NT","review":"I think this is great, maybe the greatest game i've ever played, but on my operating system (windows NT) I can't get it to run on full screen, only a 4x6 inch window. I've tried everything, even changing some .INI files but it still won't work! My dad is a programmer and he can't get it to work in full! when u make the window larger, the resolution goes higher, and it doesn't run on my comp cuz its only a 333MHz Pentium II. If you want a game that is easier to operate and start, stick with half life or counterstrike. Maybe the patch i downloaded was bugged or it didn't work right, I'm not sure.

I was expecting a light, frothy Regency romance. Instead, this is a historical novel, set in the 1830s, with a strong feminist slant that sees women as victims. The central female characters move through the novel subject to the legal control of the males around them. One subplot explores the lack of legal protection for married women in abusive relationships. This is a strong novel with a lot of violence. I have rated it two stars only.

Unfortunately, it's all too obvious that she was inspired by bad writing!Her characterizations are shallow and predictable, and her dialog is unrealistic. My guess this is Ms. Wilkins' idea of what she imagines teenagers wish their lives were like: Octavia's the outcast, yes, but she's rich and privileged, the daughter of famous parents who always has a snappy comeback at the ready. Even in her awkward moments, Octavia is sure of herself. It's all just too easy, and no real emotion comes through in the writing.My suggestion to Ms. Wilkins is to try again but this time get yourself inspired by some GOOD YA authors--try Megan McCafferty, Sonya Sones, Celia Moriarty for starters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning bliss","review":"Argentine tango giros or turns can be done in a circle or in a line, and are an amazing sight when done properly and with speed.

However this album seems to be more mature, there is less raw energy and more beautiful melodies surrounding lyrics that come straight from the heart.

Now, when I heard Life in Your Way had switched to \\"Solid State Records,\\" I was so excited. It serves them right. They are a great band with a lot of talent and deserve better exposure, which Solid State could provide them with. But, The record label has taken certain things away from their sound that I most enjoyed. The dynamics. The older stuff held the music (guitars) at a higher regard, than \\"Waking Giants.\\" The music is generally the same... the vocals are still great, but the mixing and editing has washed the guiars together.

As already pointed out, the closing song \\"You Gotta Be a Football Hero\\" had been changed to \\"When The Saints Go Marching In,\\" and a scene with Crewe and the Warden has been deleted. That's bad news! What I don't think anyone has mentioned is that the song \\"Saturday Night Special\\" was playing in the original film when Paul Crewe has the car chase with the police, then dumps his car into the bay.

When I got the game however I was extremely dissappointed to find out that, with all the complexity of Jordan's world, the best they could come up with was a 1st person shooter. The books are so intricate and complex, and yet with this game there is no character interaction, nothing to figure out. On top of all this, the music was terrible. Instead of authentic stringed and woodwind instruments they get some bad rock band who throw in a fiddle every once in a while. I had to turn it off.

It sounds like my problem was unique, but even without this bug, I wasn't too impressed by this game. First of all, it would be better off following the book's plot, but from what I remember it was mostly campaigns (I didn't get very far, as I tried to return the gift only to have the people at Walmart say, \\"we're sorry but we don't return PC games\\"). I also don't remember having normal attacks, it was all ranged stuff, and combat system was a bit crummy.

Here are ghosts, witches, mad wives in the attic, black cats and other mandatory attributes. But probably, \\"gothic\\" decorations are not enough for a book, there should be something else. Something that I failed to find. The novel is tedious and empty. A weak attempt to create a thriller rather failed, the plot is hardly glued together, the episodes that are probably supposed to scare remind a bad horror movie that is full of dark rooms, ominous music and crazy screams, but simply does not frighten, period.I finished the book, but it was a waste of time.

It doesn't help that there are no vocals, and absolutely no arrangement to speak of - the songs are all extended by way of tedious solos (often by the scratchy and harmonically-challenged violinist).The pick of the bunch (i.e. best, not worst) is probably Sexx Laws, which retains the funkiness of the original but at least doesn't shy completely away from bluegrass stylings. There's some ok solos, mercifully short, and it just has a nice vibe to it (despite some obvious mistakes).All in all, a good idea but not thought out nearly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book for Learning to Design Constructed Wetlands","review":"This is a marvelous, easy to read book written by one of the pioneers in biological sewage treatment system Design.

The amount of information he presents is overwhelming. The conviction of Tommy and Karl would be laughable if it weren't so tragic. It is horribly ironic that Tommy trusted that the police would believe him when he told them that knew nothing about the disappearance of Denice Harraway. If he had asked for a lawyer, it is likely that he would have never seen the inside of the Pontotoc County jail. The same goes for Karl Fontenot.

There is a second part that is soon to come out in DVD called \\"Karol: The Pope who remained a man\\" which portrays the papacy of JPII. This movie shows his early life culminating in his election to the papacy in 1978. It has brilliant international actors who play their parts superbly like Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate from \\"The Passion of the Christ\\") who plays a major part as the Communist agent who persecuted Karol Wojtyla for many years and Raoul Bova (who brilliantly plays the future Pope's brave friend and priest during World War II). If one really wants to understand Poland under Nazi and Communist occupation and understand how Karol Wojtyla developed his vocation, this is the movie to watch. And watch for the sequel \\"Karol: The Pope who remained a man\\", it is equally as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and inspiring","review":"It is worthwhile watching it.

Only wish there was a book like this written by lesbians for straight men to learn from. Definately a great book for any woman who wants to spruce up activities in the bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"...Agree with rexross (previous reviewer)","review":"I picked this book up at a bookstore and after reading a few pages had to buy it.Now I am buying my fourth copy.Whever I mention this book to a friend, they inevitably want to borrow it...and it never comes home to me again!What does that tell you?-- The authors are onto something :) And everyone seems to appreciate what they have to say.I learned a lot from this little book, and love the drawings. It's done with a breezy chatty style, and opens the discussion about sex and pleasure without being too 'director-like' if you know what I mean. The humor is well done. Among other things, there are practical tips about being a thoughtful 'sleepover hostess' I believe I understand men's desires and needs better.Treat yourself to this little book of jems!I'm glad I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book looked so promising and the reviews were good everywhere, so I bought it. It has nothing new in it . It just enforced all kinds of sterotypes and made straight woman seem like they only used sex to manipulate their partner into buying them things. He was also very judgemental of alternative sex practices or relationships when his own sexual preference is seen as an alternative lifestyle by some. It was also very much geared to \\"first time\\" sex...if you know nothing about the partner including where they live. If I gained anything from this book and the great reviews I read is the knowledge that lot of people have very little and very bad sex. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad","review":"Love the humor! Learned some interesting new tips I didn't know. I'm 25 & have only been having sex for a lil over a year & this book was so helpful! I really wish there would be a lil more advice as to how to explain to your partner you want to try something new. I mentioned to my man I wanted to try something I read in here & he immediately got defensive. I have to admit, I wouldn't have found this book if not for the movie Hope Springs lol enjoy! There are several laugh out loud moments plus a very interesting look into the life of gay men that you may not have known before. Great read! Very insightful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one always makes people smile.","review":"Don't expect this book to teach you anything you don't know. The techniques are all pretty basic, albeit some with a little \\"twist.\\" However, it's entertainingly written and the title alone may be reason enough to own it. I've given it as a gift at a couple bridal showers, and it is always a big hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute books but tips useless!","review":"This book was really well done with regards to its artwork and writing style. It's got a really cute/kitschy retro style, both in writing and artwork. But are you buying the book for its artwork or for its TIPS, supposedly coming from those who should surely know?Well, I bought this book for some good tips, and without getting too specific in a public forum, let's just say that I do not recommend any of the advice given!! Two of the techniques in particular were completely contrary to what any of my partners have since said they like. Now maybe something was lost in the translation, but in a manual of this sort, you would hope the tips would be so clearly explained as to be goof proof, and in my experience that was not the case.This book was a great idea in theory, but for me it wasn't particularly helpful. Use at your own risk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my marriage.","review":"Amy and I have been married for 37 years now and our love life was really starting to fade until she bought this book. While some of the techniques at first seemed strange to me, Amy and I tried them out and I must say, I'm hooked! (You've got to try the 'Rim Job'!) We used to barely speak to each other at night, but now, after I come home from a long day of tax accountantcy, we put on a little Kenny G, pour a couple glasses of white zinfandel, and spend a couple hours on page 87 ('Fisting'). Thank you, Dan and Maggie, for putting the spice back in our love life."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just alright.....","review":"Frankly, I was disappointed by this book. Although it had one or two good tips, it certainly was not the arsenal of cool sex tips that it's made out to be. I've gotten more information from some other books I've read (The Ultimate Guide to Performing Fellatio). Decent for a beach read, but don't expect rockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only \\"How-to\\" Book You'll Ever Need!","review":"Brilliant. The authors know their business like no one else. These tips and techniques WORK. If you want to keep a man AND keep him coming back, read this, memorize it and use it. This book changed my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I expected something really funny, refreshing, and informative, but there was only one thing in the book that I found new, and the rest were things that most people know already, and it just wasn't very funny.

Those two things are the authors.Maggie comes across in the book as the most vanilla woman ever. There's nothing really wrong with that, but it doesn't really work on a sex advice book. She and the other women in the book don't seem open to anything that's really kinky, and thus I felt there wasn't anything she could tell me that I didn't already know.Then there's Dan, who proved that just because you're in the minority doesn't mean you're enlightened. ... ......Also, some of his tips seemed impossible to carry out.

First of all, be warned that before you use this machine, you have to make your house \\"Roomba-friendly:\\" you have to hide or move any cords or spare odds and ends from the floor or else the machine will get stuck. Also, emptying the compartments of dust or dirt entails becoming very comfortable with dirt. Because the Roomba doesn't use bags, you have to manually clean the three dust compartments out yourself, which can be sort of a pain and you get dirt all over the place in the process. The rotating brush underneath the vac also tends to get clogged with dirt, hair, and fur. The vacuum itself, while working properly, is a great machine; however, I was surprised and increasingly annoyed by the maintenance it requires."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awesome product!","review":"I've never written a product review before, but I am so loving the Roomba that I wanted to share the joy. I thought it was expensive until I filtered in the entertainment value. While it may not clean as deeply as a regular vacuum (according to the Roomba's own literature), it more than makes up for any lack of power with its ability to get under places one could never reach without hiring a furniture mover. My favorite thing is to watch it scuttle under the bed and re-emerge several minutes later with no effort on my part. I particularly like turning it on before I leave for work and returning to freshly vacuumed rooms. I never know where I'll find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roomba=Scamba","review":"My friend and I both bought this over-hpyed product when it first came out. Talk about a waste of time and money! I have several different styles of carpet throughout my home. They are of varying styles and lengths. the roomba did not work well on any of them. the only thing it might work well with is the kitchen floor that has no carpet. It was useless with short shag, pile or even the carpet in the family room. It stalled and went in circles and got stuck so many times it was pathetic. My friend had the same experience. Perhaps if Tim the Toolman could juice it up and add some HP to it, it might work. But until then save your time and money. Unless you have linoleum and it doesn't warrant the price for a sweeper that is so-so.

I have three children, no pets so thought this would be great. No. It got stuck and couldn't get out of some corners. Did not get edges very well, and the little edge guide kept getting tangled up with any hair or thread it might have picked up. It was okay in the kitchen, too high to go along the base board under the cupboard, but would pick-up some of the crumbs. It does not always get all the area you aim for. It worked great if I ran the vacuum before I used it. I think it would be great for a disabled person or perhaps a nursing home or hospital.

Like some other posters, I had problems with the battery not keeping a charge. I called the tech support 800 number and they told me not to keep it charging when it was not going to be used. Basicly, to charge for 12 hours and then unplug until I was going to use it. This seems to help. I also developed problems where Roomba would try to climb on things and did not seem to have his sense of direction. The tech support line explained how to clean the sensors and this helped tremendously.I have enjoyed having my Roomba and I am very pleased with the quick, accurate advice I have been able to get from tech support.My one complaint is that he is a pain to clean. Getting out the screw driver, toothbrush and tweezers to get the brushes clean is troublesome. However, it sure beats the old way I was vacuuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for hardwood floors","review":"This is not the solution I'd hoped for.

After I took the charger off, the battery drained without my using the Roomba. I received an adapter from the company to prevent the battery draining. I bought the extra battery and its charger.

I don't think it cleans particularly well either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea -- bad quality","review":"I LOVE this thing -- EXCEPT it broke after 4 months -- yes, right after the warrantee expired.

After two chargings and a total working running time of about 20 minutes, I've repacked it and returned it to the store. Twelve hours charging time for a 10 minute running life just isn't worth $200. We only intended the sweeper to be a backup to our Rainbow sweeper, but what we got was just not worth the the hassle and frustration. Yes, maybe the problem was just a bad battery, but again, for $200, I want something that works right off the bat. The potential is really there, we both liked what it could do, but this first generation model just doesn't live up to what we expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for a while...","review":"This fun product was intended to be a ploy to get my youngsters to pick up their belongings before the fun of watching Roomba vacuum the floor.

I find that to be a pain as well, having to unscrew things and try not to lose the tiny screw, etc. etc. It's kind of a gross process anyway. Also, I have now found there's a reason it only comes with a 90 day warranty. Got it in November, and it broke tonight. The rubber tread around one of the little wheels ripped and came off. What a strange piece to break. I don't see a replacement part for that on the iRobot web site, so my husband is trying to glue it back together. I might as well just throw it away.

It does not work well on medium pile carpets and I would't even try it on deep pile. It works best in an empty space which means I have to remove chairs and other stuff from the room before I begin. On medium pile carpet, it stops and gets \\"confused\\" by making aborted attempts to go in different directions. It does not pick up all dirt even after going over it several times.

Of course, she is supposed to save you time because she can vacuum by herself, and she does, but it is so much fun to watch her that I sometimes have a hard time going on with other things. Roomba does a great job on my kitchen floor and on my berber carpet. She even does a pretty good job on my plush carpet, although of course that one still needs a deep cleaning by the upright every now and then. But Roomba can even do some things that my upright cannot do, such as clean all the way under the beds and the living room sofa. Occasionally she even brings out a magazine or a lost sock from under the sofa, although technicallly that is not her job. I just LOVE Roomba, and now I see that this year there is a pretty burgundy-colored model that has a few new features.

I use it on hardwood floors with area rugs, mainly to pick up dog hair & dust between more complete cleanings & roomba does really well in these conditions. I haven't had many problems with it getting stuck -- it even manages the lip between floor surfaces without trouble. Roomba is a bit noisy, but you can start it as you leave the house, so that is not much of an issue.I have only one gripe in the entire time I've used the roomba, and that is the size of the dustbin. However, considering the size of the entire unit, I don't think the dustbin could be made much larger.Overall, I think roomba is a pretty good deal. It would be nice if the accessories were a little cheaper -- but the cost of the unit is easily justified with the time saved and the happy feeling of a clean house."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 defectives","review":"The Roomba (old model) works fine on my tile floor (whole house is tiled).

I would suggest that you go with the newer model so you will not have to go through my situation. It is amazing to see how much it does pic up through a midweek vacumn.

It cleans under beds and chests-of-drawers where no vacuum cleaner has ever gone before... if there's enough clearance [5\\"]. Roomba even went into the deep, cramped, dark spaces underneath the computer desk, navigated the tangle of power cables and surge protectors, and emerged without needing to ask us for a \\"rescue\\". If you're like us -- we like to turn on Roomba and let it run and run -- you'll want an extra battery and the rapid recharger. Not as powerful as an upright or canister of course, but achieves complete cleaning by making multiple passes over its target area. This gadget lives up to it's hype.

It picks up great and is very easy to use. It gets under the bed and other funiture. It gets inot tight places and finds it's way out. I just did a samm bedroom and it only took a few minutes.

However, it is more a \\"carpet sweeper\\" than a bona-fide vacuum cleaner, and the tiny motor and vacuum device it has will only remove surface debris - something you could do with a stick-vac or even a broom in a few minutes. If you are willing to pay $200 for a robot-like gadget that has limited utility, then you will like the Roomba. If you want to clean your floors thoroughly, then buy a conventrional upright vac, most of which cost a lot less than this trendy gadget."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Shuts Itself Off","review":"While this product does a good job with the clean up, every time I run it in my foyer, the side located power button shuts it off when it runs into the spring loaded door stopper. Never fails happens every time in this room - sometimes 3 restarts are necessary to complete the job. I think this design flaw was corrected in later models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a Toy - Not Made to Last","review":"My Roomba failed in just over a week. The brushes stopped turning, despite FREQUENT cleanings (which requires a screwdriver and some manual dexterity). I opened up the case to investigate and found that the brush motor uses PLASTIC gears and bushings, and one of these had actually MELTED. Don't take my word for it though: Do a web search and you'll find more detailed descriptions and pictures too.I called their customer service department, and they initially conceded that this is a problem. In the end, though, they claimed I had voided the warranty by investigating this myself.So be careful... your Roomba will require frequent emptying and servicing in the best case. And in the worst case it will fail altogether in a very short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought the Roomba a month ago, and haven't regretted it. We have several pets, and it's been wonderful for picking up all the pet hair from the wood floors. It does fairly well on our berber carpet also, but I wouldn't recommend it for a deeper pile. The best part is being able to set it in the middle of the room, pressing the button and walking away to do something else. It takes up little space, and it's not heavy and cumbersome like a regular vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reject this Robot","review":"Within 90 days of purchase, the ac/dc adapter has been replaced, the battery has been replaced, a rapid charger added, and the unit still doesn't work. It holds a charge for about 15 minutes, and stops repeatedly during that time requiring re-setting. This company needs to do a lot of work to improve their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum","review":"I just got out of the hospital at the same time that this vacuum arrived in the mail. I couldn't, at the time, sweep my floors so I charged the unit and let it do the sweeping for me. Wow! What a blessing. It has limitations in that it obviously can't reach spots that are smaller than the unit itself. I just swept the corners into the middle of the floor and the unit picked everything up. I wouldn't recommend it for carpets because the brushes get full of the fibres, but for floors, it's amazing. I'm happy that I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Ceramic Floors!","review":"i USE MY ROOMBA EVERYDAY.

I also have an asthmatic husband who is allergic to these two pets. We keep the pets away from him but the constant dust and fur, well the roomba can run and clean while I am doing other things.

Amazon refuses to accept liability and refund my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor execution","review":"When roomba works it is great, but based on my experience and many comments available on the internet it is trouble-plagued. Roomba has a three month warranty with parts being replaced up to six months. For troubles during the warranty period, they replace parts, including roomba itself, readily although you still have to pay shipping charges, about $20, if they replace the unit. However, after the warranty period, if something goes wrong you have had it. ROOMBA CANNOT BE REPAIRED. Unfortunately, things frequently do go wrong.I think that most of the good ratings of roomba, even by publications, are made after initial use before the troubles show up. I am amazed that the company has done nothing to improve quality or, at least, made the unit repairable. After about nine months I now own an unrepairable, i.e. worthless, roomba."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE book to read on Set","review":"This is one of the most, if not the most, comprehensive scholarly work on Setekh. It is absolutely excellent. It covers just about every well-known myth the god appears in as well as more than a few more obscure ones. Te Velde also deals with more sensitive subjects well-- he takes the route of mild titillation with these subjects for the first half of the book while covering other areas before giving a more 'in situ' breakdown of Set's moral and sexual character towards the end-- much like slowly untangling a knot. It's almost artistic in presentation. The foreign language areas are easily translated by the serious archaeology/egyptology student and should present no problems for serious hobbyists or reconstructionists either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size matters","review":"You get what you pay for.

The packaging has been downgraded since the season one set came out, now it's just a very basic dvd case without any fold out or art. Not that the first one was all that eighter but it was much nicer than this. No commentary whatsoever which is drag considering quite a few of the principals are still around. No extras at all.

Written materials would help the very beginner; since I already know some Hawaiian, they aren't really necessary but would be nice. I enjoyed writing the vocab out and that helped to reinforce the teaching.I concur with one of the other reviewers: the gentleman who speaks Hawaiian on the CD has a genuine \\"old style\\" accent (my kumu was a native speaker as well) while the woman speaker seems to have been trained in \\"university Hawaiian,\\" which can be a bit jarring to the ear. But, it is good to have a male and female voice speaking the words and people do have different accents by island, age and training. So it's not all bad but if you want to know how native Hawaiian speakers use the language, the male narrator is wonderful. His English is beautiful, too!I definitely recommend this. Novices should also buy plenty of Hawaiian-language music to help develop an \\"ear,\\" too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD for learning Hawai'ian","review":"I use this in the car. I loop through a track until I get it. The online material (they give the URL on the box) was really helpful.I skipped the beginning story because it was way beyond my ability. After finishing all the lessons, then go back and try to understand the story...but get the online written version to follow along with.Upside: Excellent accent. Lots of material.Small downsides: sometimes too long or too short of a time to repeat. Have to skip the first 3 tracks until you have learned all the material.All in all this is the absolute best of all the tapes and books I've used.

Although it is listed as \\"various artists\\" the liner notes says that it is all done by a Mark Arneson, who \\"produced, arranged, mixed\\" and actually \\"played\\" all the \\"instruments\\" (keyboard??) himself. And it sounds it, like a lone wolf attempted a tribute to Mr. Morrison which actually is an insult. I couldn't even listen to the whole CD since samples of each song were truly bad.

This is a must have for your cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Face\\" it, this is a great album...","review":"Godsmack's 2003 follow up to \\"Awake\\" may not be flawless, but its still a really good album. The set features the band's traditional rock sounds, only with a little more edge this time around. Just check out lead single \\"Straight Out Of Line\\" and you'll get the feel of the album. Many of the songs have the band focusing on hatrid and betrayal, such as the title track \\"Faceless\\" and \\"I ... Hate You\\". Other songs, like \\"Changes\\", do the same but with a different vibe. This time, Godsmack means business. The album also includes the hard-rocking anthem from the Scorpion King Sountrack \\"I Stand Alone\\" (this track is incredible live, i saw Godsmack with Breaking Benjamin and (hed) P.E a couple weeks ago, this track blew me away!). In all, this is the band's best effort, the last track, with the indian stuff at the beginning, totally sums up the album.

There's not a thing on here that I remember an hour after listening to it. When Godsmack first came out, I loved their bare bones approach because \\"back to basics\\" hard rock was in the minority at that time. Now it just seems like they're not even trying anymore. To me it sounds like Godsmack are just riding their notoriety to the top of the charts and can't be bothered with writing catchy songs anymore.

Each song is extremely hard and gets you pumped up to the extreme. Great songs are \\"Re-aligned,\\" \\"I F**kin Hate You\\" and a few others off the 12 track disc. The only reason why i gave this album a 4 out of 5 is because by the end of the album i felt that, even though they werent, every song had the same kind of sound and feel to it which made it more of a homogeneous album. Nevertheles, this is still anwesome album and almost every song is great. If you like Godsmack and their other cd's, get Faceless.

When I find someone who is a Godsmack fan and they have no idea who Alice in Chains even is. This CD is terrible. I never thought I could find more things they ripped off AIC than their band name but I did. The music is so trying to be like AIC's music but they suck really bad at trying. Why can't they give up and just be themselves? Seriously, they're not even creative enough to think of their own band name or anything! And how dare anyone compare this to Metallica. Metallica inspires people, this crap is just for people who have never seen the world beyond MTV. I don't know what to say that has not already been said.

In my opinion, bands like Linkin Park belong in that catagory. This is pure hard rock. Godsmack is very reminiscant of the early 90s grunge but they make that sound a bit heavier. Their name is from an Alice in Chains song which shows you where they got much of their influence. I think the nu-metal tag has been over-used ang tagged on to bands that don't fit in with the rest of that sound. New metal is supposed to be rap/rack but I have never heard rap out of Godsmack or many of the other bands that are described as nu-metal. Well I don't know where I'm going with this review anymore but if you want pure hard rock, then I highly recommend this album. Have fun and play it loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good Godsmack record.","review":"unlike \\"Awake\\" what you hear on the singles on this album is what you get: heavy nu metal rock songs. I stand Alone and Straight out of Line have being in the radio for a while, mostly everyone might have heard them by now. Well, that heavy guitar sound combined with that bombing bass and amazing drumming (this new drummer is awesome!) is what you are gonna get musically. Sully's vocals sound a lot better and more melodic, without leaving it's anger and strength, than in the previous two records. It's catchy, sounds heavy, it's great.Highlights: I Stand Alone, Faceless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Being a huge Godsmack fan myself, I probably would be seen as biased. BUT I love this CD. To me, it is different from their other two. It's an older, grown-up sound and I would recommend this to anyone. It's hard to say which of the songs would be my favorite. I would say Serenity and Realign are my two most favorite ones, but I listen to this CD from start to finish. There's not one song on this CD that I skip over or don't like.Buy this CD! :) The only thing better than the CD's are their shows. You should check them out when they are in your town. They rock in concert!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Any true metalhead's soundtrack to 2003","review":"That was a joke, of course. Any sane person knows that title belongs to Iron Maiden's \\"Dance of Death\\". That is, unless I'm living in an alternate reality where \\"true metalhead\\" really means \\"Tripp-pants wearing bleach haired Nu-metal bandwagon jumping douchebag\\".Never liked Godsmack back then, even when I was obsessed with System of a Down and what not, and take a wild guess as to whether or not I give a single flying frak about them today. They, along with several other Nu-metal crap bands helped killnthe metal genre in the 2000s, and sadly, the genre never really recovered. The metal bible has a rule specifically stating \\"Thou shalt not listen to trend-hopping bands with down tuned guitars and vocals equivalent of a camel pooping out a chainsaw\\". Sadly, metal's disciples will be burning in metal hell for that, or so it seems.For catharsis, please consult your local Iron Maiden concert, where such slaughter of intelligence is destroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for nothing!","review":"This CD is not that good. It is basically a rip off from the bands previous CD's. There is nothing new the CD just has nothing special about it.

If you want a second copy of Awake buy Awake again instead of buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE UP!","review":"this is one of the most crappy repetitive cds ive ever heard in all my life...its even worse than their last one or the one before that (at least their debut had a few ok songs on it) + the vocalist is really bad, he sounds like hes constipated or somethin... if you want some really good repetitive crap, buy some britney spears or that hilary duff person!!!...YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF NOT TO BUY THIS CD!!

This is a band who took there name from a song by grunge band \\"Alice in Chains\\". Fine. But it doesn't stop there. They are not inspired by Chains...they are trying to be Chains. The only problem is that there are no interesting guitar riffs, the singing blows, the music is boring and unimaginative and it is stunningly lame. There used to be a time when a guitar player would inspire other beginnners to learn or to play. Seriously, do you feel the guitasrist for Godsmack could inspire anyone to play? It is a sacrilege. Do yourself a favor and go listen to \\"Dirt\\" and then tell me, in all honestly, who has the more intersting melodies and riffs...Jerry Cantrell of ALice in Chains or the wannabe from Godsmack. Abort this band immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band was great when they were Alice In Chains!","review":"I honestly used to like Godsmack but as i got older my music taste matured and I found out how great \\"Grunge\\" is (the best kind of rock music) I ventured upon Alice In Chains cd \\"Dirt\\" I was blown away by how good this cd is. Quickly I realized how bad Godsmack rips AIC off. To the point where it makes me sick. I mean I have nothing against being influenced by a band but to copy their sound exactly is stealing is should be a crime. DO NOT BUY THIS CD AND DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BAND!!!!!! The name Godsmack even comes from a AIC chains song called \\"God Smack\\". It really cant get any worse than this, or can it? It can! I heard Godsmack is now coming out with an aucustic EP. Alice In Chains Had two Aucustic EP's one called \\"Sap\\" and the other one called \\"Jar Of Flies\\". Dont buy this cd buy AIC cd \\"Dirt\\" or \\"Facelift\\" They are way better than any Godsmack record. Don't support a band with no original sound or talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about..........","review":"This album is nothing special.

If you don't beleive me, this cover looks very alike to the AIC album \\"Facelift.\\" The guy from this band said that he did indead take his band's name from a track on \\"Dirt.\\" Sully Erna even tries to look like Layne Staley. The sun logo first appeared on \\"Dirt.\\" And it even so happens that they haven't participated on any Jerry Cantrell disc. This band sucks, Their firt album was tolerable, but then, when Layne Staley died and their secret was exposed. And that's all true because I have a habit of researching bands, and being AIC is my favorite group, I know plenty about them.

And if it wasn't for the bands name or the ripping off melodies of AIC and Metallica, but I don't care about Metallica they sold out long ago, but AIC never did. Sully is just another poser singer caught up in a trend trying to be someone he aint. He should quit singing and go back to white washing his Daddy's fence. Buy any AIC, but not this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faceless and worthless","review":"The king of all constipated-sounding vocalists, Sully, comes back and fronts his band, Godsmack, for another corporate piece of trash. Godsmack keeps performing the same song album after album. Even when they attempt to \\"stray\\" away from their weak heaviness, they STILL play the same song as \\"Serenity\\" sounds EXACTLY like \\"Voodoo.\\" Voodoo Boodoo, whatever. So fans, please tell me what the difference of every song is. Oh nevermind, you're all too tonedeaf to know. My best advice for someone who happens to go through the trauma of listening to this, is to just simply shove your fists in your ears. For the true fans of theirs, read these following words carefully....THEY ARE DONE AFTER THEIR NEXT ALBUM...now kiss me :o"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Good'Smack","review":"I can't understand why some people say that Godsmack had change a lot in this album. I think they're still doing the same, in fact, some songs in this album are very similar to some of the most aclaimed songs of Godsmack ('Re-Align' beginning is REALLY similar to 'Awake', for example).If you like Godsmack you'll not be dissapointed with this album, because it's plenty of good songs. I can't see those changes that some people are tellin' here. The same deep sound, awesome riffs, powerful vocals from Sully and all those things that make Godsmack a different band. And the new drummer is good too.My favourite songs are 'Changes', 'I stand alone', 'Re-Align' (check out the great guitar solo in this song), 'I ..... hate you', 'Releasing the demons' and 'Dead and broken'."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars. Godsmack shows they still have it.","review":"This is my favorite Godsmack album. Their first one was really good, their second one didn't impresse me that much with only haveing a few good ones that stick on your head. This album has great songs like Serenity, one of my favs, an acoustic song. The melody is great. Straight Out Of Line, another great one. I Stand Along got my hooked again when I heard it on the Scorpian King Soundtrack. This cd debuted at #1 and has well diserved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"they continue to rock","review":"The reason I feel so strong about all three of godsmacks albums is the fact that they have'nt changed anything, and with the new album faceless they did it again. This album is all hard, dark, and just plain rocken, I listened to the album and realized a lot of these songs i can actually relate to, and im pretty sure that many other listeners feel the same way. Also this album rocks hard just like the other albums if not harder, hard drum beats, with even harder solos and rifts, and some extreamly dark and deep volcals, you can't go wrong with the purchasing of this album. And the song Serinity, it's just another way godsmack is keeping with the voodoo tradition. Now if you haven't obtained this album yet i urge you to go out and do so now, this album is perfect for any metal fan. And for the rest of you godsmack fans, i'm sure you feel the same way when i say,\\"i can't wait to see what they come up with next.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Faceless makes me speechless!","review":"This is a smashing new hit for the Godsmack dynasty. The new drummer gives a big hit to the band with his talent. He is much better than the old one. This CD inspires me so much in my whole life with everything the lyrics say.

Go and buy it here or at another store, but just buy this CD NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Godsmack CD","review":"This is the best Godsmack CD of the four.Every single song is really good and the number one song that stands out is \\"Straight out of line\\".Godsmack is one of the greatest bands out there.And they put on a good show because I saw them live in 2004 with Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is everyone else thinking!","review":"I dont know what album everyone else is listening to. I have been a huge godsmack fan ever since they came out, and this is by far their worst album. IT [IS WEAK]! There are only two songs that are worth listening to, and the rest seem like they arent even trying. Their new drummer seems to have thrown the chemistry of the band off. I had waited for this album for two years, and was disappointed beyond words. Save your money for their next album, and forget this [one]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This album [is bad]. It sounds exactly like their previous efforts. They did not change their formula or anything. Not one memorable riff or chorus or verse except for the song they did for The Mummy soundtrack and the final acoustic ballad piece which is the only strong song on the album in my opinion. I can't believe people like this boring drivle that Godsmack passes off as good music. Utter disappointemnt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless (0 Stars in my book)","review":"Godsmack represent everything that is wrong with the Rock scene today. What's scary is that this band is completely leeching their identity and musical direction from Alice In Chains and NO ONE is complaining. It is time for those that have a clue to call all the radio stations and tell the dj's to stop playing this uninspired, unimaginative, boring, and stunningly LAME music. Oh yeah...Godsmack wasn't obvioius enough to have album called \\"Faceless\\" so now they are going to fool all you suckers with an acoustic album in the vein of Jar of Flies. In fact, the singer even praises himself for having written songs that are similar to Jerry Cantrell's. PLEASE....let us rise against this vacant band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly Unlistenable","review":"The thing about bands like Godsmack is that they tend to take themselves too seriously. The industrial, pounding, repetitive riffs here and lead vocalist Sully Erna's one-note, barking delivery is so tiring, I can barely get through one sitting without taking a breather. Even the angriest bands in the world should have more than just one mode and the saddest thing about listening to \\"Faceless\\"(appropriate title isn't it?)is that these guys think thier sound is still genuine and cutting edge. So Sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for you rock fans...","review":"If you're a rock fan, and are looking for a great new cd to listen to, buy Godsmack's \\"Faceless\\". I've always been told \\"don't buy the cd, until you've heard about 3 songs from it.\\" Well, I had only heard 1 song from the album, and knew I loved the group, so I bought the cd after only hearing that one song. Let me tell you, the CD is AMAZING! I absolutly LOVE it! If you're not much of a rock fan now, when you hear this CD, I guarantee you'll love rock and roll as much as I do! So go out and buy \\"Faceless\\". And if you like that CD, try looking for anything else by Godsmack. Trust me, it's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Stuff...","review":"Every song on this album sounds just like songs off of their first two albums.

S/T was a start of a new wave of real metal. AWAKE was Fresh And More To The Point. This One Is The Same SH*T As The The Other Two. The Sound Is No Different, The Vocals On This One Have Really Lost Their UMPH! And The Sound Is The Same As \\"Awake\\". Its All The Same, Nothing New.

Aside from that, the main problem is their guiterist, Tony can't play a solo if his life depended on it and until they replace him they will continue to suffer for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"i was hoping to get a new, fresh, insanely catchy sound from godsmack with their latest release, faceless. boy was i let down. i have only listened to this cd one time, and i have no desire to hear it again. one of the songs (needless to say i forgot which one because they all sound equally as boring) almost sounds exactly like the transition part of \\"awake\\" from their previous release. i love every song on their last cd and i was expecting something equally as good as that, but they didn't deliver. don't get me wrong, they still have some pretty catchy parts on this cd, but mostly during their instrumental transitions. it's almost as if every song on this cd followed a formula (verse, chorus, verse, chorus, instrumental break, then chorus). it gets pretty boring at times, and it isn't worth owning. it might be worth burning from a friend. you'd be better off buying the new justin timberlake cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD combining first two discs","review":"This is a great CD! The guys have combined the heaviness of awake with the catchy hooks of the first disc. This has been a bad year for hyped cds ( like the new everclear for one) but this band always delievers the goods. Just buy it and you won't be letdown. The best CD out right now and will get you ready for Black Label society and Anthrax! Long Live Heavy Loud Metal! Highlights are Make me believe, Changes, ... and Re-align."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another good band","review":"Godsmack is not the greatest band, Godsmack isnt one of my favorite bands, and Godsmacks cds arent the greatest either. But the one thing that elevates Godsmack above most bands is the fact that they are an \\"mtv band\\" and have stayed true to their sound on every cd. True their sound has changed a little bit but only because they have matured as musicians. This isnt the greatest cd but it is definitly worth having in any metal/hard rock collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste you money!","review":"Don't waste you money!The speaker is low quality.

The pictures on the web don't do it justice. Read the dimensions though, this radio is about the size of a dorm refridgerator. It only has one speaker, but sounds great, and has plenty of volume. I wouldn't trust the pull out turntable around children, since it's seem a bit delicate. The turntable is no frills, not even an arm lift or return feature, it only stops at the end of the record. On the plus side, it includes a 45 rpm adapter, and records sound great. The AM/FM Radio is also great. the dial lights up, and like an old tube radio, fades out when the unit is turned off. The CD player is also awesome. Would have given it a 5 star rating if the turntable had a cueing lever, and auto return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best to date from Twila","review":"This is among the most soothing and worshipful CDs available.

I think this is Twila's best work yet. This project has some of the most beautiful arrangements I've ever heard. Twila writes some of the most powerful lyrics in Christian music. She also writes some of the most beautiful music. This album combines both. The new arrangements of the older hymns add a fresh new feel to the songs. My favorite on the CD, \\"My Lips Will Praise You,\\" makes me imagine what heaven must be like with the angels singing praise to God. The lyrics are beautiful, but the music as well as the choirs, will bring tears to your eyes. The instrumental, \\"Perennial,\\" is also beautiful. I highly recommend this project to anyone who wants (or needs) some quiet devotional time with the Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best!!","review":"This is really an excellent CD.

One episode on one of the discs gave me problems in that you couldn't understand what was being said. It was like there was a glitch in the program. I did manage to solve the problem by turning off the player and then turning it back on and using the arrows to procede through each of the episodes until I got to the one I wanted to watched. At that time, there was no problem with the picture or the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE Eureka","review":"I didn't start watching Eureka til the last year, and then I started from the first season online at Netflix. I got hooked, but it is the type of show you WANT to see from episode one. It is a fun, complex show that is never boring. You grow to love the characters and just like spending time with them (as is true of any really good show). I bought this because I did not want to wait to see 5 online!! That's devotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Season 4.5","review":"Eureka season 4.5 was excellent with one problem,on disk 2 the episode \\"Clash of the Titans\\" was missing.

What the heck's going on--Grant's leaving Ghost Hunters and Eureka is being cut. Mad scientists may not be unique, but put them all in one town--run for it! What a great series and seasons. Not another show like it. I can watch the DVD over again and still find something subtle I missed. I'd like to know what the SyFy channel is thinking. I refuse to buy any Vampire/vampirilla series; vampires, fake ghosts, and werewolfs are so predictable and outdated-nothing creative about any of those. You can never predict how a day in Eureka is going to go. The only redeeming shows left are Haven (probably cutting that too) and Alphas. Both are highly imaginative, creative and one of a kind, too. No doubt that Eureka will be Pop Culture soon after it ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka does it again!","review":"Life in Eureka is as nutty as ever. Sheriff Carter keeps going through jeeps (I think they must order them in bulk by now), and nothing is ever normal. When he thinks someone robbed a bank, Carter is thrilled - and his notation that Eureka can't do anything the regular way is right on target. On the end of the disc is an episode of Warehouse 13, where Fargo guest stars. Eureka is science at its most hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SHOW","review":"I HAVE JUST FINISHED THE FULL SERIES OF EUREKA AND IT IS A FANTASTIC SHOW.

Not only did we get screwed out of the Christmas episode from last year (so we get it this year), but now they bump \\"Clash of the Titans\\" to put two \\"Of Mites and Men\\" -- one was the regular version, and one was the extended version. What idiot wants to lose one entire episode in order to watch a regular version, when one would have watched the extended version in the first place, without having to bump an episode. I'm glad they cancelled the show; I can't take this aggravation any more. Anyway, the writers strayed from their initial vision years ago (whatever happened to the artifact?)

Smokey Joe's Cafe not by the Robins but Buddy Holly (although I have more than one disc with Holly's on it), Stand by Me done by then Cassius Clay, Searchin' by Alvin Robinson, Spanish Harlem by Clyde McPhatter and more. There are also some songs that werre totally unknown to me. All fun to hear a time or two. The variation in the words of Lonnie Donegan's Sorry, But I'm Gonna Have To Pass from the more familiar Coaster's version now has me wondering which one is lyric written by L & S.For better Leiber and Stoller listening, I'd recommend Ace's L & S present the Spark Records Story.

A poor man's Rob Halford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow's weakest album","review":"After three hard rock albums Blackmore thought it was time to get a bit more poppy in order to reach a larger audience (at this time he was very much into Abba). He changed the line-up, the sound and the songwriting and the result was an album that disappointed many a Rainbow fan. Graham Bonnet's a great singer, but you can't do an album without the help of the other musicians and they sure sound tired & uninspired here. With this line-up Rainbow was still a strong live-act though; just listen to the live compilation album \\"Monsters of Rock\\" if you can find it ! But Blackmore quickly realized that he had made a mistake and reformed the band with new singer Joe Lynn Turner and hot shot drummer Bobby Rondinelli. The album that would follow, \\"Difficult to Cure\\", got the band back on the right track with a good compromise between commercial songwriting and interesting playing. But he epical Dio-era would never return again !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Down to Earth.... or below.","review":"I will have to agree with fellow headbanger Ozzy Nugent (great name) that \\"Down to Earth\\" serves as the weakest link in the mighty Rainbow kingdom. Bonnett definitely sounds like he's trying to muster something that's not there at all and Don Airey (normally an awesome keyboardist) provides featherweight imagery (see \\"Eyes of the World\\"). Gone are the gothic themes, old-world sound through production, thanks to old pal Roger Glover, and that great Dio growl. I must say that this still ranks right in there with worst, tieing '81's \\"Difficult to Cure.\\" Lone waking moment in Blackmore's fret cupboard: the devasting solo at the fade of \\"Danger Zone.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Down to earth...rock solid!","review":"Rumor has it that Ritchie asked Ian Gillan to handle vocal duties on this album,but he declined.With Graham Bonnet-powerful,bluesy vocalist-Rainbow began a new era,as Blackmore's musical taste shifted toward more straightforward territory.No compromises here;it's still a great Rainbow classic,revealing another of Blackmore's many musical facets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly titled. A great band in mediocre transition.","review":"Pre-DTE Rainbow was a veritable supergroup, putting out great album after great album. When Dio left, Blackmore was faced with a challenge, since he had lost an extremely talented and unique vocalist. The DTE Rainbow, fronted by Graham Bonnet (the blonde crewcut should have concerned someone) was a mediocre blues-rock combo that sounded eerily like a Deep Purple cover band. Replacing Bonnet with Joe Lynn Turner was the right move -- not so much to recapture the grit and snarl of the Dio years but to deliberately acknowledge moving towards a more pop sound. Every Rainbow album before DTE and after is better, and the two good-to-great songs -- Since You Been Gone and All Night Long -- are included on Very Best, which you should buy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graham Bonnett's Voice is THAT Bad","review":"I just can't stand hearing Graham Bonnett growl out these songs! I have no complaints with the rest of the band - the rest are (or were, in the case of the deceased Cozy Powell) great musicians. If you're going to take the band in a more commercial direction, it would make sense to hire a decent vocalist, correct? Blackmore got it wrong here...but he made up for it in the following Rainbow albums. If you want to hear a more commercially-oriented Rainbow WITH a good vocalist, pick up any one of the Rainbow albums featuring Joe Lynn Turner on vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow - 'Down To Earth' (Polydor)","review":"Originally released in 1979, as this was Rainbow's fourth 'actual' album. Unfortunately,Ronnie James Dio's replacement for frontman / lead vocalist, Graham Bonnet just does NOT fit the bill. Not even close. 'Down To Earth' was the only Rainbow lp that Bonnet appeared on.Thank goodness for that. For some reason(s), I've personally never cared that much for him. Upside is that former Purple mate, bassist Roger Glover joins Ritchie Blackmore and Rainbow, so some of the tunes here are (how should I say it?)somewhat memorable. Like, \\"All Night Long\\"(the old MTV video is okay), \\"No Time To Lose\\", \\"Since You've Been Gone\\" and \\"Love's No Friend\\". Pretty much for Deep Purple, Blackmore and Rainbow die-hards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very misunderstood classic","review":"Down to earth came along in a really transitional time forrainbow .

Ritche Blackmore once said this lineup , he reallyfelt could have been another Led Zepplin . And he could havebeen very well right .

I have never read a sky map before, so the concept was very difficult for me to grasp.

After reading the reviews on this product I decided to try it and I have been amazed at the results. My nails are growing insanely fast and strong- I've had to trim them at least 2x a week and my hair is noticeably thicker AND LONGER! Most hair products I've used only helped thicken my hair, but this is the 1st time I've used something that GROWS my hair.

I bought the product, used just the shampoo and conditioner once a week for two months and when I took my hair weave out after these two months, my hair is a lot longer and thicker. My short hair is down to my neck. I really don't need a hair weave anymore!!! Now I'm thinking of putting my hair back into the hair weave for another two months and take the vitamins as well.

While long gone is goofyiness that I love in the older Coctail recordings a very unique and elegant sound is the replacement.

Slow-paced and torturous to finish in the end, the climax losses it's shock because by that time you just don't care who survives.

I put one on in the morning and change it about noon.I have put these through the washing machine several times. After the first wash I found that some of the threads were loose and if you ran your fingers over the bib strings would come loose. I just washed them again and the loose threads came all the way off and I haven't seen the same problem since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Drool, Bottle Feeding","review":"We love these soft, terry bibs for our three month old baby. We love that they are reversible. We use them every time we bottle feed to gently catch the drips. The bibs are soft enough that we can wipe her face with them. I would not suggest them for children eating solids; the loosely loopy terry might not mix well with purees. But they are the right size for a small baby, perhaps up to a year who drinks from a bottle or drools a lot. They are soft, nicely unadorned, and the velcro is strong and substantial. The only complaint is that with velcro that strong, you cannot undo the bib with one hand and the sound of the velcro opening up can startle the baby if we go too fast. Some consumers complained that they don't wash well, but we have found them to wash well if we fasten the velcro before washing and/or putting them in a mesh bag with any other velcro items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality","review":"This bib (neck area) shrinks like crazy. The velcro stuck to my other garment and ruined it. Do not buy this product unless you want to put it on to the Barbie doll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Used to after August 2010","review":"My son has been using these since he was a newborn. He's now two years old and, unfortunately, still need to wear a bib to keep his shirts dry. These are the most absorbent bibs I have seen in the market and he can soak these through three of these in day. After a year of use, the first batch I bought were stained and I wanted to buy new ones to replace them. But the new ones I bought after August 2010 are nothing like the old ones. They are less absorbent, the velcro stick to my other clothing and itself during laundry (despite I religiously close the velcro before putting them into the laundry) and they fall off my son's neck. Totally useless piece of junk if you ask me. All I can do now is to go back using the original ones I bought two years ago that are yellow. It's not pretty but at least it does the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I registered for these for my baby shower and received them. I liked the fact that they were made organically because babies like to chew on anything they can get ahold of, bibs included. Once I received them though, I was disappointed at how thin they were. I had hoped that an organic product, obviously lacking a plastic lining for the back, would have been nice and thick. These, not so much. They are very thin. I know there are better organic bibs on the market and I stupidly thought 3 organic bibs for $11 was a good deal. And it was...too good to be true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive but cheap!","review":"These bibs are expensive, but extremely cheap. The velcro does not work after one wash and they fall apart after two washes and then look like a rag. I would not recommend nor buy any more of these products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bumpkins not so great","review":"I bought the Bumpkin bibs with the (blue) silk trim and they were pretty awful. The trim began to fray after one washing, attracting every piece of velcro in my baby's wardrobe (other bibs, including Bumpkins) in the dryer. A pretty disappointing purchase. The cloth itself held up well, but the trim became so frayed I didn't want it near my infant. For a company that touts itself as being \\"finer baby products\\" it may want to look at the quality of its fabrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last","review":"I bought these before my daughter was born and found them extremely useful at first. My three month old is a serious spitter upper and needs bibs to keep from wearing 10 outfits a day. These were the perfect size and really absorbent but they did not survive the washing mashine. They fell apart and now I keep them as back up but only at home because they look so beat up. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This book is in serious need of an update! Perhaps back in 1985 this was the definitive source on resumes for creative professionals. Although even then, I doubt it. It is pretty obvious that this book was published in the era before personal computers. Most of the resumes use courier for their typeface and many have random clipart all over the place. It is now 2007, if you sent one of these resumes to a design firm you would be the laughing stock of the industry. The author stresses the importance of color and yet the book is published in black and white. There are probably about two acceptable resumes in this book. I'm so glad that I checked this book out of the library instead of purchasing it. If I were you, I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been a Terrific Overview","review":"I had purchased this book years ago when it had been first purchased as a booklet. The author has drawn upon the base booklet and expanded it into a full \\"volume\\", yet the prose content has not grown at all. Most of the visual examples are circa the 1970s, which is a total disappointment as so much has evolved in graphic design since the 1970s!If you're looking for idea starters you may find them here. But, if you're looking for something to mimic, that may be of the times, this book is truly disappointing.I really wish that I could offer a better response, but the book is not worth the paper it is printed on.There are many better ideas to be found (and in full color) simply by using goggle to search for \\"designer resumes\\" or \\"new media resumes\\" or similar terms.Perhaps it is because I knew the author's original work (which was avant gard at the time) that I was SO very disappointed in what is shown here.

The motor would only spin up half the time. I adjusted belt tension and pulley alignment properly with no improvement. The fence was off by .008\\" after all possible adjustments. The fence handles never tightened properly, just spun in the cast iron. There were a few other more minor issues. Delta directed me to a local repair shop to fix the motor. This shop wanted me to load the entire machine instead of just swapping the motor so I decided that if I was loading it up I would do it once and return it. I own other Delta products that I am very happy with and plan to buy one of their drill presses this week. But, for this tool I decided to replace this jointer with the Jet unit which is working great. Given all the positive reviews of this jointer, I can understand if this was a one-off bad unit that I got. Hope it works out better for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"I've been using this jointer for about 3 months now and I have nothing bad to say about it. It's handled everything I've thrown at it. It's easy to use and I didn't have to do much calibrating or aligning right out of the box. It comes with a pair of push blocks and I used the X5 promo to get the mobile base, which I highly recommend. I've got a small garage shop so the 8\\" wasn't really an option for me at this point. Maybe if my inner-Norm takes over I'll upgrade one of these days but not any time soon!The only downside to the machine is that I'm still trying to remove all of the packing grease from the bed and knives.

After the assembly, I discovered that the lock release cable on the infeed table raise and lower lever was broken.

This book provides enough explanation from the first book, that it is not necessary to start with the first book, the Last of the Renshai.I particulary like the fact that the characters have many flaws, and how they react to the situations based on their beliefs and interpetations of the prophesies makes this book a worthwhile read.

Not only did I thoroughly enjoy reading and getting into the character's minds, but I learned about 100 new vocabulary words. Sounds silly, I know, but the writing in some of these fantasy books leaves something to be desired. The writing was smoothe, poetic-like, and descriptive, but it didn't drive you crazy like some of James Michner's works, it transports you into the world of the Renshai.

John Lennon has a lot of confidence in his voice on \\"Ain't She Sweet,\\" especially for so young a singer. He completely blows away Tony Sheridan, who is the lead singer on the other vocal tracks (some of which don't include The Beatles at all). Sheridan is trying to sound like a composite of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins, but his voice just can't cut the mustard. This music is interesting because it is history, but with the exceptions of \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" and the instrumental \\"Cry For A Shadow,\\" it's not very good sounding music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stretch","review":"Unless you need to hear Tony Sheriden you are better off not buying this.

If you want a good burning inside album, check out Apparition. The drumming doesn't ruin the good album on that one.

If this was a modern romance I could see marriage and then a divorce some years later. I felt the 'Duke' was shallow and use to getting his way. Matilda lacked maturity in some areas.

An earlier reviewer described this as P&P as written by Charlotte Bronte and that about sums it up. Austen's sly social commentary and witty observations on human nature have been replaced by atmospheric shots of rain-drenched, fog-filled gloom and wavering shadows in candle-lit rooms. Elizabeth comes across as shrewish and broody, with none of the vivacity and quick wit of the original. Darcy seems dull and socially backward instead of a man restrained by his own rigid view of propriety and his place in the social caste. The secondary cast get only one or two pertinent lines from the novel to establish their character and motives, which reduces the circumstances that drive the plot to a one-dimensional Cliff Notes version of P&P."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of the reproduction was poor...","review":"I love this movie; one of my favorites.

They glossed over, skipped and condensed too many events that, in my opinion, were essential to the build up of the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy.

Sir Laurence Olivier, Greer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle have starred in wonderful adaptations of this novel. I highly recommend those versions, though they may seem old and dated to the uneducated rabble. Trust me, they are so worth it.The all-star cast is simply amazing.My only complaint is the casting of Donald Sutherland. His American accent was distracting, as the story is set in England, during the 19th century, and all the other actors had British accents. Fortunately, his screen time is limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great adaptation of the book itself","review":"Well ofcourse the movie made from a book 375 pages long could not there be details for Austen's fan to enjoy.

The actors are so believable, I wish I had a father like Mr. Bennett and Mr. Darsy is so handsome! This movie has it all, great characters, setting, plot (only thing missing is special effects which it doesn't even need).This movie has brought out my inner romantic self which is often overlooked in my busy schedule and reality of life these days.

But at least in my view it is not at all true to her wonderful novel. The best of the dialog is lifted from the book, but the actors deliver it at a flat, hasty manner. The rest of the dialog is anachronistic and stupid, with too many panderings to 21st century conceptions of romance. The pauperization of the Bennett parents was completely unnecessary to point out the particular situation of their daughters. A few comments about the entail would have been sufficient. In addition, the parents (the most amusing characters in the novel) are totally miscast in this film.I made the mistake of buying the DVD.

It's far superior to this one in every way--and even at four hours long, it moves faster than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"P&P- emotionless","review":"This version of Pride and Prejudice was disappointing. It gave you no reason to care about the characters, or want them to fall in love. Everything happened so quickly, you couldn't keep up. I had to turn on the subtitles and rewind several times to figure out what was going on. The characters were skimmed over and unbelievable. The lighting was nice, but that was the high point of the film. My advice: Stick with the BBC mini series version. It makes more sense and is true to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy more like Cathy and Heathcliff","review":"Silly, silly movie ... I have to admit, there was heat between Darcy and Lizzy, but not the right kind. This was a brewding melodrama at time, more in keeping with Wuthering Heights, not a light hearted witty story of the \\"Pride\\" of Mr.Darcy & the \\"Prejudice\\" Miss Elizabeth Bennet. And PLEASE someone tell me the importance of That HUGE PIG and focusing on his \\"under parts\\", as he walked thru the house. What did that have to do with anything??? Needless to say 1 Star is being generous for this film ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Do something else with your 2 hours","review":"We're pretty accepting of second rate remakes. But this one is just too bad. The characters are 2 dimensional at best. Knightly's acting is -- well, it isn't acting.The story line is only slightly muddled. Silly liberties were taken, throughout that modernized a story that doesn't need to be modernized.Several thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the official version of the novel.","review":"Just I finished reading the novel and I realized that the only version of \\"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE\\" TO COLLECT. Not only is faithful to the novel but despite some liberties (very few) taken expresses well the spirit of history, no customs or anachronistic modernisms in accented (as some called Jane Austen fans were proclaim it); is even better than the British miniseries (despite the excellent performances of Jennifer Ehle, who does not match the physical description of the protagonist, but magnificent in her interpretation, and Colin Firth as Darcy, masterful, although Matthew Mc Fayden is at his level also). Very artistic ( for current standards) and naturalistic acting in all players. Excellent Adaptation. Very good direction. Don't pay attention to those people who say that this is a bad or mediocre adaptation haven't romantic or sensitive spirit so better they read the novel to criticize this movie. Great romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great drama.","review":"I received the Blu-Ray version today and was totally unprepared for the audio track. The musical sound is exceptionable. The transfer is top notch. Clear and bright. I have owned other releases of this and this is by far the best one. All the actors are invested in their role. I especially like Kiera Knightly's efforts. Brenda Blethyn as nearly insufferable Mama. Donald Sutherland as long suffering Papa. Jena Malone's turn as the silly fifteen year old sister. When Elizabeth escapes to the, what should I call it, shelter near a lake during a rainstorm and Mr. Darcy follows her and they argue was a great scene. Judi Dench and Kiera's rapid fire repartées are beautiful to behold. At the end when the view of Mr. Darcy's home across the lake was shown, there were swans swimming about. Was this a reference to Swan Lake? A suggestion that Elizabeth was a \\"swan\\" who needed love to become human? Well, who doesn't need that? I doubt that I can improve on other's reviews so I won't try."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and moving","review":"great acting by everyone, a true experience of the time, wish there were more movies like thisi will watch this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Scenery!!","review":"I'm actually not of fan of Keira Knightley but she holds her own in this movie. Great acting and the third main character is the scenery. It was amazing to see. This is another good rendition of the book so, if you like the book you'll like the movie, though honestly i had to do a bit of explaining to those who hadn't read the book. Of course for those that speak an American English at times it can be a little difficult to understand the actors. They speak really fast and mumble throughout the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance!","review":"I love this version of this story. Kiera Knightly nails Elizabeth Bennett. The sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett is palpable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride & Prejudice","review":"Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadden are perfect for this film. I am so impressed with both of their acting in this film. The others in the film are also perfectly cast, most believable and entertaining. I'd like to see Keira and Matthew in another film, perhaps Sense and Sensibility? I would love that or even Jane Eyre. I'm sure they could un-pretty Keira for the part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride and Prejudice as written by Charlotte Bronte","review":"Lovely movie artfully done. But not Jane Austen. This a gothic novel with Austen characters. This is an adaptation of Jane Eyre, or Wuthering Heights, or Rebecca. Overwrought, dark and brooding. Where Austen novels are wry and clever, and always understated. If I had never read Austen I would have enjoyed it. But I have and it is jarring. It certainly is better than the 1940 version with Greer Garson, but barely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film that will never end up in your garage sale pile.","review":"This is such a well-made movie, the type you end up watching over and over again and never getting tired of in the process.It is filmed so well and in such great locations it just makes you want to jump through the screen and take a walk around for a year or a lifetime.The acting is superb and the screenplay is masterfully done.The lines are delivered so well with such perfect timing, which is so important when adapting a literary masterpiece that radiates with mischievously clever dialogue.Lastly, the soundtrack is just fantastic, I could watch this movie with my eyes closed and still love every minute of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"I hated this version.

The performances were fantastic and as someone who has never read a Jane Austen book or seen a Jane Austen film adaptation (unless you count \\"Clueless (Special Whatever! Edition)\\") I was very new to this world. And I liked it! The ending of the movie is what really got me, that and the score. The piano score was perfectly lovely, and I may have to buy it on CD.The extras on this DVD don't add much of anything. Director Joe Wright's commentary is dull as dishwater and the interviews with the cast are repeated on different special featurettes to the point where you benefit the most from watching only one of them. But overall, if you somehow missed this gem, I suggest renting it and catching up because it's well worth your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Okay. I absolutely love the book and have read it more times than I should admit, and I love the miniseries which did a wonderful job at capturing the essence of the book, but this movie is just AWFUL. It leaves out detail after detail and rushes you from one event to the next never giving the viewer a full explanation or even time to form any opinions. The characters in the movie do not seem fully developed; they are like chess pieces being moved by a higher power without knowing its or their intention.Bottom line: this movie is a shell of the book. It should never have been made. And I feel the only people who can find true enjoyment in this adaptation are those who have never read Austen's masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"The only reason I gave this film two stars is that I thought the scenery and cinematography was beautiful. Other than that, I was very disappointed. I tried watching this with an open mind (OK..it may not be exactly true to the book, but try to judge it on its own merit.) Well I'm sorry this movie had no merit. Acting was lame (even though many of the actors in this movie have done great work in the past), and obviously the writers made no effort to at least try to remain true to the original story at least a little bit. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of my favorite novels, but this film did it no justice whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it no stars","review":"I would dearly love to give this movie 0 stars, but that is not an option. This movie was horrible and keira knightly was horrid as Lizzy. Since when is Lizzy silly? Believe the one star review and forget the 5's and 4's they are wrong"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it a negative million if I could!","review":"This movie is a dumbed-down version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. None of the characters are faithfully portrayed. I would be ok with changes and creative edits if it were not for the fact that the characters have been morphed into either blubbering idiots (Mr. Bingley) or melodramatic ninnies who cry in almost every scene and physically run away from all conflict (Elizabeth Bennett). This movie has exchanged wit for stupidity, charm with repulsive cheesiness, and even rid the thing of every piece of sarcastic humor that existed. Mr. Bennett cries in this movie for Christ sake! It really is the antithesis of what Pride and Prejudice was all about. I'm extremely saddened that yet another classic story has been destroyed by Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood-ized version of P&P","review":"I watched this hoping for another great adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and was really disappointed! What was that ending? It seemed like it came out of a REALLY bad Mills and Boone novel which my sister usually reads. All kissy-face and sickly sweet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FRENCH ADAPTATION?","review":"This was a total disappointment. Everything from script, set and costume design, to actual filming angles and editing FLAWED. Who ever heard of the British Army wearing BLUE COATS? And all of the FRENCH set design elements? And where was the wit and intelligence which was and is JANE AUSTIN? If you are looking for the best contemporary version of Pride and Prejudice, look no further than the mini-series starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. All the elements were correct and the acting was leaps and bounds better than this latest attempt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd format no good","review":"This DVD format (HD) will not play on a regular dvd player or bluetooth dvd player. You have to own or buy a HD format DVD player, which if you don't already own one, they no longer make any more. Great movie but the HD format is obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"P&P- lite","review":"Pride and Prejudice is so much more than this hollywood-ized version. If one wants a more faithful and deeper (that captures important nuances in the characterization and plot of the novel) adaptation with regards to the highly acclaimed Jane Austen novel (which after all is the BASIS of this film), go get the BBC 1995 version with Jennifer Ehle (who won the BAFTA best actress for television for her performance) and Colin Firth (who was nominated for BAFTA best actor for his performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!!!!","review":"Yes, it's not the A&E; version....but who cares? I am a long-time Jane Austen fan and own the DVD A&E; series, but I have to admit, the newer version tells the story in its own way, with its own interpretation. Relax and enjoy. I applaude them for their insight and ability to find the actors and actresses that placed a new spin on the story and the characters. If you want the purist version, only watch the A&E;, but remember it has a good five hours to tell its story, where the movie had only two hours, and did the best it possibly could in that time allotment.There were vast differences from the original storyline, but I found it entertaining and refreshing. I will purchase the newer version as soon as it is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride & Prejudice (Blu-ray)","review":"This is my favorite adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, and I have had the standard DVD version for several years. However, now that I have a blu-ray player I thought I would upgrade to the blu-ray format, but was concerned that it wouldn't be worth the extra money. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The blu-ray edition is vastly superior both visually and musically. I've found that quite often there's really no significant difference between the standard and blu-ray versions. But with a film this aethetically dynamic, I was stunned by the improvement in quality.Overall, whether you're a Jane Austen devotee or you simply enjoy this film, go with the blu-ray version. No contest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie","review":"This was a fantastic movie that I have seen over and over again. This version of Pride and Prejudice is on my list of the best movies I have ever seen. Even my 15 year old son liked this movie! Pride and Prejudice is a period romance set in the 1700's in England. You will see incredible houses, beautiful scenery, and the sights and sounds as they may have been witnessed in the 1700's. The acting by Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth Bennett and Matthew MacFayden as Mr. Darcy is awesome. The supporting cast does a fantastic job of carrying the story line too. I already have this version of Pride and Prejudice on DVD as well as the music CD from the movie. I can't wait until this movie is available for download onto my IPOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"romantic","review":"excelent movie... if you are a romantic at heart. will definately watch it again and recomend it to friends and family"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as the first one!","review":"This is not the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. They are a bit too stuck on themselves, too impressed with their own talents. It bespeaks arrogance rather than quality. The characters in the Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth have a sweetness that is complimented by intelligence. Even the bonus features betray that the actors are more impressed with themselves than they are interested in delivering a great performance. I fault the director to a degree. He shifts many lines that were meant for the young ladies' father in the story to Keira Knightly. She comes off as pompous rather than intelligent. A failing strung throughout the entire showing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad casting","review":"I heard the reviews that this version was not even close to BBC series. I believed and didn't even bother to watch. Than I saw MacFadyen in Little Dorrit (Charles Dickens story) and I was left absolutely astonished by his work. Wanting more of his acting I purchased this one. What a disappointment! Everything is great in this movie EXCEPT for the actors or their portrayal of Austin's characters by the makers. Knightley made Lizzie look stupid with her out of place grins and smirks. Macfadyen's Darcy is too soft. Mr. Collins is not funny. Authors mocked his height. Is it all that you can laugh at in this character?!! I don't think so. They also made Bingley look absolutely dumb. Although I loved the cinematography, music, and costumes, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. Irritated most of the time. Sorry. Don't understand some exalted reviews posted here. As for MacFadyen - watch \\"Little Dorrit\\" BBC series, he is absolutely adorable there. Darcy is not for him for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE ADAPTATION","review":"IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG FOR ME TO LIST THE MANY PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THIS MOVIE [setting, missing scenes, character portrayals, etc.], BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT IT IS TRITE AND NOT WORTHY OF BEING CALLED \\"JANE AUSTEN'S P & P\\". I WENT TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT, BUT LEFT BEFORE THE END BECAUSE IT WAS SO \\"untrue\\" TO THE NOVEL. AFTER CATCHING IT ON CABLE A FEW WEEKS AGO, MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS \\"I'M SORRY FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE BOOK IF THIS OSCAR-NOMINATED MOVIE IS ALL THEY HAVE TO GO BY.\\" THE FIRTH/EHLE VERSION IS FAR SUPERIOR TO THIS.

The intertwined stories of the family are very intrueging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am an Austen fan and thought that the Colin Firth film gave a great insight into the lives of the characters without overexaggeration or mistakes (except a small majority) but the 2005 was a complete disaster!Kiera Knightly is a brilliant actress but her portrayal of Lizzy Bennet was just lame.As for the costume design, the Bennets were supposed to be in at least the top 10% of the middle class. Yet this film portrayed them as more working class with their cheap looking gowns and ugly home.However, on another matter i thought Mr Darcy was fabulous in appearance yet when he opened his mouth he spoke far too fast for the Darcy we all know.A very disappointing film yet funny in places.I did buy it and it is good to watch if you have a few hours spare but much better to rent from the video store than actually buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The is production of P&P falls flat","review":"Simply put, this production of Pride and Prejudice is just lame. Mr. Bennet has not the wit, nor Darcy the charm, nor Elizabeth the grace of the characters in the book. There is hardly any romantic chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy in this film; the movie relies on skillful editing instead of skillful acting to capture the audience. The brevity of the film and the resulting omission of parts of the original story leave this film flat. A much more charming, captivating, and true-to-the-original (albeit much longer) production is the BBC/A&E production, and I would recommend that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect!","review":"we received the movie a lot sooner than listed.

Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Everything about this adaptation was wrong, wrong, wrong!! But the worst part of it was the casting of Keira Knightley as Eliza Bennett! What were they thinking!? All Ms. Knightley could do in her role as Eliza was snarl, giggle or make herself so totally obnoxious that I couldn't watch the movie in its entirety. Elizabeth Bennett was a high-spirited, witty and warm LADY and Knightley's interpretation was anything but lady-like! Don't waste your time with this version of P&P - watch the Elizabeth Garvie/David Rintoul adaptation. It's true to the book and would've made Jane Austen proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I heard that Keira Knightly was going to be Eliza Bennet in P&P I was excited. I did not see it in the theater so I rented it, and was very disappointed. I was already a huge fan of the Firth/Ehle version and I think that the Keira Knightly version was too modern. When Eliza walked into Netherfield with her hair down made me cringe. Women in the 19th century, of her standidng, did not wear their hair like that in public. I also didn't like the fact that Miss Bingly wore dresses w/o sleevs. the ending was good, though highly romanticized. This was the only good thing about this movie. All in all it was OK, but if you want a version that followed the book very closely, go for BBC with Firth and Ehle."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO!","review":"Maybe I shouldn't be writing a review - after all, I only made it through perhaps the first 20 minutes of this film. If you have seen the BBC miniseries (as I have), or read the book (likewise), this can be nothing but a disappointment. I really don't know how it couldn't be. The movie rushes through the story and I don't know how anyone could follow it. With the exception of Mr. Darcy (no one could ever be sexier in the role than Colin Firth), the actors here are better looking than in the BBC production, but in the end, who cares? It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride & Prejudice (2005)","review":"Very disappointing version of P&P. I felt that the actors were rushed in trying to portray an epic movie and there wasn't the fit seen with the previous actors. The only version that I have seen so far that was by far the most timely and consistent to the book was the BBC A&E 1995 version with Colin Firth and Elizabeth Ehle. Although one person wrote that the ages of the actors (Firth/Ehle) didn't seem to coincide with the characters due to their maturity, one must remember the time period in which Jane wrote. People were far more mature for their ages then they are today and I felt the two fit the maturity given of the times. Also the other characters just didn't fit right either. Given that movies tend to go long nowadays, they could have spent more time/length in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great adaptation","review":"Joe Wright does an amazing job presenting the victorian age on screen, giving us that Jane Austin satire of the civility in the age. His direction in terms of segway to scenes as well as the scenes themselves are very moving and seem to put you in the world of Austin. It is a thoroughly enjoyable period piece, with truly colorful imagery, and a good tension between Elizabeth & Mr. Darcy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of the three versions, the worst one.","review":"Although the costumes, music and cinematography were all spectacular and certain scenes were well done (the ball scenes), this version is absolutely untrue to the story. Granted, they had limited amount of time for the movie duration, but I say it's better not to re-make it than to completely flub it. Certain things were great about this film, but Elizabeth was completely miscast, although I really like the acctress. And the movie focused on her (albeit beautiful) face the entire time, instead of developing the story more. I actually did laugh when I saw this movie in theater, especially the melodramatic ending. It was like watching a bad romance novel acted out."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH????!!!!!!","review":"People actually like this ridiculous, sorry version of P&P;?? Some people actually call this an accurate adaptation??Huh.But then again, that's why the work of Britney Spears is called music, and the likes of Paris Hilton are seen as icons, right?

Hated the lame Sixteen Candles, sitting-on-the-table scene at the end of the movie and the vast majority of everything that came before it. Hated the casual, everything-out emotionalism that characterizes modern times and makes this movie a disaster in its departure from the tone and tenor of Austen's work.Got it as a gift so gritted my teeth through it, watching it with the very thoughtful gifters. Thank you for making me appreciate, even more than ever, the Colin Firth, Jennifer Ehle BBC version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely picture","review":"I have watched this movie 7 times and would love to watch it again and again. What a lovely picture. Pride and Prejudice has been my favourite novel since I was a teen and to watch the story on screen was a delight. Superb acting by every single actor and actress. Each one was perfect for their roles and very professional, but I would like to point out in particular about Mathew Macfadyen, who gave an outstanding performance and was the perfect Mr.Darcy, tall, handsome, lovely voice, beautiful stride, sexy...etc. He danced so well and the expressions in his eyes conveyed his feelings. Only a very talented and professional actor can do such an excellent job. The story flowed so well and the settings and music was so breathtaking and original. A movie worth watching. Very entertaining, romantic and funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHYNESS AND GOOFYNESS","review":"This is the wierdest movie I've ever seen! Mr. Darcy was really shy acting and Lizzy was really goofy. The dad and mom didn't act AT ALL sophisticated. And their house was really gross looking. Also when Mr. Bingly laughs he lookes and sounds really stupid. And when Lizzy laughs when Mr.Bingly, Miss Bingly, and Mr Darcy walk in it's really stupid - I don't know why she laughs then. There's a close up of just Lizzy's eyes and it looks really sickening. It's really really odd that are in there pajama's and meet in the same field. I've listen to the book an tape and movie is not any thing like the book. If you're going to watch this movie take a take antivert before - otherwise you may be sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're a P & P Fan This Isn't Even Worth Renting...","review":"This was one of the worst interpretations of a classic novel that I've ever seen. If you have seen the Collin Firth - Jennifer Ehle characterizations of Darcy and Elizabeth, you'll probably not even sit through this DVD. The leads of this abbreviated version of Pride and Prejudice are just not believable. Knightley giggles her way through the Elizabeth role and doesn't really seem to understand the character at all.

A lot of things in this movie never would have happened during this time in history. It was really too sensual for my liking. Poor acting- did not represent the true Austen characters.

As an English major, I'm always scared to go see one of my favorite books of all time in movie form, but this time I wasn't disappointed. Firth is an amazing Darcy and Knightly does a beautiful job as Elizabeth. They really bring the characters to life.

Now THAT is brilliance. I would recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uugggh!","review":"Really disappointing in comparison to the A&E production.

Keira knightly's jutted out mouth and her fake accent makes me cringe. And Mr Darcy was completely stiff and I agree with one of the reviewers questioning why he was like a brooding Heathcliff. Ugh, although I agree with everyone that the A&E/BBC version was much better I still don't like the fact that Elizabeth is always portrayed as the prettier sister instead of her sister which is suppose to be the beautiful and sweet one. I might be nit picky but I just find that aspect of the book to make Elizabeth seem more charming and the story more movable that a plain, tom boyish, intelligent girl wins a mysterious, handsome, wealthy man. I so wish James McAvoy agreed to be Mr. Darcy. It would have been much better with him in it and probably win more awards. He was stupendous in Atonement and so was Keira Knightly. Ugh!!!!!

If you enjoy this I'd suggest watching Kate Winslet & Emma Thompson in Sense & Sensibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to watch over and over!","review":"I thought the movie stayed pretty close to the book plot.

Such witty dialogue delivered with spot-on timing. Very satisfying way to spend a couple hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Movie!","review":"I am in the minority here and have not seen the Colin Firth version. (I suppose I will have to soon after reading several good reviews) I am addicted to watching this movieand have seen it so many times that I cannot imagine anyone else but Matthew MacFadyen in the roll for Mr. Darcy and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth. Matthew MacFadyen is very hot!! I could just feel and see the passion he had for Lizzie. The scene when it was raining and Mr. Darcy was expressing his love and Elizabeth was rejecting him. Mr. Darcy looked so hurt - yet you could tell he wanted to kiss her. And also at the end of the film when they were kneeling and he kisses Lizzie several times calling her \\"Mrs. Darcy\\"....his voice is so deep, his kisses were so gentle, so sweet...I wish I could trade places with Lizzie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Georgeous!","review":"As good as period movies get. There is not a weak link in the cast. The movie is full of texture and depth. Beautifully shot. Just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruder Austen","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books, and I've reread it many times. This movie is not pure, pure Austen, but it's a nice widescreen version, with beautiful homes for the wealthy and more realistic settings for Elizabeth Bennet's family. Worth it. Just don't expect the wit and charm of Jane Austen's heroine. It isn't there. K. Knightley is pretty and young, though. McFayden is, for course, for the women to admire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice (20050","review":"While the screenplay had to be adapted to fit the time constraints of a feature movie, the screenplay preserves the Austen dialog in most major scenes. The acting is superb and very believable; it gives more depth to the characters. Jane Austen, herself, critiqued \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" after it was published, by saying it lacked shadows or depth. Director Joe Wright did a fantastic job at creating those moments between Elizabeth and Darcy, so the movie takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride that is very believable. Brenda Blythe and Donald Sutherland do outstanding jobs in their roles as Elizabeth's parents. One last thing: the music is out of this world. It's far superior to any previous adaptations."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than expected","review":"I had recently read the book for the first time, and was astonished how much I loved it. I was skeptical that this movie would be any good but surprisingly I loved it. Though they cut out a few scenes I would really have enjoyed I thought the overall feel of the movie was akin to what I felt with the book, and it was a good way to relive the story without having to re-read the whole thing. Overall I absolutely loved it. The only scenes I wish they had included was more of Miss Bingley teasing Darcy, those were some of my favorites scenes in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Pride and Prejudice Collector's Edition","review":"The Two-Disc Collector's Edition of Pride and Prejudice is wonderful for fans of the movie. Both editions of the movie are included, wide-screen and full-screen, as well as a book highlighting the story and the making of the film. The book also includes photographs from the movie and from behind the scenes. The Collector's Edition is beautfully presented in a keepsake box. It is sure to be treasured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I was really disappointed with Keira Knightley's performance here. Where's the extreme intelligence of Elizabeth Bennet? She giggled too much and failed to portray the other important aspects of her character.As for the ending, it was just too much. Excessive romanticism for a Jane Austen novel. Pride and Prejudice is not a Harlequin romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"While this movie doesn't always stay true to the book or the attitudes of the time, it is still a very well done love story. It skips some of the most interesting things in the book, but overall the story plays out well. If you are use to watching the mini-series version with Colin Firth, you may be disappointed, but I found if you keep watching it it really grows on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"already a perfect P&P","review":"A&E did a wonderful version of this, and all I can say is that anyone who loved this never saw the Collin Firth version. Kiera Knightly is not one of my favorite actresses, so I may be biased, but the other Elizabeth, played by Jennifer had a lot more class. Take the time to see the classic, and don't bother with the inferior remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty, Romance . . . What's Not To Love?","review":"I don't claim to be an expert on the novels of Jane Austen and don't judge this adaptation according to the original story or any previous versions. Focusing on this 2005 film version starring Keira Knightly as Elizabeth, I found it filled with beauty, romance, music and breathtaking scenery. The casting is nearly perfect as each of the characters comes to life in a highly believable manner. Knightly does an extraordinary job at expressing her love of her sisters (even the kooky younger girls) and her father, along with her initial distaste for Darcy.I particularly enjoyed the peformances of Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennett, and the appearance of Dame Judy Dench. It's a championship moment when Elizabeth stands up to her in the middle of the night--as good as her romantic scenes with Darcy.Everything about this film make it a period piece that completely capsulizes a point in time and a classic work of fiction. I will watch it again and again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised at my reaction...","review":"I was thrilled with the opening of this movie and have replayed it and all the Darcy scenes many times so far. The dance scene, while seemingly more Shakespearean and mid-1600s, was enchanting and the Darcy entrance extremely intriguing. Where this stunning actor has been all these years, I have no idea. He could do period literature, I'm sure, but has not, to my knowledge. And to my mind, he's a comparable talent to Daniel Day-Lewis. His great good looks, terrific baritone, gait and superb acting are a real treat.The direction is obviously brilliant, the proposal scene awesome (except for Keira's jaws-like mouth renouncing poor Darcy.) With MacFadyen being more Regency England and less Hollywood, credence is added to this entrancing movie. I fear that this dashing actor is not ambitious or we certainly would have seen more of him in American movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride & Prejudice","review":"I love the twisted and turn between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, I love Romantic movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Romance","review":"If you like romance novels or films, you'll love this movie.

But despite my reservations, I went ahead and watched it anyway. How I regret that decision. If I could it less than one star, I would. The story was rushed, and not just so they could trim it down to standard feature film length. The characters were portrayed all wrong, and I winced at their delivery on many occasions. The casting was okay, but how Keira Knightley received an Oscar nomination, and a BAFTA award, for this lackluster, uninspired portrayal of Lizzy is beyond me. She was dreadful. The writing was equally as bad, as they cut out many of Austen's original lines and scenes in order to put in their own weaker ideas. The scenery and cinematography were the only good points of the entire film. If you've never read the book, you'd probably enjoy this. If you have, don't bother. Skip it and watch the best adaption: the BBC miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Version","review":"I was a little worried about seeing this movie as I was such a huge fan of the A&E series with Colin Firth but I have to say it \\"bewitched me body and soul...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I had expected","review":"I had seen this movie in the theater and loved it.

I really didn't. I love Jane Austen, and I loved the A&E version of her book. And I am not the biggest fan of Ms. Knightly. That being said, I enjoyed watching this movie. I found myself getting misty at parts and laughing at others. It isn't the A&E version, but it is very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot compare with the A&E version","review":"If you read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, you will agree with me on the fact that this movie sucked. I watched it even though it was painful, and when I got to the end I was completely disappointed with their interpretation of the classic. Keira Knightly failed in portraying Elizabeth as well as many other actors. However, this movie was shorter than the 6 hour A&E version, but I felt as though this movie ruined the true story for those who haven't read the book yet. Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the fuss","review":"I am a huge fan of Pride & Prejudice (the book, BBC, and AE version). I was very disappointed with this adaptation. It was choppy and felt a bit too rush. I can't believe that this classic was reduced to a two hour mush. If you have never read the book, I suggest you read it before viewing this movie. You will have a difficult time following the plot otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it at all","review":"Sorry, I hated this version.

But I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and at least watch it.I turned it off with in the first five minutes. I was horrified! I did however sit and watch it all the way through a few weeks later with some friends. (I think they had to tie me down to keep me from leaving) The acting was terrible, the characters were not faithfully presented at all. This is one of my favorite novels and it was butchered! Ms. Knightley did not make a good Elizabeth Bennett, she came off as a silly air head with no wits at all, rather than the smart, witty, prejudiced Lizzy we all love. Mr. Bingley was portrayed as an imbecile who only knew how to laugh and smile. I could go on but I think you see my point. Many key parts were left out of the film. I was very disappointed. I don't see how any Austen fan could enjoy this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride & Prejudice","review":"The sound trak on this movie is trouble.

For one, the special effects were terrible. The CG teacups looked COMPLETELY fake. Also, I couldn't understand a word that was said, as it was all spoken very quickly, in whispers and in heavy accents. The dance numbers were terribly choreographed, and frankly unimpressive. They looked nothing like the dancing in \\"Step Up\\"The only thing I liked was Darcy. The actor who played him was marvelous, conveying all the emotions you could think of in both his voice, and his expression.Another bad thing is the plot. It didn't even make sense.

This version has modern-ish undertones that rob it of the essential Austen reticence and modesty. True, it isn't as glaringly awful as the Hollywoodized MANSFIELD PARK, but why, since the BBC version captured Austen's spirit so exactly, would one bother to do a remake like this? Above all, it escapes me how so many Austen fans could overlook the extensive alterations in dialogue, which occasionally made me cringe. And the scene with the statues--what was the deal with that???It is unpleasant to feel impelled to critique negatively a film so universally praised. However, I stand by my view that the latest P&P; fails to enhance the public's understanding of Austen's writing and thinking.In giving the film 3 stars, I am tipping my hat to its breathtaking scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride & Prejudice DVD","review":"I gave this as a gift for christmas, but it also bring fond memories for my daughter, for ther 19 birthday we went to the play-Pride and Prejudice at our local theatre.

This adaptation would have been totally garbage had it not for Judy Dench. Dench does deserve all five stars for her superb acting -though as her long standing fan I lament her decision to be involved in this production.I think the older BBC version with Judy Parfitt is the best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. The Collin Firth version would have been perfect with Judy Dench.This latest Hollywood version is a bad use of US Dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride & Prejudice without Austen's verbal exchanges","review":"Austen's novel is based on sharp observations on human nature. In particular, Elisabeth's attraction to the opposite sex is not so much her beauty but the beauty of thought and the ability to engage others with witty verbal exchanges. The fast and intense fireworks between Elisabeth and Darcy have been partially destroyed by the film's script, which assume movie viewers cannot understand or follow their long verbal duels. It is sad how the new script have cut or shortened these exchanges. The music and the scenary tries to compensate for its loss but the result is never fully satisfying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a purist, I guess.","review":"I could have dealt with a giggly Elizabeth (though it was hard). I could have handled the romance novel ending, but for me, it was the changing of Jane Austen's words -- in particular the romantic words of Mr. Darcy. What screenplay writer could possibly think they could improve on Ms. Austen's words after a few centuries? It's unfathomable. If you're not a huge fan of the book, or the BBC version, this is a fine rendition. But truly, I think you'll wonder what all the hype is about on the book after just seeing this version.There's a lot of book to be condensed in two hours, so I will give them credit for that -- but if you're going to change the book, do it with style -- like the BBC did with Colin Firth diving into the pond on his visit back to Pemberley. There's a change I can live with."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate movie and HD treatment","review":"This is simply the finest work from Kiera Nightley to date.

I think the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy is well acted by Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen (especially him). I LOVE the way Macfadyen plays Darcy.

She's SO much better than the actress who played Lady Catherine in the BBC version.All in all, this is an enjoyable movie that I've watched about 5 times so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to watch","review":"The characters were lovely, the scenery fantastic, costumes wonderful.

The Bennett family wanted to be upper-class and would have died before they had live stock running through their home! This is 100% Inaccurate/Unfaithful to the novel Jane Austen wrote. 30-40 minutes into the movie, I turned it off... Not to mention the colors they used in this movie - BLEGH! Greys, Browns, Whites and Blacks ~ it makes everything look dirty and even dirtier. Which is also why, I HATE this version. And don't even get me started on the acting ~ it's just as bad. I made the mistake buying it without having seen it first, a mistake I will never repeat. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS VERSION AGAIN - EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Production Dumbs the Main Character Down","review":"The main character in this movie is a person of few words and blunt statements, which is the opposite of what the main character of the novel is. She should love language, revel in banter -- everything the film version does not offer. Without this love of spoken language, the character is unbelievable when she actually speaks the lines of the novel's character in important scenes. Suddenly, her speach becomes elevated and exacting, whereas she normally just grunts responses. In fact, this is about the worst script version of the story have seen. It seems that the makers of the movie didn't believe that a modern audience could appreciate a literate character, so they dumbed her down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful surprise","review":"After having watched the BBC's mini series, I din't expect anything else to even come close to it.But this movie was a pleasant surprise. Although some of the dialogues were cut short due to time contraints , the movie is a very faithful adaptation of Austen's classic.Keira Knightly is convincing as Elizabeth Bennet.

Although Eliza is spirited, I feel that in this movie her character went from spirited to blatantly rude.The Bennett's lived like paupers in this movie, which was not so. They were not rich, but they were not poor either. The girls seemed unkept in this movie.And as many others have pointed out, many of the historical societal behaviors were disregarded.And why was Bingley portrayed to be intellectually incompetent? Nowhere in the book is it suggested and completely ruined the movie for me.I also believe that after seeing the Firth and Ehle version, that followed the novel so meticulously, I may be biased."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favs!!","review":"When nothing is on regular TV programming, I watch this movie!!

My mother and I have loved the book, reading it many times over and found the BBC production amazingly accurate. But this one was so off we couldn't watch it. It was so obviously Americanized and did what so many productions of classics do, they play fast and loose with the plot and miss the subtleties completely. Nothing seemed be right, the mood, the dress, the actors all too modern, too flimsy. I found the scenes dark and much of the sound too low.

It was very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to the Austen Collection !","review":"I just keep watching it over and over. The music, scenery, and dialogue are all captivating. Just a wonderful adaptation of a great novel from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly horrid!","review":"Absolutely NO humor. I can't be Jane Austen without her wit. This film lacked any chemistry at all between the family and that is the foundation upon which an Austen novel is built. Lizzie & Jane barely spoke, the father (played by Sutherland) was dull and lackluster. Keira Knightly's hair was absolutely ugly with those always wet-looking bangs. It was a ghastly take on Pride & Prejudice. The scenery was gratuitous, there were contrived silences that only interrupted the cadence of the plot, and there was just nothing to write home about in this film.Keira Knightly's portrayel of Lizzie Bennet was too strong, that jutting chin and too-fighting glance was all wrong for the character. Lizzie has more grace, tact, class, and love for her family. YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible portrayal of Elizabeth","review":"Keira Knightly's interpretation of Elizabeth Bennet was ridiculous. She made Lizzy out to be sort of a snot. Elizabeth would never have disrespected her mother the way Knightly's version did in this movie. It was not true to the book, to the character, or to the period. Perhaps it was bad directing & not completely the actress's fault but that totally ruined the movie, for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a Pride and Prejudice fix? Watch this!","review":"After enjoying the Lizzie Bennet diaries on youtube (an updated version of this popular story), I just had to find out what would happen next since I don't have the book. I really enjoy seeing the actor who plays Darcy. We get to see him fall in lo, lov, love with her and see why because in all appearances she is nice to him. The actors/actresses in this film are phenomenal. The soundtrack is amazing and this film is a favorite that I even enjoy playing in the background while doing other things. I highly recommend watching it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am a big fan of Jane Austen and all of her work. I have actually taken a college class that dealt with all of her work- all 6 novels, her novella, and her unfinished novel Sanditon. I have always had a soft spot for Pride and Prejudice, and LOVE the A&E version (and Colin Firth). The only thing I didn't like about this new movie is a few historical inaccuracies. These, however, are easily passed over and you can see how wonderful this movie really is. Both Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen did an excellent job. I agree with someone who said in a previous post that they acted more along the lines with the ages of Elizabeth and Darcy. I really liked how they portrayed that sweet, soulful love that I understood Lizzie and Darcy to have. Also, that ending... what more could a P&P fan ask for? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitterly Disappointed!!!!!","review":"I bought this DVD as soon as it came out, having heard raving reviews of the movie. To say I was bitterly disappointed is a supreme understatement!! There was absolutely NOTHING i liked about it.It was altered dramatically from the beautiful funny and heartwarming book Jane A wrote, into a commercial, inaccurate, and brash Hollywood version. I felt like every bit of character Jane A infused ito the book had been bleached out. Perhaps the most disappointing thing was the casting of Keira K as Elizabeth. There was very little of Elizabeth in her performance in fact I really disliked her character (and I love Elizabeth!!). I suppose after watching the A&E; verion the standard is very high and this scraped the bottom of the barrel!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride & Prejudice - an insult to Jane Austen","review":"I've seen the previous version with Colin Firth and have read the book - my personal opinion of this rendition of one of history's finest pieces of literature is that Jane Austen would be turning in her grave if she were forced to sit through this tiresome and pityful movie. The actors for the principal characters ill-chosen and clearly not capable of doing justice to the complexity of their literary personalities: Keira Knightley cannot even begin to fill the shoes of the fiercely defiant and headstrong Elizabeth Bennet, and Matthew Macfadyen's ridiculously poor portrayal of Mr. Darcy pales in comparison to that of Colin Firth. Moreover, the movie completely fails to capture essential high-lights of the story, limps through the development of major relationships between characters, and in general is more tediously boring than any period drama in recent Hollywood history. A COMPLETE HIT-AND-MISS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Boring","review":"I was SO glad I didn't see this dreadful movie in the cinemas. I don't understand is why on earth anyone would try to improve on an already masterful adaptation (even with it's flaws) of this beloved novel. The A & E version is the very best do date.Keira Knightly was about as believable as I would be in this role. Her acting is stiff and her facial features (what is up with her mouth?) are too distracting. Matthew Macfadyen is so wooden and doesn't betray any feeling towards Knightly. There isn't any real tension or chemistry between them.You can skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"While it would be tough for any adaptation of Pride and Prejudice to stand up to the quality of the BBC production starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, this production does not even come close. The quality of the casting and the liberties taken with the story line made it difficult for me to even stay to see the end of the movie. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Period Piece - circa 2005","review":"The best costume dramas are the ones in which you can't easily place the time in which the film was produced. This one, unfortunately, was obviously produced in the early 21st century, what with the young ladies screeching and hooting in the parlor like guests on The View. Stick with the A&E version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies just don't compare to books.","review":"This movie was certainly an adaptation. The characters were not as I envisioned in my head when I read Jane Austen's novel. I think that because so much was cut it was hard to see how characters developed so quickly. Some of the actors were downright obnoxious. I have not seen the A&E version yet but I think I would have preferreed it over this one. Although this review seems harsh, I think it is a decent movie for someone who has not read the book first. I wish I rented this instead of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This adaptation is quite disappointing.

As a \\"male\\" movie viewerI was skeptical of the ability of this movie to draw me into it's story. My wife talked me into itand I am glad that I did. Terrific acting, interesting social predicaments ( Jane Austin truly chronicles the pitfals of an male dominated, upper class society),Wonderful music( I ended up getting the soundtrack) and scenery too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Anyone who likes a great love story will really enjoy this movie.Its worth watching just for the cinematography.Whoever did the cinematography deserved an oscar."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After seeing the BBC version I was very disappointed. Mostly I was disappointed in Keira's performance. It was more or less reciting out of a book than actually becoming Elizabeth and truly acting. She holds no candle to Jennifer Ehle."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best movies ever","review":"Loved the scenary, choice of actors and of course the wonderful story of Darcy..Waited forever it seems for the blu ray of this great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"passionately romantic","review":"I just love this movie. I watched it without a clue of what it was going to be like. I fell madly in love with Mr. Darcy. He is very passionate and intense. I just love his whole character. After, I had to watch the Colin Firth version. Although I'm a Mr. Darcy fan of Bridge Jones's Diary, I have to say I prefer this newer Mr. Darcy over Firth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie. Not wonderful like the A&E version though.","review":"I was slightly disappointed with the new Pride and Prejudice. I thought it was a good movie, but definitely does not compare to the A&E version. I guess it's hard to squeeze all those details into a 2 hour movie. It's definitely a good movie to watch if you have never seen the older versions of Pride and Prejudice. The one thing I really liked was the ending. That was very sweet and romantic. I rewinded that part several times! SIGH!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely wonderful!","review":"I completely adored this movie adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel. I must admit, I was weary when first seeing the previews because I am such a huge fan of both the book and the Colin Firth movie version. But this movie was a complete joy from start to finish. It was both funny and it moved a little quicker than the Colin Firth version (that one's about 4 hours longer!), though I thought it covered all the important plot points. Two thumbs way up from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap compared to BBC version..","review":"I thought this was going to be even better than the BBC version (which I love) it was horrible!!!! I was speechless at the end .. and not in the good way! They left so many parts out and what was most annoying was the literally hated each other and the next minute they were madly in love ( I can only guess due to time constraints?) it was painful to watch. BBC's Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle cannot be topped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one who think Knightley can't act?","review":"Keira Knightley butchered what could have been a refreshing adaption to a beautiful story. Knightley appears oblivious to whom her character is. Again her constant posing and trying to be sexy by hanging her mouth open, is distracting and obnoxious.And, once again, it falls to the other actors to carry her and fill in the gaps in her performance.I dont' know what her agent had to pull to get her this role, but it's a waste of time, talent, and money. Only a miracle worker like Johnny Depp can cover for her like he did in \\"Pirates\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great love stories","review":"This item was a gift.

Best all time love story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice DVD","review":"Loved the DVD of \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" This the only way to see a movie, in the comfort of your own home. Beautiful scenery, great acting and wonderfully written. Why aren't there writers like Jane Austen today?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Romance Movie Ever","review":"This movie is really captivating. It takes you on Elizabeth's journey through life. She is a young girl born into a family of five daughters. Her fanatic mother wants them all married because if their father dies they would have nothing. This is because in this time period females can't inherit. The setting is set in an older time period. This tale will surely touch your heart. I'm not one for crying while watching movies but this one makes me cry every time I watch it. This is truely a great movie that no other romance can stand up to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the charm and joy of the book","review":"First, I am shocked at how positive the reviews have been for this film. Second, I found that the film had two most egregious errors that changed the heart and character of the book:First is the elimination of the Pemberly scene where Elizabeth sees the change in temparment of Darcy from proud to friendly and charming. This with the letter is her true change in heart. The movie makes the love seem more of an obligation for saving Lydia than having solidified prior to the incident.Second is the hack job of dialog making everything explicit. What is wonderful about Austen is a comedy of subtle manners. The minute Charlotte Lucas starts yelling at Lizzie, I realized that the spirit and charm of Austen had been lost. This movie was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Pretty -- but Disappointing","review":"Being an annual reader of Pride and Prejudice and a lover of Jane Austen's humor and insight, I found this film to be at best disappointing. Austen's humor was lost in translation to say the least. Elizabeth Bennet was morphed into a dreamy eyed, slightly naughty, tousled haired temptress. Her father, Mr. Bennet, was, despite the acting talents of Donald Sutherland, transformed into a frousled, woolly, bumbling father who simply didn't know how to be a parent. All that aside, the photography is lovely, the costumes are beautiful, and the soundtrack is delightful, but this simply isn't Jane Austen. For a proper film version of this wonderful book try the A&E version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle or the BBC. The A&E version may six one-hour episodes, but, with minor alterations, it's magnificently produced, witty, beautifully acted, and absolutely true to the book and entirely in keeping with Austen's writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"destroyed the classic","review":"I have read this classic Jane Austen story so many times. I have seen so many versions of this classic. But, when I saw this version, I was appalled. The interpretation was modernized and failed in its attempt to remake an adaptation; it proved to be disastrous. First, the setting for the Bennet home depicted them as extremely vulgar. Second, Darcy appeared weak and stupid. Third, the screenwriters completely changed the storyline thus it was not an adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, but a distasteful, unresearched film about a silly girl in a messed up fantasy world that did not depict the 1800's in our world and then a weak and confused, immature male that falls in love with her. It was disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I didn't like this version. I think Keira Knightly is a great actress but she's a little bit too assertive and aggressive for this role. In my opinion, this is a little too Holywood. Most of the women in this version lack a sense of inner peace from the Victorian time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Pride & Prejudice is one of my favorite books. Now it is one of my favorite movies! With Amazon instant video, now I can share this and watch anytime with anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"My husband and I love the Firth movie and just about every Austen film we've seen. Sadly, we found this remake a vulgar version of a truly gracious story.The earthy, lust-filled movie left no reason for the bland, distant, dull father to even own the dusty books in his hovel library. There was no reason for this Darcy to choose THIS Elizabeth - no reason at all.This movie was emptied - stripped - of all we love about Austen. Austen without the winsomeness of intellect; Austen without wisdom and compassion of good, ennobling character; Austen without highly refined interpersonal drama; Austen without the loveliness and intricacies we've grown to expect. Finally we laughed and laughed: this was Austen without Austen!We would not recommend this to anyone. Save your money. Use your time for better things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive acting from Knightley and a HORRID ending","review":"Keira was unable to show the keen intelligence that separated Elizabeth apart from her contemporaries. She was too giggly and girly. As for the kissy-kissy all over the face (literally) ending, I would have preferred it if we got the UK ending instead. Pride and Prejudice is not a trasy romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is great, quality of this DVD version is HORRIBLE!!!","review":"Ok I hope it does not make anyone mad that I am reviewing this with stars so low because I love this version of Pride and Prejudice, it was the first one I saw and I like it even better than the longer one I eventually saw. So I bought this to watch with my daughters the sound is HORRIBLE I had the volume as high as it would go up on my new flat screen and playing in my new dvd/blue ray player up as high as 67 (I think that was as high as it went) and still I wish I could have turned it up. Picture was grainy worse than watching this on instant streaming on my wireless.. SO disappointed in the quality of this recording and wish I would have bought a used blue ray instead. Save your money and buy a better quality recording.. Unless your watching this on an old tv and your not used to crystal clear HD. I don't know how the sound would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride & Prejudice","review":"I ordered the wide screen version and it only plays on one DVD player, not the one we take when we travel, which is what I had wanted. It was a disappointment. So, be very careful which view you order. I didn't really know there was a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of \\"BD-Live\\" previews","review":"I sat down to watch this movie tonight and was blindsided by an obnoxious marketing gimmick called BD-Live. The DVD automatically downloaded a preview of \\"Get Him To The Greek\\" from the internet and started playing it. There was no option to access the DVD menu or skip the preview. What does a raunchy comedy about rock music have to do with \\"Pride & Prejudice\\"? Why is this DVD downloading software to my computer without my permission?I purchased this movie on SD DVD years ago and I looked forward to enjoying the better picture and sound quality of Blu-ray. Since I can't find any way to disable BD-Live in my Windows Media Center preferences I am returning the Blu-ray copy of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" as defective merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreadful!","review":"There is no point in trying to list all of the flaws in this adaptation of Austen's classic; I would be here all day! What possessed the makers of this film to cast Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet, or Donald Sutherland as her father? Knightly's Lizzy is a giggling and immature airhead, with no depth of character whatsoever. The language and behaviour of the time is ignored, the dialogue is very clumsy, and the costumes and general appearance of the characters are shabby. Macfadyen's Darcy looked as bored as I was. Did the scriptwriters read the book before setting about writing the script? Was any historical research done? I doubt both. There isn't a scene in the entire film that I can say a good thing about. So badly done. So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing short of pathetic","review":"I am an avid fan of period dramas, so when I first saw the previews for this movie I couldn't wait for it to come out.If they had a satisfaction guarantee at the movie theater, I would've asked for my money back. This movie is appalling in its complete lack of substance - not to mention its failure to stay in keeping with the actual book.The actors are poorly cast and Keira Knightley in particular struggles under the weight of portraying what is arguably one of history's finest and most complex literary heroines. The worst offense, however, is the absolutely unsuitable, unknown actor cast in the role of Mr. Darcy - a character whose disdain and disapproval of almost everything in life are completely lost on the actor.Perhaps if the cast & director had read the book before embarking on this disaster, we would've all been spared such an abysmal and offendingly bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty!","review":"This is a completely ridiculous retelling of the classic story. Stick with the BBC version; you'll be much happier. Knightly's Elizabeth Bennett is totally unbelievable, and the Darcy is even less so. The shortened version of the story is totally unacceptable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie gave me a migraine.....","review":"Painful!

Don't waste your time on this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"If you are a person that likes romantic movies, you will love this one!. I have watched Pride & Prejudice almost a dozen of times and I intend to go for more. Will like to see more movies like this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First times","review":"I ended the year 2005 reading \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" for the first time, and I completely loved the novel. While I was reading it, I was waiting to see when the movie would come to a nearby theater. Much to my disappointment, it did not come, though it was promised to appear.So instead, as I finished the novel, I preordered the movie from Amazon.com, since I anticipated truly enjoying this film.I loved it. Having just read the book, it felt like walking into the novel itself and seeing the characters come to life.I highly recommend this movie for all Jane Austen fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemous","review":"Don't waste your time with this nonsense. The story is altered to the extent that none of the characters' actions make sense, none of the original ideals are portrayed, and no understanding of the novel's intent is achieved. The A&E production was of such high quality that I easily recommend it to those who don't wish to read the book; there's simply no improving on that one, and this piece of trash should be forgotten by the movie-going public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant .....Good Price","review":"Wonderful product for great price!

This 2005 remake is totally wonderful and Kiera Knightly gives an amazing performance. Will read the book next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't blink","review":"It was just too youngly Hollywood. I understand that to make this into a big screen picture, they had to take a much longer work and condense it into a 2 hour and change length movie. Wow, did the story line fly. And it was a shame that the characters weren't developed more, particularly Mr. Bennet. They had Mr. Bennet mumbling through most of the movie. Mr. Darcy seemed sulky, not snobby. I also think Keira Knightly really tried too hard on her accent (and she's English!).What happened to the Hursts? What was up with the Bennet's house - did anyone else notice that it looked really run down and messy? Did the set hairdresser quit? And the clothes - the styles seemed inconsistient.I admit, I have seen the A&E; version (and hold it as the standard). If you want to see an adaptation of P&P; that is made my people who truly loved the book, rent the A&E; version. The characters are so much better developed, and they really picked excellent actors who really fit the role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Overrated","review":"I probably would have enjoyed this presentation of Pride and Prejudice if I hadn't first seen the \\"Special Edition\\" starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I couldn't help but compare the two films as I was watching this one, and the Knightley/Macfadyen film was inferior in every respect. I was so disgusted, after all the hype surrounding this film, that I almost turned it off at several points, but I decided to see it through just once. If you must see this film, rent it (I wish I had). Buy the Special Edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I and a group of friends went to see this movie at the theater. At least two of us fell asleep during the showing. I was bored and couldn't wait for it to be over. I was shocked to hear that Keira Knightley received an Academy Award nomination, her acting skills, in this movie, consisted of grinning. The script was shallow and sets cheap. I'm sorry this does not even come close to the Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle version. I can sit through all six hours of that version with no complaints and certainly no napping."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"Not only is this the worst version of this story that I have ever seen, but it is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. And I just saw \\"Uptown Girls.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this because I love the story and I like Keira. But both were terrible in this adaptation. I can't even sit through the picture. I'm probably going to give this dvd away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly. Awful. Like viewing a corpse of Pride & Prejudice.","review":"I made the mistake of paying two bucks to rent this. I don't know how anyone could give it more than 1 star, or how Knightly got an Oscar nomination. This was miserably miscast, misdirected, and poorly acted.The script follows the novel only loosely, omitting so much of the story that I doubt someone unfamiliar with P & P would even know what is going on. Instead of showing the Bennets as gentlepeople, this version has them living in a farmyard with a pig wandering into the house. The historical detail is a mess, too. This film has Darcy proposing to Elizabeth at dawn in a field with both of them in their pajamas.A real travesty of one of the finest novels in the English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did ANYONE read the book?????","review":"I cannot believe this picture! I have read the book 3 times and it no more reflects what Jane Austen wrote than fly! There are only a VERY few places in this film that even used lines from the book. Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth follows the book just as close as it possibly can. My only fault with that picture is that it stopped with the wedding. Jane Austen had quite a few things to say after the wedding regarding all the characters in the book which wrapped it up nicely. Read it!P.S. I can't believe Dame Judy Dench lent herself to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood making money","review":"My sister warned not to watch this version as it would only upset me and she was right. As it is, it's taken four attempts to get all the way through. I can understand the difficulties in turning a detailed book into a movie but surely you can remain true to the characters? Emma Thompson did it with style, an obvious love for the story and great actors. Jane has a following guaranteed to bring a crowd, and Hollywood took advantage. If you love BBC's version you'll hate this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knightley as Cinderella","review":"Austen races through time in her novel but this movie version skips many good details sadly. This is just, \\"Rich man falls in love with poor woman.\\" Obviously the star is Knightley but in the original BBC movie (still the best) and the book it is both Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The lines were so fast here it was like having a finger on the fast forward. The Bennet's were not so poor that they had pigs in their living room; they were upper middle class so this version is just an \\"updated\\" fast forward through Cinderella-type story lines. Key lines were said so quickly there was little enjoyment. Better to read the book or - still better - go get the 1995 version with Ehle and Firth. Far, far, far better and much more realistic and true to Jane Austen. I'd hate to see this cast do other books that require time - Gone with the Wind or War and Peace. Ghastly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie - ever!","review":"This is my \\"go-to\\" movie when there's nothing on television. I love all the character representations in this version. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I believe this is the best version of the beloved novel. The actors were spectacular, from Keira Knightley, Donald Sutherland, and the lesser known English actors; all wonderful.The settings were beautiful, the emotions expressed will leave you wishing you could have such a romance. And the ending is so powerfully sensual, without any need for the graphic, all skin-baring scenes in most modern films. Simply terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Character building, no Emotion and no Romance!","review":"How can anyone even compare this to the BBC version? The characters were not developed, Darcy's heartfelt first proposal to Elizabeth sounded like he was rattling off his shopping list for the day, totally void of the inner conflict you feel in him in the BBC version. Please, don't be duped and sucked in to this two-hour mockery of this beautiful story. Order the BBC version and actually travel back in time and yes, it will take some time, but it is soooooo worth it. This is a must have for your DVD library. Colin Firth is the only Darcy I could ever imagine in this role. It's like someone else trying to play Rhet Butler, it just can't be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purely Awful","review":"This movie was raved by so many critics that I am at a loss as to what they see in it. The movie works only if the viewer knows nothing about Jane Austen, has never seen the BBC classicc (I highly, highly, recommend this), and likes Keira Knightley. She's not an awful actress, but she is so entirely wrong for Elizabeth Bennet that I cringed through the entire movie. Her Oscar nod in unexplainable"},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty","review":"This is, by far, the worst adaptation of a Jane Austen novel that I have ever seen. The reason Jane Austen works are so beloved is that she gives her characters such depth and subtlety, all of which is lost in this incredibly shallow, hollywood-ized piece of garbage. The characters were poorly cast and even more poorly developed by the actors playing them. I have never hated a screen adaptation of any novel more than I despise this. I have to believe that the people giving this 4 and 5 stars have either not read the novel, or just don't \\"get it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible rendition of this classic story","review":"This was a horrible rendition of the book. It didn't follow the story accurately and the characters were poorly portrayed - they lacked that depth and personality that clearly defines them. The movie was rather dry and boring, with little emotion displayed. I do not recommend this film... especially not as an accurate depiction of this timeless story. If you a true Jane Austin fan, or just enjoy the book, the best representation of this classic story is the BBC one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victorian","review":"While Kira Knightly exceaded my expectations, the film was, to its core, unfaithful to the victorian society that Jane Auston wrote about and critiqued. Jane Austen, i would argue, did not write romance novels so much as commentaries on the world around her. This film was not at all faithful to that society. A young woman would NEVER go about in the dark in her night gown and coat. She would NEVER kiss a man before they were married. Yes she was an upstart and a spit fire... but these basic diversions from societal norms were not Elizabeths... they were a product of modern romantic folly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth owning.....","review":"This version of the Pride & Prejudice is not worth owning....rent and watch the movie, you'll know what I meant. I would strongly recommend the other version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle being the actors/actresses of Mr. Darcy and Ms. Bennet in the movie. I daresay, this version is very well presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern, stylish, classic revival - not BBC version worthy but lovely nevertheless!","review":"This modern-day version has an aesthetically pleasing cast and set although it does not stay true to the book. So if you are a fan of Ms. Austen, watch the BBC version; otherwise, you will be disappointed. However, if you are in the mood for a chick flick period piece or love fluff (think Marie Antoinette costumes, decor, etc), you'll enjoy it. Plus, anyone who has every been to the UK or loves its scenery will just be delighted in this modern version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Confusing","review":"This movie was the most disappointing version of Pride and Prejudice yet...There was so much of the story left out that if you had never read the books you'd be lost(as were the two people watching with me) The actors were not convincing in their roles. Overall I was very disappointed in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one word...awful...","review":"Yes, the scenery is beautiful, but the characters are so dull...I admit, I am a big fan of the 1995 BBC version, and I really, really tried to watch this with an open mind, but I was bored to tears after a half hour.

Save your money and rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is my Mr Darcy....","review":"I'll start by saying, I am no Kiera Knightly fan so I was reluctant to watch it, but under some insistant urging I gave it a try. Was I surprised. I was able to overlook Knightly as the lead character because she was actually good! Matthew Macfayden's Mr Darcy was a very romantic hero. His blue eyes are incredibly expressive. The scene where Elizabeth and Darcy are in the rain arguing and suddenly discover their attraction, is great!....I don't know if I would of had the strength to hold back, Mr Darcy is too delicious. Anyway, this is an impressive watch! Let's hear how many dry eyes there are when Mr Darcy finally decides to claim Elizabeth toward the end of the movie...oh my goodness, well done! So grab a glass of wine, your favorite blanket, maybe a box of tissue, and enjoy the show. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knightley is Outstanding","review":"this is one of the best films of 2005 if not the best. keira knightley is outstanding as elizabeth bennet in this latest recreationg of the jane austen classis pride and prejudice. this is a beautiful intrepretation of the novel that truly captures the comedy and romance of the story. this film is wonderful in every way!! i highly reccomend seeing this film. it's fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride & Prejudice dvd","review":"Arrived quickly and great condition.

Darcy resembles a farmer more then a gentlemen. Really awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Performance - a Poor Film","review":"Keira Knightley's fine performance cannot save this poor representation of the great book by Jane Austin. The visual presentation of the Bennet home was shocking. Rather than a gentleman of moderate means we see a household where the family walks through the chickens' habitat to enter the back door, the hog is led by the open kitchen door - it's a mess. Mrs. Bennet is represented as a sometimes drunken slob instead of the proper wife, light in intelligence, seeking to fulfill her primary duty - getting 5 daughters, with little dowry, married. There is no attempt to portray the close relationship of sisters, Elizabeth and Jane. In fact, the relationship is cast as that between sisters Eleanor and Mary Ann in \\"Sense and Sensibility\\". It was a terrible disappointment in nearly every respect. Buy the version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle - it's a treasure whose length gives hours of pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total let-down after BBC version (and the book)","review":"Why?? Why even attempt to remake a film that was so fantastic? This is like remaking Gone With the Wind. I had high hopes for the movie, with its big budget and great looking cast, but they were not met. The movie departs from the book, and the editing and script do not give enough time or substance to fully develop the characters. The one thing I thought they did well was to depict the country dances as being significantly more back-woods than the ones in town. By the way, I think it's a JOKE that Kira Knightly got an Oscar nod for this performance. P-lease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Forward Version","review":"This is a fast forward version of Pride and Prejudice. Too many close ups, not enough time for character devolopment. Film didn't show the beauty or romance needed to make me care about this story or these people. Keira Knightly doesn't have the grace posessed by Elizabeth Bennett. I'm glad I rented this, I would never watch it again. It doesn't compare to the Colin Firth version, which I could watch over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all impressed!!!","review":"I love Pride and Prejudice. It is one of my favourite books and I must have read it at leat 10 times (so far!!!). The BBC adaptation was just perfect. This film was just neither here nor there. I hated the drab set I don't know where they got the idea of the wandering pigs and geese, the Bennets lived on an estate not a farm. and they were gentle folks not farmers.. their future problems would have stemmed from the estate being entailed after Mr Bennets death not from poverty during his life. Keira Knghtely was just plain silly and McFadden just a sulk not a proud man. I hate adaptations that think they know better than original creator... if you don't like Ms Austen's handiwork.. just go ahead and make your own.. just don't call it Pride & Prejudice!!.. Give me the BBC version any time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrendous","review":"This movie slaughtered a beautiful book. Keira Knightly resembled nothing close to an Elizabeth Bennet and the story was so rushed and sugar coated that only someone who has never read the book, or even heard the plot, could have enjoyed it. It was an absolute heartbreak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the 1995 BBC version instead!","review":"I was greatly spoiled by the previous 1995 BBC mini series of this movie.. and although I expected this latest version to be good based on all the hype it received.. I must say, I was sorely disappointed in it. It in NO manner can compare with the BBC's version. Although normally I am a fan of Keira Knightly, in my opinion, she truly lacked in her portrayal of Austin's Elizabeth Bennet. Similarly, Matthew Macfadyen is just NO Colin Firth, who plays Darcy as no other. For anyone that has not yet seen this movie, perhaps this version would suffice.. but my advise is to buy the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version from 1995. I think it far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overacting ruins the movie","review":"Horrible. Over acted. Bad adaptation.Knightley's overacting ruins the movie. She is too forceful and too thin, two characteristics which would never have occurred during that time period. In addition, the removal of pride and prejudice from the characters action, completely alters the original intentions of the novel.I did however enjoy the acting by the woman who played Jane and the woman who played Mrs. Bennett; I wish I could transport them into the A&E; version, which by the way is far superior to this movie.I would not waste your money on this film and instead purchase the A&E; version. You will thank me afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared to fall in love","review":"After reading Pride and Prejudice and seeing the Colin Firth version, I was hesitant to watch the movie, but decided to try since I like Keira Knightly's acting.The movie stays fairly true to the book, and is so beautiful. The costumes and settings are breath taking, and add a whole new wonder to the already amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done.","review":"Our whole family loved this version, almost as much as the Colin Firth version!!We found humor, snappishness, and sincerity in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best version of Pride and Prejudice and the acting was spectacular.","review":"This movie version is very entertaining and the performance by all the actors was academy award winning, The casting director did the job, and the director was incredible. Kiera Knightly and Mathew Macfadyen were superb!! If I didn't know better I would have thought Mathew was truly in love with Kiera, I have never seen such a performance. It is one of my favorite movies. I never get tried of viewing this movie. It is a delight......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this production is great...","review":"The actors cast as the Bennet family, of course! Keira Knightley is wonderfully watchable and Jena Malone has been around forever; Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan(!) and Talulah Riley have gone on to do some great things! Stately Donald Sutherland always delivers and Brenda Blethyn's flibbertigibbet flightiness is perfect as the feckless matriarch."},{"rating":"2","title":"P&P","review":"My mother tried to get me to watch it for years.....I assumed it would be dull like sense and sensibility or whatever that movie is called so I vehemently said NO.

A lovely movie and worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I was actually looking forward to see this movie. The result was bottomless disappointment. My honest opinion is there is just no way to shorten a book so considerably and then expect it to be anything else than lacking! There is only one true Darcy: Colin Firth. I won't even get into Ms Bennett ... My advice, if you love Jane Austen: Buy the set with Colin Firth, do yourself a favour here!! I know it is very long but I'm not kidding, it is so worth it!!! Don't waste time and money on this poor remake! I would have given no stars at all but that was not possible ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Without giving away the movie, it is well done remake on the classic text. No, it doesn't perfectly follow the book, but the cinematic art is well-done. The actors and actresses are very convincing, and I can watch this over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"I ran to theatres when Pride and Prejudice first came out, later on bought the movie and have watched it about hundred times. Although the story doesn't exactly follow the book (otherwise the movie would be MUCH longer), the major themes and elements are put into the movie in a stunning way. As for the scenery, the countryside and Pemberley were amazing (I want to go there!), and the actors were very believable, especially Lizzy and Mr. Darcy. I'm a tiny bit disappointed that they didn't put something between Lizzy's running out the door and them together and Pemberley (like a clip of marriage?), but otherwise the film was amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves soppy romance stories... like me. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films I've ever seen","review":"The other 1-star reviews say it all. I'm just here to lower the overall film rating! I loved the book; this film was atrocious and boring (all the meaningless, added dialogue!). I'd probably say that even if I weren't an enormous Austen fan and hadn't felt like this was a travesty to Austen's legacy: no subtlety or humor, and completely dumbed down. Read the book, watch the BBC miniseries (in that order)--don't waste your time on this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most romantic movie I've ever seen.","review":"I didn't see the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice in the theater, and rented it only when I couldn't find anything more interesting in the video store. I watched it once and was charmed despite my difficulty in understanding some of the dialogue. I watched it again and became captivated. This is a gorgeous version, and I am now a huge fan of Matthew MacFadyen's. He portrayed Mr. Darcy with subtlety and humor. Finally I 'get' the fascination with Austen's Mr. Darcy.Warning: the performances in this movie are so stellar that you'll find yourself watching it over and over again, catching something new each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diversion","review":"Imagine a world where the only concern is getting your children married.

It took me 3 times to watch the entire movie. Watch the BBC version instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I dont know about others, but I love Keira Knightly! This movie has been done with others playing that role, but Knightly takes it to another level, completely. She is truly Elizabeth Bennett. If you like movies about the rich and richer, you will love this movie. The music score is enlightening and many of the scenes are set in a richer person's house. All the characters blend quite well to make this movie a must see event. The Bennett family is interesting, funny, and sometimes annoying but true to the time and circumstance of their position in life. Watch and engulf yourself in all it has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride & Prejudice","review":"I fould that the parts from the book were to speedy so that they could put things in it that arnt in the book at all.

This widescreen is actually the fullscreen version with the top and bottom cut off. Compare the fullscreen and widescreen versions (I have both) and you will see this. What a shame that there is no way to re-experience the beauty of this film as it was shown in the theatres."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnifique","review":"Voila une bonne adaptation du roman de Jane Austen qui est l'équivalent de la série TV de la BBC/AE ; les acteurs jouent justes, les images magnifiques, et qui plus est nous avons le droit à une bonne son en franaisIndispensable !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money - buy the A&E Version!","review":"This version of Pride and Prejudice is pretty bad. It is more like a poorly produced junior high play than a movie. Not even Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland can rescue this one. The main actors are so flat. They seem to want to rush through the movie to get it overwith and do not have any stage presence at all. Only the camera angle and choreography of the scenes keeps your attention. The acting of the main characters just isn't up to snuff - at all. Buy the A&E Version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle from Amazon. It is an exquisite version that is exceptionally well done. The \\"Americanized\\" air of this modern version leaves you wanting to watch the A&E version, even if it is much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother with this version if you've seen BBC's...","review":"okay, I tried, REALLY tried to like this version... but, I couldn't... not that it wasn't good, it is just that I've been spoiled by the BBC version.... the one with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth... but also, the acting wasn't nearly as good... the leading lady did a very good job, but, the others were quite bad...Darcy - very wooden, not likeable at allThe Mother - annoying, not amusing...The Father - usually, I like Donald Southerland, but, in this picture, he looked like he had to go to the bathroom the entire time.Jane - seemed confusedthe ONLY plus in this version was Wickhim... he was actually handsome in this version..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop watching it!","review":"Almost watched it just once but frankly it was only after the second viewing that all of the humor, rich scenes, and depth of the characters really impacted me. Now I'm still enjoying it and still getting something new from each viewing. Haven't seen that kind of quality in a film for a LONG TIME. Had to own it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasent Surprise","review":"I took a date to see Pride and Prejudice, and I expected to sleep through the whole thing. The girl I took was a huge Jane Austen fan, but I never was. My parents love the A&E version, but I never could get through it. I went in with the same expectation and was completely wrong. Keira Knightly's performance is her best to date. If she doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination, something is wrong. The film is bright, cheerful, and funny. The supporting cast is wonderful, but Rosamund Pike and Donald Sutherland stand out. Guys, don't worry. I usually hate chick flicks too, but this is one that guys could handle taking dates to. So don't have too much pride or predjudice, judge it for youself. And I will buy this one on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but there's an alternative","review":"As an admirer of Jane Austen novels, I ordered this video because it was the only version of Pride and Prejudice that I could find with a Spanish soundtrack--and it did serve that purpose. The rendition of Jane Austen's novel, however, was very disappointing. I have viewed many video versions of Pride and Prejudice and have found one to excel far above the rest in accurately depicting the book. That is the BBC production starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul, which adheres very closely to Austen's original text. In the BBC version, the settings are authentic and realistic for the era, and the casting is excellent. For anyone who has read and enjoyed the novel Pride and Prejudice, I highly recommend the BBC video. Elizabeth Garvie becomes Elizabeth Bennett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"This is a great movie and I had been looking for it in fullscreen, so I was happy to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved the novel, this will be a big disappointment","review":"This version is an insult to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I absolutely loved the novel and this movie did not come close to capturing the romance, charm and character of it. It was as if the director hadn't even read or understood the novel. There was no depth to Darcy's character. The most vital points about his honorable character and integrity were left out. Elizabeth's discovery of this was poignant to her falling in love with him. The scenes of their meetings were rushed (probably due to time constraints) one after another when in the book, months go by before they see each other again. The portrayal of the Bennet family is exaggerated. While Austen captures the heart of a woman with the slow and deliberate even agonizing wooing between Darcy and Elizabeth, this movie misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst version I've ever seen","review":"I love this story, but I have never seen it so badly portrayed. Over half the dialogue was left out, and with it much of the plot. If I hadn't known the story so well, I wouldn't have known what was going on half the time. There was almost no character development, and all the wonderful wit and dry humor was either left out or played completely deadpan, as if either the director or the actors didn't understand what was being said.Don't waste your time with this one -- get the BBC or PBS versions instead. Both were far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"This is NOTHING at all like the book! It is terrible!!!On the other hand if you have never read the book you will probably find this decent but slightly boring.Basicaly it's not even a good movie by any standards. It was a total waste of money and I wish that I had never bought it every time I see it on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was dissapointed","review":"Great cinematography! Kiera Knightly did a poor job as Elizabeth, she swaggered about in her tomboyish fashion like she was still on board the Black Pearl. Donald Sutherland was wonderful but the movie over all fell flat. The script touched some points in the book but few of the important points. Matthew Mc Fayden was far from the proud arrogant Darcy and came across as a petulant child. His lines were rushed and devoid of emotion. This could have been a great sucess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"Sorry, this version didn't cut it for me. I guess I have been spoiled by too many BBC versions of Jane Austen's work. Neither actor was as convincing as Darcy and Elizabeth as Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even one star!","review":"These two lead actors really spoiled the story for me. Instead of clever reparte, they mope, pout and stay sullen. Their mood is constantly serious, even truly depressing. Jane Austen wrote clever dialogue, and if you watch the previous versions with Colin Firth, and the best version with Greer Garson, you will see what's missing from this version. The PRIDE is missing, the provocative bantering and the little digs. Do yourself a favor and skip this version, and watch Greer instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I love Jane Austen. I hate when her books are done on film and they are not true to the orginal story. This film version left a lot to be desired. Kierra Knightly as Elizabeth Bennett? I don't think so. The BBC has a great version of this story on DVD (Collin Firth as Darcy) and it is many times over better than this. I may be a purist but if you are going to tell a story, try to stick to the book it is based on and don't cut corners to try to appeal to the those who don't even know who Jane Austen is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not the definitive version!","review":"I like this version of Pride & Prejudice and love Kiera Knightly, but it honestly can't hold a candle to the 1995 BBC production starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle now also out on Blu Ray. That newly restored HD release is simply breath taking (and I'm not that big of chick flick fan!). To each his or her own obviously, but I recomend the five hour BBC version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like The Old Goodies","review":"At first when I saw this movie I really liked it, and it got me interested in seeing the old one with Colin Firth in it, after watching the old one I can honestly say I cant veiw this one the same as before, mostley because Kiera Knightley and the other actresses really seem awkward in their roles.

To me that tittle better conveys the theme, that our first impressions of others are often grossly mistaken. Lizzy's first impressions of two of the men in her life were wrong. One for the better and one for the worse. My first impression of Lizzy was also wrong. At the beginning of the movie, I was disappointed to find Lizzy as a shallow, giggly girl looking to marry a rich man, but as the movie goes on (slowly at times) I was pleased to learn Lizzy was the complete opposite of my initial impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latest P & P","review":"Wonderful version of Jane Austin's pride and predjudice.

The characters are slightly different than what you may have imagined while reading and while Jane Austen's book is quoted all throughout, the story line was changed a bit. However, this movie does a pretty good job of condensing 122,618 words into 129 minutes of pleasing, albeit fast paced, visual entertainment. The Blu-ray quality is lovely, I haven't had a need to use the DVD yet and the digital copy I will probably access via iTunes since I never managed to get my digital copy (which is a piece of paper with a code on it) of Tangled to work via Windows Media Center - and once you use those codes they are apparently lost to you forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need to get out some more..see review after this one","review":"My response to this dvd and the PR guy review:While watching this I thought, this is...DistastefulEgregiousCompassionlessProfaneAwkwardInsipidIllegal (in some states)Extemporary(just watch...you'll see)Frenchy director Breillat's \\"Hell\\" is simply another experimental flop.

Watched partially with several classes and they cant' wait to finish it. Being in Southwest Louisiana and raised here I am always looking got something fun and entertaining from or about our state to teach my kids or students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really expected this to be better. The acting was TERRIBLE and one of the first scenes of the movie is the mayor of New Orleans involved in what seems like a very shady deal. The lessons to children are also very questionable. Three kids (about 12 yrs old) alone in the swamps of new orleans in the dark! The plot of this story is fabulous I only wish that it had been done better! So as an adult I really disliked this movie, however my 5 year old son thought it was cute. Even if we did have to interject from time to time to remind him what was inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film Teaches Questionable Lessons","review":"Overall, a disappointing movie with bad acting, poor continuity, and sub-par special effects. The Labou animatronic is reminiscent of a 1980's Teddy Ruxpin. More disturbing are the lessons that your child might learn from this film, such as: It's OK to mutilate a library book, particularly if it is the only copy in existence. And it's OK to wander around for 2 days in a swamp near New Orleans (the city with the highest rate of overall crime in the country) without any adult supervision."},{"rating":"2","title":"art of exlaining the hardest facts heartily","review":"the book was very good but to follow the tips are very har"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Miami '05, but what is this?!?!?!?!?!","review":"If you're looking for his AWESOME Miami '05 sound (favorite CD of late), or what he's playing in his live sets - YOU WON'T FIND IT HERE! This is Markus meets so-so vocal trance with poor lyrics. I guess he's trying out different things, but leave the vocal to ATB and stick with the gritty/dark trance we all love....and even his best song on the CD, Without You Near, even though it has 2 mixes, isn't the same, or nearly as good, as what he plays live/mixed! I heard this track on a Gabriel & Dresden set awhile back, and again on a recent Markus mix, and it totally rocks the way they spin it - but the CD versions are poor in comparison. The You Won't See Me Cry re-mix is nice, but I liked the original more.All in all, you should really pass on this one, or at least listen to it first before buying. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"without you near.......worth it.","review":"the production on this cd is good. The \\"without you near-reprise\\" is an amazing track worth the price alone, proof of his abilities as a producer, but I must honestly say that his live sets would sum up what a really good dj he is,I noticed the increase in the pitch on both of the cd 2's of the miami 05' and ibiza mixes,they somewhat capture in my opinion the live hard flowing melodic vocal clean mixing sound we normally get from him. Markus got mad skills all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Give Phil 4 Stars is Still Saying Something","review":"Although I give Master and Musician and Beyond Nature 5 stars, I will have to give this one 4. Keaggy being my favorite guitarist, 4 is still a cut above most. Rivulets, Legacy, and Spend My Life With You are worth the price alone, but his rendition of Swing Low Sweet Chariot is a little cheesy. The sounds are a little sharper and less warm than Beyond Nature. But still an excellent listen and well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit back, relax, and let the master play...","review":"Acoustic Sketches is one of my favorite guitar instrumentals with sweet melodies.

Everyone who wants to deepen their level of soul awareness & energy power quickly & safely should definitely pick up a copy of this.......listen for youself, because there are no real words to describe the benefits.

For the time, it was a beautiful, amazing, AWESOME game- and it gives you passwords so you don't always have to start from the beginning! I played it as a kid and own it as adult. It's one of my favs, but if you're seriously looking to beat this game, you have to have patience, time, and guts to get through this monster. Despite how great it looks and sounds, you shouldn't play it unless you're prepared for the hell it'll put you through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Independent Stories that Fit Together","review":"The art of short story writing is by no means dead. Looking at the stacks of new books and best sellers in a book store today would give you the impression that everything belongs to the full length novel. Alice Munro has created almost a new form of writing. She specializes in short stories that kind of fit together to tell a more complete story of her life.The stories in this book definitely fall into that category. They are individual stories, complete and independent, but taken together seem to represent what has happened to a person going through life and growing up.In the second part of this book, called 'Home' Ms. Munro has said that they had not been published before because they were too personal. This book, along with her other ten collections of short stories and one novel represent a body of work that isn't exactly autobiographical but which seem to represent her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautifully written but slow paced","review":"I was very disapointed, I would of expected a real page turner like Runaway was, this isn't it. I wouldn't describe it as 'amazing short stories' like she has for her literary format description on the back of the book more like 'amazingly condenced long stories'.

To get all the seasons and both movies for that price was too good to pass up! Even after reading the reviews about how hard it is to get the discs out of their \\"sleeves\\". Since the set opens and reads like a book, you pull the discs out from \\"inside\\" the pages, so to speak, (they aren't exposed and pop out, like most cases would have them) and they are pretty snug. I think I'm going to just manually make each sleeve wider as I watch them... It's annoying, but I don't think it will actually ruin the discs as some of the other reviewers state. Great price, I'm very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect collection, but bad package.","review":"I bought this collection when it was at a discount. I was really satisfied with the price. The collection is perfect with all episodes, a bonus disc and two movies! I tested every disc and they worked well.

I read all the reviews saying that the case was poorly designed. The DVD's are difficult to get out the first time, but not impossible (you just have to pull somewhat hard). Once it's out, the DVD is not difficult to get it - it does have a snug fit, but I think that's nice. The DVD's are safe from being scratched inside the beautifully designed case. Don't worry about the reviews that say that it's poorly designed. The snug fit for the DVD's keep it safe. Hope you make the right choice and get the complete collection (which comes with 4 bonus discs and the two movies!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Concert Momento","review":"This is the only Eric Bogle I own (sorry Eric!) so I know little of his studio work. I attended a concert in on a whim, and was simply blown away by the profound and intimate, yet generous and funny nature of the man, his music and the concert itself. Through many moods, it remained with me ever since. When I came across this album I took a punt with it and was wonderfully rewarded. The introductions are very much part of each song and I feel like I'm getting the whole concert over and over again for free. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardly exhaustive, but a good place to start.","review":"As a twelve-year-old first time Dwarf Rabbit owner, I read this book countless times and reveled in the vivid color photography. Almost every color of rabbit imaginable is pictured within these pages, and almost every breed is described in a paragraph of its own. Of course, at only 64 pages, this is hardly the exhaustive guide to owning a dwarf rabbit; it's not the book you want if you're going to get serious about showing and breeding (though there is a chapter on breeding toward the end of the book). The contents also include chapters on \\"Considerations before Buying,\\" \\"Selection,\\" \\"Acclimation,\\" \\"Feeding, \\"Care,\\" \\"Behavior,\\" and \\"Health,\\" among other topics. Overall, this is the perfect book to guide an amateur bunny keeper of any age who wants the basics (and some nice pictures)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"The CD overall is very well developed , if your are wondering if this CD is for well... it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same band","review":"I dont know about new fans, but some of the older fans of Reliant K are missing them. Where'd they go? This is a good question to ask before you buy this. The sound of the band is... similar, however in some of the songs i wonder if they've lost their edge. The cleverness in the lyrics are all but gone, and are only in maybe 1 of the tracks. (crayons can melt on us for all i care) I don't know, this band is just going in a direction where they are going to lose ALOT of their fanbase.

While the harmonies were great on previous albums, nothing compares to what it is like now that all 5 members are contributing vocals.This is a rockin' hard relient k album in that all you have to do is put the cd in and hit play and enjoy EVERY song from start to finish. It's truly remarkable how Matt Thiessen has fine tuned his song writing and musical ability, when is he going to be songwriter of the year!All in all, most perfect work of Relient K yet. I had high standards because I thought nothing could be better than Mmhmm, but they just get better with each release and beat it. Here's to hoping Relient K stays around for years to come. *cheers*"},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought 2 of them!","review":"Ok, so I made a mistake in a shipping order and accidentally ordered 2 but I am in no way complaining! You have two discs in a package, one is the standard audio cd and the other is a dvd that has live acoustic performances of some of their songs including a cover of the Beachboys' \\"Sloop John B\\" And they perform it better than the Beachboys might I add.An absolute MUST for any Relient K fan. Not only do you get their best album to date but are also treated with dvd features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Musically, this is Relient K's most impressive CD so far. They show a lot of talent in including the all acapella \\"Plead the Fifth\\" and the 11 minute epic \\"Deathbed\\" is nothing short of a masterpiece. Although the rest of the songs did not produce a mainstream radio-hit like \\"Be My Escape\\" provided from Mmhmm, the songs are absolutely better than any of the junk you will find listening to on the radio. The lryics are catchy and positive, and the new more piano-driven songs sound great. I know some tweens are dissapointed that the cd doesnt have any more silly songs that are all over their earlier CDs, and although their earlier cd's were amazing as well, this CD provides way more musical maturity and complexity.A must buy for any fan of the band or alternative/pop rock music.Sounds like: Jimmy Eat World, Something Corporate"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Relient K's Best!","review":"I had heard good things about this CD before I bought it. The vocals definitely are very good and unique for the band. There are still some songs on MmmHmm that I like better, but there are good ones on here too.

The satin fabric on the edges is poor quality and we had loose threads hanging all over right after the first wash in the laundry machine (gentle cycle, mind you). Also, the opening for the neck is very small - my daughter is 6mo. old (average size) and it's already too small for her. Would never buy anything from this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fantastic","review":"Like many have mentioned, this is made in China. And it started to peel just after the first wash - very disappointing. It's also tight around the neck, which is not very comfortable for my baby.

Given a choice, I wouldn't want to buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"During the first wash, the velcro tabs came open, and the satin edges on the 2 green bibs began to fray from contact with the velcro. The terry cloth-like body of all of the bibs also developed pulls. We have now used these bibs for 3 months and they are a frayed mess, and the velcro no longer stays closed.

The pink set has held up just fine, and still looks good after the same amount of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cause breathing problems for infant","review":"The quality of fabric is very very poor.

Some parts of the book was funny, but others seem like Perry/Madea was trying to had to tell a joke. For example, the part about growing up with Brittany Spears grandmother was suppose to be funny but it was not. The punchline about the WWNBA was worst than the Brittany Spears trailer park joke.Tyler tried to hard to make this book fun, but it simply was not. He really dropped the soap on this one. The only reason why it will sell is because its Madea.As Madea says in the book, if you brought it and don't like, too bad, you still brought.

It is boring and has no plot whatsoever. Since this book was given to me as a gift, I am forcing myself to read it.While Madea has some very interesting antedotes, I find that this book goes around in circles. I thought I'd be rolling in my seat laughing. It's not funny at all.I think Tyler Perry definitely has a niche with film making and movies, but, in my humble opinion, this book doesn't live up to his ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overrated","review":"This book is very overrated. Perry's films are entertaining, but when it comes to writing novels, he falls very short. Tyler jumped from boring subjects to corny jokes with terrible punch lines. He attempts to tell the story as Madea is telling it herself, but throughout the book he sometimes forget Madea's suppose to be telling the story and ends up speaking as himself. Simply speaking, this book is/was over hyped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I'm a huge Tyler Perry fan, however this book was slow going and I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.

Written as an autobiography of the life of Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus, who became Emperor of Rome in 41 A.D., I, Claudius is actually historical fiction. As such, there seems to be no way to measure the accuracy of the accounts given in this first part of Graves's two-part series.Nevertheless, I, Claudius is interesting - it reads like a novel - and reveals the sordid details of the lives and times of the Royal family from Augustus until the time when Claudius ascended to the throne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This novel written in 1935 is set as the autobiography of Claudius, before he becomes Roman emperor and as he sees the various members of his family die off, mainly through mischief.It is not particularly well written. How for example can Claudius report word for word conversations that were held hundreds of kilometers away?Also, the characters' psychology is poorly developed and inconsistent. Why for instance would Livia suddenly decide to confide her wrongdoings to Claudius whom she has always despised?Though not graphic by today's standards, violence is so pervasive throughout the work that it becomes tedious.To potential readers interested in an analogous approach to Roman Antiquity, Marguerite Yourcenar's \`Memoirs of Hadrian' constitutes a far superior option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Soap Opera: History as it REALLY was","review":"I, CLAUDIUS is a triumph in literature. It is the memoir of Claudius, the fourth emperor of Rome, who has to pretend that he's an idiot to keep from being murdered. Augustus' wife Livia is one of the most cold-blooded murderesses ever conceived. She banishes, forces to suicide, or poisons anyone who stands in the way of her plans for her son Toberius to succeed Augustus. Which is a lot of people. Livia thinks nothing of murdering her own husband in the end. Then cruel Tiberius becomes emperor and rejects Livia. She knows that mad Caligula, a murderer as well as you'll see, will be the next in line for the throne. It's pitiful as Livia lies on her death bed begging to become a goddess. A plethora of other wonderful subplots abound. This is a book filled with treachery, violence, murder, and a battle for power. Fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserving of its acclaim","review":"This book was recently rated as one of the top 100 books of the twentieth century. After reading the book I can see why. It give a great history of the first three emperors of Rome. Reading this book will give you an appreciation of who did what and why. It breathes life into one of the most interesting eras of human history. To understand Rome and the early empire we understand our origins and ourselves that much better. This book accomplishes that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painless Education","review":"If you are interested in learning a thing or two about ancient Rome and want a fast paced story at the same time this is your book. Graves' chronicle of Claudius and his dysfunctional family is full of mystery, humor, intrigue and tradegy. Emotionally, you begin to love, hate and feel pity for these real people. While the military history can become a tad dull, the book as a whole is the best work of historical fiction I have ever read. A top five favorite book of mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love that Clau, Clau, Claudius","review":"This novel truly surprised me. I had never heard of it before seeing it mentioned on the Modern Library's Top 100 Novels of the 20th Centry and probably never would have pick it up either. Historical fiction has never siezed my interest. However, this is a fascinating book that is beautifully written and packs some very subtle satire and characters worth rooting for. It gets off to a slow start, and the numer of and relationships between characters is vast and confusing, but by the time you put the book down, you too will respect Graves' mastery of rhetoric and characterization. You know how biased (and probably dishonest) Claudius is, but ya just can't help but cheer for him at the end. Now I just need to pick up the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Classic","review":"\\"I, Claudius\\" tells the fabulous tale of the rise of Claudius of the most powerful (and cruel?) man in the world.

Truly a timeless classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, Claudius","review":"This book is so self-conscious and self-aware, one has to wonder whether the author is not more taken with himself than interested in writing a novel for others to enjoy. Way too cutesy for me.I did not like this book at all.I would have much preferred the author just write a nice, deep, rich biography or even a third-person historical novel, perhaps with footnotes or indexed research notes. The first-person mechanism is highly overused, to the point of abuse. There appears to have been a great deal of research that went into this book, but because of the tone and style, the reader cannot determine or make an assessment as to whether the material is fact or fiction, or merely self-serving attempts to appear clever. The heavy-handed overused literary device severely detracts from the good qualities of the book, which are: good story, interesting historical period, insight into times and lifestyles of long ago, and occasional easy flow of language.This is one book I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Rome really this bad????","review":"I had to read this book for an independent study in Grade 12 English and I can honestly say that I was completely reviled by the utter lack of content in this quasi-classic book.

Robert Graves captures the behind-the-scenes look at the Imperial Family wonderfully. After reading this book, Claudius immediately became my favorite Roman. While Mr. Graves must have taken a little bit of license with this work, I think he portrays Claudius well. The best summation of this book is something someone said to a friend of mine while he was reading this book in the London underground: \\"Livia's a bleep, isn't she?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Roman history at it's very best! Fascinating!!!!","review":"What a majestic find after 1900 years. It was predicted to Claudius that something of value that he wrote would be hidden and then found 1900 years later.

The \\"autobiographical\\" style succeeded in engaging my interest right from the beginning. Caligula's raving reminded me, in a way, of certain parts of Jung Chang's \\"Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China\\". Also, I had heard of the German national hero, Arminius (Hermann), before, and \\"I, Claudius\\" provides a very interesting account of Arminius's victory over three Roman legions in the Teutoburger Forest, and of his subsequent fate. Overall, the book presents a captivating view of the history of early imperial Rome, with its murderous wars and spectacles, Stalinesque purges and constant hopes of redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best historical fiction novels","review":"Robert Graves brilliantly walks the reader through the dangerous intrigues of the Roman Empire, and makes it seem so real and fresh that it's hard to believe that it all really happened 2000 years ago. This book sets the standard for all historical fiction -- and it's a tough act to follow"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Godfather...? Mario who...?","review":"For readers intrigued by man's eternal conquest for power, skip the Godfather. Read Robert Graves' I Claudius. The experience is more literary and twice as entertaining! This novel achieves rare success in delivering a story that is as exciting as it is profound.The narrative chronicles the life of Claudius from early childhood through his appointment as Rome's fourth Emperor. The humanity and appeal of the humble Claudius contrasts sharply with the action of the story, consisting chiefly of conspiracy, deception, and murder. This novel explodes any naive assumptions that leaders operate by higher moral principles, exposing all the corruption which undoubtedly persists in modern politics. The story's dark portrayal of human nature is delivered, ironically, in a uniquely amusing style reflecting Claudius' rare perspective on the chaos surrounding him. Here author Robert Graves presents an inspiring read on the endurance of good in evil times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Tragic, yet had me laughing out loud in parts.

Feminism is merely the belief that both sexes are equal, it's a poor name for such a belief but that is what it is called.Sure there are androgynous individuals who claim they speak under the banner of feminism - but they are anathema to feminism as well, because feminism is about the equality of both sexes, not the supremacy of women.This is yet another dirty bomb in the culture war - the war on modernity being waged by regressives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Incorrect Guide to the Dark Ages","review":"Carrie Lukas's latest effort is a bizarrely tangled web of half-truths and opinion.

If women keep blaming others for their mistakes, how can we over come our self-imposed limitations?I trust that feminist will be attacking this book only for the reason that it empowers women to be strong and independent because if women are strong and independent, we won't need political feminist groups like N.O.W.

As others have said, it is disappointing that Amazon does not sell the Italian version with ALL of the music from the movie but it is thoughtful of other reviewers to provide the information about ways to purchase the complete version. Still, this is a lovely, lovely CD. I want to mention the vocal piece at the very end, Roger Waters of Pink Floyd wrote lyrics and sings it, and it is a beautiful, tender, heart-grabbing song and the CD case/liner notes show the lyrics under the CD 'holder' - a nice surprise.Good purchase. Will also look for the Italian version now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great musical score for a great movie","review":"Being Tornatore one of my favourite movie directors, I've noticed that he almost always rellies on Ennio Morricone for the musical score of his films. Well, now that the film tells the story of a music man, the score was a difficult subject to deal with in the film, but morricone made a great work with the music, and this album turns to be a very good extension for the movie tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend of 1900: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack","review":"Once more, Ennio Marricone has reached in and tugged at my heartstrings. A taste of Jelly Roll Morton and Scott Joplin adds spice to this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bellissimo!","review":"I went cineplex to see \\"Legend of 1900\\" to find another beautiful film like \\"Cinema Paradiso (which, I have seen several times and wept every time. The director Tornatore, composer Morricone are the same)\\". I bought this cd only for \\"Lost Boys Calling\\"(vocal by Roger Water of Pink Floyd. You dislike rock? I promise you, this piece is good. I listened hundreds times. Even now, this song reminds me the scene '1900 turning back up the steel tomb (yes, the ship)'.) I really respect Morricone's works, but every pieces of music is regretably short (that can't create whole one impression I expect from the film). (Oh, Itlaian songstress named Flippa Giordano sings this songs,too. Don't expect her. She couldn't convey the meaning of the lyric.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough jazz music of the time","review":"I enjoyed the movie thouroughly. When I saw the cd I had to get it. I was dissappointed at the lack of jazz music on the cd. There is the famous scene (duelling pianos with Jelly Roll Morton) One song from that scene is on the disc. It is the best song. The rest is like mood music or background. Not enough of the emotional piano jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but it is uncomplete","review":"After seeing The Legend of 1900, I had to buy this CD. The music was simply excellent! After listening to it, I noticed that there was something missing...a lot of the movie's best songs! Now, I'm not sure what happened, but I missed those songs. That's not to say that buying this CD isn't worth it, it is, but I feel there should be something like a Legend of 1900 Volume II or something. Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie, you won't be missing anything, so buy this CD. If you have seen this movie, you will miss the songs as I did, but you will not regret having the opportunity to listen to the songs that they did put on the CD over and over again. Oh, for all those of you who haven't seen the movie, buy the CD and then see it. It is DEFINITELY worth it.Merrie, a Tim Roth super-fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"North American Sony CD chopped by more than 20 minutes!","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this Sony production which I purchased in Montreal, Quebec a month ago (September 1999). Morricone's impressive score to Giuseppe Tornatore's most recent film was released more than a year ago in Italy, also on the Sony label. Can anyone explain why the North American edition should have been butchered by the loss of more than 20 minutes of music? There are often good reasons to edit foreign language films to make them more 'attractive' to a North American audience, but surely this should not be applied to the film's soundtrack?"},{"rating":"2","title":"RECOMMENDED!!!","review":"This is an excellent piece of art!!! Great for all sensitive people who like the type of music. However, it's adviseable to watch the film at first; the soundtrack is very specific and you should buy it only when you liked it in the film as well as when you found interesting the motion itself!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"Maggie's latest does not contain an ounce of christian fluff or jargon; rather the songs are a mirror of the walk of a true disciple of Christ. Her passion for her Master takes your breath away and made this listener stop and realise that a re-ordering of priorities was needed.

She originally got it on her first birthday, so essentially the world stopped when it came up missing. I immediately went on line to find a replacement to help to blunt the pain. Fortunately we found the original one tucked in the bottom of a suitcase a day later, but decided to keep the new one anyway. The only problem is the one pictured is not actually the one that arrived. The one we got is called babygirl, is also pink with a terry cloth texture and has no diaper. No problem however since my daughter now loves both and her original one now has a new playmate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already Bored","review":"Yes, the language is beautiful. Yes, the characters are brilliant. Yes, the book damn near bored me to tears. This thing needed an editor with an eye for economy. The length isn't necessarily the issue--it's the fact that Johnson overlaps so much of the plot from different perspectives, and I just didn't want to read the same thing over and over again. I'm a big fan of Johnson; loved Fiskadoro, Jesus' Son, Resuscitation of a Hanged Man, but I resented him for dragging me into this quagmire, and making me wallow in it for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"too anyone who got to the end, i bow to you","review":"I tried 3 times to finish this book, but i just can't do it. I'm a big Johnson fan but this book is just too long to sustain his ethereal style.

Try Johnson's poetry and short stories, that's the stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"The positive reviews of this title have spurred me to finish the thing but overall I agree with the negative reviews.

For your own safety, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Already Dead\\" Made Me Wish I Was","review":"It is unfortunate that this novel was ever written. The characters are uninspiring, and the plot is at best plodding. The story is told through the eyes and actions of those either mad, intoxicated or stoned. Accordingly, the text is disjointed to the point of distraction. \\"Already Dead\\" is eminently forgettable. I felt I had been robbed of the time it took to read this drivel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful Noir","review":"Denis Johnson gives us, in Already Dead, a fascinating look into the dark side of the human condition. Criminals. Land owners. Drifters. Cops. Three dogs. ... Denis Johnson attacks interesting questions with stylistic prose and subtle humor. The book is sometimes frightening. Sometimes scarey and always entertaining. The book is generally dark and explores our emotional and psychological darkness fearlessly.If you might like a thriller that emphasizes literary brush-strokes and has a strong story then you may find this work to your liking. Those looking for quickly moving populist fiction may find it tedious, however... Johnson does tend to linger on the personal point of characterization."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lotta book","review":"I read, and re-read this book in the last year. After the first read, I was puzzled. How can one read a book so late into the night, when I should have been sleeping, so many times and not feel satisfied at the end. I found the answer in the second reading. The quality of Johnson's prose is astounding. Descriptions, metaphors, similes fighting eachother for supremecy page to page. I'm not a critic, so excuse me if I only sing this novel's praises.'Already Dead' more than lives up to its title. Each character is doomed in one way or another. The privilege we have as readers is to absorb the mood, the nuance of the characters, the multi-demensional context and the quality of the writing.This is a big book. It drags at times and while there will be moments when you will search in vain for a plot. But the story and the writing provides the will to finish this novel.Neat and tidy? No.Juicy plot?

Nothing wrong with having *some* characters be so narrow-minded (such folks exist in real life), but universality of those qualities suggests to me that Johnson himself holds those qualities...this sure doesn't encourage me to read anything else he's written. In fact, I now avoid his books like the plague and gave away this book at a garage sale. (It's a shame I have to give this book even one star to get this review posted.) I am so glad that there *are* men who *are* able to regard women as dynamic, three-dimensional, capable of thought, and *human.* I'll read their books!

If you are looking for something that isn't your instant pop record that will fizzle out as fast as you have put it into your record player, this will certainly fill your appetite.

I can however, compare it to other music that is floating around out there. If you're looking for something that isn't like the usual Fall Out Boy or Beyonce Knowels which seems to dominate the radio these days, this is your group. It's very unique and each song is truly all its own. It also has very good use of instrumentation, deviating away from the common guitar, bass, and drumset (with the occasional keyboard). Where with many bands you will find a similar sound and almost the same melody in some cases, this is not so with this album. Along with there being more than one main vocalist, not all the songs follow the usual verse, chord, verse. There is a different structure, different sound, different everything. The lyrics are profound most of the time, some of them are a little bizarre, but what fun would they be otherwise?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The extra disc is a nice bonus","review":"I would say they sound like a combination of Arcade Fire and Wolf Parade, with a bit of experimentation for added uniqueness. The sound is powerful and thick and quite rhythmic, some excellent drumming and guitar playing here. I am disappointed that this band is not getting the exposure that they deserve by way of radio and clubs in the U.S. This is one of those CDs that words cannot describe, you just need to listen to it to experience it. It is a very artistic album, with lots of styles in it. Many people here compare this album to their previous one, but it stands on it's own as a great album. I'd say the melodies on here are better than the ones from You Forgot It In People, and the production is a bit bigger. If you like this you may like Arcade Fire or Wolf Parade. The extra disc is a nice bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLIPPIN SWEET BUT WHY NO PA?","review":"this record is unlike anyhting i have ever heard before. it doesnt even sound like a real record in the sense that there is so much going on it sounds unrehearsed like some collaborations like gypsophilia or godspeed you! black emperor. it really has no genre and i dont even now what it sounds like but its definately worth buying if you are open to new music styles. plus its got my fav lady miss leslie feist so ya cant go wrong . :)pswondering why it has no parental advisory because it curses WAY more than some records that have them. a perfect circle - mer de noms says the eff word once and it has one but there guys go on about all sorts of parebtal advisory worthy stuff but the dont get one.meh we all know that the pmrc isbaked anyway so buy it before it gets a pa kids"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it.","review":"It definately no 'You Forget It In People,' but it won't disappoint.

Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSS ups the ante with one of the strongest releases of the year","review":"Eagerly anticipated, the follow-up to 'You Forgot It In People' equals, if not outshines it's predecessor in musical vision and brilliance. Broken Social Scene self-titled is a symphonic rock treat, combining infectious hooks, driving beats, and instrumentals that are weaved together like fabric, textures that are both exquisitely delicate yet ambitious. Much of the same from Broken Social Scene, orchestral grandiosity, atmospheric/ambient nuances, propulsive rhythms, with splashes of indie-rock like colours on a canvas. Symphonic choruses, experimental with strong hooks, beautiful arrangements, an all over the map approach that will most likely result as one of the strongest CD's of 2005. The future of music has arrived, in the form of Broken Social Scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best rock albums of the 2000s","review":"This is one of the most interesting and exciting albums I have heard in a long time. The music is dense and complex, but also has a fun, free spirit running around in it. Horns, choruses, loud & good drumming, indie style vocals and lyrics, electronica, rocking guitar - a very nice mix of elements that results in a sound that is all their own. I heard a couple of their previous discs, but they don't reach the level of this one. The producer, David Newfeld, probably deserves a lot of credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost! Wrong Direction!","review":"Their other 2 albums were great. Trippy, very creative music that you could just lay down on the couch by yourself and daydream to. I was excited to see that they were coming to NYC and wondered how they would transfer that to the stage. Live, they came off as much more aggressive and overdriven than their recorded music. And what did they need all those people for? There were between 9 and 12 people playing and jumping around and stuff, but you tell what any of them were playing. Anyway I bought this one before the show and was disappointed to hear that it was pretty much the same song oriented, straitforward alternative rock that they played. This might be a good album, but don't try to relax with it or get stoned. Too bad. But I still have the other 2 that I can get off on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely a Copy of the Previous","review":"By now Broken Social Scene could record the sound of their own farts and release it as a record on Arts & Crafts, and all the critics and hipsters would oooooh and aaaaaah it.

There are a lot more lyrically-infused songs in this album, but I personally liked their instrumentals on You Forgot It In People. However, the real rockers in this one, being SUPERCONNECTED and MAJOR LABEL DEBUT (FAST) are simply out and out wicked guitar-riff and drum-thumping magic. Definitely not for everyone...but if you steer away from the formulaic pop garbage out there, this might be right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely a Masterpiece","review":"Broken Social Scene's self-titled album is quite the treat and/or pleasure! From the very first track (Our Faces Split the Coast in Half) the listener begins a superfantastic musical ride that is sure to please.

It's like setting in the middle of the universe. That is the best way I can describe it. This album being as good as it is may even rival the band's earlier effort: You Forgot it in People. Which is one of my top 10 albums of all time. This BSS album definately ranks in my top 10 too, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes good music.

However, his suggested death toll for the Dresden bombing (135,000) is inflated at least three times. Despite lacking heavy industry, Dresden was a regional capital, a communications center, etc., and therefore a legitimate target. As for the destruction of cultural treasures, the Germans merely got a taste of their own medicine. After the Warsaw Uprising, German crews with flamethrowers systematically burned Warsaw's archives and libraries, causing the loss of a half-million irreplaceable pieces of literature. The Germans also deliberately dynamited architectural buildings (among them the Royal Castle of Warsaw). The list goes on and on.

My research of this author has proven him to be as generally reliable as any other noted historian. His only sin is to try to present a more balanced view of both sides of a tragic war. Although I do not agree with everything that he writes, it certainly does not make him anti-semitic. That epithet should be saved for the true hatemongers who deserve it.

First off, the songs are too short and the beats are just plain weak. Second, the lyrical content leaves much to be desired. Granted, the alblum does have some strong points, \\"Where Do We Go From Here?\\" (featuring Nas and Mac) has some valid lyrics and a good beat, and \\"Ain't Nothing Changed\\" (featuring Magic and D.I.G.) is just plain spectacular.

Those three tracks are okay. But i think the rest of the cd got slow and wacky beats and also the lyrics are wack too. Its time for MP to start writing lyrics about something else than just the haters and how poor he and hes brothers was back then. MP is also kinda stealing 2pacs texts and lyrics. I mean \\"GHETTO IN THE SKY\\" is about the exact same stuff as \\"I WONDER IF HEAVEN GOT A GHETTO\\" by 2pac. And he should\`nt have titled the cd \\"ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME\\" because thats 2pacs too. But anyway there a little bit of good songs on the album so thats why i give the cd 2 stars.

His labels' albums drop off of Billboard just as fast as they come on, the music isnt particularly enjoyable at all. The beats, lyrics, and messages are all recycled to death, and it is this person's belief that MP came out of retirement to try to bring some fire to his falling empire after Cash Money rightfully took the Down South throne from him.

This album contains boring and uninteresting beats as well as wack lyrics. The sound(artist and Carlos Stephens etc.) is still much the same now, even though Beats By The Pound has left the camp.

I can't think of anything good to say about it. All of the songs sound the same with that awful noise that is P's voice, and the beats sound like they were made by a little kid. And what is up with P and Tupac. P never knew Tupac, and if they would have known each other, Tupac would have just had another person to slam in \\"Hit Em Up\\".

The production was my biggest problem with the album (it was typical No Limit sound, good enough for the REAL tank hitters, but I expected more from MP). Lyrically, I didnt expect much, but I thought there would be some party jams or music to run the streets with, neither. Nas wasnt as good as I thought, JD, too. Magic seriously needs to get dropped from the label, and Silkk as well as C-Murder didnt come with much, so pretty much the only No Limit Soldier I think that has a future is D.I.G. He needs to get coached lyrically, but I like his flow. Overall, if you're Bill Gates, get it cuz you got enough money to not feel bad about a mistaken purchase, but if not, at least burn it so you wouldnt hafta pay full price.

However, I'm beginning to like No Limit(Even though they have no talent). So that's why I am giving this CD a little better than just one star. The problem is that No Limit has nothing to say in their albums, they talk about the same thing over and over and over again. A good example is this CD. Aprroximately 4 of the songs in the CD are about Haters and the rest aren't any better. The only good song in the album is Who Down To Ride( I LOVE D.I.G.! Flows are tight as hell! ). I do have regrets buying this. If I should buy another NL CD. It would either MAC, Mystikal, D.I.G., or Fiend.

The best thing I can say about this collection is that disc 3 is considerably better than 1 and 2. The psuedo-live/pub feel of most songs just comes off as silly. Most songs seem to feature only accordian and drum (and singer), so unless you want to hear lots of accordian music, stay away from this one.Songs not featuring the accordian are still woefully short of instruments, as if all the flute and guitar players were on holiday when this was being recorded. It's not a lack of musicianship as much as a total lack of musicians. This album's depth is exceeded by its CD's thickness. Replay value is somewhere below zero: don't even buy it used.Additional note: this appears to be identical to Irish Favorites, Vol. 1, except for the addition of the third disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A MOVIE","review":"KURT RUSSEL IS GREAT IN THIS, A FAMILY OF FIRE FIGHTERS AND A BROTHER LEARNING THE ROPES, LEADS TO A GREAT MOVIE, JUST WATCHING WHAT FIRE DOES AND HOW IT MOVES, IS QUITE FASCINATING, YOU CANT TURN AWAY.

Plot-wise, the film is an old-fashioned barnstormer, directed with gee-whizz efficiency by Howard, whose attempts to wring high emotion from Greg Widen's corny script rings entirely false from the outset.

He is truly one of the great character actors from the last 30 years, and this small role proves that no matter where you stick him, Sutherland delivers. I've still got the chills from watching the grin on his face as De Niro shows him the melted doll. This film also sees excellent performances from Baldwin and Russell, both of whom have spent way too much time in lousy movies for their own good--this one proves they have the talent to do better. De Niro of course does well, although I would have liked to have seen even more of him, especially toward the end, when his character seems to take a little vacation from the script. But overall, an extremely enjoyable and unique film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome movie and a must-see!","review":"I love Backdraft! I remember seeing it for the first time on cable about four years ago and loved it then - mainly because of Kurt Russell and William Baldwin. Recently, I bought the tape and am so glad I bought it. Watching Russell as the domineering older brother and Baldwin as the younger brother trying to make Russell's character proud of him and to uphold the family tradtion is what appeals to me. The suspense of the movie always gets me on the edge of my seat no matter how many times I've watched it. I always cry even though I know what's coming. This is a must-see movie if you like action and observing the sexy Kurt Russell and William Baldwin in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie","review":"A lot of drama and some really cool action scenes make for an excellent movie. Ron Howard is a very talented guy and this is one of his earlier breakthroughs. There's an element of artistic license in the way that Howard depicts the fires and firefighting; he also showed artistic license in his portrayal of mental illness and John Nash's life in A Beautiful Mind. Other reviewers have criticized the Backdraft script and claimed that the only good things in this movie are the fire sequences, but I disagree. I think the whole thing is good, and the final \\"faceoff\\" scene with Scott Glenn in the massive fire is classic. The movie has a bit of a 1990s feel, which may date it slightly, but I think that's part of the appeal. Kurt Russell is the king of cool, and he's perfect for this role. Another cool movie of his that not that many people know about is Dark Blue, which is about the LAPD and LA riots.

When Krut Russell's character goes into the 2 story building, to rescue the child, he has his coat wide open and no SCBA equipment. The smoke would have killed him in a matter of seconds. If anybody was to run into a fire filled room with their coat undone they'd be cooked !And the chemical fire at the end, oh my !

Ten years after the Mark II line-up split and eight years after the band ceased to exist entirely, the best line-up reformed. The time off was necessary, I think. \\"Perfect Strangers\\" is a gem of the 80s. It has all of the talent and class of Deep Purple with a matured and evolved style. The title track explores the emotions that still lingered between bandmates, post-reformation. Moody and exotic sounding, the song is centrally placed to anchor the album. It is the spine of this work.All of the songs, aside for maybe \\"Not Responsible,\\" are well-done and enjoyable. Of course, my favorite song is \\"Knocking at Your Back Door.\\" It's sleazy and thoroughly enjoyable.Ending the album is \\"Son of Alerik\\" a long, solely instrumental piece. Moody, it has a way of conjuring images of somber medieval kings, quite indicative of Blackmore's love of the medieval.All in all, an enjoyable album, perhaps one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Album","review":"This album is worth 10 stars.Unfortunately I can only give 5 stars.I agree with \\"polaris\\" , how could any Deep Purple fan cannot like this album.Just listen to Wasted Sunsets and you will know why Ritchie Blackmore is still considered to be one the best heavy metal guitarists . This is a brilliant album. Its a very matured album and one can easily see that a lot of effort has been put into this, especially considering the fact this is a reunion act.Deep Purple is still my favourite group ever.Highly Recommended for anyone who likes Highway Star or Smoke On The Water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pure Moods","review":"This album is NOT part of the Pure Moods series.

It is all of her hits, and sung by Cher herself. This is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars and Climbing","review":"I have not finished the book yet, but the author's style is charming, insightful and enjoyable to read. This is a huge survey of some 4000 years of history of civilizations on the Mediterranean coasts. It goes from Egypt to WWI. Did you know the Romans likely originated in Troy (Aeneas)? Fascinating. For me it pulls together less than satisfactory past knowledge and adds knowledge in a useful way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most informative","review":"This is a most informative, well-written book on the Mediterranean.

Melodramatic to the core. Jennifer Jones as Ruby was not pretty enough to be so desirable; the doctor's role wasn't developed enough, and there were never any bright spots. Ruby lacked wisdom and depth of character. Charleton Heston was pretty shallow, also. I thought the entire plot totally rediculous. I resented the presentation of God and Christianity in the character of Ruby's brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"ruby gentry","review":"This is a good movie with a good strong cast.

It was before the time of TV violence, sexual content and swearing, which means it's okay for adults and kids alike. Contrary to what another reviewer has said, Mr. Ed does NOT go to the glue factory. He and his owner Wilbur have many adventures. Yes, there are times when Wilbur does look slightly off his rocker to his peers, but Ed is a good friend to him. Look for great guest stars and funny jokes. Mr. Ed will continue to be a great show for years to come and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Mom...","review":"A gift for my Mom she loved this television program from years ago, she loves watching this series.

I bought this book because I wanted the libretto of the musical. Everything I read before I ordered the book stated that it would contain the libretto. It does not. It contains the story to Wicked with large excerpts from the Holzman's book as well as the lyrics, but not the complete dialogue. Large portions of the script are reduced to a short descriptive paragraph. This book is not cheap, but I paid the price because I wanted the complete libretto. I feel like I was mislead."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING TO THE TENTH DEGREE","review":"As as avid reader of all literature and a fan of the original Wizard, this was without a doubt the worst book I have ever had the horror of reading.

I bought my tickets to see the show over a year early (in California).The book may be missing a few things, but if you are looking for some great information about photos to aid your understanding and love of the show, whether you have seen it or not, this is a great buy.

I'm normally very impressed with Amazon - their product selection, their fast and accurate billing and shipping, and the condition of the products when they arrive. This time, however, the book (which is hardcover) arrived with warped pages (like water damaged) and some of the pages are not very attached to the binding."},{"rating":"1","title":"WICKEDLY DECIEVING.....","review":"As a \\"fan\\" of this splendid and inovative AMERICAN musical - I was most eager to finally read a complete script of this elusive show (The Broadway Cast album was no help other than ptinting the lyrics to the songs) - alas, No such luck... The pictures are nice. The binding is excellent BUT no script! If you read the original book - you have clues. But lots of great stuff was left out of the musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inside information on the production","review":"Great inside information for the Wicked lovers, very light/fast reading, with interviews of the production team.A must read for any Broadway fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked good book!","review":"The grimmerie is the best piece of Wicked merchandise I own. It is incredibly informative to any Wicked fan, tells you about the actors/actresses, set design, technical design, production, everything. The real gem though is the photos, they are all LARGE and colorful, a pleasure to look at. My favorite part is that they didn't limit the book to the OBC, since the majority of people who have seen the show have seen subsequent casts. Unfortunately the Original Chicago Cast is left out, which is why I only give it four stars instead of five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"We purchased the Grimmerie after reading Wicked and just before attending the musical in Chicago.

The look of the book from the padded, distressed appearance of the cover, the foxing on the pages, the photos, the history of the show... it all adds up to a wonderful read and a great addition to other theatre books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has all of Oz honeymooning","review":"As far as photobook tie-ins for fans of musicals go it's hard to imagine a better or more informative book. There are multiple interviews with many members of the different casts of \\"Wicked\\" (US, London, and touring), plus many photos of the different metropolitan productions, and in-depth looks at the beautiful props, sets, and costumes that did so much towards making the show a success. And there are many superb interviews with the creative team that put the show together that give you a good sense of the give-and-take that went on in putting it all together. There's also a useful glossary of terms if you're not as familiar with the books by L. Frank Baum and Gregory Maguire the musical bases itself upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Companion to the Show","review":"I recommend purchasing this book after the seeing the play. It's the perfect way to remember the award-winning musical. Buying it off amazon is a much better bargain then buying it on location!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all Wicked fans","review":"I have only recently become a Wicked fan, having seen the show twice in the last few months in San Francisco. It is, without a doubt, one of the best musicals I've ever seen. The Grimmerie is a beautiful, informative book and something all Wicked fans will cherish. If there is a Wicked fan in your life, this would make a perfect gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly interesting...","review":"at first, i had hoped this had the full script, but understand why it doesn't. this book also gives people who may not have read the book this musical is based on a taste so that they might delve into the series, which currently has three books to it. i certainly am happy with the content, and glad that they made this book for the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly good!","review":"\\"What a wonderful musical!\\" If you share that sentiment, you'll want this book. It is a wonderful collection of great pictures, behind the scenes insights, a view into how this show came into being, looks inside the minds of the players, and of course the entire dialogue and song lyrics. Very nicely bound. Just an excellent way to revisit and enjoy the musical again and again. I bought one for me and another for a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description","review":"The description on Amazon clearly states that the book contains the libretto as well as the spells used in the show. The book does not. I understand that the original intention was to include these things, but they were dropped at the last minute. The description of the book was misleading. If I just wanted a book with pictures from the show I would buy a program and save myself the money. I gave the book one star because it is not the book that was advertised. The pictures may be nice, but without the libretto the book is fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"I am new to this esteemed author, this being only my second foray into her many works. I found Arabella delightful and look forward to a third installment of Ms Heyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluffy.","review":"The story was an entertaining, light read innocent enough for a young girl to enjoy (despite the fact that the main character annoyed me thoroughly on more than one occasion). However, the skeleton plot was so reminicent of Pride and Prejudice, I could not help but make continual comparisons to the authentic Regency masterpiece and find Heyer's work lacking in Miss Austen's depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth May Destroy Love","review":"ARABELLA by Georgette Heyer brings a penniless parson's daughter to London for a season under false circumstances.

I read a lot & am a lover of words... but this is the most wordy & effusive writing style I have ever seen. The story might be good if I could get through a sentence without having to read it twice to get it's meaning. I don't have any interest in any of the characters and the verbiage (although i'm sure is contemporary for the book's setting) is tedious. I will keep plugging away but it is putting me to sleep most nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and Typical Georgette Heyer Fare","review":"I'll be honest: I have difficulty telling one Georgette Heyer apart from the other. In my mind, they all tend to tell the same story, but I think Heyer always does an excellent and charming job of recreating that story. Like numerous other Heyer regency romances, this is about a poor young woman who goes to London in search for a husband, and ends up nabbing the wealthiest and most eligible bachelor, largely by being a little naive, with a theatrical temper and compassion. Despite the fact that I KNOW I've read this story by Heyer before under numerous different titles, I found this book entertaining, the romance sweet, the whole trip was pleasurable and typically Heyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and funny","review":"For a bit of light hearted fun, I can't recommend this book highly enough. Arabella, the eldest daughter of a country parson, is given the opportunity, by her godmother, of having a Season in London, in the hope of finding a wealthy husband and thereby being able to gring out her three younger sisters and to advance the careers of her brothers. Society is under the impression that Arabella is a great heiress ( a fact which \\"slipped\\" out under the influence of a glass of champagne) and she is given the entree into the highest eschelons after being seen with the highest arbiter of fashion and taste, Mr. Beaumaris.The story is full of the usual quirkiness of Miss Heyers characters and is a sheer delight as a light and funny read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I expected of Georgette Heyer","review":"Heyer has memorable characters and interesting plots. Arabella isn't my favorite, but it is well worth adding to my Heyer Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regency romance at its best","review":"This is a delightful Regency era tale. Arabella is the eldest daughter in a large family of a poor clergyman and his former society wife. Arabella's mother manages to convince her husband to send Arabella off to London for the Season, in hopes that she can land a wealthy husband to improve her family's fortunes. On the way, a carriage accident leads her to meet wealthy bachelor, Robert Beaumaris, who she overhears saying that he felt the \\"accident\\" was engineered so they could meet him. Arabella decides to fire back and claims to be a wealthy heiress herself. Robert passes on the rumor of her wealth, which leads Arabella to be the toast of the town. She spends much time with Mr. Beaumaris and he begins to see the real girl as she rescues a stray dog, an abused boy chimney sweep and works to get her brother out of financial trouble from his gallivanting and gambling in London. All's well that ends well in this charming tale with a plucky and real heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a collection of cheap shareware","review":"This disc sounded like it would be fantastic.

It's almost like they aren't in the same room or even in the same time zone.\\" When I got home I read through the liner notes to find that was in deed the case. The 3 Domingo cuts were recorded on different days than the 3 Skovhus cuts. I find that to be terribly disappointing. In order for these songs to hang together the singers need to really understand and empathize with each other during the performace. That's pretty damn hard to do when they're not even in the same city (probably).This is the only Domingo disc I own that I will likely never listen to again - to the used CD store I go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skovhus, you're no Fischer-Dieskau...","review":"I heard only the last song in a radio broadcast.

Among other things, what makes this collection notable is a lengthy dinner interview with the artist which reads like a contemporary Q&A style news report. Humble and unbuttoned, we are given an informal lesson by the master on the several ways in which the artist serves humanity. Eloquent and wise, Rodin was a remarkable thinker with an ability to see well beyond his age. Like his art his thoughts are timeless and for that reason are always relevant. My only criticism of the book lies in the marginal quality of the black and white images. These could have been printed on better quality paper--as it is the halftones sink into the paper and lose clarity and intensity. However, I did not buy this book for the reproductions but for the artist's sage comments. If one is seeking wisdom, this book is a great value. William J.

I looked inside the Amazon shipping box but I could not find the piece (box was sealed when i got it). I can only assume that it broke off before packaging. Shipping to return would cost me more than half the product cost as item is no longer in the states. I wasn't really expecting this to happen since the item is directly sold by Amazon.

Yes, it does everything! Bring it on a family ride with everything from road bikes to cruisers to klunkers.... there is a tool here to fix almost anything! But, that comes at a cost... weight. What I learned from this is to rethink what tools my bike needs (allens, vs. sockets etc...) and what i'm likely to fix on the trail/road vs. calling the sag-wagon... then get the tool that will meet those needs.

Luckily, by the time we figured it out, there was a local bike store that helped us tighten the bolt.

Highly recommended for *all* bikers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool, minor complaint","review":"Excellent multitool for the road bag and general maintenance. The large hex keys alone justifies the buy, with tire levers and screwdrivers included in the same package. It only loses a star for durability, as two teeth on the chain breaker tool bent and sheared off during a chain removal. The chain tool still works, but is not a substitute for a separate chain breaker.

I have used the original Alien tool for years and this one adds more useful features in the same format.My only complaint vs. the original tool is air-travel related.

Fun read, but Not recommended for your collection!!!I am huge fan of Whedon and Cassaday, but the story came up short. While the first story arc was exciting,it totally fell flat on the second arc.This is just another example of Marvel's recent lack of quality.

Getting back into comic books at my age(25) is honestly because of these books. Whedon and Cassaday really do honor to what comic books should be: intelligent and beautiful. The books really dwell in our contemporary debates about what it means to be different and also, what it means to need people around you that are of value, so to speak. Logan and Scott's relationship in the first two issues are brilliantly done. Whedon's understanding of framing devices and storytelling in general is well done and really, really fun.

As a former resident of Atlanta, I have appreciated the accuracy of her work in capturing the true flavor of the city especially the Little Five Points area and its residents. I reluctantly say that this book was not nearly the quality of material I have come to expect from this author. The story line seemed rather implausible and the character development was nil. I would reccomend this book to die hard Callahan fans but would caution them not to expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners Software CM book, short on content","review":"As a developer who has had some configuration management experience I was very disappointed in this book. The basics of CM are covered tutorial style, using RCS as the example tool.The book repeats much information by breaking it up into individual and team sections. It seems the authors were determined to meet a predetermined number of pages, one appendix is simply a printing of the RCS man pages, which were also included on the CDrom. The reviews of tools are in a nice format but are certainly not thorough enough to really help someone looking for information. The authors would have served thier readership better by covering the material once and then filling pages by adding depth. The authors background should have provided enough experience to produce a better book. \\"Applying Rcs and Sccs : From Source Control to Project Control\\" by Don Bolinger, Tan Bronson, Mike Loukides (Editor) is a far better value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly by the seat of your pants SCM!","review":"As a person who has over 15 years of experience in SCM and teaches the discipline professionally I found this text completely unacceptable. It doesn't address any of the fundamentals of SCM (i.e., configuration identification, change control, etc.) or and of the primary problems associated with software develpment such as shared data, simultaneous update, etc. Finally, it doesn't address process management, impact analysis, facilitating good communications, running a CCB, and more. About the only thing I found the book is good for is learning about the tool shipped with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not the Oxford English Dictionary of Slang","review":"This book was not to my liking in the least.

(Nixon was President then...)On page 32 I learned that the Aryans got their name from Arius of Alexandria (confusing \\"Arians\\" and \\"Aryans\\")....

I thought I'd get used to it, so every now and then I give it a spray or two, but I just can't do it. Terrible. What's worse, is the foul aftertaste you get in your mouth and when you're talking to someone, cover your mouth with your hand. I'm talking major bad breath. I'm sticking with my Vocal Eze.

I myself don't really care for that. Oh yeah and the vampires....yeah I never got to that part. 130 pages in and there is one in his dream. Thats about it. I was almost halfway through this book and the vamps still hadn't show up. I was bored to tears and had I had anything else to do I wouldn't have gotten as far as I did in this book.

It is GONE GONE GONE. Mind you, cheesy writing with one dimensional characters is not a crime, but this book could set a precedent.Creating a gang of friends just so that you can kill, maime, and injure them in various ways is a cheap way to gain emotional response from the readers. Of course, we the readers could care less since the characters were never really developed properly.Dawn of the Vampire is bad on so many levels, it seems unfair to actually get too detailed in reviewing it. I can only give a warning and wonder if all those glowing rave reviews are only a trick to sucker others the way I have been suckered.

Mr. Hill is very vivid in his description of the Appalachian Mountains and South Holston Lake; and having grown up in both I can honestly say that it was hard to venture out after dark for a while after reading his book.The characters really come alive.

I used this book as research for my own historical novel and found it to be immensely useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thirty Seconds over Tokyo","review":"I like this book because it ahs history in it. It tells you how the Doolittle raid took place and what happened. Also because it has a few graphics in it showing important parts or characters. The novel is a likable book because if you don't know what happened in the Doolittle Raid it will tell you what happened.The best part of the book was when Captian Doolittle made the first bombings on Tokyo. In the book they said that the factories in Tokyo were in bunches, so when they made the bombings it did the most damage. That was the best part of the bookThe reasons the author didn't do a very good job on the setting was that he didn't give good enough pictures. Also because he just says where it's taking place. The other thing the author didn't say in details what had happened at Pearl Harbor. Also because he didn't alot of detail of what happened during the whole time. That was what the author didn't do."},{"rating":"2","title":"a history class must!","review":"First of all, I think everyone should have to read this in history or social studies class.

This CD sounds nothing like their first two and is very unique. The riffs are crazy and Spider's voice is amazing. The best songs on here are: Nobody's Real, Supernova goes pop, Tonight the stars revolt, and autimatic. There is also a pretty good cover of \\"let the good times roll\\" on here featuring limp bizkit's DJ Lethal. If you like Powerman, then you should check out Union Underground, Static-X, and Rob Zombie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good, all these years later","review":"Along with System of a Down, Sevendust, and maybe the first Puya disc, Powerman 5000's \\"Tonight the Stars Revolt\\" holds up better than most of the crap that came out in the nu metal onslaught. Though a lot of the riffs sound like hand-me-down's from Rob Zombie, I happen to like the sound on (especially) the last White Zombie record, so that ain't bad. What I really like about this is that instead of writing about angst or horrific things like most other bands of their type (*cough* Korn *cough* Slipknot *cough*), PM5K's lyrics remind me of some really cool comic books that I read as a kid, especially \\"The Son of X-51\\" because Marvel Comics had a character named X-51.With heavy riffs and strong vocals, this album holds up as one of the better hard rock/metal albums of the late 1990s. It might be closer to a 3.75/5, but I would recommend it to anyone looking to flesh out their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Get Boring","review":"I am on the bus three hours each day, and PM5K:Stars Revolt is pretty much all i play on my minidisc.

Another good thing about PM5K is nobody knows who they are so hopefully they won't sell out in the near future like some bands already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explicit lyrics?","review":"First off. Why do they say that this CD has explicit lyrics. They say the f*ck like once in the whole album. Now Limp Bizkit, they swear way too much! Anywho, this is a very sweet CD. I do not know exactly why, but I can never get tired of this CD. I do not see why so many people are just classifying it as a carbon coby of Rob Zombies tracks. They sound nothing at all alike. This CD is closer to spped metal than the type of music that Rob is. They donm not always talk about being the Scum of the Earth. Mind you, I do like Rob a lot, I prefer this CD a lot more. It has all good tracks. The only complaint is that it is not nearly long enough. We need more PM5K. I feel that the talent of the instrumental portion of the band is guite talented. But, the lyrics are a pure marvel. They have a relativelly original sound, and could battle on my CD shelf up beside the Deftones, and Soulfly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cd Is A Big Let Down","review":"I bought this cd a few days ago.

You may want to read them- you will be treated to similar music here.Here is what the liner notes say for these CDs: \\"Her philosophy begins and ends in the self-controlled fervour of her almost maternal concern for the well-being of a work's inherent character, and, ultimately, her knowledge and skills all go to serve nothing more or less than the natural simplicity of musical invention.\\" Needless to say, we would hope for that style, given these stellar works from Bach, Mozart, Chopin etc. I give four stars in an effort to control \\"star inflation\\".

The lyrics are completely forgettable overall, but the singing adds to the sultry, hot-summer night feel of the disc.

I had a hard time getting into the book from the very beginning. I typically have a very, very hard time setting a book down but this one would sit within my Kindle, unread, for days and days before I'd attempt to pick it back up. I tried to pick it up again last night and couldn't believe when I looked at the bottom of my screen and saw that I was only 48% of the way done. This novel seems to go on forever. And although the promise of \\"secrets\\" kept me mildly interseted at first, I found the plot for the most part very predictable and the character lines cheesy. Many reviewers seemed to really enjoy the book but if you like your romances with a little more excitement and less cheese, I would suggest passing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"I am sorry I wasted 99cents on this book.

I liked this book because the story was charming, as were the characters, and it didn't take effort to read. I was surprised by the twist of Ryan's mother's ghost, but it was a welcome addition that only enhanced the story.

Honestly there were so many bizarre elements introduced I was almost waiting for an alien abduction or demon possession to creep its way in. There were some decent moments that were cute, but overall I had a hard time getting into it and an even harder time getting past the whole ghost character thing. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor (Wo)Man's Nicholas Spark","review":"If you're looking for stories that highlights small town living, you won't really find it in this book.If you're looking for a romance novel, you won't really find it in this book.If you're looking for memorable characters, you won't really find it in this book.If you're looking for a good mystery you... kind of find it in this book.I will give the author credit, I like how she slowly reveals the 'mystery\\" of what happened to Ryan. The pacing is the only thing that kept me reading towards the end. However, the closer we get to discovering the past the less you start to care and the author just kind of rushes the ending and slaps a happy ending with little thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring","review":"I thought the story kind of dragged...I actually started reading another book before I even finished this one (with only a few pages left) that's how disinterested I became.

I love other Barbara Freethy books but just not a fan of this one. Hate that I spent 2.99 on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Sorry, but this book was very stupid! The characters went back and forth with their feelings and were so wishy washy. They have feelings for one another in one chapter and in the next they are packing their bags to leave. Predictable plot and cheesy dialog. I read it to the end because I wanted to confirm who the ghost was, but sorry now that I wasted my time. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoakie","review":"Or trite. Either word would work for this book. I found most of the characters to be undeveloped. The author has them doing things which are totally out of character without adequately showing why. And the plot line was predictable and trite. Add to that a ghost who appears only to a little girl and I found myself rolling my eyes throughout most of this book. The redeeming feature of this book is that it was free for Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"This book was classified as a Christian Book.

I spent the entire day reading this book and ignoring things I should have been doing. This is a wonderful story with endearing characters, love, romance and family. There is humor and sadness, for me that was smiles and tears. I enjoyed every word and was sorry when it ended.

The instructor goes way too fast and doesn't give info on how to do the steps. What he does best is moves his hips as shown in the warm up and cool down. It made me wonder if i was watching an exercise tape or a porno. The only person who benefits from the tape is M.C. Cash. His dancers are tired out and the viewer is too confused to actually do anything but watch them. This video is not worth 2.00. I beg you please do not waste your money on this sorry excuse of a workout video."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent speciality cook book","review":"This book is a great special interest book. If you are looking for an extensive encyclopedia of recipes and techniques, this book is not for you. However, if you would like to explore the culinary specialities of the various regions of the Spain, this is a great book. Besides covering the mainline Spanish culture, it also deals with the Basques and Moorish influenced foods as well.Visually, the book is very impressive. The surrounding pictures and text describe the region and the culture, putting the recipies in context. It is this extra material that makes trying out these recipies so much fun.The recipies themselves vary in the level of difficulty, preparation and practicality. Again, pick your experiment and get started as you have time. One frustration is that some of the ingredients are hard to find if you are outside of Spain - obviously not the book's fault.This book was well worth the investment and is an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Primer","review":"A perfect book for one either wanting to learn more about Spain or its cooking. The recipes are often simple, always marvelous and take into account the true spirit of the country. If you want to understand Spain and Spanish cooking in all its glory then here it is- there is no better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very origional sounding rock band","review":"I read about this band in A&P magazine, and in the Law of Inertia mag, so I decided to try them out. Boy was I glad I did! The best I can describe this album is that it sounds like a straight up riff based rock band with tons of Black Sabbath influences. I hear Black Sabbath all over this record. This isn't your basic boring verse-chorus-verse-chorus song structures. The whold cd is just awesome! The only things I don't like about this album is that 1) sometimes it sounds like the guitars are pushed ahead in the mix above the drums and bass and 2) the singer needs to let loose. Some parts he is just too whispery quiet and passive sounding.Other than that the record is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll","review":"This is the first CD I have ever heard by this band that I have been hearing about everywhere. Boy was it worth the money. The guitar is constantly interweaving with the vocals and a good old rock and roll rhythm section that reminds me of the 70's-in a very good way. The singing is the only thing that detracts from this album for me, it seems somewhat monotonous and quiet at times as far as the mix goes, leaving me wondering sometimes whether I am listening to one long song or several similarly styled tracks. But if you are the type of person who likes to go to shows and hear something very unlike what is on the radio-this is the CD for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great Bibs","review":"Although these bibs are attractive and organic, they do not actually prevent moisture from seaping underneath to clothing...which it the purpose right?

I wash them and dry them with all of his other clothing, no special treatment, and we have seen minimal staining and no wear whatsoever. No, they do not have the waterproof inner layer, but I knew that when I bought them. We have three of them. I like to put them on my son when we are going to have company because they are not bright, ugly colors and don't distract too much from his outfit. I have no problems with him soaking through them, but he's not a super heavy drooler. They have gotten us through 3 teeth and one more is on the way. They are nice and soft.I would definitely buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Distinctive Style","review":"A vivid imagist and sentimental symbolist, Jason uses strong sensory descriptions and common language to create modern free verse that speaks directly to our emotions from his experiences.The Dickinsonian 'A poem to my dead love' bathes in despondence.'Me?' fell right out of Eliot's , The Waste Land.'In this frail time between heartbeats' is a gem.'Trapped in the inside world' is intriguing.My favorite is 'Where she sleeps'.Jason's voice mourns from a previous century. His manner of seeing and thinking is ancient. A distinctive style. An (yet) undiscovered talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like imagery ...","review":"... you'll love this book. These poems are arranged to show a personal journey. The ecstasy of love found, the bitterness and self-loathing of love lost, followed by the redemption of time healing wounds. Many of the poems are deeply personal, but all are accessible and full of colorful imagery. The poet also has many with beautiful nature themes mixed in. Some poems are fun and playful, some are very serious."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this hoping it was a good furniture polish, with the added bonus of repeling dust. It did neither. It didn't repel dust at all, in fact I think it attracted dust. Plus it also left a sticky residue on the wood and left my furniture looking dull. There was absolutely no shine to the wood anymore. It made my furniture look horrible. This product doesn't do anything it claims to do. In fact your furniture will look even worse after using it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birder's Guide to Northern California","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this book. The information was to generalized and did not include specifics. I have never experienced a book with such vague and poor directions to birding sites. Too bad that there is not an ABA guide to birding Northern California."},{"rating":"1","title":"Northern California birding trip frustration","review":"I'm afraid I'll have to agree with what's been said about this book. I took a trip earlier this month to Northern California and my friend and I found this book only mildly useful. It does provide general information, however for anything more than that, another book is needed. Seasonal variation is ignored in some site descriptions and detailed directions to sites that require them are absent. There are no bar-charts to tell when a species is common, rare or even present, only a very general checklist in the back. Northern California is a large area to cover with a birding guide, so I can see why this book may be thin on detail. I think a much better bet would be to try John Kemper's \\"Birding Northern California\\". We saw this at the Pt. Reyes visitor's center near the end of our trip and certainly regretted not having it the whole time. Until an ABA/Lane guide comes out for this region, I think Kemper's is the best there is. Good birding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book needs work. It is not going to be a lot of help in planning a birding trip. It is too generalized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on my wavelength - worst guide I have seen","review":"I found this book very frustrating. I often drive up Southern California using the excellent ABA guide and as soon as I hit Northen California it is like navigating in a fog. The directions are terrible and frequently I end up with a detailed map trying to work out where the site I am aiming for is located. Each chapter covers far too much ground to be possible to follow easily.The 2nd major fault is there is no bar charts and checklist showing seasonal variation of numbers, frequency of occurance etc. It makes it very difficult to figure out what one is supposed to be looking for and when."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little guidance in this guide","review":"Vague, inaccurate, partial: possibly European birdwatchers are spoiled for choice, but this guide is of so little practical use that you should avoid spending money on it. As the American reviewer suggested, the Kemper book is far more informative, accurate and vale for money. Hate posting negative reviews but felt the need on this one couldn't be ignored.Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and Cheap Feeling","review":"At 34\\" around I just didn't feel like I was getting the support I needed.

Not excluduing the breakfast meats and chicken brest. The rest of the meals I can fake in the microwave or by boiling some water. And mose important to me is not one meal, from start to finish, takes more than 20min. It is the best. Considering I don't like washing dishes either. All I need is a sponge!!! It is the best...

I use it to cook steaks or whatever, right out of the freezer, in fact.

It's unbelievable that a professional company would release such a terrible quality video. The picture quality is even worse that those EP mode (extended play) cheapies. This one's in the SP mode (standard play), but the picture is washed out, it has all kinds of lines buzzing around the edge of objects and actors. This is totally unwatchable! I had to return this video to Amazon.com for a refund, even though this is the only vhs version available to buy. I recommended that Amazon.com view this product and stop offering this totally inferior quality product for sale. But they haven't done it so far. I really don't know how good or bad this film is because I was not able to watch this video due to its WORSE THAN BAD quality. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"au revoir","review":"Melville's final film is another story of the criminal as lone wolf. The essential lonliness of the life is, as always, the demise of the anti-hero. Alain Delon has developed a romantic conscience is this, his third outing as Melville's on-screen persona. While not as razor-sharp as \\"Le Samourai\\", this film compensates with a tinge of sadness. As always, the photography is burnished and moody. Deneuve is in her prime, as is Delon. Melville fans are not the only audience for \\"Dirty Money\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Primer","review":"This is an anthology of articles defining Conservatism in America in modern times.

It's got the acoustic guitars, the slow, hip hoppish beats- your standard issue chick music on the mmody tip.Via Tania's vocals are what bring the whole thing down. She's very warbly and oftentimes sits on TOP of the music instead of meshing with it. Which is too bad, because the music is great.

The print() and println() methods of the PrintStream class are excellent examples of polymorphism\\".This definition of polymorphism is just plain WRONG.3) I cannot say anything about the second part related to the 310-027 exam.4) A good book to buy to prepare for the 310-035 exam:Sun Certified Programmer & Developer for Java 2 Study Guide (Exams 310-035 & 310-027) by Kathy Sierra (she is a co-developer of the SCJP 1.4 exam 310-035) and Bert Bates."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Sub acolyte","review":"I studied Russian under the tutalage of Doctor David Murphy.

I've had it about a week and am amazed at how well it works. The atomic clock is extremely accurate! I checked it against a standard time and would you believe that it is good down to a second or less! Also the outdoor temperature tracks right with our local Weather Channel readings. Also the humidity readings are good. Another good feature is the button on top for lighted display-in the middle of the night-press the button and read display and it goes out in about five seconds.

Seems to be accurate and has a nice functional clean design. Setting it up is easier than appears in the instruction booklet. The instructions are not clear and direct you to start pushing this and that. Inital set-up was frustrating because I was impatient and wanted the unit to work immediately.My advice is just put the batteries in the units and wait, even if the atomic clock signal indicator indicates no signal. In my case, in Florida, it took about three hours to connect with the atomic clock signal, from then on I received the signal. Note: When I did receive the signal - the clock was set to Pacific Time - and it was easy to reset to Eastern TimeMy only other comment is the order of the display. On the base unit the humidity displays to the left of the temperature and this seems counter intuitive to me.I have enjoyed this addition to my desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overall choice","review":"I spent a few hours looking for just the right weather system for under $150. I only really needed outdoor and indoor temperature. Living in Oregon, I also wanted to support a \\"local\\" manufacturer. Even without this preference, the BAR608HGA was clearly the right choice. It delivers all I want at a good price, plus indoor and outdoor humidity measurements, an auto-setting clock and a weather forecaster that predicts weather changes on the basis of changing atmospheric pressure.I didn't give it five stars because it doesn't have the fit and finish of a truly outstanding consumer product--but as an iPod owner, I have admittedly high standards. The sliding door is a little inelegant and tends to stick, the backlight doesn't stay on as long as I would have liked, setup isn't ultra-easy...but who really cares? This is a quality product that does what it's supposed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is pretty bad","review":"My unit is not very acurate, plus sometimes it doesn't communicate with the outside sensor (it is really close to the window - so they are both as close as couple of feet from each other). The weather preddiction usually doesn't really work that good - sometimes it does sometimes it doesen't so the feature is useless. Atomic clock feature is also useless - I've tried to place the unit in several different places in my apartment and it still wont find the atomic clock signal (I live in NY but there are no major buildings surrunding mine - just river so I dont know what seems to b a probblem). Oh one more thing the outtside sensor broke after aprox. 3 months so I had to replace it with a new one. Generally I don't recommend this unit at all!!

But when I tried putting the batteries in the remote unit, I found that the two bottom screws that remove the battery compartment are so tiny and so deeply recessed that not a single screwdriver in my house comes close to fitting it. Now I've got to buy a new screwdriver set just to install the batteries??! Terrible design. Shame on Oregon Scientific, which normally makes pretty good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"These units are great. We have a few of them in different rooms. They perform as advertised.The outdoor device reliably senses temp -- but keep it out of direct sunlight or the readings will be high.It sends the signal to the base unit indoors, so we can figure out what to wear for the day.I wouldn't rely on it for weather forecasting -- look that up on the web.The atomic clock is a nice feature, but we've had some issues with picking up the signal from time to time.Overall, however, this is a great unit at a very reasonable price, and it's been reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"reliable but could use a bigger display","review":"I've had this working since the day I got it in 9 months ago. I love the fact it receives time from the atomic clock. I'd say the weather predictions are as good as any based on a few variables (I don't think the forcast is received from the weather service though that would be cool).Unfortunately, when I'm sitting on the other side of the room it's not big enough to read the time display. The light only goes on when you press the button. Also, the buttons and labels are not clearly arranged (sort of like the Florida balots in 2000). But, generally, I'd definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Husband","review":"My husband has always wanted an indoor/outdoor thermometer so I gave him the wireless weather station.

It is too bad I can not say the same for the Oregon Scientific RAR608HGA weather forecaster. I followed the instructions exactly according to the book, time after time. I finally got the remote transmitter to work, as long as it was right next to the base unit. I even got it to work once when it was outside about 5 feet from the base unit. That lasted for about an hour. I called Oregon and the young lady told me to return it and they would send me a new one but I decided why send good money after bad (shipping cost).

I would definitely recomend this can opener to everyone :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"West Bend Can Opener","review":"Very good product. Lives up to it's past previews. Easy to open a can. We had bought several others but they didn't work at all or as well or as sturdily as this one does. You put the can where it is supposed to go and it goes automatically without a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stainless Can Opener","review":"Love it. Works great. The only drawback might be it's \\"stainless appearing.\\" The price is right. The knife-sharpening feature it has is mind-boggling to me though. Looks like there are little, plastic thingys that are supposed to sharpen a knife. Think it does work but I don't see why. Maybe I'm too old for writing reviews now. I would buy it again. Clean cut opening w/o splashing me with the can's contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easy","review":"This can opener worked great for a yr and a half. It broke because the switch that the main lever pushes down on has a plastic piece that breaks off. You can see this white plastic piece sticking out on the right side of the gear on front. This piece can break on the first use if you push the lever down hard enough. So much for the all steel head design. This could of been avoided if the company made the small switch lever out of metal like they advertised it being \\"ALL METAL\\".I wont buy any more items from West Bend...This is just another company that chose to make inferior products. They knew this would fail. My last can opener that I gave my son when he moved out was built in the late 60's early 70's {brown with flowers lol} is still running after 40 yrs. I should of painted it and kept it. Sad we cant even build a can opener these days. Throw away world. Yet we cry about landfills filling up. Whats wrong with us?"},{"rating":"1","title":"My experience differs from the Amazon consensus","review":"I bought it a few months ago and found it:a. frequently to require my placing the can into the opener 2 or 3 times before it would open.b. with some frequency, not opening the entire can.Now, all of a sudden, it stopped working.Just one guy's opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Opener -- Supreme","review":"I like the can opener for it great ability to open all types of cans. However, I think that the bottle opener is not needed as most bottles can be opened with a twist top. Also, I was disappointed that the knife sharpener is manually operated. I thought that it would run automatically off of the can opener's motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Based on the reviews, I decided to pay a little more and get this can opener.Here is what I found: Very messy - paper on cans shreds on cogwheel. Once the can is open, the magnet holds the lid - it drips all over the place. I hated it so much, I would hold the magnet up away from the can. The cutting blade jammed against the cogwheel after 3 months. I managed to get it free. Today, 8 months after purchase, the cogwheel dropped off. I'm going back to manual can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnet broke off 2 weeks after warranty ran out!","review":"Purchased from Amazon Nov. 2010 and it was great while it lasted, and attractive too. We are not big users of canned goods, so it was used occasionally for soup and tunafish cans, opened 3 cans per week on average. So I am very disappointed that the magnet part broke off just 2 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired. Ok, so technically it still opens cans, but without the magnet, lids fall into the soup. VERY ANNOYING!!!!I went to Westbend.com, and of course the magnet itself cannot be replaced, you have to get a whole new cutting assembly. Well I had paid only $24.99 (with free shipping on Amazon Prime) for the WHOLE CAN OPENER, and a replacement cutting assembly costs.....$24.99 !!! Plus $7.95 shipping!Needless to say, I'm looking for a new can opener, but won't buy West Bend again. I cannot recommend any appliance that lasts only a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATROCIOUS customer service","review":"Better hope nothing goes wrong.FIVE emails on a can openers warranty.Every time I supplied them for what they asked for, they asked for something else.Obviously their policy is to frustrate the cusomer long enough until they give up.By the way the replacement head for the opener, cost more than the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just now getting around to reviewing this...","review":"We ordered it in the cobalt a couple of years ago and it's still going strong! Attractive little devil, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart!","review":"A few months after the one year warranty was through, I was opening a can and just couldn't get it to lock on. This was a problem that had occurred now and then over the past few weeks, but was easily overcome with a few tries. This time, the blade and a little gear fell out onto the counter and that was the end of the West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener. No forcing or jamming was involved - they literally just fell out and I stood there as confused as you probably are reading this.Bottom line - it was good while it lasted, but I did expect it to last longer than this. Going forward, I think I'll stick with the manual opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"West Bend Can Opener","review":"Never received the product, so cannot tell you how good or bad it was.

It opens cans quickly. It also has a stainless and black finish that looks professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold up","review":"I really liked this can opener for tall cans. It worked very well...until it didn't. I got it in February 2011, and by May 2012, the gears had fallen out. I tried to fix it, but my \\"fix\\" didn't last long either. Nice looking, but I'm thinking I'll save my counter space and just go back to using a manual can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice can opener - while it works","review":"It is a very nice looking can opener, looks great sitting on my counter, and works great.. until it doesnt (after several months it just quit working). I was very dissappointed with its short life span, and will not purchace this brand again. I would expect more durability for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this can opener!!!!","review":"This is a great can opener!!! I have to open 2 cans a day to feed my dogs.

It's tall, so those usually hard-to-open tall cans (i.e. coffee, pork and beans, etc.) are much easier to open. It's built solid, it's attractive and it opens cans smoothely and quietly. I like how the cord actually retracts into its hidey hole... I don't have to stuff it in! I haven't tried to knife sharpener yet, but if it works as well as the can opener, I'll be very pleased. I highly recommend this appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"West Bend Electric Can Opener","review":"Poor quality; received the can opener from Amazon and lasted about a week; opened about 4 or 5 cans before it stopped working. It got stuck on a can while opening it and i had to unplug it for it to stop making a piercing sound. Plugged it back in and all it would do is buzz and not open cans. Returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked fine for a little over 3 months, then the motor gave out","review":"For $38 and change, it seems like you ought to at least get past the manufacturer's warranty period (1 yr.). This particular can opener could just be a lemon, since it's gotten generally good reviews, but I certainly can't recommend it, especially at that price. I probably could have rented one for 3 months at a cost of less than $5; buying it, I paid about $13 for each month that it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Bend 77203 Can Opener","review":"Wife says she loves it.

The easily removable cutter assembly on the West Bend solves that problem -- BUT, we note that it has a tendancy to catch on the label, and tear the edge as the can rotates. The adjustable cord storage, and lid magnet are nice features - altho the plastic catch that positions the magnet seems weak. Very nice appearance, and good weight balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"snazzy can opener","review":"If it is possible for a can opener to be an attractive item on your kitchen counter, this can opener fills the bill.

I don't think so. On previous occasions when it stopped working, I was able to get it going again. No such luck this time. It's nice looking but I give up; it's going into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"The first one that came in lasted 1 month. The threads on the geared wheel stripped out. I was sent a replacement cutting head attachment. It didn't work good either. Rather than getting a 3rd replacement head, I did some mechanical work on the head myself, and got it working to my satisfaction. Besides the cutting head being poorly manufactured, the motor will stall out on cans with extra heavy steel. And the cutting blade is dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after two months","review":"This can opener looked great and worked great for about two months. Then the screw that turns the drive wheel (the one that turns the can) striped its threads. I'm looking for another can opener manufacturer now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks beautiful, cuts fast.","review":"Beautiful design looks great and is compact on counter top. The tall height accommodates almost any can. The blade cuts heavy lids quickly (important if you are quantity cooking and have lots of cans to open at a time) and the lid magnet grips the loose lid tightly (almost too tightly). It can be awkward setting the blade on the can and getting it to grip the can, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. The cord fitting inside the base is a great feature; you can cozy it right up to the outlet if you like, or move it to a convenient place for use. Storage is a breeze without a cord flopping around. I have only been using mine for a month, so I cannot speak to its durability. It looks as though the plastic lever will last if I treat it gently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I bought this can opener to replace a Hamilton Beach (76606) Pop-Top opener that I bought on Amazon in July 2010. That can opener was a piece of junk and I wonder why I kept it so long. It only opened about 1 out of 3 cans--very frustrating. I'm so happy now with this West Bend opener. It works like a dream and is a beautiful design and color. Looks great on my kitchen counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good purchase for arthritis sufferer","review":"I open a lot of cans: I have three dogs and I cook with canned tomatoes and tuna quite frequently. Opening cans has become a painful process with several different kinds of can opener (including OXO Good Grips, which I had used successfully for many years) and this electric version saves me pain! It takes a little while to get the knack of placing the can initially, but it holds firmly while operating and lifts off the lid neatly when finished. It will also tackle tall cans, such as chicken stock or fruit juice, with ease. It looks and feels well made and tough: I will add more if I have trouble in the future, but so far I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not canned response","review":"Can opener works well and think it will hold upwell for long time.

Finally today I went to Walmart and replaced it. Sure wouldnt' recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the best","review":"Oh my goodness. It must be a crime to love an inanimate object so much. I have been suffering with a poor decision made years ago to purchase an under the cabinet Black & Decker can opener that loved to disperse the contents of the can on the counter. It finally started cutting so poorly that my depression era mentality allowed me to replace it. The West Bend arrived yesterday, right before I was ready to open three cans. It got the acid test with a 28-ounce can of enchilada sauce (okay, some of us have to have help). It didn't spill a drop. It's tall (allow 10 and a half inches) but doesn't take up that much length and width space (5 x 5 inches) on the counter. They also had me with the 70 watt motor and detachable head going in the dishwasher. Nosing around, Amazon had this in their Warehouse Deals section, where the box was supposed to be damaged (but it wasn't), and so the price was only $17.99 (new item with warranty) including super saver shipping (at $25 for total purchases)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Love this can opener - it is easy to use and clean.

I should have paid attention to the size description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking but stopped working","review":"Bought this can opener in red and it looked great on the counter.

Would not buy West Bend again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I purchased this can opener after carefully checking on the reviews at consumer reports. They rated this can opener as the best and I truely agree. I received it in a timely fashion and it works great. It's tall so it accomodates all can sizes and operates quietly.

Guess like some other reviewer said, I'll just open the drawer and open the can with an old fashioned manual can opener until I make a trip to Walmart to buy a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Impossible to Use","review":"This can opener requires far more dexterity than any simple appliance should require. Unless the can is positioned in exactly the right place, either the opener doesn't engage or the can begins to turn without actually being opened. There's nothing defective about the can opener - it's just impossibly hard to use. (I should note that I've used other electric can openers for years without any problems.) I'm just baffled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews this can opener has received - I've never before purchased anything from Amazon where my own reaction to the product diverged so dramatically from the reactions of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it zero stars if I could","review":"I have this can opener in white. I've had it about a year. At first it worked ok but within a short period of time its performance dropped considerably. The problem first seemed to be it had difficulty opening large cans. A bit annoying but not a big problem, I supported the can while it went around. Then it seemed to chew up the paper labels on the cans which would gum it up and it would stop. I'd have to take the can off, clear out the paper and try again. Then it stopped working on large cans even if I supported them. Then it stopped working on cans with paper so I had to tear the labels off prior to trying to open them. NOW I can't even get the blade to pierce the can lid. Ugh - I HATE this machine! I've never had an electric can opener that worked really well and so my expectations are not that great. Still, this one falls far below even my lowered expectations.

It is quiet, and we don't need to fight with it to get it to do the job, like we did with the two previously owned can openers. It leaves the can top clean,and does not splatter.

The nice thing is you can move it across the kitchen counter top easily to be close to you for easy opening. In addition, the cutting head is easily removable for cleaning. The cutting head will get gummed up and need cleaning for sanitary food can openings over time. I like the black finish to cover up day to day stains, but a quick wipe with a wet cloth will clean it up too.Sometimes it's a little time to get the can in the correct position for opening, but it's no problem after using it awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than any other electric can opener","review":"I gave this 4 stars. It is well built, sturdy and easy to clean. The only reason it got 4 stars rather than 5 is that the lid edges are sharp and dangerous, which is inherent to this type of opener, I would suppose. If only they could figure out how to roll the edges of the lid like some safety hand held openers. I really got this for my 94 year young father so he could open cans when I am not home.

Dishwasher cleaning for the cutting mechanism on a can opener!","review":"After a long search for a can opener whose manufacturer understands that customers want to clean the cutting mechanism of a can opener in the dishwasher, the West Bend 77205 has met our requirements perfectly. There has been much coverage of the risk of food poisoning from unwashed can openers, and the dishwasher is just the thing for that. I was happy to find this product, and it is still working well after several years of use. We do find that we need to tear a top strip of paper off of paper labels, so that the paper doesn't shred and make a mess. But that's easy and a reasonable step in the process.

Knife sharpener works very well. Can opener does any size can easily and leave no sharp edges. Not only looks good but works good. Actually does meet expectations and cleans easily in our dishwasher.

You get what you pay for! Looks great, loved it, WON'T buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After reading rave reviews about this (how can anyone get this excited about a can opener?) I bought it. After a year and a half, the blade is dull, it rips the paper off the outside of the can which wads up and lands on the cupboard, and the lid inevitably falls into the can most of the time, so I always have to dust off the lid before opening so dust doesn't fall inside the can. This type of can opener (top-cutting) leaves very sharp edges and the lid cannot be replaced on the can without falling in nor can it open pull-top lids. I won't ever buy this kind again. I had a side-cutting can opener before this (creating a smooth, non-sharp, replaceable lid), which isn't made anymore. I just purchased a hand-held smooth-edge can opener (Fissler) and will put this one in the garbage dump where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shreds can labels & paper gets in your food","review":"It shreds the top of can labels and the shards rain down into our soups, vegetables, etc. when we poured them out. We started tearing the labels off before opening the cans to avoid this problem. Finally, we realized it's easier and quicker to open the can with the old fashioned manually hand-cranked opener than to keep tearing off labels each time. So we retired this to the dreaded cabinet above the refrigerator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pile of Junk","review":"This can opener is a total pile of junk. It failed the first can I tried to open, a #10, large can of tuna from Sam's. Pretty pathetic for a $40+ can opener.

Amazon return window also close, because i bought it 5 month ago.If you want to risk your money then buy this product. I am going back to Manual Can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Review I Wanted to Write","review":"I followed all the swell recommendations for this can opener. I received it sometime in December and used it as necessary, which means not every day. Well, today, April 27, as I was sharpening some paring knives, the can opener died. Burnt to a crisp. I am very disappointed, and I would recommend great care when using the knife-sharpening feature. Of course the limited 1-year warranty is so limited that I am not about to fool around wasting time with returns, repairs, especially at my own expense. The can opener is going straight to the trash can. I am so very disappointed with this product. If you plan to sharpen knives with it, (and I am not even sure WHY a bottle opener feature is necessary), use care. Better yet, find something better, perhaps made in the USA, as this piece of junk was made in China. What was I thinking?Best,penlady (a.k.a Melinda J. Adams)"},{"rating":"1","title":"minimal knife sharpener","review":"What amazes me about all of these 5 star reviews is that there is little warning that what is touted as a knife sharpener is truly minimal. If you are looking for a robust knife sharpener that works electrically with something like carborundam wheels and can handle serrated blades; this is not for you. You may have guessed this by the price. If you are looking for only a can opener, then all 5 star reviews have meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems pretty good so far","review":"Had it for a few weeks opens can with alacrity and precision and works over most dented areas.

I had some bad experiences with poorly made openers. They just don't always work. This one works EVERY time. It is handsome and has a great finish. If you buy items on Amazon, it would be helpful to go through your history some time later and give a review after you have actually USED the product for some time. And always look for reviews that reflect how a product does over time, not just in the first few weeks of use. Great product. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Can Opener!","review":"During the past two years I purchased three can openers. None of those was a West Bend. They did not last very long and I was disappointed. I had not consulted with the Amazon reviews before purchasing them. Before purchasing this one, I read what others had written on Amazon and decided on this one because of the good reviews. It is just great. It opens cans smoothly, is very quiet, is well balanced and is very attractive. Throughout the years, Amazon's reviews have been very helpful in my deciding what to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but...cheap quality","review":"When you figure out how to use it, its ah-mazing! My hands were killing me from using crappy can openers. But the problem I have is that its quality is cheap. For the price I would expect a little more heavy duty. Should have came with multiple razors that can be replaced since over time I'm sure it will get dull. Unless you make sure to always whip up the razor after using it. The knife sharper and bottle opener in the back was a nice treat. But again its cheap quality. Every time we use the bottle opener...because of the way it is angled beer splashes all over the back. Overall we are satisfied with it! But not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I read the reviews before ordering this can opener.

This was the case with many different can openers. It became easier for me to use a manual can opener. I then started the search for an \\"Industrial Can Opener\\" that would work for me, instead of me working for it! I couldn't be happier. I hope I stay this happy after time and the blade bends or dulls. Many can opener companies force you to throw away the whole can opener instead of being able to replace the bent or dull blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Bend 77204 Electric Can Opener Red","review":"When shopping for an electric can opener I specifically was looking for a \\"red\\" one, as that is my color scheme for my kitchen. I first bought the West Bend 77204 about 2 years ago. However, the little white plastic piece which the handle is pushed down on to activate the can opener recently broke off. I know in the world we live in it seems that everything is made out of plastic that can be. However, I am wondering if the manufacturer would have replaced this with a metal piece if I would still be using my original can opener? I went shopping on Amazon and found a duplicate and purchased yet the exact same can opener. So, I guess you would have to say that I have been very satisfied with it......with only one exception.....it will break over time. We will see how long this new one lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"well designed can opener","review":"Have had this opener long enough and used it enough to honestly say \\"The best we have had\\". The unit is very quiet, opens cans smoothly, stores the unneeded length of cord in its base, has a small footprint on the counter and yet very stable. We purchased the red one and it is beautiful. Most important.. the lever that you apply pressure on, to start the opening process, is metal and will handle the force applied. The only reason we had to buy this one is the plastic lever \\"CRACKED\\" on the previous opener. This is a very good unit indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mde in America","review":"My husband and I were tired of wearing out the \\"made in China\\" handheld can openers. two in one year...Time for \\"made in America\\". and after some research, Westbend came up, so to Amazon, our favorite shopping site, and...there it was! we love it, no can size is wrong. the magnetic lid holder a plus, and it fits in the corner of the kitchen counter neatly because it is tall and slender.

The only thing I would've liked better is if the outer shell were metal instead of plastic...it still looks metallic and I guess the plastic makes it lighter in weight...but I really would have preferred the durability of acutal stainless steel.

Pleasure to use, works perfectly every time, and looks nice and unobtrusive when not in use. Very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"I also loved this can opener! Like the others have stated, it was very easy to attach a can to it, and you flip the handle down and it goes and goes. Mine fit the can so closely, it always ended up ripping the lable off the can. And after about a year of use, the handle no longer stays \\"down,\\" and therefore won't open cans unless I stand there holding the handle down till the can is open. Technically it still \\"works\\" but not as intended. Luckily it was inexpensive, so I don't feel too bad about replacing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great and Attractive Too!","review":"For a few years ago I had stopped purchasing electric can openers as I could never find one that work faithfully and/or just didn't have a nice appearance on the counter. After my boyfriend and I moved in together he insisted on an electric. So I did some research, read reviews, and gave this one a try. As I cook a good amount of Italian food, I use a lot of the large 28 oz. - 32 oz. cans of tomatoes. To my surprise not only did this can opener open these cans with ease, the magnet actually held the top of the cut lid, and held the can as well..look ma, no hands & no mess! So you don't have to stand there holding the can while it cuts and doesn't splatter the contents when it's done. I've had it 6 months now with no problems. It's easy to clean and it actually looks quite nice on the counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted 6 months","review":"I bought this can opener in December 2009 and I need to replace it. The lever has become almost impossible to lift in order to fit the can on the opener. I'm not sure what the issue is--I think the blade is rubbing up against the back of the attachment. When I do manage to get the can in place, it takes a lot of pushing to get the blade to set. While the can opener is running, it's ripping the paper on the can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working too soon","review":"This can opener just quit after several years.

Peter became sole czar when he was in his twenties and started living out all of his ambitions. He built the first Russian navy, and also built St. Petersburg, which he began from nothing. His love for war and the sea led him to fight against Sweden for a large part of his life and eventually win a long coastline on the Baltic Sea.

There is decent sharpness if you can work with the ultra thin DOF. Hand holding is out of question for the +4 and +10 macro filters. I was able to minimized CAs in Lightroom to some extent. This is ok if you just want to play with macro photography on a shoestring budget.If you can up your budget by about 200$, the Sigma 50mm 1:1 macro will probably be a much better buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corb and Loos","review":"An excellent book! Very well documented with plans, sections, elevations and models. The models are especially informative because they are primarily section models that illustrate the spatial differences between Corb and Loos.

The author is definitely a pull; I was interested in the story until nearly the end. But like other reviewers, I found that it seemed as if the author just had to finish the story and quickly wrapped it up in two pages. So you get a great and interesting story and then BOOM! Wrap everything up in a couple of paragraphs. I was also heartily disappointed in Will, the 'hero' of the novel. He was never around, and besides his great opening line, we really don't get to see much of him. I absolutely cannot understand how Keeley felt she knew him at all. She constantly jumped to conclusions about him and he about her during the 10 paragraphs in the novel they spent together.Keep your eye on this author; she's definitely interesting, but I think there has to be more."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"I love this book.

It's page after page of descriptions of furniture, rooms, shoes, clothes, food....I love all that....but this is more than even a dedicated shopper, gourmet, home decorator can take.My suggestion?

This does tingle a bit when you put it on your freshly shaved face. That may be due to the antiseptic properties of the lavender contained within the product. I just find myself applying more than I normally would apply other balms.I still would recommend this for sensitive skin, as it seems to be very gentle and non-irritating.

It took some good ideas (the Jack story is embedded in a modern-day tale of babysitting for a bratty little kid, some potentially charming embellishments on the fairy tale itself), but the writing (this thing must have been churned out in a week or two) didn't do anything with them. The songwriting and choreography are similarly uninspired.The other thing that wasn't there was quality acting/directing (for example, the giant spends most of his time standing around looking threatening).My sons (4 and 5) are big movie fans, and will sit and watch almost anything - they lost interest in this within a few minutes.

Now, cars are much more complicated, yet Haynes still tries to keep their manuals the same size. A one inch thick manual for an MGB is rather comprehensive. A one inch thick manual for a BMW is too vague to be useful. And in this case, they are trying to combine two very different models (the 3 series and the 5 series) into that one inch space. Many of the instructions given are simply generic advice that aren't the slightest bit specific to BMW.I can't see much value in Haynes manuals anymore.

Both books start with focusing on a murder, and as the events unfold, the themes and allegories offered to the reader pose a striking resemblence.

I absorbed the first person narratives of the characters (animate and inanimate) the same way one takes in a new painting in a museum or gallery - the one that stops and speaks to you from not only it's composition and technique, but from some deep emotional well of recognition.

Kind of gritted my teeth to finish it. But I know more about the inner workings of the Islamic miniaturist painter's life than I ever wanted.It's too bad that the translator didn't provide some badly needed editing. Like a storyteller in love with his own voice, Orhan Pamuk simply doesn't know when to shut up.

Too bad, because the cover is so interesting. One chapter alone was enough for puzzlement. Those of you who really liked it----------I don't get it at all. I don't care about the miniturists and their angst. Could have lived with just the love story or the mystery or the art history. I felt as if I was in a bad, confusing dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Pick It Up","review":"This book was selected for our neighborhood book club. I've been reading it for what must be a hundred days (it seems like a hundred - it might be three weeks in actuality), and I am proud to say I am on page 50. You know how people say \\"I couldn't put it down\\" when they are speaking about a great book? Well, \\"I couldn't pick it up\\" is how I will describe this book to anyone wanting an honest review. It is sluggish, overwrought, convoluted, and inconsistent - and those are its good qualities. And I, a watercolor miniaturist, should be loving this book about manuscript illuminators. Of course, I should finish all 400+ pages before I really review this paperweight. I'll do that in 2015 when I complete it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very knowlegable but Boring","review":"This was the first novel by Pamuk I read and sadly must admit that 70 pages before the end I gave up unable to read one more page - the book had defeated me.The subject of this novel was the reason I wanted to read it in the first place, because I am very interested in Islamic Culture and Art. Pamuk is obviously an expert on Miniature painting and the information he gives is very interesting, and I learned a lot from it, but it is too repetitive. His passion for the subject probaly run away with him and blinded him to the fact that he was also writing a murder- mystery and not a scholarly dissertation. I feel very stupid reading all these glorious reviews but the fact is ,that admitting he is an excellent writer, the book was too long-drawn. I will certainly try one of his other novels in the near future and hope that this time I will hit the Jackpot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Empire Fading","review":"As an author of a mystery novel in its initial release, I genuinely admire Orphan Pamuk's MY NAME IS RED. It is set in the 16th Century as the Ottoman is starting to fade from its premier postion of power and influence on the world stage. MY NAME IS RED is a complex novel with elements of the mystery and romance genres within its plot stucture. It is primarily a novel of intellectual concepts as Western ideas begin to influence intellectual Ottoman thinkers. MY NAME IS RED is a terrific book--a serious book. You should read it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feast for your mind","review":"Do you like Umberto Eco or Italo Calvino? If you do, this should be your next book. 16th century Islamic history mixed with murder, mystery and a love story. Orhan Pamuk is reaching out to his Western audience with this book. Having read the book both in Turkish and English, this is one of the best translated Turkish books."},{"rating":"2","title":"four stars, because he is going to keep writing..","review":"When I read Pamuk's this book, I thought that 'Red' is not a color itself, a color that contains all colors and a color that contains no any color (even,red) at the same time.Anybody who wish to understand Pamuk's books have to find the deepest meaning of 'being everywhere and nowhere at the same time', this can't be understood clearly and,just because of that it is pure reality. In my opinion, Pamuk's books are implying that 'There are only ways to walk but nowhere to arrive'."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs explication","review":"This book (at least in translation) is in desperate need of an introduction. The chronology at the back is not sufficient to give some unfamiliar with the history of manuscript illumination in Istanbul any idea what's going on. An explanation of the controversy surrounding art and illumination and the tensions between Eastern and Western art would have been very helpful. As it was, the bulk of the book was completely lost on me! Which means that, overall, I can't really comment on the quality of the writing or the story, except to say that I found it very difficult to read and not at all enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated and in need of a good editor","review":"I read this for book club. I liked parts of it, but it was just too repetitive and ponderous. The weight of all of the words suffocates the love story (to the extent there is one) and the mystery. I just wanted it to be over. Blech."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Is It to be a Color?","review":"No surprise that Orhan Pamuk won the Nobel Prize. My Name is Red is an amazing tale, told by multiple characters (and inanimate illustrations as well), and deals with love, loss, envy, hatred, and the intracacies of art and its creators. Breathtaking prose is alive on every page due to the author's magnificent imagination. I intend to read more of Pamuk's work, and hope it has the same effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as durable as they suggest","review":"If you have a perfect swing, then this product may stand up to \\"seasons of use, but if not, here are a few problems:- You have to choke up on your club because you are hitting off a raised platform.

This book is so full of markings I couldn't give it to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Excellent, but probably a bit beyond her intended audience.\\"","review":"I love Kay. She always seeks to make real-world applications. She does this so well for adults, I was curious to see how she would do with kids. In summary--not quite as well.This book could be better described as \\"How to teach your kids the Bible\\". It has wonderful precepts and concepts, but these will be better used by adults FOR young children than BY those children.Teens will be OK with these concepts, but I doubt a teenager would pick up a book with this cover.If you have teenagers who are really into specific books of the bible, I would suggest (for Revelation at least) \\"Dragons, Grasshoppers & Frogs!\\".For general bible study for teens, I think \\"What the Bible is all About\\" by H. Mears would be a better choice.Again--Kay's precepts and concepts here are great. They are just a bit above the level of the audience for which they are directed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great material!!","review":"I've looked all over for material for my 8 year old to learn how to read and study her Bible.

It is a cheap public domain set to which no apparent thought or care has been given.An example: In the middle of \\"Easy Street,\\" you suddenly hear a break in the music and people talking. Why? Because the producers of this collection just threw any old public domain music onto the soundtrack, in this case an old blues song in which the musicians begin talking and laughing. It's a great song, to be sure, but totally inappropriate and distracting, having nothing to do with the action on-screen and really ruining the experience.I should add that the prints look terrible.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY Disappointing","review":"This review is for the \\"Essential Charlie Chaplin Collection\\" box set from Delta Entertainment. Oh what this set could have been... The films contained in this collection are almost a complete selection of Chaplin's early work - from his first Keystone through the masterful Mutual series. Unfortunately, the prints of the films in the compilation are nothing less than terrible. Added to the misery of this collection is a terrible soundtrack and incorrect projection speeds. If you're looking for a great intro to Chaplin, choose DVDs from a producer that cares about the quality of their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"Yeah... What a disappointment.

The table has sharp corners not rounded. Beware of the fence where it is beveled - it is as sharp as a razor. I filed it down after loosing skin off two knuckles. It took forever to find a location to drill holes for mounting a power feed unit without hitting bracing under the table. I would have preferred the reversing swicth located on the outside of the base. Even hooked to a dust collector shavings build up in the base - which happens with all shapers. Unfortunately there is no lower clean out door. To remove shavings you must reach in and remove from top. To use the miter slot the entire fence assembly must be rotated. The micro adjustment of the fence is a nice touch, but had to tape the adjusting knobs to keep from moving due to vibration.The X5 performs well and is well made. It is just very poorly engineered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered either","review":"Like the previous reviewer stated, this is not the same product pictured.

However, I did read, \\"Pilgrims of the Wild\\" from cover to cover. Initially, I found this book to be rather slow and difficult to keep my attention.Grey Owl,(the author)by his own admission,interjected a plethora of words that without the constant aid of a dictionary to assertain the meanings of, would find most at a loss to understand what he was trying to convey to the reader. I found however as I continued, to be drawn in; Surprisingly, I might add, to the point that I found it difficult to put down.I couldn't wait to find out the outcome of the beaver.

This is one of my top reads of this year, and I read 2-3 books a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total disappointment","review":"After reading some very positive reviews, I grabbed this book with much expectation. What a mistake that turned out to be. More than anything else, I found the author's prose superfluous -- that the sentences were *overwritten* simply for the sake of sounding nice. Unlike McEwan or Chabon who would easily leave me in awe, I found myself bemused and cringing from the apparent \\"over-effort\\" on William's part. I also found it difficult to relate to the characters who seemed all too eager to abandon their family in the time of need. How likely was this in the first place? There were also many episodes along their adventure which were disjointed and seemingly unnecessary. And o yes, this is the first book EVER that I couldn't finish (left it with 100 pages to go)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening~~The reality of America's Lifestyles.","review":"Beth Moore has done it again! She is so God inspired. This study teaches us to follow Daniel's example of prayer and living a life of loyalty and integrity. It is challenging and convicting. I would highly recommend doing it with a group because the video portions are what gives you a lot of information to do the daily workbook lessons. this study opens our eyes to what over-indulgent and self-centered people we are. She points out that the fall of every great empire starts with forgetting the poor. Really makes you think and opens your heart to hear what God desires from each of us personally.

Beth Moore does a really great job of bringing understanding and depth to this hard-to-understand book. With her usual great scholarship and humor, Moore sure makes you understand why people are talking about the imminent return of Jesus.

The local characters were well drawn, but the underlying mystery was not very interesting. In other words, as a police procedural, it just didn't draw my attention.

Lonnie Cruse treats personal and professional loyalty issues, marital discord and health fears with a sensitivity that had me caring and hoping for the characters.

They all seemed to be described very superficially.

I hope he never stops playing: he'll be as much an American icon as Willie Nelson by the time he's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellencamp R.O.C.K.'s in the U.S.A.","review":"SCARECROW is John Cougar Mellencamp's fifth album overall despite his name change with its predecessor UH-HUH. The title is used for the opening track RAIN ON THE SCARECROW. It's a story about the reluctant surrendering of farmland. GRANDMA'S THEME is sung by,I believe JCM's grandmother on a personal cassette recording(in mono),until,nearing the end,a replacing guitar. SMALLTOWN was the biggest hit from this album. JCM tells about the small Indiana town he was born in. RUMBLESEAT and LONELY 'OL NIGHT were hits also. R.O.C.K. IN THE U.S.A. is a tribute to major black music artists from the 50's and 60's. THE KIND OF FELLA I AM is a bonus track unavailable on the defunct LP. All the other songs are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic of Heartland Roots-Rock","review":"\\"Scarecrow\\" is, quite simply, John's best work and the place to start for the casual fan. While \\"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\\" is both over-the-top and over-played, \\"Small Town,\\" the title track, and \\"Rumbleseat\\" have stood up well over time and are now heartland-rock classics. And even the lesser-known tracks yield a few gems (\\"Justice and Independence\\"). \\"Scarecrow\\" should, quite simply, secure John Mellencamp's legacy in American music."},{"rating":"2","title":"At His Best","review":"This is (Most Likely) Mellencamp's best album. \\"Uh-Huh\\" and \\"American Fool\\" are very good as well and everyone should have all three, but start here first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs From The Midland","review":"Scarecrow is the most politically charged album of John Cougar Mellencamp's career. \\"Rain On The Scarecrow\\" is about the plight small farmers face. His compassion for the farmers led him to start Farm Aid with Willie Nelson & Neil Young. \\"Justice & Independence '85\\", \\"Face Of A Nation\\" & \\"You Got To Stand For Something\\" all take a social commentary slant. The album is also ripe with down home tales from Mr. Mellencamp's life. \\"Small Town\\" was a huge hit and tells of the little Indiana hometown, \\"Minutes To Memories\\" is about an old man he meets on a bus and \\"Rumbleseat\\" is about being young and in love. \\"Lonely 'Ol Night\\" sounds like it could have been released in 1967. \\"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\\" is a tribute to the sounds and groups he grew up with and is a great song. Scarecrow spent half a year in the top ten, spawned three top ten hits and made Mr. Mellencamp the Midwest answer to Bruce Springsteen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Ever","review":"John Mellencamp is one of the greatest singer/songwriters ever. This is his best album. But All of them are good. I've followed John from he early days playing around central Indiana in the 70's to his making big in the early 80's on through his second greatest hits cd. . His music always says something. Just listen to this disc and its 's there. Songs like Rain On The Scarecrow or Small Town or ROCK In The USA. I highly recommend this and all of John's albums. This is one of my all time favorite albums ever. Great midwestern rock and roll at it's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands next to Springsteen as seminal 80s roots rock.","review":"Although this might not be the optimal place to start appreciating Mellencamp's music, this is definitely his most fully-realized work. The songs have a thematic unity that isn't present even on Bruce Springsteen's (more popular) Born in the USA LP. Mellencamp has been swimming in stylistic circles ever since, albeit to sometimes excellent results. He never could be as scathing as \\"...Scarecrow\\", as careless as \\"ROCK...\\", or as anthemic as \\"Small Town\\" again. The songs are sparse, fast, and poignant. Each song bears a distinct and memorable harmony, but the CD is totally cohesive. Occasionally overwrought, though uncomplicated, Scarecrow is an album by a true artist in perfect harmony with his genre. With this CD, Mellencamp reached his apex as a songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the under dog.","review":"After a decade of being ignored by critics due to a string of albums that could barely disguise their overwrought Sprinsteen influence, Mellencamp finally got recognition with 1985's Scarecrow. Returning to his Indiana roots, Mellencamp crafted what was basically a concept album about rural life and the hardships that it often entails. The sentiment is captured best in standout tracks \\"Rain on the Scarecrow\\", \\"Minutes to Memories\\" and the anthemic classic \\"Small Town\\" but most of the stuff here is very strong and this record proved that Mellencamp was a valid and important social commentator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth 10 Stars","review":"This is my all-time fave album of John Mellencamp's. Every single song is a hit and this cd stays in the cd player,never get tired of playing it. This was the first of John's \\"American Heartland\\" type albums(the second being the great \\"Lonesome Jubilee\\") and if only he would do just one more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gob-Foot in Mouth Disease (Clean)","review":"Ok, this is a really awesome cd. So why am I giving it 1 star? BECAUSE THIS VERSION IS CLEAN. TAKES THE WHOLE POINT OF THE ALBUM AWAY! DON'T BUY THIS JUST GET THE UNEDITED VERSION. GIVE UP THE GRUDGE ON THIS CD [...] EDITED THE WHOLE CHORUS! TAKE MY ADVICE AND JUST BUY THE ORIGINAL CD DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS .....CLEAN..... CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"man faces the result of his own neglect","review":"Very well filmed suspense/horror featuring the great Joe Don Baker! As usual humans are making life easier on themselves by getting rid of the minor responsibility of keeping a dog. This time poor dogs are getting ditched on a small island as families relocate to the mainland. By no fault of their own and with no food, they start attacking livestock and people as they rampage through the countryside. Warnings are not followed and true to life, ignorant people dominate this film and Joe don is the only one with enough sense in his head to be a survivor. Although not an action film, Joe Don carries the film on his capable shoulders facing danger as desperate, neglected, and crazed dogs lurk in the shadows. The ending does justice to man's best friend by showing not all of them were man eaters. Director Robert Clouse does another great job here as he normally does when not directing kung fu movies. 16x9 dvd-r picture and sound is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry Brik II for Dry and Store (hearing aid equipment)","review":"When I searched for these batteries for the hearing aid \\"dryer\\" I was pleased to find them with the first search. The order was placed and within three days they were delivered to my door. It certainly was a painless, efficient and perfect way to make the purchase. I would do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps hearing aids working","review":"Hiking and gardening in Texas heat and humidity can be hard on delicate electronics. I use these desiccant blocks along with myDry and Store Global II Electric Hearing Aid Dehumidifier TRG-AAevery night. The audiologist said my hearing aids were surprisingly clean. The only negative is that the manufacturer keeps changing the design. The latest hasn't any red marker keeping track of the block's remaining capacity. On the other hand, that feature didn't work so well. I'd agree with the manufacturer to mark the date on it when you install it, and replace it two months later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry-BrikII","review":"There are several sources for the Dry-Briks. Anyone who has heaing aids and uses an overnight drying system probably knows that. I chose to buy from Amazon because they have the best price. As far as the product goes, it does the job: keeps moisture down and lasts the full 2 months as far as I can tell. They are the brand recommended by my Audiologist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good niche product","review":"If you have hearing aids that you want to hopefully maintain in operating condition and for a long time, then these blocks along with the Dry and Store should help. Just replacement blocks for the main unit. Haven't had any issues with the replacements. Replace these or your hearing aids. Preventive insurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry and Store is Audiologist recommended","review":"I have been using Dry n Store for 4 years, always with these Dry-Brik blocks.My audiologist strongly recommended this system to protect my very expensive hearing aids. The Dry-Brik Blocks work perfectly with the unit. Be aware that the timing stripe on the package in no way represents the actual desiccant condition in the block. It is nothing more than a timing device that starts running as soon as the seal is broken, even if the block remains in a sealed container.I have a humidity controlled home, so I leave each block in the unit for three months rather than the recommended two. No problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desiccant blocks for hearing aid care","review":"This product is one of the few things that works as advertised. With the high cost of hearing aids the price of these desiccant blocks is a tiny amount of money to insure the full lifetime use of your hearing aids. Used with the Global Dry Store machine has been very sucessful for the last four years that my wife has used these products. After checking prices we bought them on Amazon.com. Amazon was a lot cheaper than any where else. Remember you must remove the moisture from your hearing aids or they will fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad Amazon Carries This","review":"I've been using the Dry-Briks and Dri-Brik IIs for a number of years now, and they have really protected my hearing aid. My ears are quite tropical, and I've had difficulty maintaining hearing aids because of the moisture, but this product does the job. I used to have to call the manufacturer to get the Dri-Briks, but Amazon makes it easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry Briks","review":"arrived fast, well packed.These keep my hearing aids working well longer before I have to send them off for cleaning or repair"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Awful","review":"First of all, this is not ambient music. It's not even music. Sounds from xylophone and percussion, along with sampling of sounds (bird noise, waves, other stuff) are combined arythmically and experimentally to create...well, nothing much. I can't imagine why you would prefer to turn this on. It provides a limited amount of atmosphere, but no real mood. It grabs your attention occasionally with a mix-up of sounds, but then doesn't reward you should you concentrate on it. Avoid this one, unless the above description is your bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very High Quality Subwoofer","review":"The Cerwin Vega CLS-12S Powered Sub is a great subwoofer. I needed a good sub to round out my home theater and for music. Cerwin Vega has been around for a long time and has always been known for producing a lot of bass. The sub is very heavy and well constructed. The amp is the same brand that most of the high end sub manufacturers use. It has lots of power and is very adjustable to room and listen environments."},{"rating":"2","title":"R134A Manifold","review":"Glad I bought it. Saved me a ton of money rather than taking my aging cars to the shop everytime I need to recharge the AC system or evacuate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tight","review":"The sound quality is fine and the price is quite reasonable, but the headphones are much too tight for me, and I have a relatively small head. There is no way to adjust the tension and they need to be tight since they don't rest on the top of your head, but simply press upon your ears to keep from sliding down. Better headsets (of all kinds - look at what airline pilots wear) have a pad on top.Not much fun to wear for extended periods; I'd look at someting else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably my worst purchase ever -- 1 star is too much!","review":"This headset is 100% useless. It is so excruciatingly uncomfortable thatyou will not be able to use it for more than 2--3 minutes unlessyou are a major masochist.It is difficult to imagine how anyone can make something so bad.I honestly believe they tried hard to design their worst product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Great, A Few Problems","review":"I bought these headphones mainly because of the microphone. I use them for online gaming and such. The microphone has PERFECT sound. When I talk, I sound clearer than anyone else. And they even cost less than many other worse microphones.As for the sound quality, it is great. My brother has a pair that cost $120, and we agree that mine sound better. I can hear even the most faint sounds in music.There are a couple of small problems. The cord is about 10 feet long, so it is always getting in the way. Also, for the first few weeks, they really make your ears hurt. This goes away after a while, though.I would certainly reccomend these to anyone who needs a good headset for a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little uncomfortable, but otherwise very good quality unit","review":"After about 30 minutes it gets a little uncomfortable, could do with better padding. I'm not a big headphone fan anyhow and will soon try a USB phone instead for VoIP. (Update - I did try a USB phone but the headphones are in fact superior in quality)The inline mute and vol control is very nice, the mute button flashes to remind you its on, nice. (Update - Recently I have had issues with the mute light not showing at all - looks like it may have developed a fault). The cable is a good length. Installation on WinXP couldn't be easier, just plug it in, no software supplied or required.The microphone could do with coming half an inch closer to the mouth, I have to turn the mic volume on full to get others to hear me clearly, this causes a hiss due to having the volume control so high. To be fair I am a low talker.JP"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, Doesn't Last","review":"While initially pleased with the microphone design (smoothly moves out of the way when not in use) and sound quality of this headset, I found it had two major failings.1) Extremely uncomfortable.2) Fragile wiring. Failing after only a couple months of use.I would not recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable!!","review":"That's the first thing I thought when I put these things on. After an hour or so of wearing them, I must have consciously adjusted them at least 15 times because of the pain. Another problem I've encountered is that the mute button will periodically decide to activate itself. The blinking blue light will catch my eyes and I'll realize the headset decided to mute itself again. Whether or not this is because I wasn't using the mic, or because I had it in the up position I don't know but it should not go mute unless I click the button to make it mute. Another problem, that's actually a major problem in my book, is that I can't use the adjustable volume control on the headset. So, I'm forced to use the volume control either in Windows or in the game I'm playing. As for the sound quality, I would say it's so-so. This was an impulse buy for me and I'm regretting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider Carefully","review":"I had this model about 6 months, light use (1-3 times/week) before it died. The mic would no longer transmit and the sound remained stuck at max. After removing/re-installing the driver it was still the same, which was no real loss since they were not very comfortable in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great until it doesn't","review":"I really really liked these phones and have recommended (and given as gifts) these to family and friends. After about 15 months it quit working; why? I don't know, but when plugged into the USB port the blue light flashed a few times and nothing more. Perhaps because I left it plugged in just about every day, who knows how many hours (lots!), whether in use or not. Anyways, considering the great quality of sound and comfort, I bought another set, however I disconnect them when not in use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get these \\"premium\\" ones","review":"don't get these \\"premium\\" ones. I've bought a lot of usb headsets, and this particular model is annoying because (1) the earphone parts aren't deep enough and so your ear gets squished, and (2) that dumb medallion with the volume clicker on it dangles... truly annoying. get the standard logitech ones, silver colored -- they fit and don't have that volume medallion thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within one year of purchase.","review":"Recently, these headphones began to transmit only half of the sounds sent to them. Generally, I don't mind when electronics break, it's just something that happens over time. However, considering that I purchased these headphones less than a year ago, I'm disappointed that they malfunctioned so quickly.This product worked quite well until it prematurely broke though, which is why I haven't given it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very tight - gives headache & mic stopped working","review":"It is a nice looking headset and I generally like logitech products. But it is really tight no matter how I tried to adjust. Mic stopped working after about a week. Maybe it is just a bad set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headset Review","review":"This headset works well. It's great with the sound canceling quality and people on the other end of the conversation seem to hear me well. The only negative is that the headphones feel large (if you are used to your iPod headset). But they cover your ears well and drown out other sound. All in all I am satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great till the volume piece fell apart!","review":"I really loved these headphones, quite comfortable, but the volume dongle in the middle of the cord fell apart on me; it is a point of failure, and once it is damaged your headset is useless.

I also received my order 2 weeks prior to the scheduled delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Lightly used for a year and the screw fell out with no way to fix. I don't mishandle my electronic products but this one was a lemon. never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but hell to wear","review":"OK, Logitech makes great products...with at least this particular exception. Granted, these are almost as comfortable as the headset which comes with Dragon Naturally speaking, but that headset is worth perhaps $7.00. Nice sound, but they are the least comfortable thing I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality Headset","review":"I had to purchase this after buying another logitech headset (not USB) after finding out my power mac g5 did not have powered audio jacks, meaning the standard mic mini-plug headsets won't work. The usb headset worked like a charm. Audio quality and clarity leaves something to be desired, but that's why I have a pair of studio quality cans. Mic quality is excellent. My only reason for not giving this 5 stars was, for me, (a proud wearer of glasses) I found it uncomfortable and at times painful to wear the headset for extended periods (2+ hours)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"I have owned 3 pair of these headphone in the past year. I should have given up after the first pair. If you turn your head too quickly you will rip the wires out of the ear piece and bye bye head set. If you lose track on how the microphone is turned you may turn it 360 degrees too many times and trash that wire. Logitech makes some good stuff but not Head sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PC Headset that works great but hurts like hell...","review":"This headset has crystal clear sound,a good mic and is simple to hook up to your pc(simply plug it in to the usb port).The big issue with this product is that if you use it for more than 20 minutes your ears feel like they are on fire.I use this product while playing multiplayer games online and i have to say that this headset pinches your ears so tightly that you have to take them off often just to get the circulation back in your head.If you want to use this product for a long period of time at your pc your ears WILL hurt.If you dont mind the constant ear pain then you should buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headset","review":"Great headset and works in conjunction with camera. Very confortable to wear, sound and voice quality very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good at the price.","review":"Ok at the price. Much cheaper than local Computer outlets charging full freight.

The sound is good, the cord is plenty long and the installation on my Mac was a breeze.

I would recommend these to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound but Uncomfortable","review":"The sound on this headphone is great although I haven't tried the use of the microphone. My only problem and a big problem for me is that after having the headphone for sometime, your ears start to hurt. Not sure why the design is the way it is. I used to have a BOSE headphone w/o a microphone and they were very light and comfortable. I know BOSE is BOSE but Logitech could have spent some time on the design, not just the technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"I bought this for my new Skype service because it was Skype certified and from Logitech.

This is a good alternative to a regular PC headset as you do not have to reach around to the back of the PC and plug in the 2 audio cables like a regular headset.

I am happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have a huge head and they size is still great.

This is a great product. The microphone works like a champ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst headset in the world.","review":"I bought this for $40. It was most waste of money I could have ever imagined.An internal component broke within a month. The left ear was inaudible.The microphone was nonadjustable.It was way too tight and it hurt so much. It was ridiculous. Might as well buy a pair of speakers, glue them to a hat, and rip the microphone from a laptop. That would have even been better.The headset does not conform around the hears.It's flat.My friend who had one also described it as: \\"Putting your head in a vice\\"The sound was great, but it was so uncomfortable.I don't think anyone could wear it well.I'm being generous.Get the Koss SB-45. It's dirt cheap, comfortable, and the sound's clear. The microphone on SB-45 is good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"My view after a few hours' use.","review":"The sound quality, in and out, over Skype seems fine. My big problem with this item is that the earphones themselves press on my ears in such a way that they exert pressure on the temples of my eyeglasses. At first, like a tight shoe in the store, this doesn't register, but after a couple of hours the discomfort is intense. I don't know how to deal with this. I am considering donating the headset and going from scratch to find something that will work for me without hurting my ears and the sides of my head. I tried bending the plastic band, but it seems to want to come back to its original shape. I'm considering going to ear button speakers and a completely separate mic that I could mount somehow on my iMac. I'll do more experimenting, though, before I toss these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful uncomfortable","review":"The sound quality is good, but these things are really uncomfortable. I've tried every possible adjustment, but no luck. The problem is the earpads are made of some sort of tough leather-like substance which is not soft to your ears. I paid full price for this at Best Buy, and I'm finally emerging from denial and realizing these aren't going to work.I think you can probably get something else at this pricepoint which will be more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!","review":"I thought I bought a \\"premium\\" headset for my Skype conversations... Not so!The sound drops constantly, sometimes it's on the left side sometimes on the right side. Then mute button suddenly stopped working and nothing will bring it back to life (...again bad wiring/poor product quality). Also, I find this headset to be very uncomfortable to wear for longer periods of time.When it works the sound is great for both headphone and microphone. Problem is it doesn't work consistently! Hence, it's useless and I have to say: Don't by this product.UPDATE: After my initial review I complained to Logitech and they promptly sent me a new headset free of charge... Great service, however, on day one using the new headset I have the same problems! The sound drops when you accidentally touch the cable. Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dies after three months","review":"I'm disappointed that the headset stopped working just the other day. I bought one (obviously used) in May, but it smelled so badly of cigarettes I became nauseous. I immediately contacted the seller who was kind enough to send another pair. I think I received this set in early June. I had it plugged into the USB drive and the PC told me it could no longer recognize the hardware because the USB end went south. I tested other devices on the USB port and it was fine, so it was definitely this particular set that had gone bad and not the port itself.Unfortunately, despite the good sound and relative comfort, I would never purchase a Logitech headset again because the quality is lacking in the most basic way possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this Logitech headset","review":"I had bought the headset 6 months ago and had to throw it into trach bin 1 month later.

Anyway, I won't buy any product from Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great unless you have ears.","review":"To truly appreciate these headphones you must modify the way you listen. First off, cut off your ears. Why you may ask? Because you will want to after having these things on your head for 2 to 3 seconds. Other then that the audio sounded as though your speaking from inside a colon. All in all these things probbaly taste better then they sound. My ears are still bleeding. Also if you want to use this with skype, don't use it with a beta version as it auto modulates the sound so that your friends can barely hear you if your voice is even a octive above a whisper."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely not naccassary","review":"actually I bought it so I can improve the hearing with clients that were to call me via the computer.

I don't wear glasses, though I do have one earring on the top cartilage of my left ear, both ears hurt badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inferior microphone","review":"I have been using Dragon Naturally Speaking for a little while now, and having real success with it. I have been using the headset and mic that came with it, that is an analogue model that performs pretty well. I have read many experts saying that USB headsets and mics are far superior for such, because they get around some of the inherent limitations in the sound card and analogue system of the mic input for computer.So, I have been trying this model of Logitech. It works so poorly it's sad. The unit seems well built and I like Logitech (e.g., the best remote control for powerpoint presentations on the planet is made by them). But this mic (on any settings) is much inferior to the lower budget but decent analogue mic system that came with Dragon Natually Speaking.There is a model 7100 from Andrea that many speak highly of that I am looking into, but this Logitech model is just not usable for this purpose. At least, not on my computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ears feel crushed","review":"Now you may be thinking that it may be that my head is too big, but I assure you that it is of average size ;-)These headphones are like cheap airline headsets and regardless of sound quality are very uncomfortable for more than 5 minutes of use. The Speakers rest directly on your ears and the padding is no where near deep enough to ease the discomfort. Very cheap build indeed ... they look cool but don't be fooled!Also, for those of us follically challenged, the hard plastic top bar is also uncomfortable.I guess this is the problem with buying on the Net, you can't just take a real look at them - otherwise I would have stayed clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the 250","review":"I bought a Logitech 250 to replace my Ipevo USB Skype phone and it was a great improvement. Others said my voice was much louder and clearer, and a problem I had been having with my voice suddenly getting too quiet for others to hear went away right away. So I recommended the 250 to a friend, but the store he went to was out of them so he got a 350. He's very frustrated, as the mute button on the headphones is very sensitive and very easy to trigger, which happens regularly during our conversations. He's anxious to get rid of it and get the 250 as soon as possible. The 250 is quite comfortable and works superbly for me, by the way. For Skyping, at least, the volume control of the 350 is useless, as is the mute button, since one can hit Mute on the screen at any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad headset","review":"I bought these a couple of days ago and loathe them. They sound great, but if you can't wear them it's useless. After about 30 seconds your ears start to ache and don't stop aching until you pass out from pain. Logitech should have tested them on people not rodents. I don't normally bother with reviews, but this product is such a stinker I couldn't help myself.I'm taking them back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"This headset has a little dongle attached to the line that lets you adjust the volume. This seems to me to be of limited value, if I'm sitting at my computer anyway why not just use the software volume control? Anyhow, the dongle appears to be operated by a ghost. Even if you're not touching the thing it makes the volume go down to 0 while you're using the headset. Judging from another review here plus a search of the web it is clear I'm not the only one to have this problem. Stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I ordered this to replace a Plantronics headset. I returned them because they are uncomfortable and the volume/mute switch is very hard to use.The fit is very tight, with very little padding on the ear or over the top of your head; if you are a 'conehead' these might actually work for you, though. :) I adjusted these to the shortest they could be but the speakers still sat below the bottom of my ears, and I'm no tiny person.Combining the mute and volume control is a great idea, but the switch rarely worked properly. You push the button squarely in the center to mute, push up/down to in/decrease volume. Every time I tried adjusting the volume, I would mute the microphone, and vice versa. Perhaps my set was defective but taking 5-6 'pushes' on the +/- side of the switch to adjust the volume up/down 1 notch is unacceptable.The best thing about this headset is the USB PnP ability.I'd suggest you avoid these and purchase the Plantronics DS-500 for about $10 more, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin cable above the in-line control","review":"Cable goes thin after the in-line control, and this limits life. The H530 has no in-line control and the cable runs thick all the way to the headset, a much better design all round."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and uncomfortable.","review":"I've used Logitech products for years now. These were very disappointing. The ear cups are round and don't fit over your ears properly. The wire from the USB connector up to the inline volume controller is thick, but then they go to a cheaper thin wire from there up to the headset. The headset worked for about a week then it started shorting out where the thin wire comes out of the control. I finally got so fed up with the intermittent connection, I broke open the volume control (it's glued together, btw) only to find VERY tiny wires that were shorting out and so small you could never solder/rewire them yourself. They need to use more solid components and wire that is thicker than a human hair. Terrible design. Don't waste your $. Go for the MS LifeChat LX-3000 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy! Its JUNK!","review":"This headset worked GREAT for about 3 months. It was the best headset I ever had. Then I didn't use it for about 6 months, and when i plugged it in, it no longer worked. How can something that hadn't been moved or touched in 6 months magically stop working? It wasn't even a year old. I recommend checking out Plantronics, their stuff is better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for recording","review":"I've bought this product to record audiobooks for the public domain. When I record, I get cracks and squeaks in the recording that make it almost impossible to sound anywhere near professional. It might work well for Skype, but don't use it if your trying to record anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece Of Garbage","review":"I bought these for my teenage daughter to use on Internet voice chat. Within a month the flimsy wire started fraying and I knew it was only a matter of time before it cut out and stopped working completely. But even before the thin wire gave way, it started cutting out and crackling within a few weeks of use. Dropping them on carpeting causes the earpieces to snap out of their holders. It was only a matter of time before the plastic snaps broke completely. The flimsy wire also has a twisting problem over continued use. I should have returned them while I still had the chance. After a few months of use they were totally shot. You would expect to get more use out of them for the price. DO NOT under any circumstances buy these for children. They will destroy them in no time. They are not designed for any type of robust use. Even for adult use, you will have to treat these gingerly to get any prolonged use out of them. A total waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset","review":"I bought this headset after reading a number of reviews, both professional and amateur, for use with speech recognition software.

The head set worked, actually, but it was so heavy , awkward and uncomfortable to wear that I returned it to Amazon. The redesign of the head set, they have added these fake leather bits around the ears and these HUGE HUGE ear covers that did nothing but make my ears sweat (I didn't realize my ears sweated before I had these God-awful headphones on) and in general they screwed up a really good product. I really do not reccomend them, except perhaps as torture devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"too tight","review":"While the sound is just ok, the headset is far too tight on the ears.

Sound is fine (i use hd sound card) so most headsets i use sound good!but these, like many others i try just really press on my head and the pain begins (after an hour or so)(my head is small) I think its because the ear cups are to close to the speaker? not enough air between the 2 so the ear touches the inner part? I went through 2 of these (one was my ladys) the problem is the thin string like cords! they ball up and crimp like mad! and one side quits working! and the mic button turns off or on with hardly touching it! thats a pain! these are great looking but really not so good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but broke quick! 2 Times!!","review":"I purchased these in the fall and they lasted until January - the right ear quit working.

Never really used it much and had it on the shelf. Installed SKYPE last week (2/2010) and brought out the headset. Worked for 10 minutes and died. Sometimes Windows 7 sees it, sometimes (mostly) not. Not even shown as a product in Logitech [...] forums there show a LOT of unhappy people that bought this. STAY AWAY !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable. I wish I had listened to other reviewers","review":"I wish I had listened to the other reviewers on how uncomfortable this headset is. Maybe it's fine if you have a thin head, but I think I have probably an average sized head and it is extremely uncomfortable to wear for any extended period of time. Having said that, I really only use this headset for Webex meetings and the sound quality is good. And I'm told that the mic on the headset works well too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sound But Uncomfortable","review":"Good headset for $15 but I wouldn't pay $65 for it. It has good sound and works well with Skype but the ear cups are uncomfortable. The headband is not padded either, it's just hard plastic, but you get used to it. The cord has two lumps in it, one with a mute switch and one that has no controls, just says Logitech on it. The cord that goes from the USB plug to the first lump is very stiff for some reason, which seems odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, should cost 5 bucks","review":"I bought a pair of these to use for playing games with friends n family. They are terrible.* Makes my ears sweat and hurt after 5 minutes. The cheap plastic foam is hard and provides no ventilation. Uncomfortable.* Volume control dial is cheap, causes all sound to disappear from one ear. Slightly moving the wire will cause sound to get knocked out of one ear. Pain in the butt to use.* Plastic connector hurts after a while - no cushioning.Basically, this headset sucks. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not stood test of time!","review":"I agree with all comments about sound quality etc but having used them extensively for quite some time the sound cuts in and out between left and right channels. The problem relates to poor anchorage where the cable enters the headset. It would be reasonably easy to rectify if you could take them to bits but it does not look like they are built for that. Final opinion...very dissatisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! What a Painful Purchase","review":"After reading numerous reviews that mentioned these headphones being uncomfortable, I decided to take a risk and buy them anyway. I needed to get some good headphones for podcasting on my iBook and these fit the bill. Based on the price and my brand loyalty to Logitech I figured it couldn't be that bad, right? Wrong.Pros:-Plug and play with Mac works great-Affordable-Decent sound qualityCons:-They most definitely hurt my ears, almost right away too! READ: Not Comfortable!-Feel like they could snap in half-Non-foldable makes storage a painI do not recommend this headphones, I'm returning them this weekend for the Plantronics DSP-400 USB headset. I can deal with a little bit of uncomfort, but these headphones just plain hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful gaming headset","review":"This usb headset is exactly what I was looking for. It is easy to use, and the sound is clear coming and going. You plug in the usb cable and you're ready to go. There are controls on the cable to change volume and to mute the microphone. I have been able to hear everything very clearly, and I have had no complaints of garbled sound on my end. I definitely recommend this headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I have four of these, one for each member of my family. Primarily, we use them for listening to DVDs and Internet broadcasts on our computers, as well as for Internet telephony. I even got one for a partner who uses it for speech recognition on his computer. I think they are terrific-high quality audio and an accurate, non-distorted microphone. Although one of them was defective (the volume control did not work correctly), Amazon's response was first-rate. They replaced it with no fuss, muss or bother (or cost, for that matter, since they paid for the UPS pickup). I might still get a smaller set for travel. Also, the cord is a little skinny and so is more prone to damage. But otherwise, a nice unit and a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headset for the Money","review":"USB headsets are the way to go. This particular one is very good. Don't worry about it being too tight as some of the other reviewers have said. I have a big, no, make that huge, head and it doesn't bother me. Sound quality is good. Very good product for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Setup and Install","review":"I really like the simplicity of this item. It uses the basic plug and play system... plug the headphones into your computer and you are ready to rock!

Sometimes I have noise problems with the mic."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily broken","review":"I bought these headphones and was quickly disappointed.

SO that being said, it has a chance of falling a whopping three feet onto a carpeted floor, and these things cant take it. The actual mic part of it has fallen off everyt single time, reguardless if it falls or not. the wiring inside has a nasty habit of coming undone. the hear padding is not secured well, and can EAsily come off.Botom line, save yourself the time and trouble. DO NOT get logitech headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, not such a great fit.","review":"I've purchased two sets of the 350 headset and both users, myself and a co-worker, have the same comments.Great sound and mike, seem like they could use slightly larger earpads, and the mute button can get turned on accidentally too easily.

Straight out the box, plugged it in. Vista recognized it as a USB audio device, but the sound was never redirected to the headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and unreliable","review":"As other reviews have mentioned, the headphones aren't very comfortable. The padding is thin and the ear cups provide pressure all over the ear, instead of around the ear.The headset performed well for a couple months, and then suddenly the left channel went silent. After testing it on multiple machines, I found that I could get the sound in the left ear to reappear momentarily if I jiggled the cord just right. It was obviously a poor connection somewhere inside the left ear, which apparently had worked its way loose despite the fact that the headset wasn't abused physically in any way.This sort of poor quality is not something I expect after paying almost $100. Look elsewhere if you want a USB headset that you intend to use for any length of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, will ultimately stop working","review":"When I bought these, I saw how the big cord goes to the USB adapter and then the thinner cord goes from the mute adapter (the round thing you see in the middle of the cable) to the headset. My first reaction was, wow this thin cord is really flimsy and the connection looks prone to failing. Sure enough, 6 mos later or constant but careful use, that thin cable has started to come loose from the mute adapter and now its unusable as i get constant static. A shame as other wise a fantastic set of gaming / voip headphones but do NOT buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good technology, poor design","review":"Technically, these are good headphones. The sound quality is nice, although the bass is perhaps just a little strong. Microphone comes through clear and works very well.Setup is very easy; doesn't require any drivers or anything of the sort. The only thing you might have to do is disable the mic output in your volume control panel, to avoid hearing yourself in the headphones.Unfortunately the comfort is really a problem. Most overhead headphones have oval earpieces that fit over the ears. These have round earpieces that end up not fitting over your ears. The result is that the edges of your ears are pressed up against your head, making them quite painful to wear for more than half an hour or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible in so many ways","review":"Excruciatingly uncomfortable. These crush the cartilage of my ears, and are so snug they prevent air from circulating in my ears. After a few hours of use, it takes nearly as long to recover and air out my ear canal once they are off. It also digs into my skull and leaves a ridge on my head. I am actually concerned they started to rub my hair out.Silly design. The placement of the mute button is right where you lean into your desk. I mute it very frequently by accident.It started making horrible static after a couple weeks of use. Annoyed everyone in chat. Then after a month, it stopped working.If anyone buys this product after reading these reviews, I would be astonished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Until it Breaks","review":"I bought this headset to use with Skype, and for that purpose, it was alright, except that the controls on the wire are very poorly designed. It's very easy to put yourself on mute and not realize it. (I've had people hang up on me a few times because of this.) The volume controls are also on a hair trigger, meaning that my system volume will go up to max or down to zero almost randomly.It only lasted a few months before becoming unusable after long and gradual decline in audio range and quality. However, it's not hard to fix if you're so inclined.I ripped mine open to find a really shoddy soldering job, and with some tape and cheap fixing, it works enough until I can afford a new headset, but it's still on its last legs.If you purchase this item, pay attention to any deterioration in audio, so that you can return it if yours starts dying like mine did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky, but good sound quality","review":"I'm using this with a Lenovo T42 laptop and mostly for Skype. The installation was a breeze, I just plugged them in and it worked. The sound quality is very good. But, they are very bulky headphones and are uncomfortable for long-term wear. I wouldn't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"Not only was this headset the most uncomfortable headset i've ever owned, but it also stopped working properly after about a year of owning, maybe a little sooner, its the only headset i've actually broken out of anger of how worthless it becomes. Back to the discomfort part, it's not that it didn't fit nicely, but there wasn't enough cushion for the ear and after a short while it begins to hurt in a very discomforting way, and you constantly have to shift it around so it stops hurting that one part of your ear. There are plenty of other headsets that probably do not have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile and uncomfortable","review":"This is my second and last pair.

Padded ear phones. Frame not too stiff.- Noise canceling microphone seems to work.- Long cord.- Both Windows XP Home Edition and Mac OS X 10.4.7 recognize the USB hardware without difficulty.- Audio quality is good.- My recorded voice quality is fine.- My voice quality while talking over Skype is okay (as decent as my connection can be).Cons:- I expected the microphone recording volume could be louder. Might be solved with software that improves gain.- As others reported, I had difficulty with the inline volume control. The mute button is very sensitive to touch. +/- volume control works fine. The blue mute status light stopped glowing after a week of use -- less than 5 hours overall. (Mute still functions, but I no longer have visual indicator when mute is active.)I think it's a decent investment for the price range ($30-50)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and very painfull to wear","review":"When I first started using this headset I was impressed, Sleek overall apperrence nice volume/mute control, and great overall sound quality. But unfortunatly thats where it stoped (at least for me). I am a avid gamer so the headphones are alomost in constant use and I run a lan center so they get moved around alot. These headsets are also very uncomftorable after say 4-5 hours of use they put alot of pressure on your ears as they are a pretty tight fit. but comfort issues aside; after about a month the small rubber connections on bolth sides of the volume control began to seperate exposing the wires. Then the sound began to drop out intermitantly on bolth sides almost randomly. Then the Mic stoped working alltogether. It turned out that the connection inside the volume/mut control had become broken. I imagine that if you are not constantly using this headset it would be great. But if your going to be using it constantly I would look at other options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discomfort and headache","review":"I use this headset for dictation software (Dragon NS) today.

I thought I would get some sound accuracy improvement by paying more money but it is not necessarily the case here. Too bad the Labtec's mic is a bit broken (due to misuse) and Logitech bought out Labtec.Bought it with a rebate so ended up costing around $25.

I hear things going on behind and around my character that are in the distance or right next to me. For the price, these are terrific and I am very glad I bought them.The cord is about 8' long.

Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last time buying logictech","review":"I had bought this headset about two-three months ago and about a amonth ago I had noticed that the cord was starting to twist its self inside the cord casing. Eventually it ended up twisting so much that casing had broken open and eventually the wires to the mic snapped. This is the second head set from logictech that I have owned that have done nearly the exact same thing. When I had first noticed the cord twisting I would hold it an let it on wind but that only kept the headset alive for a little while longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"The USB plug on this head set sticks out enough to assure you will break it within 6 months and have to throw them away after turning you head accidentally yanking the connection. I then got wireless - and then one side went out on those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound","review":"I returned it immediatley. I am using Vista and this mic clearly stated that it is Vista compatible. It souned great for a while. Then that same night, it went completely static. Only some things could be heard. Tried it on my XP machine and everything worked so much better. Dont know what caused it to go bad though. Worked fine on Vista then sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I have bought many reusable sticker books for my daughter (a huge Strawberry Shortcake fan), so I thought this would give many enjoyable hours of playtime! WRONG!! The reusable stickers stick to the dolls OK, but when you try to put them back on the page they came from, they don't stick well at all!! So you end up with pages of bent and mangled stickers. The opposite happens when you try to use the reusable stickers on top of the cutout clothing! They stick so well that they tear off the surface of the cutout clothes!! I just wish once someone at the company that makes them would actually sit down and try to use them!! HORRID!! Try one of the \\"Sticker Stories\\" books instead!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to use","review":"I LOVED the clothing they made for this!BUT it doesnt work well at all!!!!Half the stickers ripped just trying to remove then fromthe page, they really wernt reusable. while you may be able to peel some off, you had nowhere to store them and they would be wrinkled or torn from removing them!The dolls didnt even punch out well! useing a scissors is a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extensions","review":"Op/Tech System Connectors, Pro Loop - 14\\" Webbing (9 - 12\\" Each side)did not extend the strap at all, same as the ones that came with the strap"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flag","review":"Aside from this one, I bought 2 other flags from other Amazon Marketplace stores on here on the same day. Out of the 3 flags from different people, this flag was the only one that was square/symmetrical, had great color, and no defects at all. It looks great hanging in our Taekwondo school. If you want a good quality flag, get this one. I was very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suze Nails it","review":"Suze just kills it in this presentation. I read the book before and thought it was good. Suze brings emotion into the equation, and this is very important to investing. Her advice is very simple, but as she says, \\"some of the things that are very simplistic, hold all the value in the world.\\" I really like when Suze discussed Law # 5. It was very motivating, and her speech at this point was just flawless. I felt her passion. I think the DVD is good for people who invest and even people who want to learn how to be a public speaker. Suze has executive presence like no other. If you read the book and watch the dvd, you will be able to \\"keep what you have, and create what you deserve.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Defected clipper","review":"Purchased this because my vet uses Resco brand clipper and it's American made. I try not to buy China or Taiwan made products. I was excited to find American made Resco nail clipper, BUT it didn't meet my expectations. It pulls my dog's nails because there is a gap between the blade and clipper and the blade is dull, the springs make noise when pressed, an overall poorly made product."},{"rating":"1","title":"278 pages to nowhere","review":"I like Martin Caidin's aviation books, but he's not much of a fiction writer. I purchased \\"Three Corners to Nowhere\\" about two years ago, but despite several attempts I have never been able to finish it; it just doesn't hold my interest.The protagonist is a super sleuth who implausibly holds many qualifications (expert pilot, insurance adjuster, accountant, engineer, lawyer, martial arts guru) who speaks several languages and carries a pocket pistol with a muzzle velocity of 5,000 feet per second or something equally crazy; his main interests are wisecracking and chasing women.The plot develops slowly and the book doesn't really go anywhere. Martin, stick to what you do best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Caiden!!!","review":"Another fascinating tale from an American master storyteller... one of my favorite all time writers (second to only John D MacDonald).

But overall, Que has done it again...set the bar at a higher level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Was And Is An Angel","review":"Best Tracks:Disc one: Sugaree -- puts you in an ecstatic trance. Catfish John -- Fantastic.Disc two: After Midnight/Eleanor Rigby/After Midnight -- arguablythe best extended guitar solo of all time...for many years asought-after bootleg, now presented in crystal clarity.Disc three: Mission In The Rain -- classic Jerry ballad, sweet andplaintive with gorgeous guitar.All other tracks are good, but the above tracks are the ones I program."},{"rating":"2","title":"JGB before it was Jerry Garcia Band","review":"Some of the review talk about how this is \\"not as good as the Dead\\". Well it's different because it's not the dead and it's not what became JGB. This is Jerry with a basic band creating HIS own sound and not being a part of the Grateful Dead. I was not a big Jerry fan until the 10th time I saw the Dead, did not understand what all the hype was about. Sometimes it takes that special Jerry show (with or without the Dead) to make you a true fan.I had a bad bootleg of this show and it was incredible. This new recording is amazing and captures Jerry with alot of raw energy and it shows. If you are a Jerry or Dead fan this is one of the 10 best I've ever purchased (note: I don't have all the Dick's Picks, but I have about 50 shows on tape/CD). Do yourself a favor and buy this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice jammin'","review":"I bought this based on how I liked another JGB cd (welcome to our world) and am pleased with the sounds on this one. Garcia shows his genius on these extended jams. I get an upbeat feeling while listening to this music. Even the synthesizer music, which is corny in the context of current synthetic sounds, adds to the groove. All three discs are great, especially if you are looking for some great guitar jamming sounds. If you like this one, I encourage you to take a look at the JGB's \\"Welcome to our world\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE DEAD than some dead","review":"Jerry Rules, His Genius shines through on this well recorded 3-disc CD. Robert Hunter featured too.Twist of FATE (Dylan). All great, but especially 1st disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"heavy album","review":"Hellbound by Warlock is their heaviest album to date. And as a metal connisuer i know what good 80's metal is! not faster pussycat thats not metal! if you want some hard hitting metal buy this record this is the second album by Warlock and lead singer Doro pesch is really on in this one if you want to know more about warlock see my review on triumph and agony. doro pesch is the queen of metal not lita ford! although lita is a good artist. doro has kept it metal after warlock split up in the late 80's her first solo album was force majuer or something like that i havent bought it yet but its on my list. and shes still going strong, not to mention she in her mid to late 40's. I love metal and if you love metal you'll love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warlock's weakest album","review":"That I usually associate this album as the filler in between Burning the Witches and True as Steel underscores its limited appeal. Altogether, it is an inferior continuation of the first album, crispier in production (which is common with most band's second album) but still weakened by the general song uniformity. Earthshaker Rock and the title cut are decent songs, but the second side is largely forgettable. Overall, the album's most memorable element is that some songs feature a lengthy solo (or more accurately two, as there are two guitarists) after the second chorus with no vocal following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"They Think\\"","review":"Wow...a power metal band with the aggresivness of fight. Rob himself would have to admit the carring of a tradition.

It's well played, well produced and every song sounds EXACTLY the same. Oh boy!Seriously, this CD is a delete bin affair of the worst kind. The performances are top notch and the songs are boring as hell. After three listens I simply forgot every song as it left. Blindingly fast, blindingly without purpose.These musicians obviously have talent, and from time to time this CD makes perfect sense with some catchly melodies or lyrics. But seriously...it's something that history won't bother to remember. It's pandering to their audience which is good I geuss, but those of us on the outside will find nothing new or even fun to look into."},{"rating":"1","title":"By the book metal","review":"A completely cookie-cutter, paint-by-numbers metal album.

I was expecting spaced out tinny punk rock, but instead was blown away with strong guitar backed with unusual drum beats.
