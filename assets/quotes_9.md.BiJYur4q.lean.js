I was so disappointed in the quality of what I received. Of the 5 pounds, 2 pounds was of yellow pineapple that was inedible and had to be discarded. The pith of the pineapple was used rather than the good part of the fruit. There was no way I was going to use that in these high quality expensive cakes. Also, there was a lot of syrup in each tub, so I definitely did not get a pound of fruit. I ended up having to replace the bad pineapple at a local grocery store for twice the cost.

Is it a coincidence that Iko Iko later made it into the Tom Cruise produced Mission Impossible 2? Etta James' classic is probably owned by half the world already. The rest are nice to have in as background filler while you're doing something, like writing a review for instance.I bought this CD, however, for the two songs \\"On the Road\\" and \\"Vegas\\" composed by Hans Zimmer. The first is a unique, airy instrumental that's slighly reminiscent of Jan Hammer's Miami Vice scores. The latter conveys power and excitement and it enhances the movie so masterfully that I believe it was the breakthrough hit that helped make him one of the most prolific and sought-after movie composers today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cruisin' Music","review":"There's alot of goodies on this soundtrack, new and old. \\"Iko Iko\\" and \\"Nathan Jones\\" I remember from the 60's, these versions are just as good as the originals. \\"Dry Bones\\" by the Delta Rhythn Boys is straight out of the Ink Spots era, by now everyone should be familiar with \\"At Last\\" by Etta James, it's been used in a few commercials.

He was very cruel in his portrayal of Grissom, implying through the writing that he was at fault for the sinking of the capsule, when there is a good deal of evidence against that. Plus, I read an interview with Shepard where he said that it would have been nice if Wolfe had interviewed teh astronauts themselves before writing it. Yes, that would have been nice. But, like I said before, it is an entertianing book. But if your looking for facts, there are much better sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolfe's witty look at test pilots and astronauts","review":"This is a witty, fun read about the early space program, the Mercury 7 astronauts, and Chuck Yeager.

This movie brings back lots of memories on where I was when Alan Shepard made his first trip.

Beginning with the stories of pilots like Chuck Yeager, the man who broke the sound barrier, the book develops into the grand drama that was the space program and the race against the Soviets to the new frontier, chronicaling the pilots who took such great risk in participating in it. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book. A great work that I highly recommend to all readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"the right stuff","review":"\\"The Right Stuff\\" by Thomas Wolf details the manned space race between Russia and the United States. It focuses on the United States' effort to put a man into space. The story of the first seven American astronauts is told, along with a description of test pilots, scientists, and others involved with space flight during this time. Tom Wolfe accurately depicts the personalities of the cocky test pilots and their change throughout the book, where in the end, the end of being the heroes of the Space Race. The Space Race was, in fact, a vital part of our history and is the reason for some of our major technological advances today. This book is a great read and will really give the reader a taste of the time and views from Americans about this Race at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic book, but Kindle edition riddled with errors","review":"I've owned \\"The Right Stuff\\" for over thirty years in print form. I downloaded the Kindle version from Amazon to take with me on business trips.To my disgust, the Kindle edition is abysmal - clearly, Amazon or whoever came up with it ran the print edition through a character-recognition software program and utterly failed to copy-edit it afterwards. The number of errors is alarming, and it is only because I've read the print version so many times that I was able to recognize what some of the errors meant in the text.It's a shame, because this book is a fine, fine book and one of my all-time favorites. Shame on Amazon or the publisher or both for charging $10.00 for a flawed, poorly-edited copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, KINDLE version FULL OF ERRORS","review":"Great book, completely flubbed by Amazon. Is it so hard to run a spell check on a Kindle manuscript before publishing it? This book is filled with ridiculous OCR screwups: letters cl being turned into a nonsensical d, for instance. And there are a lot of them. Amazon needs to fix this book and send us all an updated version that doesn't hurt our eyes or our brains."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Book","review":"What Wolfe always does well is understand his characters motivations. Al Shephard - Smilin' Al of the Cape/Icy Commander - , Chuck Yeager, John Glenn \\"the flying monk\\" - are all sliced and diced by Wolfe's samurai sharp, if not unsympathetic, sword. A brilliant work on patriotism, heroism and American masculinity, with none of the dull twaddle that characterises Wolfe's later works (particularly Man in Full)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy e-book (The Right Stuff)","review":"Shame on the publisher (Picador/Farrar, Straus and Giroux) for the sloppy production of this ebook.The Right StuffTo care so little about the quality of their product is an insult to both the author and his readers. Don't buy the ebook version until the publisher makes it right.The original book, as written by Tom Wolfe, deserves 5 stars. It's highly entertaining as well as informative. In this review, I'm only rating the quality of the ebook which has at least five dozen scanning errors, some of which are confusing and make it impossible to figure out what the author intended. Until the publisher fixes it, spend your money on something else. There's plenty of quality ebooks available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolfe is not in his element","review":"Wolfe says in the preface that it is a pity that there is no literature to describe the experiences of real fighting men, and so he set out to make some. Wrong. There are excellent books written by the men themselves who have been there--pilots, army men, scouts, you name it. However, these books are not of the sort read by the audience of the New Yorker. Wolfe has created something on the subject that is palatable to those folks, and with that they are impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"all i know is","review":"the remaining of the REAL Mercury 7(Grissom who died in the fire before this book came out) called this book \\"fiction\\" and that Wolfe took too much license with this story.

It is full of cliche' and most of it is based on narrow shreds of fact. I only read Wolfe's novel because in my former profession (USAF Pilot), I kind of felt like it was required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very important book","review":"I just re-read the Right Stuff and I found myself thinking that in this age of cut-throat politics and CIA directors caught in trysts, how important it is that we should still have national heroes. The astronauts of the Mercury program may not have been perfect, but their heroism speaks for itself. And Wolfe's writing style is unmatched. I cannot think of a better writer to emerge from the New Journalism movement. The Right Stuff is clearly his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Had To End Somewhere","review":"This is a page turner, par excellence. Most media descriptions of astronauts and space exploration are bland at best. This is history as narrative and you never want it to end. The astronauts themselves come to life as never before or since. Mr. Wolfe captures the era perfectly. It is as if you are right there with the whole cast of characters in the space program. This is exciting stuff, unlike the endless boring coverge of space exploration on television that dominated the era. This is the real stuff. Mr. Wolfe's masterful description of what it is like to land a jet fighter on a aircraft carrier will stay with you forever. Sadly, The Right Stuff has to end, and Mr. Wolfe admits that he could have continued on and on but had to end it somewhere. I am sorry that was true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon, please fix these mistakes!!!","review":"Actually, I haven't read the Kindle version and thanks to the people who explained about all the mistakes, I'm not going to!

This is one of the only nonfiction books I've read that reads like a well written novel. I will be diving further into the Wolfe cannon because this book was so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"God! this is a good one!","review":"I have not much to add to the other reviews, just wanting to support with five stars.This book is about pilots, herostuff, the dawning of the space age and is very well researched: if you want to know about fighter pilots lives, their training, the first space modules etc, this is one to buy. And above all, it has an amazingly smart style, combining humor, facts, drama and tragedy to one big true! comedy about...the right stuff. You will laugh and learn at the same time!One of the best books I have read so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"I read this book more than 10 years ago, but it's still one of the books that has made the strongest impression on me. One of the things that really struck me, was the way he describes how the test-pilots (headed by Yeager) are first laughting at the \\"astronauts\\", and then are mesmerized by the fact that Shepard, Glen & co become heroes. To me, this visualizes the insanity in how the american people put them on a pedestal and considered the astronauts the greatest americans (why be modest? PEOPLE) ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could I not have this in my collection?","review":"I think you only have 2 reviews because there is no question about this book - never having read this is like never being introduced to Dr. Seuss as either a child or a parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not completely truthful","review":"Tom Wolfe did a great job of making the history of the space race come alive, but bear in mind as you read it that some of his opinions are a tad biased. He all but blames Gus Grissom for blowing the hatch of \\"Liberty Bell 7\\" prematurely, when he was never proven to have done anything wrong. To be fair, Wolfe should have included the evidence that when Wally Schirra blew the hatch on his flight, he got a bad hand bruise, something Gus never had. Still, the book is very entertaining, and very funny, and I recommend it hightly. Still, supplement your reading with \\"Moonshot\\" by Deke Slayton and Al Shepard, and \\"Carrying the Fire\\" by Mike Collins"},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie Proulx does it again!","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book a year ago.

I have read all her other work including the \\"Shipping News\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough and Raw - Just like the Land is","review":"A short story collection that sure deserve attention. First of all, the writing is absolutely impressive. It takes you to Wyoming, takes you there pretty close, beneath an open sky of all possible colors and hard, sunburned land that turn's into dust, when your boots hit it. The stories are refreshingly weird (in a positive way, understood?!), grabbing the reader by his collor and tearing him out of everyday life .... Her [Annie Proulx's] work is a gift. Reading a pleasure, time spent in a purpose, like \\"the path is the destination\\". Mighty good read with a literary quality to it that makes your heart pound take up a step and your eyes moving faster over the pages, anxious to devour them. Howdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"brokeback ....and others","review":"This book was very entertaining, and it was interesting to see the differences between the screenplay and the story of Brokeback Mountain. i really enjoyed all the stories, once i got past the grammar and dialect issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassment to Wyoming's culture","review":"I expected something completely different. Its apparent that this writer has no heart for what country people's values are really about. I read three stories and all have some sort of perverted sexual concept in each. Not all country people are really like this... I was really let down, thinking I had found a good novel written about country living, instead just another dark and sex-realated novel. The stories are great at thoroughly degrading the people of Wyoming. In fact none of her stories really connect with wyoming culture at all.Second, I found it difficult to capture the feeling of the people in the stories. Her writing is good, but she lacks talent at creating and expressing interesting characters, especially the western type. I just couldn't get the feel of them. Maybe its because most all of her characters are dark and twisted. These definitely are not the country people that I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, ugly, should be thrown away at once!","review":"The story (I only would waste my time on the 1st one) is depressing, filled with ugly images and stupid people -- bears no resemblance to any real Wyoming people or attitudes. I have lived here over 60 years and find both the people and the scenery uplifting and positive. She should get a better attitude about life before she vomits her vile thoughts on an unsuspecting reader/listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brokeback Mtn. as is SHOULD be experienced...","review":"Annie Proulx's stories are a brilliant application of economy and authenticity. She uses not one word more than she needs to paint the sparse landscape of life in the west with the grit and realism of it's cast iron characters. I ordered this because I wanted to read the story that inspired Brokeback Mountain. This collection includes Brokeback and 10 other raw and riveting stories. I ordered from the \\"used\\" inventory--it arrived in good condition for a price that makes me feel good about passing it along to more short story enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like Proulx's prose","review":"I took this book and Into the Wild by Krakauer with me on a 3 day backpacking trip in the mountains. Read Proulx."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboys Rock!","review":"This is a tremendous collection of stories. The prose is magnificent; Proulx continuously finds new ways to say common things (my favorite: \\"his mouth seems to have been cut with a single chisel blow into easy flesh\\"). What's more, as amazing as the prose is, Proulx is just as concerned with story (a concern too often lost among contemporary writers); these stories rock with happening! Standouts: \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" (a frank glance into doomed cowboy love); \\"People in Hell Just Want a Drink of Ice Water\\" (poetic in its depiction of the brutality of life); \\"55 Miles to the Gas Pump\\" (probably the shortest serial killer story ever told). Proulx's stories deal with the harshness that is contemporary life -- but always with an edge of humor, a touch of the whimsical (a sort of Ray Carver in Big Country). All are excellent, deserving of your reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tripping Over Words","review":"Proulx is the Fellini of novelists and short story writers. Her use of language (her starnge and sometimes invented vocabulary, her colloquial syntax), her curious characters and barren locales, all sugget something of the Italian master of surrealsim and desperation. Proulx's characters inhabit a nether world of lost hopes and fragmented dreams, of broken families and broken souls. At the end of a Proulx story, one never says 'aha!', but rather 'huh?' She tests her readers at every turn and assumes we are up for the game. While I found myself bumping against some of the rocky outcroppings of her prose, there were also times when I was subsumed by her magic and was taken for a ride to a planet resembling Earth. All that is missing is love. Perhaps that makes Proulx more a realist than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"annie takes a little time off","review":"Don't expect anything like previous Annie Proulx works here. This collection of grim/goofy tales has all the staying power of a candy bar. Nowhere is the depth and complexity of her earlier works. \\"Close Range\\" left me with the feeling that it was written over a couple of weekends (spread far apart), and did not receive the writer's full effort. Her readers deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked and Awed","review":"I was surprised to find that a middle aged woman from the North West would write the way she does. It was refreshing and a little shocking at times. It was definately a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"feh","review":"I enjoyed \\"The Shipping News\\", and think Wyoming is abeautiful state, so I thought this might be a worthwhileread. In my opinion, it wasn't. Ms. Proulx seems to dislikethe people, leaving no doubt everyone in Wyoming is aredneck, and every family abusive....Not bad writing, butdisappointing content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted","review":"Our book group picked this book. A couple people had started reading the book and shared at the last meeting. One said that she had a hard time getting into the book and was only on the first story. She felt that there was too much time spent building the characters. The other women who had started reading the book said that was what it was about, building the \\"character\\" of Wyoming. That was a great way for me to start reading the book. I couldn't wait to finish one story to get to the next. Then I read People in Hell... the rest of the book was hard to take. I found the book depressing, twisted and dark. Rough Wyoming. This book will provide plenty of discussion for our book group though. I guess this goes to show that as long as one can write well, you can write about anything you want and get good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult read - at best","review":"Maybe I'm just a simple guy. I don't want to have to concentrate when I read something for pleasure. I just want to... read it. If you skim as you read you'll miss out and have to go back.Also, her subject matters were distasteful, i.e. the first story about a skinned animal and the final story about two hicks who find out they're homosexuals (I didn't just ruin either of these stories for you.)In most of her stores, there's no real \`end'. They just sort of go along, and then she gets tired of writing and puts \`the end' and goes on to the next one.Not a satisfying read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Wyoming, we know better.","review":"This sordid, dark, ugly filth is not the Wyoming my grandparents hailed from. I have known many persons from ranches in that state and they are hard working, forthright and resourceful. They may not be saints but they are nothing like this mess. Spend your money on something else, like a nice travel guide to Wyoming and go see for yourself what a rigerous, diverse country this really is. There are fewer people in Wyoming per sq. mile than there are in Alaska as well as a far more diverse wildlife population. The folks there have better things to do than live like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":".....yawn....","review":"I bought this book to read the much-lauded \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" on a dare from my nephew who calls it \\"Brokebutt Mountain.\\" NO we are not anti-gay so don't start! This book is simply not in the same league as \\"The Shipping News.\\" Proulx does not know my neighbors in Wyoming and it shows in this collection; she changes views of us westerners faster than Michael Jackson changed noses! I just hope she leaves Montana alone...."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like hopeless..","review":"This book is for you if you enjoy hopeless and depressing. Also, if you have the ability to enjoy the twist of words without being wrapped in the subject matter. However, if you believe life has a purpose you'll find yourself wondering why you read it. I do believe a talented Preacher could take these stories and say \\"This, my beloved, is why you need God\\" :)I know the stereotype currently is that educated people love Proulx. It's only the uneducated buffoons that can't \\"get\\" her that don't like her.I guess I'll sit over in the uneducated section. ;-) At least we have better books on the shelves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why has no one mentioned that Close Range is funny?","review":"I have read every book written by Annie Proulx and almost every review available; few of them make much of the humor in all of her books, and Close Range most especially. Read this book for all the reasons mentioned in other reviews-characterization, poetry, description of place, humanity--but read it also for her ability to make you laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proulx has a way with Words","review":"I found Proulx's interpretation of Wyoming ranching life as harsh, grim, stark, disturbing. It's as if Wyoming was left to nature alone - not much influence from \\"civilization.\\" Her writing is in a word: FLAWLESS. She is one of those folks who can offer a man's whole life story in a sentence or two - with out really missing anything. Truly a gifted writer. I love her style, though the stories were often heartbreaking and grey. In fact, I could not picture any of the stories in color - they were all shades of sepia and grey. On an odd note, Proulx really is a funny one about characters' monikers. A super quick read, but lasting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"flawless","review":"It's rare that I use this term to describe any literature. I'm picky--so for me there's always something wanting in most works. The only flawless piece of literature I've ever read is Marilynne Robinson's second novel, Gilead. Annie Proulx, however, has proved herself to be absolutely masterful, I must say. I have seen two film adaptations of her works, but these are the first pieces I've actually read. They are relentlessly depressing, these stories, which can sometimes mask their perfection, but each story is a miniature sample of writing at its absolute best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unabridged CD is Not","review":"There is a common problem when ordering \\"unabridged\\" CD versions of short story collections: the individual stories are not abridged; BUT, the audiobook is abridged--by leaving out some of the stories. Amazon lists the CD version as unabridged, although the CD case itself does not use that description. The table of contents for the Close Range hardcover edition lists the following 11 stories: The Half-Skinned Steer; The Mud Below; Job History; The Blood Bay; People in Hell Just Want a Drink of Water; The Bunchgrass Edge of the World; Pair a Spurs; A Lonely Coast; The Governors of Wyoming; 55 Miles to the Gas Pump; Brokeback Mountain. The \\"unabridged CD\\" edition has only 7 of the 11 stories in the book: The Half-Skinned Steer; A Lonely Coast; People in Hell Just Want a Drink of Water; The Mud Below; The Blood Bay; The Bunchgrass Edge of the World; Brokeback Mountain. The 1 star rating is for bad marketing and does not reflect an evaluation of the audiobook itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is the only story worth your time","review":"Bought this after seeing the magnificent film, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". As a longtime reader of western fiction and non-fiction, I was disappointed with the other stories in \\"Close Range\\". How many times can a writer put down the stories of ignorant and/or down-and-out folk in short-story format without becoming repetitive? Proulx does it 10 times in this book, but finishes with the intense and heartbreaking \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". The reader cares about Ennis and Jack-- a feeling for characters not experienced in the first 250 pages of this story collection. Worth $14? You decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"grisly","review":"I read and loved Shipping News but was not prepared for this book. I read 3 stories, each more grisly and disturbing than the last, and decided to write a review as a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading this book, I have now given this author three chances to \\"wow\\" me. I know I am in the minority here, but I do not like Ms. Proulx's style. Her characters are unappealing and a waste of time to read about. Her stories are loaded with violence and abnormalities.

Writing such as Ms. Proulx', which combines such wonderful feel and imagery, giving one a sense of presence, can be insidious when combined with plots that are too gritty, too macabre, too out of synch with reality. You wind up reading the whole thing, hoping that just one of the stories will make it all worthwhile. In this book, it never happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"These short stories are are tough as the Wyoming land they're set into. Tales of rough lives at the edge of solitude and despair, unforgiving charachters in an unforgiving land, where even rusty abandoned tractors have a soul, and sex comes with no frills attached. Brokeback Mountain is by no means the only noteworty story in the set, and surely one of the mildest in many ways.Buyer beware: living in this Wyoming is not for the faint of heart. Reading these lyrically written stories of despair and vast loneliness is not either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cowboy Cartoons, Nicely Rendered.","review":"It's clear that Proulx is a skillful prose stylist, and some of the stories are surprising in their plots, but her \\"cowboys\\" seem like paper doll versions of real people--viewed from outside and ultimately stereotypical. I don't care if it's bleak or if it shows Wyoming in a bad light; I just wanted to believe in these folks. But despite her fine sense of detail, the characters make me think that the author's view is mainly that of a tourist--an ethnographer who has the details right, but draws the spirit of the characters from careful study of \\"Gunsmoke\\" or some such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proulx's writing is superb, but most characters are losers.","review":"If you like stories about deteriorating human lives that leave nothing in their wakes then you'll like \\"Close Range\\". I'm an avid Proulx fan, but I got a little tired of the \\"no hope\\" situations played out over and over in these stories.I can't seem to stay away from her vivid images though. Pictures are painted that call up the exact smells and sounds of all the characters' pathetic adventures throughout. You'll think you are there--disgusted and morbidly curious at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redemptive writing . . .","review":"I finished Brokeback Mountain last night and wondered what moved me so. Was it just sympathy for the two men? Was it their hard life, there turning away from a love that would have been unthinkable in their day? Was it the soaring prose of Mrs Proulx? Of course, the answer is a bit of all these elements.But is there something more . . . so much more? Something about innocence lost, wasted youth, the tender regrets of middle age, and the inevitable battering by life, leaving us hollow. . . and a bit sentimental for the fading memory of youth . . . when all was possible. This is the transcendent message of Brokeback Mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for kids on the go","review":"These are a good idea for travelling, they are a reasonable size for drawings and fit an airplane tray table almost perfectly.

This product's utter failure at what it was designed to do (play cds and tell time) is both amazing and apalling. The top that encloses the cd while its playing (when that works) is horribly mis-aligned. It does not close properly. Also, the digits irritatingly blink on and off. It loses time...up to 40 minutes later than I had set it originally! Right now (after 3 months of tolerating this) it no longer will turn on to play my cds or to turn on the radio tuner. Although the digits still appear (blinking), it doesn't change the time at all. When I try to reset the clock, the digits turn off! Thus NOTHING works right on this thing. It is utterly useless.

Managers hate workers, workers hate managers and nobody seems to understand or talk to anybody else. Author William Isaacs believes that's because people don't communicate very well. Companies that succeed have made effective, positive communication part of their culture. Dialogue is a two-way street and negative, ineffective dialogue can kill a company's prospects. Isaacs, a corporate consultant with a doctorate in philosophy, uses a very un-businesslike style to convey his ideas.

Alongside the inner rim of the mug, there is an area where water will collect when you invert the mug. So, if you end up rinsing the cup and putting upside-down, you'll basically have old watered-down coffee collecting and drying.

Some are a bit hard to view, but if you're a true crime buff, or just interested in the seamier side of L.A. history, this book delivers the goods!Blanche and Schreiber cover a great deal of ground in a highly entertaining manner from the origins of forensic science and the L.A. County Coroner through a number of high profile cases, and many not so well-known (at least, to me). Fans of films that explore L.A.'s dark side - like CHINATOWN, L.A.

It is so thin that it is kind of, well, film-y.The early history of L.A. slaughter and retribution has some interest, since most retellings of L.A. murder start much later -- with the bombing of the Times offices, or later. After that, it's a retelling of well-known cases (like the world needs a few more paragraphs about O.J.) combined with what appear to be rewritten press releases from the coroner's office.There was a story to be told, and it peeks out of \\"Death in Paradise\\" here and there.The authors are semi-literate."},{"rating":"1","title":"False right from the get-go","review":"200 deaths a day?

The pictures are great (some are pretty gruesome, though) but what I really liked was learning about how the coroner solves cases, especially in the old days. They didn't have modern techniques like DNA and they had to rely more on witnesses and real investigation. Some of the cases were never solved, though, which is a shame because nowadays with all the high-tech stuff they probably would be.This is a very, very cool book that I would recommend to anyone interested in Hollywood history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually flawed","review":"Based solely on the chapter dealing with the 1947 slaying of Elizabeth Short, known as the Black Dahlia, it's clear that the authors have not gained access to L.A.

I stopped eating fast food altogether and NO SODA, NO ICE CREAM. I still drink full beers and the occasional bottle of wine. I have lost weight VERY slowly because I am not exercising, but my energy level must have tripled, without one exaggeration. Finally, i decided to buy a juicer and this book.

If you have kidney disease high levels of potassium could be dangerous. Too much potassium in a normal person is potentially fatal. This diet and the therapy is akin to treating your body like a sponge, that absorbs nutrients, supplements, and then purges it all out, over and over.

What conclusion do these officers jump to and investigate exclusively? Time travel. So with this underlying ridiculous plot, the novel delves into the troubled boring lives of the officers and two other mini-stories which will eventually undoubtedly involve the time traveling exploits of the victim and murderer.

Thus the hit piece in the Washington Post. Please disregard.\\"Vaccine A\\" is a well-balanced account of the development of an anthrax preventative gone awry.

It's great when I'm playing games on our living room PC and I want to wander over to the kitchen to get another Sprite or something, but bad when I want to plug them into my portable CD player or even my laptop, as I now have 14 feet of cord I really don't need.I agree totally with many of the other reviews.

I was looking for her take on it all.This book surprised me because it is so well written.She provides an excellent insight as to the struggleswhich the female beat writers faced. I would recommendthis to any young aspiring female writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book!","review":"All Joyce Johnson does in this book is drop names about people she knew and complain that she was born in the wrong generation.Don't waste your money on this book. Just go to your nearest old folks home and hear about how they \\"knew\\" JFK. It's free and doesn't waste 5 hours of your life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading","review":"As a long-time reader of Beat literature, and as a man, I must say that Joyce Johnson's take on those heady, wine soaked days of poetry and madness is absolutely as good and as necessary as anything Kerouac or Ginsberg or any of the more famous (male) crew ever wrote. For my money it's right up there with On the Road.I guess I've read this book three or four times now and it never gets old.I also recommend Ms. Johnson's novel, In the Night Cafe, another skillful invocation of the Beat period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written and Gripping","review":"This memoir recounting a young woman's years spent in the inner circle of Jack Kerouac is well-written and gripping enough to hold its readers' attention. Placed firmly in the center of the Beat Generation, her story teems with indecision and insecurity, the desire to get up and go, leaving responsibilities at home to see the nation and experience life.-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martini Shaker","review":"Great shaker I love the color. This is my second one my first one my boyfriend accidendtly dropped and broke it I loved it so much I got another one right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but broke","review":"We bought this for our son in law's birthday. It was big and beautiful and went nicely with the martini glasses we got to go with it. He loved it! However on the 2nd round of drinks- the shaker broke in his hands, nearly cutting him. So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easy","review":"This shaker sure does look beautiful but it breaks really easy. I got it for a gift and had it for about 2 weeks before I used it and it fell over (on the counter) and shattered. Now, it may have been full of ice and the time (so really cold), but that shouldn't effect a martini shaker! I really think this kind of glass was made for looks and not function."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I had only read the small print...","review":"I'd give this product the following, if I could.Beauty: 5Leak-proof: 5Wear and care: negative 2.I have a rule. If it cannot be on the top shelf of a dish washer, I won't buy it or use it. First wash, regular mode, away from anything that might jar it or clank against it -- and a shaker with a thickness of almost 1/2 inch just broke. I picked it up out of the dishwasher, attached the lid to it, and the bottom just fell out and down on my foot. Huh?Again, I should have paid attention to the fine print -- hand-washing recommended. Sorry, but I like my bar equipment squeaky clean, and hand washing just doesn't hack it.Again, considering the thickness of this shaker (and I was truly amazed), it still boggles the brain -- how could it have broken like that?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as a California Vacation","review":"A wonderful way to introduce your kids to the wonders of California.

And if it plays at an IMAX near you, DON'T MISS IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"California adventure","review":"This was an excellent DVD. My children and grandchildren enjoyed this fast paced beautiful California adventure with all the wonder that makes California a beautiful place to live or visit. From the soaring sky dancers to the beautiful redwoods this is a DVD to see. Watching how they photographed these sites was just as interesting. This DVD was purchased at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre product","review":"I compared these to the Sony noise cancelling headphones (MDR-NC5).I found they didn't reduce background aircraft noise as muchas the Sony did, and they were much less comfortable. Whenyou are wearing headphones for an entire plane trip comfortmatters quite a bit (to me at least...).I'ld pass on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I just purchased these headphones and I'm not at all happy. They have a cheap plastic look & feel, the sound is worse than what would be included with a $20 Walkman. The noise cancellation feature works...as long as you don't mind replacing ambient noise with the annoying hiss of white noise that the headphones produce. I'm not a negative person and have no gripe with Panasonic, I'm just calling it as I see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt the burn","review":"I have done other dance workouts in the past. My favorites were a series of belly dancing videos also by Natural Journeys. I picked this video for a change of pace. After I did it once I was hooked. My legs, obliques and butt all had the warm \\"thoroughly worked out\\" feeling. I love how everything is broken down. It's easy to follow along with but you will feel it. For a low impact workout, it really makes you sweat. There is no jumping or moves that will stress your knees. The moves are graceful and easy to follow along with. Kili will have you feeling like you've been doing hula for years. I've recommended this video to all of my friends, including those with mobility issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun exercise","review":"I am a native hawaiian. I moved to Louisiana with my husband about 14 years ago. I've since packed on about 30 lbs...yup people, the food here is that good. Purchased this video to aid in my weight loss and because I know that Hula is fun. It's a good video just wish I had the motivation to do it more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real workout","review":"As a beginner the workout program really made me break a sweat. Some parts were hard to figure out (I may just have poor coordination/dancing skills), so I would just go back to the moves I was comfortable with. All in all I had fun doing the parts I could master and it was a nice break from the same old routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Hula Dance","review":"This was easy to follow and the dance was so awesome! I would definitely get more options of what Kili has out there. She explains in detail the moves and how they should be done...she takes her time to tell the audience....Great service as well...I received it before expected....I really like this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I just got this dvd a few days ago and i already fit my abs tighting. I love the fact that I am learning the hula and getting a workout at the same time. I recommended for people who have knee problem to not get this dvd. Hula is all about the hips and bending the knee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on the thighs!","review":"This is the first dvd of the series that I bought and I absouletly feel in love with it that I now have all four of them. Its a great workout that you could do everyday and you feel the burn in your thighs with all the squats and squatting. The thing I like the most about it is that is not just your basic instructional dance dvd it incorprates your basic full body workout into the whole dvd while you are learning the dance which helps you accentuate the moves more and get better while doing them. You can definatelly feel your body working and toning up on these dvds. I would definately reccomend this dvd to someone who wants a low-impact workout or just a break from your normally stressful workouts and a really good workout for a beginner beacuse it will give you something to sweat and get better at."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can feel it working!!","review":"I think this is a great workout video for anyone seeking a low impact routine. If you are interested in something fast and bouncy this is probably not the video for you. It has an even pace and when you just watch it you may not think it is very strenuous but, you would be wrong!! My daughters and I were all sweating (a lot) when we got done. At first we even took a break in the middle! You can really feel it in your thighs and abs. After I do this dvd I even feel thinner because my stomach feels tighter. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great alternative indoor workout!","review":"I have gotton two left feet on the dance floor but have wanted to learn some moves while exercising indoors on cold days. I was encouraged to try Hula after reading the reviews. I love the dance/workout, which is easy to follow, and do it when I cannot exercise outdoors. The dance moves coordinated with some squats make the muscles and the body relax and sweat. I am glad that I gave the Hula workout dvd a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this tape","review":"This is a GREAT workout!!! I love it I do it everyday and It's fun not like the Jane Fonda old 80's crap!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad! Don't buy this dvd","review":"Wow, this is a really terrible dvd. The filming is bad, the moves are rediculous, and the pace is for the elderly. I'm glad I got this used at a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hula til it hurts!","review":"Ordered the video on Thursday. Received it on Friday and broke open the case immediately. Super excited because the cost of the video was the cost of one hula fitness class! I already feel the burn in my lower hips and abs. I love to dance and like finding new ways to mix things up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Video at a Steal!","review":"Of all the other videos I've bought over the years by Denise Austin or various yoga people, this workout is the best. It's fun and makes the time go by quickly. I enjoy this more than 30 mins. on the NordicTrack. The girls are in great shape (not anorexic-looking) and the drums get you in the island mood. You can pretend you are on vacation in Hawaii learning the Hula! You don't realize how hard you are working until you start sweating - it really is an enjoyable workout without being frenetic. There are some light yoga moves incorporated, but not annoyingly so. You also use your arms a lot, which adds to the benefits. I'm going to buy more of Kili's videos after mastering this one. I FINALLY found an exercise video I will actually use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rough video","review":"I did not like this video at all. It was too rough, not the soft hula I am used to. Seems like it was combined with a hard rock sort of dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff","review":"It took too long to get to the meat of the video. Too much time was wasted. It went too slow. I like to get right into the exercise without all the fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun workout!","review":"I absolutely HATE working out, but this DVD is actually fun for me! I am not at all coordinated, so I know I don't look like the \\"Island Girl\\" in the video, but as long as no one sees me, I love doing this workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good workout!","review":"I am a belly dancer and I thought I might like this DVD because Hula is SO similar! I was looking forward to it but was very disappointed.DETAILS:I DID NOT like this \\"workout\\" at all. The first 10 minutes are fine - not bad at all. After that it becomes mundane and VERY BORING. It is VERY slow moving and yet . . . there is NOT ENOUGH CUEING.Since this is targeted to beginners the instructor should have BROKEN DOWN THE MOVES to make them understandable and more doable. She DOES NOT do this.MY SYNOPSIS:Beginners WILL get LOST and the more advanced will be BORED.This DVD did not hold my attention and was NOT it a good work out. I'm sorry. I have to say thumbs down! God bless."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this DVD","review":"I cannot say enough great things about the Island Girl DVDs. I have all but one--and I love each one. After only 7 workouts over 2 weeks, my husband noticed my butt looked smaller!! I also keep up with him on our walks now (not only is he more in shape than me, but he is 6\\" taller). After only the first 2 workouts, I noticed my legs felt stronger as I carried laundry up and down the stairs.I had gotten so bored with my treadmill, other exercise videos, and exercise ball (not to mention weights) that I was not even exercising at all anymore. But I look forward to doing the hula as often as I can. I love the way I am more flexible, and s-m-a-l-l-e-r. Isn't that what we all want?I have found out, though, that I am not a natural dancer. Putting arm movements to leg movements makes me feel like quite the fool, but the more I practice, the easier it gets, and I am DETERMINED to master each move. If you are bored with exercising or don't like it, you MUST get some Island Girl DVDs!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"little practice","review":"I have no knowledge of Hula dancing and I expected a bit more practice than I got. The starting part she tells you what the dance looks like and then it goes right into the workout. I did not see where she trains you or teaches you the step by steps at all to each type of thing she did. Obviously, because the workout goes right into it, I had a terrible time keeping up as I did not know the steps. I think I would buy another video that gives you much more practice than this one though I could see how it would be a good workout if you knew what you were doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video","review":"I loved this video! It's fun and gives you a great workout all for a cheap price! However......after a couple weeks of alternating this with others I did become a bit bored. But I haven't done it in a while and I'm sure I'll love it all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dish the Dirt","review":"For anyone who enjoys following the cult of celebrity -- go backstage with James Ulmer and find all of the behind-the-scenes gossip (ok really thruths) about today's biggest stars.

Quite simply, this book is impossible to put down. James Ulmer's clever rating system is interesting enough in itself -- but the best part of the book is his personal stamp. He makes no bones about being star-struck, yet his mission is the demystification of the gods, and he does it with gimlet-eyed clarity and intelligence. A dirt-filled riff will turn on a phrase into a sharp insight into the celebrity cult and our fascination with it. Some of his observations of actors are priceless. My image of Marlon Brando struggling up the Brooklyn waterfront ramp will now forever be juxtaposed with him struggling up the aisle of an L.A. supermarket, dressed in a muumuu and eating from an as-yet-unbought gallon of Breyers ice cream. This is a great summer (or winter) read, but don't take it to anyplace where you're self-conscious about laughing out loud. Because you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just re-read it and it's STILL as frisky, fresh and memorable as the first time...","review":"Sharon Stone's hilarious shower scene...the breastfeeding of Kirstie Ally's possums & the psychology of Hollywood schadenfreude...the racy rituals of Tribal Hollywood (in a chapter that reads like Margaret Mead on a joy ride down Wilshire Blvd.)...this book careens around some truly funny curves and hairpin tales, tidbits and even, towards the end, throws in some genuinely poetic writing...a crazyquilt of savvy analysis (though the numbers are far less fun than the quotes) that is served up hot and spicey by an obviously keen and clever insider...I can honestly say it made me alternately gasp and laugh all over again seven years after I first checked it out...Why haven't we seen a sequel yet, Mr Ulmer???"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY","review":"This is the worst item I have purchased for my daughter for her birthday. The instructions they provided were very vague and not helpful at all. They provided pieces to decorate the doll house but they don't explain how to go about it. Then theres pieces they give you that your not even sure what they are for (like dough and string). The assembly of this house is very poorly made and falls apart easily. The one we purchase advertised real electrically working lights but they didn't provide the means to achieve this. I would have taken this item back to the store but it was to far to travel to return it.

As with what SingingBlueSilver said, the music for the arrival at the Ivory Tower, as well as other selections on this CD, is NOT what was on the original motion picture. I think it is a great injustice to not only the movie, but to us as well that the soundtrack is not composed of all of the original music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory Lane","review":"The soundtrack to THE NEVERENDING STORY really is an enjoyable listening experience. I remember watching the film when I was younger, and I recall how much I enjoyed the fantasy and mystery of the story. Listening to the various songs and musical pieces was a nostalgic experience. For those who have seen the film, I'm sure that you'll also be able to visualize the different scenes in which each song is attached. Some of my favorites were track #6 (Bastian's Happy Flight), #8 (Atreju's Quest), #9 (Theme of Sadness), and #14 (The Auryn). The woodwind/flute in the \\"Theme of Sadness\\" has a very full, and haunting sound. And \\"Bastian's Happy Flight,\\" as well as \\"Atreju's Quest,\\" have an exciting momentum to them. \\"The Auryn\\" includes a nice choral-like arrangement, which brings the listener to the end of the journey. I recommend this soundtrack to those who would like to spend a few moments in the enchanted land of THE NEVERENDING STORY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, But Keep well","review":"The reason why I say this, is because, once scratched, even a tiny bit,it will cost you another CD.But otherwise noted it's one of the best music's I have ever listened to.If you buy one keep in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a soundtrack this is","review":"This is one of my favorite soundtracks along with Labrynth! The music hear just takes me back to Fantasia. Now we all have seen or heard about the movie. My favorite song would be the Title Song. There is just some magic about it that wisks you away. I also like the Ivory Tower. That one also just takes me away to Fantasia. Try listening to it above and decide for yourself if it does or doesn't take your imagination away. Two thumbs up or 5 stars and a half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Enchanting and Inspirational","review":"I bought this CD on a whim because I remembered loving that first scene as a kid with the clouds and the Limahl song at the beginning of the movie. I remember there being more music in the movie but I was surprised to discover that every track on this CD is magical, and often times inspirationally uplifting as well as touchingly sad in a beautiful nostalgic way. If you ever believed that the world was a truly magical place, this is the soundtrack for you because it will remind you of how you felt, and maybe make you believe again. Rarely do many days go by that I don't play these wonderful tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible","review":"The battery is thicker and longer than the OEM battery and doesn't fit into the camera. It's just as well because it also would not accept a charge on an external charger. Total waste of materials. Positive note: the Amazon vendor issued an immediate, full refund and told me to just toss the battery.FYI, the only replacement I have found that has performed like the OEM battery is the Lenmar branded replacement (unfortunately, not available through Amazon as of this review; what is currently advertised as Lenmar by the Amazon associates is a cheap, inferior, no-name battery without the Lenmar label that, in my experience, did not last or provide comparable performance:Lenmar DLK780S Digital Camera Equivalent to the Kyocera BP-780S Battery)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but didn't work","review":"I got this humidifer for my daughter's bedroom.

I already have the penguin which is also by this company...and that one worked perfectly. I don't know if it is because of the design...but this one shuts off after about ten minutes of running.

The actor tells of a village on the banks of the Mississippi, Hannibal, \\"a little democracy which was full of liberty, equality, and the forth of July\\". Not a quote I would choose for accuracy, even if those were Twain's words. You have to imagine how former slaves recalled that village, however few slaves it had.Speaking of the actor, his attempt to sound old got old right quick. I'd sooner hear more of Twain's words than his voice.Many of the old photos seemed to have barely any connection to Mark Twain. For example, black and white children together on a donkey. I'm not convinced young Samuel ever saw that happen.Some of the modern scenes were interesting, I have to say, but they don't save the final product. BTW, contrary to the editorial review, there is no scene selection.I don't know why anyone, myself included, ever thought this was an IMAX subject.

First, the writing is disjointed. The author jumps to new topics without transitions or comments on the many quotes. Second, and related to the first point, this is more of an edited volume of quotes, not an authored book with original ideas. Third, it is noteworthy to this reader that the author interprets his own failed marriage and Jung's affairs with patients as psychological growth, whereas Freud's affair with his sister-in-law was an opportunity to criticize Freud's emphasis on sex in his psychoanalysis.

I was quite disappointed. Grizzly Man fails as a wildlife documentary because Timothy Treadwell didn't have the qualifications or expertise to produce such a thing. Grizzly Man falls short as a biography because Mr. Treadwell was in no way great or inspiring. However, he was nuts.

Unfortunately this film, like Treadwell's actions, isn't about the bears. It's about Treadwell.I've never seen a guy so much in love with himself, he's a poser, a Marlin Perkins wannabe.

Let's Hope So!","review":"After two viewings I can still not decide whether Herzog meant for this film to be taken seriously. It has the look and feel of sketch comedy. I am not a discompassionate person, and I literally laughed my way through 2/3 of this thing. One of my favorite moments was the clip where Dave Letterman asked Treadwell if we'd be hearing reports of him being eaten by a bear, and then the audience erupted in laughter--COMIC GENIUS!Treadwell was clearly insane! Not brave! Those bears didn't want or need him there! So what is the story if not the novelty and irony of this closeted, kooky wannabe hamming it up for the camera and then getting exactly what he was asking for.If Grizzly Man is satire, then it's a masterpiece and Herzog is a genius. If it was intended as inspirational or tragic docu-fare, then it fell far short of its mark. The guy, the situation, the foolish-looking supporting players and the ultra-serious narration were all just laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"treadwell is crazy, but the experience is spectacular","review":"this movie follows the life of timothy treadwell as he lived in the alaskan wilderness and thought he was helping to raise the awareness of the plight or his perception of the grizzly bears on kodiak island in Alaska. Werner Herzog does a splendid job of relaying the information of treadway's life and leaves one with an interesting portrait of the man, and in some ways what would posess this lunatic to think he could live with grizzly bears in the wilderness,but also lets you witness the effect treadway had on others lives. Definitely worth seeing, it is a great film, and Mr. Chocolate and Saturn may have been Timothy Treadwell's friends, but to others they are just bears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful documentary","review":"I thought that this movie would be more interesting. It is not for children and this documentary is poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant documentary from Herzog...","review":"There are certain themes that never tire - such as man's humility in the face of nature. Grizzly Man is such a story. The ironic thing is that Timothy Treadwell thought that he was on the right side of that equation; arguing for the preservation of animals. Yet, as you watch this fascinating documentary, you see Treadwell slipping into what can only be called madness. I kept thinking of Captain Ahab as Treadwell yelled at the sky to rain. He preferred the bear's world to man's world. The problem was, he seemed to think that made him a bear.Yet, Treadwell is a likeable guy. He's like a slightly nuttier version of the Crocodile Guy (if you can imagine such a thing). You root for him, even though you know he will get eaten. Yet, he knew the dangers he faced and he wouldn't have done anything differently had he known his fate. Sane or insane, Grizzly Man is the story of a man who brought meaning to his life...even though his lifestyle eventually killed him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow the Yellow Brick Road","review":"Mr. Treadwell, it seemed, was deeply disturbed. His delusions that he was saving the bear from poachers and other misfortunes seemed very real to him, although none of the footage that was supplied for the film showed any encounters as such. He seemed happiest among the bears and truly there was \\"No place like home\\" for him except the Sanctuary and the Maze. What is even sadder is that his companion died trying to save him from what some saw as an inevitable end. Most of the interviews seemed cartoonish and staged like a bad Saturday Night Live skit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herzog, &#65533;where were your mind?","review":"This documentary is not about bears.

Watch \\"March of the Penguins\\" if you want to see a wildlife documentary, watch this if you want to see mentally unstable person compromise the lives of some beautiful bears, and other Alaskan animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grizzy Man","review":"The only thing I liked about this movie was the photography of the grizzly bears. As far as Treadway - I thought he was a total nutcase. He focused too much on himself and really didn't give us much information on the bears at all. When he got so carried away on flipping off the game department - that entire scene should have been deleted - it only showed what a jerk he was. That was the part of the movie that really turned the entire movie off for me. I think that bear had just about enough of him also. Too bad!There are much better films out there than this one! I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to a documentary on grizzly bears and quite frankly, found only a delusional young man, romping through the Alaskan wilderness, trying to make friends with the bears. While I can appreciate the footage of the Alaskan landscape and wilderness, that is about all I could appreciate. Had I known that it was a crusade to save the bears by communing with them, I doubt I would have rented it. That said, I am glad I only rented it and I guess I should have known more about Treadwell before I did. I was supremely disappointed, having a rare evening to watch something other than my 5 year old son's movie picks. A waste of time. The plight of the grizzly is not helped by this lunatic's ravings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be prepared to be annoyed","review":"This character seems borderline psychotic at times and shows no regard for anyone but himself and animals. At one point in this movie a bear wandered within 20 yards of fishers and they threw a rock at it to scare it away, this caused Tim to become irate and pretentiously condemn people who were just protecting themselves, they could have just as easily (and legally) shot the bear but they chose to scare it. Those people are true nature lovers, not this crazed fanatic. This man died in a way very fitting for the way he lived, he treated animals like civilized creatures instead of wild animals, and at least his death teaches us a lesson, bears are not rational creatures, they are wild animals who will kill humans. Treat animals with more respect than this lunatic did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grizzly Man","review":"Grizzlies are wild animals. They don't speak English, neither do foxes. I think this man was desperately seeking affection, and somehow thought the animals would reciprocate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible blow for the Grizzly Bear reputation","review":"Clearly the man was insane and is desperate for attention. He supposedly cared for the bears which I imagine in his own warped way he did. However, by placing himself in such a dangerous position (note how he hypes up that danger by constantly telling us) and getting himself killed he's put back the work done by Charlie Russell and other real bear conservationists by adding to the big bad bear false reputation. If you actually want to really learn something about bears and not some hero talking to a camera about his babies etc then ignore this lame Hollywood drama and watch 'Bear Man Of Kamchatka\\" on BBC DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Life","review":"This fascinating documentary has many aspects to enjoy such as real-life tragicomedy, unique up close video of the bears and a cast of Alaskan eccentrics in the background. The contrast between subject Treadwell's moon beam emotionalism and narrator Herzog's heavy German realism is unintentially hilarious and has already been parodied. Personally I'm much more comfortable with Herzog's approach; grounded by his pessimism he does at least stay on planet earth while we can only watch the flight of Treadwell's indulgences with amusement, disdain and a hint of admiration. You have to admit he did do amazing things even if he was essentially an idiot. Come for the nature footage but stay for the human drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"We expected this to be about a person dedicated to the well being of the bear population in Alaska. It turns out to be about a guy who was living in another reality and thinking the real bears were cuddly teddy bears. Its amazing he didn't die sooner. Sorry. The guy was a nutcase.However, it was a well put together documentary and we DID watch the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load.","review":"This guy Treadwell was a self-serving prick. He claimed to be \\"protecting\\" animals all through this piece of crap, but how exactly? Yeah, I like bears too, but I'm not going to intrude on them the way he did. His 5-minute long swearing at the Parks Service was nothing more than childish pandering to those who know no other way to criticize the government. This movie was a colossal waste of time made by an egotistical clown who had no respect for the fact that he was made of bear food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dvd is modified from it's theatrical version","review":"All the reviews I have read talk about the film's story and about peoples opinion of tim. Does anybody know the reason for the change and what changes they made? I hate changes from the original to dvd.The movie itself is great.Even though it is 2.0 audio it is all the film needs to be authentic.I have been to katmai national park ( geographic harbor ) on a guided tour.We sat and watched the bears 10 to 15 feet away feeding on salmon in a small river.Seven of us sitting on the banking eating our lunches taking pictures.It was the greatest thrill of my life!!!!!! I know how tim felt,the spiritual feeling,the closeness with \\"god\\" the feeling of how we humans have screwed the earth up! The thought keeps coming to mind is \\"this is how life is supposed to be\\"!!!Anyway,please if someone can tell me why the film was modified I would be ever so grateful!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Move along","review":"The subject of the film is obviously suffering from mental problems that cause him to shy away from the civilized world and to only feel a sense of belonging with wild animals such as foxes and bears. If I had purchased the film and not borrowed it from the library I would almost feel as though I were exploiting someone with a mental defect.My main issue with the film is that the director was biased in that he was attempting to cast the subject and his plight in the best light rather than a neutral tone that documentaries usually have. This was to the detriment of the film because although the attempt was made to portray the subject as a conservationist, he simply came across as a crazy person.Don't buy it, if you must see it, get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it twice in one sitting","review":"which is new to me as usually with Hollywood dreck i can't wait for the movie to be over and am watching the timer on the DVD player as intently as the screen. Now this documentary answer the questions as to who Timothy Treadwell was and how he got to spending his summers in Alaska living among the Grizzles that ultimately kill him which makes watching the footage all the more horrifying and riveting. In short it is a journey into one man's heart of darkness that leaves some aching questions unanswered because they are found in the human heart instead of in those of subjects that treadwell is so fond of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-So-Good","review":"A documentary of a home-grown nut-job that deliriously thought he was either a bear, would die & become a bear or protector of bears. He never really made up his mind, because he didn't really have a manageable brain. A man that could go from saying \\"I love you\\" to a wild grizzly bear to totally freaking out yelling profanity @ Park Rangers on his video camera while alone is not quite right in the head. Apparently Treadwell was manic most likely. He did manage to hook a crunchy gf too, but she gets killed as well. And the moral of this story is - it's not okay to be crazy like this nut-job in the wild with grizzlies, but acceptable if it makes for good entertainment & pass it off for a documentary. Where is good old fashioned entertainment & creative films anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD but....","review":"\\"Most times I am a Kind Warrior out hereOccasionally I am challenged and in that caseThe Kind Warrior must must must become a Samaria\\"-Timothy Treadwell - The Grizzly ManI have always said, that people should follow their dreams. But it seems to me that people following their dreams may be more for others to learn something, than that person following their dreams. Once you're dead, you can't teach nor gain anymore knowledge. Others can still learn something though.Lesson: Don't feed the bears.I don't purchase DVDs often, but for some reason I was drawn to this one. They do not play the audio, as he is being eaten towards the end, and I think that is a misjustice to Mr. Treadwell's cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"accidentally hilarious!","review":"How someone could take this movie seriously is beyond me. What makes this movie funnier than Chistopher Guest films, and at the same time disturbing, is that it is a real documentary. This is like a new genre of entertainment! Timothy Treadwell had no mission! He was a dilusionary man that saw bears as cute human children in bear suits. Thats it! He got off on the rush these animal gave him. Thus violating and mocking nature without even knowing it. I thought this movie had to be a mockumentary, but it was not. I found myself laughing through the whole thing because I couldnt believe it was real!!!! Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated. Invasion of privacy.","review":"I turned off the movie with about 20 minutes left. Herzog usesprivate material from Mr. Treadwell to do a layman's psychologicalprofile of him. This is an invasion of privacy and overall is deplorable. It's also twisted how he focuses a lot of time on the gruesome death and details, including the audio tape. If done with respect, this could have been an interesting, although more pedestrian documentary. Herzog goes for shock value and thru hype and violations of privacy exploits this unique individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbing film on many levels","review":"I watched this movie last evening...well, to be honest, after the first hour, I skimmed through the rest as it was more of the same over-dramatized interviews and manic sound bites from Treadwell. The interviews with Jewel and the coroner were just as disturbing as the story itself as they both seemed like scenes from a bad soap opera.I wish the film maker had given Treadwell's mental and life history earlier in the movie as I spend much of the first half hour thinking, \\"Is this man serious? What is wrong with him? Why hasn't anyone tried to get him some help?\\" Clearly his friends and family saw his mental instability. It's so sad his life had to end so tragically and another human being lost her life as well.Still, I imagine if I muted the film, much of the footage might take on new meaning without Treadwell's distracting commentary. Nature in all its splendor and shadow is to be admired and respected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing True Story , Unique,","review":"I'm as much intrigued by the Bears in this Story as I was by Timothy Treadwell. This is a fascinating story about the Bears and their interactions with the Videographer. I liked this so Much I bought the DVD and read Treadwell's Book \\"Among Grizzlies\\". If you are looking for a break from corn-ball Hollywood Formula movies you may wish to check this one out. This real-life drama is outstanding. -Dr. ZauisP.S.-great music too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best unintentional comedy i have ever seen.","review":"I laughed so freaking hard when watching this movie. It is lilteraly the best uninetional comedy ever. If somebody told me that it was a mocumentry and i had never heard of it or seen it i would believe them. All in all its a great movie, even though it was funny it still was sad when he was killed by the bear and what he did for bear research was great"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY CAPTIVATED BY TIMOTHY TREADWELL","review":"Timothy Treadwell was a REAL CHARACTER in every sense of the word. I watched this documentary with my husband and son and we all sat mesmerized by this eccentric naturalist's on-screen antics. Especially provacative were his night-time tent soliloquies. Whether he is ranting about the plight of the animals (and insects) or placing his hand into a steaming pile of bear feces, you just can't help but like the guy. I am glad the director decided not to air the tape of Timothy and his girlfriend being mauled because I kind of like to think of Timothy still out there talking baby-talk to his beloved bears. Anyway this is a MUST SEE and a MUST BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mentally Ill homeless man commits suicide by bear","review":"I can't believe this movie won all these awards ! I sat down to watch this movie with my 9 year old son , when we saw the guy caressing bear poop that was enough ! I guess after Michael Moore and Broke Back Mt. I should'nt be surprised Hollywood just gets weirder and weirder !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this even made?","review":"Watching this film made me angry. First off the \\"main character\\" was just annoying to listen to, though I gave him the benefit of a doubt. As the film without a story progressed, it became apparent that this was a very disturbed and delusional man with a foul mouth. He 'befriends' wild animals, which is antithetical to environmental ethics. Wild animals need to remain wild and not be acclimated to humans or it would be dangerous for both. This is espeically true for Brown and kodiak bears. He did far more damage to the bears and any conservation/environmental cause by his actions and this film than he knows.Then he goes off on some absurd diatribe about his sexuality which we did not need to hear and hear is where I thought: not only does this guy have problems, the director is a moron as well. Spare us. I turned off the tv. Believe me, I am being nice by saying this but, truly the worse film of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treadwell the Idiot","review":"This would have been a better name for this movie. I hoped it would have been an educational film about the grizzly bears of Alaska. Instead it is a movie about a self-centered, foul mouth idiot (Timothy Treadwell) who thinks he is a bear. These are wild animals and not pets. The movie is put together clips that he had filmed of himself wandering around in Alaska's bear country. The bears eventually had him and his girlfriend for a snack one day. This movie was a waste of money and is definately not for children, or for that matter, anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen this plenty of other times.........","review":"....in the West. It's full of trustfunder's who head out West to become (in their mind) the next Jeremiah Johnson. The West is full of 'em.Unfortunately, they're usually so full of bs, that the only actual facts in their stories is their names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"If I could give this less than one star I would. This was a waste of my time. At the end of the movie I could have cared less about \\"Grizly Man.\\" Watching this idiot chase a fox over his hat was about as much as I could take. Then it got worse. Watching this lunatic rant and rave and flip of the park service, well I feel that my time would have been better spent doing anything else. I can't belive I wasted my money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from being a documentary","review":"In my opinion, a documentary is to inform the audience of certain knowledge and in this case it should have been - bears. A wild animal in general will never attack unless it is hungry or if it feels threatened or you are threatening the life of its young. This is how humans act 98% of the time so why is anyone surprise at other animals behaving in the same manner? The fact that Timothy strode around unharmed isn't really anything amazing. I did not think him crazy or irrational but I did feel like I was watching an episode of Captain Kangaroo and as the film progressed, the Captain on drugs. He spoke like a child most of the time and I felt sorry for him. He disconnected so badly from society at a very early age and somehow never matured properly. If you feel like you learned something after watching this film then kudos. Me, I learned nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grizzly Man","review":"This was a movie about a personality, not about grizzly bears interacting with humans or grizzly bears in the wild. There is no new information about grizzly bears in this movie. The \\"star\\" of the show, Timothy Treadwell, was a pitiful reject. Why Werner Herzog (director) thought anybody would be interested in knowing more about that poor guy is a mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know how anyone can take this movie seriously","review":"IT'S HILARIOUS! So hilarious, it's difficult to tell if it's a documentary or a mockumentary. The star of the story, Timothy Treadwell, is made fun of by a majority of the people interviewed. Plenty of gay innuendos throughout the entire movie. I highly suggest grabbing some beers and watching this movie with some close friends who share your sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a nut","review":"This guy was seriously crazy. Out of touch with reality, stuck on his own sense of self importance, very disturbed. And they made a movie about him? Only in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"This film was truly excellent. Definitely one of my 20 favorite films of all time. This film is funny, and shows truly AWESOME scenery. Timothy is unintentionally hilarious, between his tirades about the Government and his sometimes too-high voice. The film is very interesting and well worth several viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grithly Man","review":"Reviewers rave about this doc., but I think it takes a special kind of person to watch some California space cadet lisp his way about verdant meadows of azure green for almost two hours without laughing yourself ill. I lasted 5 minutes,42 seconds. Frankly, if you're not rooting for the Grizzlies to gnaw this cretin's head off long before the flick is finished, join a seminary. You boast a saintly tolerance for world-class stupidity. That said, the Grizzlies looked appropriately menacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not feed the bears.","review":"What is this fascination we have for viewing troubled or mental people as entertainment? I can see Treadwells love for these bears but he never respected them. There is a difference here. While Steve Irwin loves his croc's, we don't see him swimming and trying to cuddle them, for obvious reason. Herzog and his backers saw an opportunity to make some money off some guys personal train wreck and to call this documentary entertainment, educational or even informative is nonsense, unless, of course, you like to see bears in the wild like I do, which explains the two stars. O.K. film except Treadwell kept getting in the way. Besides, humans cannot be good for a bears digestion, in fact, this poor bear died of lead poisoning. Sorry about Amy though. Her decision to stay with that nut case cost her everything she was and would have been. Bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting look into a crazy person's mind","review":"Wow...I can't believe I just watched all that. I am not shocked at all that this guy preferred living alone with bears...he would not function well in society lol. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it kept my attention enough to watch all the way through. That and Grizzly bears are HUGE and scary lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Commentary","review":"This movie was hard to watch. It was a sad commentary on Tim's life and how far from society he removed himself. Some of the footage of the bears was great. I enjoyed the Alaskan scenery but the great shots were far and few between. The interviews were over acted it seemed like and hard to watch. I couldn't watch the whole thing (I skipped a few interviews) but kept watching in horror because the story was just so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wasted Life of a Young and Privledged Boy","review":"This is all about the afterlife of a good looking, middle class, smart, blond headed Anglo who drug fried his brains during his freshman year in college and subsequently dropped out.His afterlife consisted of being a Beach Bum in Southern California in the winter and tent camping with a girl friend among wild Grizzly Bears of Alaska during the summer.Given that some of the screen sequences he took with his hand held camera are remarkable, his narration of same was limited. In fact if you removed all versions of the \\"f\\" word from his vocabulary, the Alaskan portion would be improved, but shorten considerably.Don"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful life he lived","review":"It's beautiful the life he lived. You could see how much love he had for \\"GOd's\\" creation and mother earth with all her wildlife. And the hostility he had for civilization is well-deserved. It seems humans have long forgotten any decency and civility for one another, but few have remained duely honorable to our land and to others. I don't view Timothy Treadwell 's life as tragic or wasted, but rather a little crazy, throwing caution to the wind but yet leaving his own positive mark on history for the better and treading well on his short-lived path to what he held dear in this life. Cheers to you Tim , to the Grizzly Man, your bears, and our earth. May we remember our love for all. Godbless~shauns movie review"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy it.","review":"We just watched the Grizzly Man and couldn't help but think that Timothy Treadwell was in serious need of mental health and used the grizz and Alaska to escape the truth and reality. As mentioned in the movie, he did more to harm bears with his constant intrusion in there areas. There wasn't one moment in the film were he or the director ever showed him actually helping any wild thing, unless you count the time he sounded as though he was crying at the death of a bee, baby fox, or grizzly cub. Sounded as though he didn't truly understand the life and death in the animal kingdom or was in some type of denial of the real world. I'm glad we watched it but I'd suggest renting it, it's not something I need to watch again. It may make an interesting study for students or professionals dealing with mental health issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC","review":"ONE OF THE BEST DOCUMENTARY FILMS EVER MADE. I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO DOESN'T LOVE THIS FILM BY THE GREAT WERNER HERZOG!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to witness.","review":"An obviously confused and trouble man, Timothy chronicles his unarmed encounters with the worlds most successful and feared predators. The entire manic journey was painful to watch. His misplaced adoration and disturbing humanization of these beasts leads him to become bolder with every passing year. The most tragic repercussion of his entire life was how he lured a woman he supposedly loved into his unholy lair. Both of them suffered an agonizing and terrifying death by these sweet little \\"friends\\" of his who only tolerated his presence because they had something easier to eat. I mourn his girlfriends' passing, and I chalk up to his death to him loving the creature more than the Creator. Don't watch unless you want real-life induced nightmares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Bears!","review":"Werner Herzog has pieced together the home movie footage of Tim Treadwell, a self-styled mountain man who attempted to co-exist with bears in the Alaskan wilds and eventually got eaten. He also got his girlfriend eaten.It's a chilling, darkly ironic tale with an edge that's almost Pythonesque.It's also a stark, cold parable about self-delusion; the uncaring randomness of nature and fate; knowing one's limitations; and the perils of being an unwanted outsider.But I think the main thing viewers should and will take from this documentary is: Don't go where the bears are. And if you must go where the bears are, don't mess with the bears. You may think they are digging your Thoreau act, but they don't speak our language. And they will eat you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This movie was amazing! The story is true, and well put together. I loved the fact that it used real footage taken by Tim Treadwell and mixed in interviews with the people in his life. Although the story is tragic, this movie really makes you feel the love Tim had for Alaska. I bought it in hopes to get my boyfriend to take a trip up there with me, and I think it is working! The images of Alaska are breathtaking. Very entertaining movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of the Same","review":"I felt that the movie kept repeating itself over and over. Scene after scene, Treadwell is shown talking to the bears, spouting his love for nature, and going on ranting tirades against the government, poachers, and society at large. I would have liked to see a more linier approach taken to the film with more explanation as to why he chose to live with the bears, and how his unique method of study evolved. What exactly did Treadwell do in respect to his non-profit? We are told that he goes around to schools at no charge giving presentations, but what impact did this have? How did the educators who invited him to speak at their schools view him? I would also have liked to hear from the Forest service (or at least been told that they had been contacted for comment). In all, this film was quite redundant with no real climax or \\"gee wiz moment.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this for real?","review":"From start to finish, this comes across as the Spinal Tap of nature documentaries.After the first 30 minutes, I began questioning the validity of its claims.Everyone interviewed appears to be acting and the way in which the movie is cut together makes it come across as a comedy more than a tragedy.I believe this whole movie to be a fake and I find it amusing that anyone would swallow this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"The coroner seems to be as mentally ill as Treadwell","review":"Regardless of your opinion about Timothy Treadwell, I think we can all agree that this filmmaker was a bit lazy throughout the entire documentary. With hundreds of hours of footage shot by Treadwell himself, in addition to the wide variety of interviews, I don't understand why this director decided to narrate over 75% of the film. Maybe he just liked the sound of his own voice.Worst of all was the scene around 50 minutes in where the coroner describes the state of the remains he received and what he examined. I honestly wonder if the coroner was as mentally diluted as Treadwell. The man seems to almost relish in the gore while he overacts throughout the entire scene. The good doctor clearly thought this film was all about himself, rather than the victims he examined.If Treadwell is the uninformed, kitschy version of Steve Irwin; than this coroner is certainly the kitschy version of Bill Nye the Science Guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating!","review":"This movie definitly has so torn reveiws but as for myself and for others to which I can convice, this moive was absolutly facinating and thought provoking.

It's the medical examiner--a man who took way too much pleasure in describing partially-digested body parts. Nice to see someone so obviously enjoying his job.This is a great movie that just begs to be discussed, analyzed, mulled over. I differ from many reviewers who are hellbent on romanticizing or making poetic Timothy Treadwell's life. Or death-by-bear-attack, as the case may be. I saw Mr. Treadwell as a poster child for untreated mental illness. His death, while probably predictable, was all the more tragic because his \\"friends\\" were caught up in mythologizing a young man who was in dire need of mental health intervention, evaluation and treatment. Narcissism was the least of his problems.\\"Grizzly Man\\" should inspire all of us to be better, more attentive friends to each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is not widescreen as claimed","review":"Although the cover says \\"16:9 widescreen version\\" and this is even printed on the DVD itself, when you play it, it's in full screen format. When you click on play, the first thing that comes up is: \\"This film has been modified from its original theatrical version.\\" This is not a DVD with widescreen on one side and full screen on the other side. For a film with wide expanses of nature photography, it matters a great deal to have two ends of the image chopped off. This seems to be a case of false advertizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling and Weird","review":"My wife and I watched this documentary on the Dicovery Channel last night. Treadwell was mentally ill. He needed help. It was funny at some points without intending to be. The footage was beautiful and I liked the narrator. Treadwell's friends seemed to be just as misguided as he was. I think they live in a world of idealism that doesn't translate to real life. The native Alaskans had it right. Respect and keep your distance from the grizzly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think people are missing the point","review":"People are missing the point in their review here. This isn't a documentary about bears, it's a character study. Treadwell was (among other things) a 'dry drunk', someone who gets over their addiction to alcohol or drugs by fixating on something else, often something very unhealthy, rather than addressing the root cause of the problems. I found the movie fascinating, and the wildlife shots are beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"He murdered his girlfriend!","review":"If this waste of film was released without him getting killed and murdering his hostage girlfriend, then reviewers would all be saying the same thing: this loser was a stupid mental case! But since he got himself killed, people feel bad-*sniff- so they write about how heartfelt he was in his mission. Please! Um, what exactly did he do to save the bears? If a homeless man loves the ocean, lives on a beach, and constantly says he loves the fish and dead animals washed up on the beach, would you say how spirited and wonderful he is? Where's my video camera? I'm going to quit my job, because nature- here I come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and Infuriating","review":"Wow. This was hard to watch, because it was so terrible.

Naming all the bears also sickened me. The fact that he wanted them to feel safe with humans is the ultimate hypocrisy.How are you protecting bears, making them comfortable with human beings that want, for the most part to do them harm. I feel he got what he deserved, & I'm happy he's no longer in their world. I care more about animals & nature, than I do about people. Never the less, it's mindblowing to see this guy acting like such a crazy idiot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Luckily I only spent $1 to rent and see half of this piece of cinematic trash. Not sure what all the rave is about, but half way through I turned it off due to bad language and it just being a bad movie. Story about a nut who got eaten by bears becuase he was trying to be one. Duh.... The Arnold Swartzenegger sounding narrarator does not help either.If they would have focused more on the documentation of the lives of the bears and not the phychotic desires of one man, this may have been a decent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie stinks","review":"Movie has very little about bears but is about some wacko who only knows how to converse in four letter words.

If not, he should have.It's one thing to take a trip to the great outdoors for recreation and abide by park rules and regulations, but to blatantly ignore warnings by experts and park rangers and meander right up to these creatures thinking they are Yogi and Boo-Boo isn't just crazy, it's suicide.Why not just go to Africa and walk through a pride of lions?There's nothing amazing about this movie. It's the mark left behind by an irresponsible wanderer and ex-drug addict who cut his life and that of his girlfriend short by not respecting God's creatures. There are some places left on Earth where man is not welcome or needed. If you want to see a bear, go to the zoo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fool on the Hill","review":"Hmmmmm. Well, Treadwell's as easy a target for armchair critics (i.e., me) as he obviously was for the bear that finally had enough of his antics and decided to go all Darwin on him (although how it managed to choke down that enormous ego we'll never know). This all makes perfect sense, of course -- bears will be bears and all -- but I can't shake the feeling that the guy never imaged such a thing could happen. In the end, this film is more a study in human vanity (make no mistake: Treadwell's the star of this show, the bears merely bit players) than natural beauty, and that's the real tragedy here. I was disturbed by this film, but not for the reasons I expected...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curious?","review":"It would have been nice if they shared the recorded audio of the incident. I would give this doc perfect marks if they had not mentioned that the audio on the video camera was still rolling at the time of the attack. Why bring it up if they were not going to play it. They had no problem showing the gross image of the gutted bear that ate the victims. The audio would have been less gory then the image. I was overwhelmingly curious to hear it since they made it known. Even if it was terrifying to listen to I still would listen to it. It pissed me off because now that curiosity will never be satisfied. I'm not sure what I would get out of listening to it, I just know I hate when people only give you part of a story. The most curious part about this doc was the audio and it's the one thing they left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"If this movie was a mocumentary it would be great. The fact that the gentleman this film is about is real and that someone actually took the time and effort to make a movie about him is the definition of stupid. Do not waste your time and watch this. I feel lesser of a human being for having seen half this movie. If I had finished it, suicide would be the only answer. This movie is THAT BAD. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grizzly Man","review":"The book is truly a real life story, My oldest son is a bush pilot in Alaska and has flown the Grizzly Man. The subject of his death will be controversial forever. It is a must read for anyone looking for another exciting chapter in Alaska history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Documentary of an egotistical fool","review":"I watched this entire movie, trying at every turn to understand the worth or message of this documentary. My only achievement was having stayed awake, given the bad narration, and the cheap acting attempts made by Treadwell's friends. The movie may have been more interesting and worthy of the DVD rental fee had the movie depicted a person who really understood grizzlies, and who emulated some sense of normalcy in dealing with nature's hazzards. Instead, I saw an arrogant, self-absorbed, irritating fool repeatedly telling all animals \\"I love you, I love you\\", and who frequently pontificated his greatness among the wilderness. Treadwell, I believe, had serious emotional issues, a factor that probably got him and his girlfriend killed, or may have been smoking some Alaskan weed that has not yet made it to the rest of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Though Grizzly Man definitely drags from time to time, it's an intersting study of a man who might have been a dedicated ecologist, an unmitigated narcissist, or something in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTRAORDINARY -- MESMERIZING AND SAD","review":"What could've been sensational and exploitive given the subject matter (and highly ironic title), Werner Herzog's GRIZZLY MAN is instead a mesmerizing, perceptive and heart-rending account of Timothy Treadwell and girl friend Amie Huguenard's fateful attempt to live with and film Alaska's endangered, wild bears.Their remains were found at Katmai Reserve in October 2003. They had been eaten by the animals they loved.Culled from over a hundred hours of Treadwell's expert footage, Herzog fashioned a paradoxical portrait of a troubled, compassionate man seeking solace and understanding.Was Treadwell a nave naturalist who lost touch with reality and died as a result?

I did some research, thought maybe Tints of Nature would be safer...the product description makes you \\"feel\\" like it might be safer. (It has a lot of organic materials, but still has PPD). It claims to be more \\"organic\\". I have read that PPD builds up a toxicity in your system (I even waited for over 7 weeks since my last reg hair dye). My reactions included: redness, itchiness, sores on my head, hard time breathing, and hives that are still on my face. I am going to Vegi Dyes next.

It also looks natural, as opposed to one solid color. It hasn't turned brassy either, as hair color that doesn't have a lot of ash in it tends to do on my hair.What's more, it was very easy to use, inexpensive, and it's safer and gentler than most hair dyes I've found (no ammonia, minimum PPD).

And he is dead on in his assessment of the impact of farm fisheries on salmon ecology.The book grossly understates, however, the impact of logging on salmon habitat. Without canopy to cool streams, temperature-sensitive salmon simply cannot spawn successfully. And let's not overlook the role that clear-cutting plays in causing erosion, sedimentation, and flooding. It's true that salmon ecology can still suffer from genetic contamination by farm fish, point-source and non-point-source pollution, illegal overfishing on the high seas, legal overfishing in fresh water, damming, and overuse of water by irrigators and developers. But let's not downplay the egregious impact of logging."},{"rating":"1","title":"SD - Proprietary Junk...","review":"I hardly ever write one of these reviews, but this product in particular really got me fired up.This product is one of a few MP3 players that supports the SD format.

If you have only one African wildlife video, this should probably be it. Look for the lion who's just lost the girl to his buddy - and is so put out that he ignores another lioness who saunters up and swats him across the face, as if she's saying \\"hey, stupid!\\" As with many other wildlife tapes, you may want to review this one before letting the younger kids watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"john/jimmy..kirk/johnny","review":"this movie should be given its place in any western collection.much as another fabulous western 'the man who shot liberty valence', it deals with a 'west' that has changed beyond the main characters' capacities to understand.and, in common with countless westerns (of the a, the b, and the c varieties), it all comes down to who fastest, ?no? or does it?both the leading characters are riveting in their own ways,and ?the ending! oh my, what an ending. whew.this is a fine western, definately watchable again and again, and therefore definately buyable.alvin"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This movie is a classic for more than one reason.

However, the most important, widely used engineering materials (metals) are summarily ignored until they are covered in a mere ten pages in an appendix. That is, elastoplastic material behavior is barely touched upon. Therefore, things such as descetized kinematics, finite element formulations are virtually worthless to any worker in the field of metals. Only the exceedingly simplistic material behavior known as hyperelastic is covered in detail. As a worker in both mechanical engineering and finite element linear and nonlinear analyses, this book was a great disappointment relative to its usefulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Starting Point to Nonlinear Analysis","review":"This is a very good introductory book to the subject of nonlinear continuum mechanics focusing on finite element applications.

However, if you are down with feminism rah rah, here's the book for you.

The cliches abound, and Tessier drags things out to the point that very little happens for the first 70 pages (out of 125); and when things do start happening, the complete lack of creativity ensures that the villains will be Nazis and the end will be predictable.Having this sorry waste of pages tacked onto a solid novel makes for a sadly uneven experience -- although at least you won't have to pay $40 to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute shoes, but definitely not fo rme","review":"I ordered these because they looked like very cute ballet flat type of shoes, and they had good reviews here and elsewhere.

Then take it!!The novel \\" Are you experienced \\" starts very well, but then it becomes more and more lengthy, so that I have lost the interest in reading on.Although the novel is written from a first person narrator, I could not identify with or even understand the protagonist's behaviour. Sutcliff's style doesn't convince me, I have not found any parts in the book where tension arises either.In spite of this the story (two young people travel to India for three months during their gap year, because he wants to get her into bed and she wants to find herself there) is good, it's just not put well into practise.Nevertheless I'm proud having read it, because as Dave, the protagonist, says having done it is more fun than the doing it!Since I had to read this novel for school, I have found out many interesting details and so I can say that there is definitely more in the text than I thought before.

But take a deeper look, and this is one of the most engaging origami books on the subject ever-for that matter, perhaps it is one of the best origami books ever. I know it is one of my top ten books. Enough praise, you want to know what's in it. Well, as Montroll usually does, the beginning models are so easy, I think you could fold them from sheet metal...an egg, mountain, and tree. Soon though, the dinosaurs begin, and slowly but surely the difficulty rises, until culminating with a Stegosaurus. Other dinosaurs include, T-rex, a bunch of gliding dinos, and others such as Dimetrodon and Spinosaurus. I would recommend this to any Dinosaur fan, and/or origami fan. However, a true beginner would find this book to be boring, because after the three 'sheet metal' models, the difficulty rises 2 or 3 fold. If you can make the first 4 or 5, you can probably learn to make them all. In short, a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for advanced folders","review":"There aren't too many really easy folds here -- it rapidly gets difficult.

And the models look great! I had the Stegasaurus memorized at one time.In all, if you're an Intermediate or Advanced folder, this is an *awesome* book for you!If you still find the Peace Crane a challenge, this book might frustrate you.

It should be standard on any disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Lector","review":"This book and its companion volume represent a prodigious amount of research. Having said that, though, I also have to warn potential readers that they should not take it at face value. Along with several colleagues, I have examined a representative sample of Quinn's footnotes. Without exception -- literally, without exception -- I have found the notes problematic. They seem padded. The sources cited often appear largely irrelevant to the point made in the main text. Quite frequently, when the sources are actually examined, they don't really turn out to say what Quinn says they do. This is extraordinarily troubling. Few if any of us have the time to look up all of the many, many references -- even if they were easily accessible. I don't have the time myself. But my sample suggests to me that I can't rely on Quinn's scholarship at any point with any degree of real confidence. Others have come to similar conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but accurate?","review":"I've followed Mr. Quinn's writings for several years and foundthem to be generally helpful. Yet I often feel that, with each book,I have learned as much about the author's attitudes as I have the subject. I have found Mr. Quinn's later works to be heavily interpretive. It is easy to be impressed with the sheer number of the footnotes, but the question remains whether the sources safely stand for the cited proposition. In any event, Mr. Quinn's work ventures into a field where little other information is available, and is helpful for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, turns into gossip session about church leaders","review":"The book starts out well written, and somewhat convincing, but the book ends with Quinn just passing along gossip about Church Leaders from anonymous employees in the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City.

Packer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be trusted","review":"This accuracy of this book is not to be trusted. One reviewer of this book found, in just the first chapter, all of the following: \\"(a) blatant misquoting, (b) altering the tone of original reports, (c) making claims without documentation, (d) stretching interpretations of incidents to support claims, (e) ignoring obvious explanations for supposed \\"problems,\\" (f) reaching false conclusions due to insufficient research, (g) omitting evidence contrary to claims, (h) fabricating supposed contradictions, (i) clinging to apparent contradictions that are resolved by even the slightest serious thinking, (j) drawing conclusions contradicted by the book's own evidence, and (k) actually distorting the record to support a thesis.\\" (From \\"A Betrayal of Trust: Review of The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power by D.

After wading through innumerable footnotes that the author seems to think are the mark of a serious scholar, the end result is a weak case based on questionable assumptions and poor reasoning. This book really teaches us nothing new about the Mormon hierarchy. Even by academic standards, the prose is dull and pedantic. I found the work generally a disappointment and a labor to read. This is good bed time reading if you want something to help you get to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least It Isn't plagiarized","review":"One cannot complain that Dr. Quinn has copied his work from someone else--although that includes an accurate quotation of his sources.

It definately feels like sleeping on clouds. The first night I slept all the way through the night and didn't want to get out of bed the next day. I purchased it for around $65. It's worth it. On more thing, I tried it on my Theraputic bed mattress and it does not feel as good. Go figure. I guess it's a good buy for the firm uncomfortable beds or futon like mine.There is an odor when you unwrap it, but it does go away. Just air it out for a few days.

My husband noticed the difference immediately, even though I hadn't told him about it.

It is definitely memory foam, nice and thick, 2\\". I moved less during the night than I usually do, but was also a little warmer than I usually am. In response, I will continue sleeping on the foam but will lighten up on the covers. A good buy so far, and a good price. I've never slept on memory foam before and it's a nice change.

I would recommend to anyone. We purchased a mattress about 8 years ago. It did not hold up. We had a warranty, but we had to pay for a home inspection and then it would be pro-rated. Also, the mattress had to have no stains on it. My husband eats in the bed and he had spilled kool-aid on it that would not come up. So we were stuck with keeping the mattress and could not at this time afford another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep better for sure!","review":"I've been having problems getting a good night sleep for years having back and hip problems.

Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets my expectation","review":"This product meets my expectation. It provides the extra cusion I needed. It does have some strong chemical smell when you open the package and it also appears to be out of shape initially. After laying it flat for a few days, the odder was reduced significantly and the shape was back to normal. I topped it with a mattress pad and cover sheet. Now I can hardly notice the smell. Maybe I got used to it too.Tip: Don't expose it under the sun. I had purchased another pad before (not from the same maker) and placed it outdoor to get rid of the smell. Although no damage was done, it got discolored badly.I ordered a TWIN Extra Long and it fits perfectly for the king size bed (length-wise) on my side of the bed.This is a product I will recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft but Smells","review":"I like the memory foam except for the smell! I let my foam air out for about two weeks and still had to put it under two mattress covers to try to keep the smell down. I still get a whiff of the smell sometimes when turning over. I have bought other brands before that came with a cover and I did not have this problem. The smell may not bother most people, I am more sensitive to smells than most.

I don't want to get out of bed.","review":"I'm writing this review from my bed which I now find to be so comfortable, I don't want to get up.I originally bought this to put on a hard futon that guests sleep on.But I found it to be so comfortable that I'm using it on my bed now.It arrived compressed and needed about 24 hours to expand to its full size.Even at its full size, it is a 1-2\\" smaller than my queen size mattress.I think this is on purpose so that your fitted sheets will still fit.It did smell a little but that went away in a few days.I recommend airing it out in the garage or on a patio.I have been using it for a month now and I has definitely improved my sleep.I used to toss and turn a lot more. I would wake up in the middle of the night and find my arm was numb.Now the bed conforms to me and I feel less pressure points. My wife also feels she gets better quality sleep on this mattress and doesn't feel as achy when she wakes up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatly improves your existing bed...","review":"I'm not going to go into details, but this is a great product. I had no complaints about my mattress, but adding this pad made it so much more comfortable. I'm definitely sleeping better (from night one). I wish I had known about this type of product earlier.As for this particular product, I think I picked the right thickness and \\"density.\\" There are 3 and even 4 inch pads. But since this goes on top of an existing mattress that is designed to be used without a pad, 2 inches of cushioning is about right, I think. And the density may not be as high as other products or full beds, but again, it seems to work well as a mattress \\"topper.\\" Other reviews mentioned a long-lasting smell, but I did not notice anything that lasted more than a few days. And the price was the lowest among similar products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eases back aches","review":"My husband says his back aches improved after using this topper. The foam conforms so well to his body that he now has no need for the new pillows I just bought! I, on the other hand, had to get used to it and feel--after about 2 weeks--that it's more comfortable than our old non-foam mattress topper (I had to get used to the foam forming and re-forming to my body shape when I wanted to quickly change positions). I especially appreciate that there is minimal bed movement when either one of us shifts positions during the night. The only qualm I have is that the foam doesn't fully fit my queen bed, which I understand is intentional so that queen fitted sheets can still fit... but wish it was slightly larger b/c of the obvious shortage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really makes a difference!","review":"We just added this topper to our already cozy mattress and WOW - it made it EVEN more comfortable - it gives a great \\"squish\\" factor to the bed. It also helps to buffer you from the movements of your sleeping partner- it sort of absorbs their movements and keeps you perfectly unaffected. The only thing that i have to say is that there is a \\"new foam\\" smell - that WILL take over the bed - it says to allow a little \\"air-out\\" time - but who can resist immediately putting on the bed ?! I would definitely suggest this product!!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke down after 1mth of use... garbage","review":"Do not waste your money on this POS item. The mattress was firm only for the first two weeks, and then it slowly started breaking down. It's been 3 months since I bought it and I ended up dumping it in the trash today. After a months use the topper was firm in some areas but extremely soft in others, I still decided to give it a shot but after my back/neck started to ache becuase of the toppers insufficient lumbar support I decided to call it quits. I only bought this item because of the rave reiviews on Aamazon and I thought it would be a good addition to my old matterss, but I was wrong.

I would highly recommend airing this topper out before putting it on your bed...the out-of-the-box smell is pretty intense.But wow, I put this memory foam topper on my latex bed (which is mega firm) and the combination is awesome. I can feel the support of the latex mattress, but have a nice soft cushioning that makes getting out of bed nearly impossible.I would have to say though, the memory foam would probably not do as well on a softer mattress - seems like it would sink too much...So yeah, awesome mattress topper - getting out of bed and ready for work has never been more difficult. Can't wait for the weekend so I can sleep in and really enjoy my bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This is a great buy. The smell took about 2 weeks to fade away.

I have trouble getting up in the morning nowadays, and watch more tv than usual. 2'' is the perfect size, anything bigger can cause you to sink into it too much (or at least that's what I've heard). It provides good support, especially if you've got a bit of back pain. Extremely soft, and GREAT GREAT GREAT value. It's THE best $45 I've ever spent.There are a couple downsides to this product. It doesn't fit exactly to my bed size, it's about 1'' shorter all around. But it's better than being too big. Second, the new topper smell stays for a good couple weeks and eventually goes away after about a month. The best tip is to make sure you open it up completely and let it expand to its full potential for about a half a day before using it. A bit of Febreeze doesn't hurt either :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!","review":"Holy smokes! I did not want to get out of bed this morning!

This was the perfect extra bit of soft. It's enough to take the crush out of sleeping on the side but not enough to make the bed soft. Since the XL twin was 30 dollars less than the regular twin, I got that and just whacked off the last three inches with scissors. not pretty but under a sheet, who cares.It did take a few hours to get the crimps out--they pack them super tight and they arrive with serious wrinkles but it all goes away in time so don't worry. Also, don't expect a perfect exact product. I expect they cut them out of huge sheets and precision isn't really a priority. For me, it was great. For a pickier customer, it might seem disappointingly like a big huge slab of memory foam. Which is what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible SMELL!","review":"I don't know why the others have raved about this topper.

I was just about to give up on it, so I sprinkled it with Arm&Hammer; carpet soda and vaccumed, got a plastic zipper mattress bag and had a wonderful night's sleep on my old spare bed.

(I was surprised to see Dietz had other novels out there.) Some characters were pretty stereotypical, and the dialogue was sometimes too rapid fire between the Ellie and Peter.

I know it's hard to be famous worldwide singing in another language different of English, so if you listen to the English versions of her songs, try to listen to the original ones (in French) and you'll realised how good they are (even better than the English versions! I can bet on it!).I hope to see her success soon, and of course to see her more often in the music awards we usually watch on TV.So, I strongly recommend this album, you won't feel dissapointed but if you are, you can sell it to me.Aliz��e, go on singing that way and you'll get the world in your hands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is the best of French pop music, actually.","review":"This album is the best of French pop music, actually.

Unfortunately, Aliz��e seems to have dropped the sound a of songs like \\"Gourmandises\\"- whereas that had a very heavily produced, and powerful beat, the songs on this album have not. The ballady type songs like \\"A Contre-Courant\\" sound like the ballady songs on Gourmandises. However, the catchy, electronic beats of \\"Moi...Lolita\\" have been replaced with a more 'mature' sound you could say. Songs like \\"J'en Ai Marre\\", although catchy, have not got that Boutonnatesque, spine-tingling, electronic feel. I would say to Aliz��e fans, \\"buy this\\", but do not expect such a fresh, sound as the first album.

I wish it came with the flat XL attachment that I have used on a friend's oreck canister. That piece made hard floors and carpets easier to vacuum, it had a dual option for smooth glide or with a brush action. The small round brush attachment that is usually for furniture and drapes is clogging more often than I expected. The bristles may be too long and coming together to closely at the tip. I am going to try storing it with something forcing the bristles more outward to see if reshaping them helps. Otherwise, it is lightweight, easy to use, and does a great job with baseboards, corners, and crown molding. It makes cleaning with indoor pets so much easier.

I didn't think this would be a problem because I often carry my Mini-Mite around, and it comes with a shoulder strap. Well, my whole left arm went to sleep in about 2 seconds and I realized how many times I didn't carry my other one around, and missed the option. The suction is really no better than Eureka Mighty-Mite ($70) and barely better that Eureka Mini-Mite ($40). Oreck should keep their freebies and make their uprights cheaper!Also, though I like my $500 upright, I should have gotten the $300 one.

It also alludes to how close America came to loosing George Washington!The production values, though not cinematic, are above-average.If you are a student of Colonial history and a lover of beautiful films, I would highly recommend seeing this documentary then watching \\"Last of the Mohicans\\".

The first two songs, \\"Mai\\" in which his voice is at its best, and \\"You Are Loved\\" which is just a great song, are the best. \\"February Song\\" is such a smooth listen but it takes a time through to get it; it doesn't get you at first. It is a great album! I am a diverse music listener covering everything from 80's hair bands to Greenday to Josh Groban to Rascal Flatts and very few albums can I say I like at least half the songs.

Josh put so much of himself into this beautiful album--as vocal artist, composer, producer, pianist and drummer. His collaborations with other ubertalented musicians like Imogen Heap, Herbie Hancock, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Dave Mathews, Eric Moquet of Deep Forest, David Foster, and many top-notch instrumentalists have resulted in the ultimate album to enjoy and to give as gifts for any occasion.

Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Josh","review":"With every album, Josh Groban enhances his reputation as one of today's purest, most delightful and versatile vocalists. \\"Awake\\" is no exception, as he offers a range of ballads, classics and pop selections. Perfect for a leisurely afternoon, Groban's soothing and sensitive performances on \\"Awake\\" are a welcome departure from the chaos and cacaphony of everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Josh Groban is great no matter what he is singing. I am disappointed by the choice of songs on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Love Josh Groban's voice, but the selection of tuneless renditions resulted in my fast forwarding most of the CD. Really wish he would stop experimenting and record some tuneful standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awake","review":"Although I liked Josh's new CD, I found the music wasn't quite as appealing to me as in his first 2 CDs. However, no matter what song he sings, his voice gives me a sense of peace and harmony that I haven't found with any other artist in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Not Magical","review":"Josh Groban possesses a rare vocal richness, and this CD showcases that as does all his music. Yet this one largely lacks that \\"je ne sais quoi\\" of his first recording. The musical genius is all there, but something of the way his music can pierce the soul is missing.\\"February Song\\" and \\"Un Giorno Per Noi\\" touch that magic, but \\"Weeping\\" and \\"Machine\\" seem experimental misfits to this type of recording, a style that certainly Groban is capable of producing, but better on a separate release.Despite the lack of \\"magic,\\" Josh Groban is one of the most gifted vocalists of our time, and any recording he makes is necessarily good music. 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay Josh!","review":"I heard so much nit-picking apart of this album that I didn't buy it for a long time. Why? Sure the sound has changed a bit, but if you're not growing as an artist, you're dieing. Josh is at his very brightest when he is being experimental. The tracks with African sounds are two of my favorites. Granted, Machine is a little far off. It's not a bad song, but so different from the rest that I can't get into it. But this is the first of his albums that I've been able to listen to all the way through without skipping tracks -- quite an experience. Looking foward to what he comes out with next."},{"rating":"2","title":"different, but great","review":"This album is somewhat different from Josh's other ones, but some of his best work is on this album, too. You Are Loved is probably the highlight of this album for me. The first ten tracks are very similar to his previous albums, but Josh explores a bit with the last couple tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban Awake CD is best yet!","review":"I really enjoy Josh Groban's music. Although before it was more classical and opra-ish I still liked but now this cd is a lot more contemporary. It doesn't hurt to go onto something like iTunes to at least try and listen if you're not sold on it yet. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I purchased this CD as a gift for my Mom who is a huge Groban fan, but she said this was one of his worst! She was disappointed, saying that it hardly sounded like the Josh Groban she listens to! Now I'm skeptical about purchasing any other CD's of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awake - Josh Groban","review":"I loved his first two CDs but was disappointed in this one. It's quite a departure from the style that made him successful. None of the songs are ones I wanted to listen to over and over again. Nice attempt at creativity but it doesn't fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Album, But Different","review":"OK, let's cut to the chase: You probably won't hate this album. Then again, if you're looking for a repeat of his two MASSIVE hit albums, this isn't it.The music is very pleasant, even romantic at times, and Groban is maturing as an artist while continuing to entertain and charm the ardent.But there isn't a great, important piece like you found in the first two albums, either. Don't get me wrong - I like the album, and I think it's very unfair to expect every artist to hit a one-pitch grand slam with every release. If you never heard him before, you'll be impressed by his power and talent. The die-hard Grobanites are either going to love it \\"just because\\" or hate it because its not what they are used to.Me? I like it, I play it and I would buy it again. It's just that it's not an automatic like the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"This is Josh Groban's best album yet. It has some of his old style operatic ballads along with a few newer different sounds. These new sounds I'm referring to are in the songs \\"Lullaby\\" \\"Machine\\" and \\"Weeping\\". Those three are my favorites because it shows he can do more than the operatic ballads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wasn't aware of the type of music Josh would be singing on this. I should have done my homework, before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After waiting a very long time for this release, and having great expectations over the music which would be represented, I found it to be a disappointment. Too many varieties of music on one CD - it didn't flow and frankly, I'm not even listening to it now. My friends also felt it wasn't as good as previous work - too mixed up - and too many high notes. Sorry to say this as he's a tremendous talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a huge Groban fan, however, found this sadly lacking. I wouldn't have even rated it a 1. There was not one song that I liked. Perhaps he needs to return to some of his writers from the past...Tossed it in the garbage...save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I felt almost sad the first time I heard this CD ,I had such high expectations . For me it's the choice of songs , he should stick with Romance or Love songs ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change is good","review":"After my first listen to this CD, I was unimpressed. My absolute favorite is his self-titled album. But a friend let me borrow her DVD \\"The Making of Awake\\" and it definately changed my opinion. Being able to see the meaning behind the music was very insightful. Plus Josh had more input on this one, which makes it more personal. Now I can say I am hooked on this CD as much as his first. Yes, it is different than his other work, but change is good. How can he grow as an artist if he is doing the same things over and over?Like millions of others, I love his voice and am excited for what the future holds for him. He's not my typical genre of music (hard rock and new country) so I am surprised that I love his music so much. He definately has talent and so much potential. The same cannot be said for most \\"artists\\" on the music scene today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent again and again","review":"Love Josh Groban's voice and his arrangements are done with such wonderful musicians. This album will not disappoint his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban, What a voice.","review":"Once again fantastic. His voice is amazing,I could listen to this cd 24/7. I don\`t think you could go wrong with any of his music, he just keeps getting better and better and to think he\`s really only just begun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, Still Think His First Was Best","review":"My subject line states my opinion. I enjoyed the new album but the first one has my favorite songs by Josh. His voice is fantastic, especially considering his youth. Looking forward to enjoying him for many years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first, but still Josh","review":"Josh Groban is Josh Groban. An amazing young man with a voice like, well, like Josh Groban. It's not as good as his first stuff, but still well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"How beautiful track number 3 is...","review":"What's with you folks? So many reviews and not one mentioning \\"Un dia llegara\\"?! It's by far the most touching song I heard for years. Passion, yearning - it's really uplifting and touching. And I think the serenade-like content gets through even if you don't understand every word of the appropriate lyrics in Spanish.And it is sung by a superb voice.This is the first Josh Groban cd I know, but definitely not the last one. And I should look up the composer's list of works too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"awake by josh groban","review":"I think josh groban's voice is still fresh but his singing is more polished and sophisticated in this more recent CD, one can listen to this collection of songs repeatedly and not get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Contemporary Tenor","review":"The voice of an angel in a project that demonstrates his true abilities to convey emotional interpretation throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor song selection","review":"I own Groban's first two albums and really like them, but this album leaves me cold. The song selection doesn't show off his vocal talent; many of the songs are bland, with childish or poor lyrics. His Spanish pronunciation is a bit off in this one, too. As other reviewers have mentioned, the passion of his previous music is simply gone. What happened, Josh?The only songs in this new style that hold a hint of interest are \\"In Her Eyes\\" and \\"Now Or Never\\" (written by the talented Imogen Heap). I'm wishing I hadn't paid full price for two good songs. Word of advice: Even if you like Groban, check this one out from the library or borrow a copy. Listen to the full CD BEFORE you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awake","review":"I am always surprised that Groban's voice is as good as I think that it is. The selections are good and worth listening to again and again. Share it with others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third is NOT the charm","review":"Josh has an amazing voice, and as a long-time fan I am sad to say this album is a far cry from the first two. A very different choice of songs that appears generic and is lacking his usual passion. And what is up with the lullaby? What saves this CD are the very good italian songs, oozing with passion and Josh's usual refinement. Bottomline: if you're not into poppy Josh, don't buy this CD, or if you do, get the extended version with \\"Verita\\" another very good italian song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album","review":"Josh groban album Awake is a great album. Is great to see a new recording in vinyl and enjoy it on a turntable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Love his music and voice - Awake","review":"I first saw Josh on our local KEET TV channel.

This album is garbage there is no power in his voice anymore no songs like you raise me up or The Prayer. I was very disappointed with this album maybe if I listen to it more I'll learn to live with it but as for now I wonder what happened with this. He had some great duets as well in his other albums the new one not so much. Also anyone want to take a stab why he sang lullaby? Can you say thats the icing on the cake for why this album is disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"complaint","review":"I will never review a product again from your darn Amazon site . . . and may not ever order form you again . . .the last time I reviewed an item . . .it showed up on GOOGLE SEARCH with my address too . . .and I certainly prefer not to have you banter around GOOGLE my name , address etc. . . .very disappointed in your poor judgement . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asleep","review":"Hyperbole is a fool's tool, but I am dumbstruck at the hosannas bestowed upon this latest release from this pseudo-classical popera artist. I'm sure he's a nice enough boy, but as he jettisons toward each next high note, it signifies nothing, really. Granted, this new discharge is a leap ahead of his previous turgidly droning releases - I'd wish he'd forgo his awkward use of a multilingual erudition altogether - but he and his ilk remain a philter for the wishful thinking, and a gallimaufry of clich��'s for the rest of us. Perfect voice for a Christmas Collection, though. My grade: B-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"Josh follows his previous work with some very insightful songs.

There isn't one single song that I enjoy. I actually find it very irritating to listen to, so will probably never play again. I did love his song \\"You Lift me up\\" (from another album)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not his best. but good","review":"I have loved the music of Josh Groban since the beginning. this new album is not his best. the music is lacking the spark. He can do better. after playing this CD over and over.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend to the music?...","review":"I am giving Josh Groban 5 stars for his voice and 0 stars for his selection of music.Maybe it's not his fault, maybe it's the producer's.We all know that some other artists with a bad voice are trying to sing songs who were sang by great singers. They were just simply killing it. In this case is just the opposite, these horrible songs are killing Josh Groban's voice. The reason why the CD is #1 seller on Amazon, because he has done so well with the previous albums, that people don't read the reviews or listen to the previews.I am waiting for #4 release... I am really curious..."},{"rating":"2","title":"New sound, still great","review":"This CD is quite a shift from Josh's previous work, with a mix of lighter, radio-friendly tracks, african-infused a cappella, and a closing song that's a jazz/alternative collaboration with Herbie Hancock. Most of the songs are in Enlish, which will appeal to the less classically-inclined fans, while Josh's vocals are as strong as ever. The opening track \\"Mai\\" sounds like it was written for the opening scene of an epic film (very powerful vocals, great sound). \\"You are loved,\\" \\"February Song,\\" and \\"Now or Never\\" will probably be the most sucessful on popular radion stations, while \\"So She Dances\\" sounds like a new take on mood music from the 1940's ballroom scene. My personal favorites, \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Weeping,\\" both with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, show a verastility of sounds that wasn't present on Josh's earlier albums. Overall, another great CD from Josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Continues To Grow & Stretch....","review":"With \\"AWAKE\\" Josh Groban Continues To Showcase His Musical Tastes & Talents!!!

Lyrics that speak to the fundamental experience of love and belonging, the desire for connection within all of us, set against a beautifully balanced arrangement--and made a classic by Groban's extraordinary vocals.Like X-Patriate's \\"The Cost\\" and \\"I'd Rather Close My Eyes\\" fromGreetings From Lafayette Park, or S and G's Bridge Over Troubled Water, sweeping music combined with a deep and powerful voice that creates shivers up my spine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet!","review":"I have all of Josh's CD's and this is my favorite!

Just doesn't seem to grab you like his earlier ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One from Groban!","review":"Wow! I loved his others CDs and this one is just as good! Even though half the songs are in Italian, they have really grown on me. I can't understand the words, but the songs are still beautiful. One of my favorite qualities about his music is that his songs seem to be very romantic, which makes them really easy to fall in love with! Haha.It was all great, except the final song on the CD had a bit of a techno beat, something I didnt expect, and still strikes me as odd.Overall, this CD is a great buy and I'd recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awake","review":"Love it.

Thanks again."},{"rating":"1","title":"really not a good effort","review":"I loved Groban's first CD. His second CD was almost as good, but not quite. This one really misses the mark. The songs lack passion. One of the songs sounds like he's got a cold. At least one song is so full of falsetto that he sounds horribly off key. Most of the songs are just boring to listen to because he sounds bored singing them. The title of the CD, \\"Awake\\" is listed as a \\"bonus\\" track. How does that make any sense?!? What a contrast from the passion and energy of his first CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Groban","review":"I for one can't say that Josh does any wrong.

I'd like to hear a little more skilled rolling of his \\"r\\"s and a softer sound to his \\"t\\"s when singing Italian songs.I am probably the only person in the western hemishpere who didn't like \\"You Raise Me Up\\" but that song is the reason I never bought the CD.Awake is something else. This just might be the CD to win the rest of us hold-outs over. It's won me over with his versatility, his willingness to take artistic chances, his ability to have some fun with a very serious voice. He's different--he's cool--he's talented. I'm hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best!","review":"Josh Groban's third album is as good as the first two. Some of the songs are not typical Josh Groban, something I didn't expect, but still enjoyable just the same.

Truth be told, this CD is fabulous. I've listened several times and I truly enjoy every song.

There are three, four songs in this album that I love to listen to, a couple that are so so, and the rest I feel kind being disappointed. but if you are a fan of Josh, you might still want to keep a copy of it -- like me, to only listen to his voice makes me happy~"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Oops\\" is right.","review":"This video is nothing like the others.

However, fundamentally very good. I would highly suggest this for a beginner player as well as someone who needs to possibly 'tune up' their game due to being rusty or whatever. Relativly cheap, as well as Phil Gordon is a very good person for explinations with thought process. Overall, it's worth the money.

It is simple enough to download songs and it comes with all the accesories needed.

I called the company and was on hold for one hour. When I got through the tech started reading the manual to me. He said either it was defective or I was using files that were protected (illegal download). Basically I think that this player might be ok as long as you are not using an online serice to fill it such as napster or rhapsody. But it is worthless if you are.

In comparison, this Coby mp3 player is Much easier to use. It has superior battery life (30 hrs) to many of the other mp3 players that i have researched.

This player is very basic, but for the money does exactl what it says. It holds enough songs to get me through a 2 1/2 hour routine. Sounds pretty good and is very easy to work. Couple of drawbacks: The headphones that come with it has a very short cord and the battery runs down pretty fast (usually replace it about once a week, so I guess it can run for about 10 hours total before it needs a new battery). Other than that it looks pretty cool and is very small (fits in my pocket while I walk around)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought one, won't work","review":"The Coby MP-C741 I bought won't work.

I don't think it has enough bass sound, but for its price, its not bad. The controls are great, but I have noticed that some electronically challenged people try to operate the cd controls with the cassette buttons. That is probably because the cassette controls are closer to the CD door that the CD controls. The pictures on the CD control, a single large button, should probably stand out more.

It was. The sound quality is frequently quite poor, especially in the extremes of tenor and bass.

Almost all my CDs skip frequently using this player, even though NONE of them have ever given me a problem with ANY other player.

What happened to songs like \\"Johnny Quest..\\", \\"3 Quarts Drunk\\", or \\"Shotgun\\"? The worst song on \\"Pezcore\\" is better than anything on this CD. Other than the cool slide-thing on the CD case, this one is a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy for fans","review":"this cd is fun to listen to even though it sounds kinda like their other albums. less than jake still delivers the same fast-paced punk/ska that fans love, so if you're a fan u need this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why 4 stars and not 5?","review":"You ask why did I give this aewsome cd 4 stars instead of 5 one reason is because it has very few trumpets and horns compared to Loser's King and Pezcore. But don't get me wrong these punkers from Gainsville are still my favorite and they will continue to be as long as they make great lyrics and kickin tunes. So if you want a cd that will remain in your cd player for a long time then you should get Borders and Boundaries plus its on Fat Wreckcords which make it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Ever since I heard Losing Streak, I loved Less than Jake. They always exeplfied what a ska band should be. I bought Pez-core and was also greatly satisfied with it. After Losing Streak came Hello Rockview. It was different, with more of a punk edge, but in my opinion, equally good to Losing Streak. Then there was Borders and Boundries. I popped it in the CD player with anticipation, and what do I get? Not ska, not punk, but utter mainstream [garbage]. Pathetic, slow songs with humorless lyrics and no ska guitar to speak of. They sound like Blink 182 with horns. This album was a sad attempt to make more money and, in the process, anger all the fans that truly love Less than Jake. This ... release makes me worried about what the new album will sound like. If they could go back to their roots that would be great, but sadly, I don't see that happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borders and Boundries is a Disgrace","review":"When i first bought this CD i was expecting a follow-up to hello rockview (which was a good cd...but no where close to Losing Streak). Instead i found out that LTJ quickly turned from a ska band to a pop band. After Losing Streak which is definitly there best album out of the six LTJ albums i own, LTJ kind of dropped the ball with hello rockview, but it was still a decent cd. Now B&B sounds nothing like the old LTJ, a more mature LTJ, yes but who wants that. There is no more bari sax and it is mostly guitar now. IF you are a loyal LTJ fan then you could get this cd, but if you are just getting into ltj, please pick up a Losing Streak or a Pezcore. I only gave it 2 stars because the case is pretty cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same thing you heard b4!","review":"Its good, im not saying its bad. The songs are catchy and you hum them all day and tap your foot, but they are the same. If you have ANY LTJ cd, save the $15. All of the songs sound the same. On the other hand if you are just getting into LTJ, get it. Its worth it if you dont know any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN SOMEONE SAY SELLOUTS?","review":"LESS THAN JAKE WAS MY FAVORITE BAND Of aLL TIME. I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

Hello Rockview was good, but not as good as Losing Streak. Then this piece of [junk] came out. Everything on this album is slow and lacking in the usual ska energy. Only one song is worth listening to(Mr. Chevy Celebrity) and that is a short song with no horns. If you are a ska or punk fan, DON'T by this album. If you are a fan of Billy Joel or something old and lame like that, this is for you. I'm surprised Fat Mike allowed this atrocity to appear on his wonderful record company."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new trashy LTJ","review":"I had wrote a review the day this cd came out saying it rocked. But i wrote that before the music actually hit got to my brain. Being a LTJ fan from the birth, this cd is pitiful. I basically dislike everysong on the cd. If you are a true ltj fan u will find this cd to be trash. I was so disapointed in it. It lacks everything that i ever liked, which basically is Horns, and just the SKA in itself. Do your self a favor, if you are just learning about LTJ now, save the trouble of wasting money on this, and buy Losing Streak. That is truly LTJ. As for this, this is just foreign LTJ, Trash in itself!One more thing, IM still a huge fan of LTJ, but untill they correct this mess, im sticking With Reel Big Fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"More mature but still good ol' LTJ","review":"OK, OK, I have noticed how many of the reviews of Borders and Boundaries emphasize LTJ's movement away from ska, and that the songs are too slow. Yes, the punk-ska genre has a tried and true formula, but expanding upon it and giving it your own signature flair is what the punk part is all about. And this is what LTJ is doing on Borders and Boundaries. They explore slower tempos on a few of the tracks, but for the most part, this is your typical LTJ. The hooks are plentiful on this album, especially on songs like \\"Magnetic North,\\" \\"Look What Happened,\\" and \\"The Last Hour of the Last Day of Work. I'm sure that the songs on LTJ's latest release will work very well live, and for those of you who haven't yet seen them live, I strongly suggest you do, it's quite an experience!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wham Bam Thank you Less Than Jake","review":"I love it and any LTJ fan will also!Very similar to Hello Rockview but in a good way.The lyrics are awesome.Every song has just the right elements including some awesome horns with that distinctly brassy Less Than Jake sound.Ive been a die hard fan since Pez Core came out.If I love it then so will you!They have definately strengthened themselves 10 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet to be topped","review":"When Chris says, \\"I swear it's the last time.\\" in Track 4, he's not kidding, well as far as making an awesome album goes. This album is Less Than Jake at its most tolerable (which I consider its best). The guys sound like they really have talent, and the lyrics are a bit deeper than previous releases. While the strange lack of \\"whoa-oh-oh's\\" in the songs may turn away the hard core Less Than Jake fan, this is definitely the one album that's just so good you'll never want to listen to another Less Than Jake album again...seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but different is.........damn good","review":"If you are wanting to hear you typical less than jake album, then your in for a suprise. This album is one if not my favorite album by the band. This album shows a more....yes im going to say it, mature side to the punk/ska band out of gainsville. For your first LTJ album i do not recomend this one though. But for you long time LTJ fans, this one kicks major booty, and no matter who you are you will NOT be dissappointed, unless you dont like this kind of music, then what are you even doing reading this review. TO sum it all up, get the album, its the best album i got all year....and i got a lot of albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great cd....","review":"LTJ is a great band, who usually put out great cd's but in this case they didnt. It does have a few good songs but the rest are pretty bad. I would say this is their worst cd yet. If you are looking for a LTJ cd to buy, dont get this one get Hello Rockview. But if you have all the other cd's go ahead and get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its A Grower","review":"well i own losing streak and hello rockview and i was dissapointed when i first heard this album, but as i listened to it more and more it grew on me, now i think borders and boundries is a truly great album, and i would recomend it to anyone and everyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I should have seen it comming. They kept maturing from CD to CD, and eventually it would be inevitable that they would lose their edge. Less Than Jake definately lost their edge on \\"Borders and Boundries.\\" It is not the perfect blend of ska and punk; that would be \\"Hello Rockview\\" and \\"Losing Streak.\\" \\"Borders and Boundries\\" sounds more like Blink 182 than any real punk band-- way too pop and catered to those who listen to MTV. There are a few good songs (\\"Subburban Myth,\\" \\"Gainesville Rock City,\\" and \\"Bad Scene and a Basement Show,\\" but everything else is pop and therefore garbage. If you like pop, buy this CD. If you are a true fan of LTJ, ska, punk, and skacore, stay away from this; it'll make you jaded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as many horns, but just as good if not better","review":"Less Than Jake is an awesome ska/punk band. Some fans might not like this CD because of the abscence of horns, but dont listen to those idiots, this CD kicks ass. Gainsville Rock City, and Look What happened are a few standouts. This whole CD is great, maybe not the best LTJ, but clearly 5 star potential, LTJ are clearly the kings of ska,(Reel Big Fish Rock too) but this album takes a more punk- approach, which is why i like it. I dont think LTJ can make a bad CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best","review":"this was not a usual LTJ cd. it seems like they almost completely lost their ska sound and went more to pop-punk. some of the horns on here sound fake, and the songs were pretty weak. but you should just get this cd for \\"look waht happened (the last time)\\" thats a really great song, so is \\"last hour...\\" even though its only pretty much 3 chords. but get pezcore, losing streak, and hello rockview before u get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW LTJ!","review":"What can you say about the new Less Than Jake album? Well, I can say two things: it rocks, and it rocks hard. Fast energetic pop-punk with horns, I mean what more could you want?

Some of the steps take a couple run throughs to get down and I would recommend getting the feet patterns down before trying to add the arms. It is not a \\"killer\\" workout and is perfect for those of us who want to begin working out and for those who want a break in their more strenuous exercise routines. It works and its fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes I feel the burn but it's fun","review":"Yes this is an exercise video but when I turn it on and start following the moves, I feel more like I am dancing. The drums are incredible and are a great change from the generic \\"exercise\\" music in other videos. In the very beginning of the video they show the whole dance that you will be learning. Then instead of going over each move step by step, stopping and working on each new step and boring me (like in some belly dance videos) they began with the first step worked on it, transitioned to the second step, put the two together, then the third step and then put them together from the top, ect. You get the idea. You built upon each step introduced and then put them all together in the end. There was no wait time while I watched the dancers demonstrate. It was a lot of fun but it burns my buns and thighs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing workout","review":"So I really like the idea of Hula dance as a way to workout. It seems like it would be really fun and simple to do. I found that its wasn't challenging enough and that I gave me NO feel that I had worked out. I personally like to feel that ache in my muscles after a good workout. With this I got nothing. I would really like to know if this works for anyone else. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who really wants to have a good workout.

I've owned the Tahitian Cardio and Tahitian Hip Hop for ever a year now and loved it! The first workout I did was the Cardio Hula. WOW!!! I was feeling that right away!! Hula seems to be a more controlled workout than Tahitian. I was dripping in sweat by the midpoint of the workout. My hips and legs were so sore at the 15 min mark lol. The only downside I have for the DVD is that they tend to go through the new moves pretty fast. i had to keep rewinding it so I could get the moves down.

This recording added just the right amount of ambience. It is very successful. (There was no reason to eliminate Glenn Goulds \\"humming\\"; it obviously helped him to give superior performances, and was part of his authentic style. In any case the original recording of this piece had almost no audible humming sound.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating and controversial","review":"The recordings certainly sound \\"Gouldian\\", in that they accurately mirror the pianist's contrapuntal clarity, chord balances, accents, dynamic shifts, pedaling, and hair-trigger precision. A few details even appear more precise than in 1955, such as the ever-so-tiny split bass note in Variation 12's first measure, corrected here. Yet the intensity behind note attacks seems softened, rounder overall sonority, along with the surround sound ambience that markedly contrasts to the close-up dryness Gould often favored in his recordings.In other words, the musical performance is liberated from the recorded artifact itself. Goodbye to 1955 mono, and to studio noises like piano bench squeaks and foot stomps. And goodbye to Gould humming along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Experience","review":"I have lived with this historic recording through all its manisfistations - mono, enhanced mono, remix, digital remix and now Zenph rerecord. The reuslts are just incredible on this new release and Gould himself would have been the first to applaud.These grumpy people stuck in the past are pains -- they are the same people who screamed when vinyl lp disappeared, still pine away for Milinov and the good old days.Give yourself a thrill and listen to this disc with headphones - especially the one that simulates Gould's actual left hand- right hand playing - that alone is worht the price of the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classics never die; just reborn!","review":"This masterful re-edition allows the new generations may even get closer to what this recording meant in 1955 for the musical universe. It's hard to guess how many listeners became music lovers of this genre, because of Gould was -if I may- the first and possibly the greatest artistic achievement in the history of the music.These Goldberg meant a true openess and at the same time the most convincing proof the classic music was far to be considered a status issue reserved just for a minory. Besides it illuminated the interpretative flame of many new pianists who understood had became an icon of the instrument and a key force in what Bach's music concerned.The superb quality of sound is outstanding, and due the fact that 25 years ago Gould left us, we have the suspect there will be mnusch more pleasant surprises of Sonny in what concerns new releases of this genius of the keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT Glenn Gould","review":"To those who rated this recording and gave it 5 stars: you are absolutely right, the sound quality is perfect, clear, crisp, full... and yes, what an achievement by Zenph!But then: let us take two little words out of the title - \\"Glenn Gould\\", and everything becomes perfect and I'd be the one to rate it 5 stars! Unfortunately, these are two that - according to Zenph - matter!There is simply no Glenn Gould around! There is no magic of this performance, no drive, no humming (and - for the owners of top headphones - this is an essential part of what made Glenn Gould unique!).so... if you're in for acoustically perfect rendering of the Goldberg Variations, then this one's for you!If you're in for high-quality Glenn Gould... Forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novelty at best","review":"This is like listening to a modern pianist trying to imitate Gould, yet falling way short. The \\"Zenph\\" lacks Gould's touch, unique phrasing, nuance, dynamics... and the piano used sounds nothing like anything Gould would employ (and he was VERY picky about the sound of his piano). This recording is a novelty; nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"...not as good as some other piano versions (in my opinion, of course) - notably Angela Hewitt's and Murray Perahia's. Of course, this an historic recording (or rather re-performance of an historic recording). The sound is brilliant and Gould's dazzling virtuosity is fully on show - and, joy, oh joy, without him moaning along! However, there is still the impression that this idiosyncratic interpretation is more Gould than Bach. Be in no doubt, for lovers of the Goldbergs, this recording is worth owning and we owe Glenn Gould an enormous debt of gratitude for rescuing this long-neglected masterpiece, but the reading has now been surpassed. This is a splendid, cleaned-up historical masterpiece and none the worse for that, but the art of Goldberg performance has moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISCOURAGING","review":"I do not presume of being a Bach, Gould, or even a general music expert. I just happen to love music in general, and don't have any special or academic qualification, but let me tell you this. I just downloaded the original version and the Zenph reperformance from iTunes. They are *really* different. Many people --many of whom have given less than three stars to this experiment-- have conceded that \\"all the notes are there\\". But all I can say is: the two versions are as similar as a Gould vs a very talented and obsessive Gould's fan. Even I, who had never listened to any of the versions, could feel the difference. I think the label \\"re-performance\\" should not be used; only monetary compensation could have prevented Gould's heirs to sue this company for taking GG's name for its experiment. Had they been fair, they should have labeled this \\"in the manner of...\\", or something similar. NOBODY could take this for the original Glenn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dubious and Disappointing","review":"This was a dubious enterprise which achieved a disappointing product. An exact recreation of Gould's performance is of course impossible. One can actually hear differences in touch and piano sonority. But the surprising part is that the recording of the player piano is just not that good. It is muffled in the extreme.Circa 1915, the makers of the state of the art player piano solicited Artur Schnabel. They wanted him to cut a piano roll, telling him that the rolls could now reproduce 18 different ways of striking a key. Schnabel said \\"Ah, but I have 19\\" and refused. Technology has improved and the numbers are higher, but the aesthetic issues are the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither one thing nor the other","review":"I did not, when I put this disc on, expect to hear a Glenn Gould back from the dead in my sitting room. Nor to hear the \\"soul\\" of the original recording. But I did hope that the disc might reveal more of the Goldbergs - as so many other performances on disc have done - but I am not sure it does. Pleasant to listen to but no more than that. Neither echt Gould nor something to savour for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased, But Essential for the Marx Brothers Fan","review":"As the only book to focus specifically on the life of Chico, this book is indispensible. Written by his daughter Maxine after his death (and, it would seem, partially in response to Groucho's off color comments about Chico in \\"The Marx Brother's Scrapbook\\"), this book focuses primarily on her first hand account of his life. Now, you figure, she was born as the Brothers were starting their rise to Broadway stardom, so most of the material is post-Vaudeville - not a bad thing if the movies and late stage productions are your thing, though details about them are sparse.While I think this book presents an excellent (and, as other's have said) candid view of Chico through Maxine's eyes, he doesn't really have a \\"voice\\" in it. In some ways, she is too close to the subject to really allow Chico to be a flesh and blood human being.Neverless, if you've read the pile of books on Groucho or \\"Harpo Speaks,\\" you should really read this one, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, dull, pointless","review":"I read this book as a teen when it first came out.

Not unlike Texas itself, it is vast and complicated but boils down to a few simple truths. Its two most enigmatic characters are an honest cop fleeing the chaos of his past, and a hard-working country woman attempting to discover hers, but they are complemented by insightful beef-jerky-tough older ladies and a town full of familiar personalities. As our publishing industry spirals into the increasing irrelevance of niche publishing and empty drama, it is refreshing to find an independent author with this much tenacity toward storytelling in its most vivid form."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not purchase","review":"ordered this flashlite as a Xmas gift: 1st one did not work: 2nd one broken: it's 1/13/10 waiting on a refund!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"The product works as described.

Well, as many reviewers have said, be careful. You will burn yourself at least once. The handles are tricky and you have to tip at a certain angle or the top will fall out and your pasta will tumble into the sink. However, it is definitely non-stick and easy to clean, but you won't care because you will have lost your appetite waiting for water to boil in it. I am online today looking for a Calphalon hard anodized pot even if it costs twice as much. No one should wait over 25 minutes for water to boil!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joining in with the naysayers","review":"I have tried to like this pot - in theory it sounds great, but in actual usage, it is very problematic. The non-locking handles are the chief drawback - you need to awkwardly hold them closed with pot holders while draining - and the acute angle needed to remove all the water inevitably means leaking hot water on to the holders and hence on you.

It's generous size makes it great for not only Pasta but stews and soups. The vented lid is not only great for straining, but also while food is cooking to prevent boil-overs.

The pasta cooks very nicely in it and does not stick at all. Handles don't 'lock' in the traditional sense but are engineered to clamp up against the lid holding it securely when you drain liquids. There are sets of small and large holes which allow you a choice when draining liquids. You do need to be careful to wear protective devices on your hands and pour the liquid off slowly and carefully, or it can run down your hands and arms. I use wood utensils on all these new-generation non-stick surfaces and they do not scratch. I highly recommend this pot for cooking food in liquids and draining it off successfully. Just be careful when pouring to avoid burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure what everyone is whining about","review":"This is the best pan I have ever bought for $10. True it is not the best pan out there, but for the price it is. It has a great non stick surface that is easy to clean, and a heavy duty bottom for even heating.Not sure how all these people seem to burn themselves, it not very complicated to drain a pot and keep the lid on. Heck the handles hold the lid so it doesn't fall off.The only thing I wish it had was a lid that wasn't vented, for cooking things other than pasta, either be able to close the vents/strainer or come with an additional lid.

I was truly amazed at how good this protein bar tasted. It's was almost difficult to distinguish between this product and a Snickers, Milky Way or 100 Grand. Of course, they have to tone it down a little bit to make it healthy and pack in the protein, but SERIOUSLY - give this bar a try and you will see what I mean.

I got them for $7.99 with a free hand towel, and they aren't even worth that much. Some of the loops looked like they had been snagged on something when I received them, I washed the towels and they have fuzz balls everywhere. The edges on some of the towls have came unstitched and are all fraid after only the 2nd wash. I would NEVER ever buy these towels again. No way are they 100% cotton and worth more then $2 a piece. These are junk towels I would use in my dogs crate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin for a name brand towel :-(","review":"I bought these towels to wash my car, so I wanted a thick soft 100% cotton nap. What I received was on par with the thin towels you'd find at cheap hotel - not thick or soft. On the plus side, the sewed in tag did say 100% cotton and it was made in the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Kindle edition","review":"I'm not rating Drabble's novel. I think it's a regular Drabble novel, fully representative of her style. But the edition I read - the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt edition to Kindle devices - is an unacceptable one. It's full of errors. There is a lot of sentences with no punctuation. There is a lot of misspelling words - \\"Creek\\" instead of \\"Greek\\", \\"Erst\\" instead of \\"first\\" and so on. I think there isn't a single page without mistakes. It's annoying. It seems an amateurish scanning, using a bad OCR software. I am asking Amazon to exchange this terrible edition for the Penguin edition, which I hope it's better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good camera","review":"I received this camera from my husband as a gift right before our son was born. What a mistake this purchase was. It is large and bulky, but the worst thing is that the picture quality is very unpredictable. Some photos turn out ok, others are just awful. The zoom lens almost always takes fuzzy pictures. This is NOT operator error - I have had other cameras and never had problems like this. I also HATE that the camera pauses for a full second when you hit the shutter button before the photo actually takes. When you have small children, their smiles are unpredictable and I've missed too many great shots because this camera paused for too long. I'm going to get rid of this one and buy myself an Olympus Stylus. My advice is to stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, lots of info, but sloppy","review":"I bought this book and read most of it in one night; I couldn't put it down because the subject is so fascinating. A huge number of films are given short reviews: some I knew, some I didn't. The tome's small size and attractive design helped me keep reading into the wee hours. But I became gradually more annoyed when I discovered how carelessly the book was written and edited (if there was an editor at all). Misspells and typos abound: Herzog's film on Kinski, \\"My Best Fiend\\" is shown as \\"My Best Friend,\\" thus completely missing the point. Great character actor Theodore Bikel is cited as \\"Theodore Bickel\\" - and these are only two out of dozens of similar, inexcusable mistakes. If Rough Guide can't afford a decent proofreader, maybe they should stick to travel guides. If they had only been more careful, the book would deserve an enthusiastic five stars, rather than the grudging four stars I give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good information in a pocket-sized book","review":"There are lots of little tidbits of info to be gleaned from this cool little book. Hundreds of cult films are included, though there are some I wouldn't have included (like APOLLO 13, THE PERFECT STORM, SEE SPOT RUN and TITANIC), and some they overlooked (THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, GREASE, THE MATRIX, etc.), but overall this volume has a nice mixture of titles, broken down into many categories and a handy index.

Forester and this was one of them. This is the story of a World War I officer -- Charles Randall -- and his experiences in life ranging from the Great War, his wife (and her questionable morals), his success as an inventor and more. This work has the feel of a traditional fiction novel written in Forester's classic style. If you are looking for another naval story by Forester this is not for you, but if you like Forester overall and want to see how wide his range was then give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spongebob !","review":"I love this key chain !

I listened to his rhymes, his flow, etc. etc. He's not awful, but he didn't break any new ground musically. Pick up a copy of 'Long Live the Kane' by Big Daddy Kane (recorded two years earlier than To the Extreme) and you can see EXACTLY where he got his musical inspiration from. Like I said though, his stuff is good comedy. Seeing a white boy in a \\"Down By Law\\" leather jacket, talking like a homeboy and claiming that he's killing the competition (i.e. sucker MCs) is good for a laugh. But come on, people - unless you think you're being really cool and ironic, there's no disputing the fact that Vanilla Ice is just a wannabe rapper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even fit for a cup stand...","review":"This album is terrible. And, NO! I am not just saying that because he's just a lame poser, this is really a terrible album. Ice Ice Baby does not have a cathcy beat.. And nor does the whole album. His vocals are squeaky and just sound lame. I tried to make some use of it.. No I really did! I tried using it as a cup stand but i realized i would poison my drink! This album is so lame I couldn't even run over it! (it would've touched my car) So I realized that in hell nothing survives... so on Christmas day I burned it in my fire. More seriously though. This albums beats are annoying, and the rhymes are lame. Do NOT waste money on it.

I bought it during a trip in Florida about ten years ago, I was only 10 years old, back then, and Vanilla Ice was the hottest act out there. Of course, his fame didn't last long and nobody buys his albums now. But heck, I swear to God that To the Extreme is one of the best rap albums ever, and I can still listen to it and dance to its infectious beats. I truly believe he paved the way for other white rappers such as Eminem, even if that would make Slim Shady sick to his stomach to admit it since he absolutely loathes VIce...just as all the rappers do. Well, he may be a has-been, he may be considered ridiculous and his lyrics truly show he thinks he's God or something. But in his own way, he was a pioneer of rap music, and even though his chances of being famous again are very slim, at least, he can console himself by knowing that everyone remembers his first (and last) smash hit, Ice Ice baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is only the first not the last","review":"This is not his best album but his evolution only gets better.

The facts are these: The baseline for the most popular song was a cheap and unapologetic rip-off of Queen and David Bowie's \\"Under Pressure\\", denials of other reviewers notwithstanding. The fact is that the music is marginal in any sense of the word, and revelations regarding Mr. Van Winkle's 'creative' interpretations of his own past make it even more difficult to take seriously.

Vanilla Ice deeply hurt the future of white hip-hop. Right now, there's Eminem, and that's about it. I gave this album 2 stars because even I'll admit that \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" is a cool song (of course he stole the beat for it from David Bowie and Queen). The rest of the album though is frankly, well, BAD. Plus, after this album, did you ever hear anything about Vanilla Ice again other that Behind the Music on VH1? If you said yes, you're living in a fantasy world. In conclusion, I don't regret that I bought this cd because every once in a while I'll put \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" on for a listen, but if you don't like that song, I wouldn't even think of reccomending this album to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"Don't listen to the naysayers.

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"To The Extreme Review","review":"I really don't know what to think, but one song does stand out, like a sore thumb, that is, and that's none other than that cult classic song \\"I Love You\\". Take it from me Iceman, there is no way you can rap a love song and to even try means you have probably have got balls the size of grapefruits. The first time I heard it, I cracked up with laughter, and even now. Another song I don't get is, \\"Having A Roni\\", try to explain that to me. Also that one song, \\"Ice Is Workin' It\\", exactly what is Ice workin'? The only song worth a listen is \\"Ice Ice Baby\\".

His lyrics and beats made hip-hop blush and many from then on took hip-hop for a joke. Thanks Vanilla for making a mokery of hip-hop culture. Trust me, this CD is trash and before you let Mr. Ice give you have a false perception of hip-hop, pick up some Beastie Boys, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, The Roots, etc. If you buy this album, let it be for destructive purposes. Or better yet, use it as a frisbee, paperweight, or a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album ever","review":"Vanila ICE has gotta be the illest MC ever. People say he's wack, but I don't believe them. I've heard supposed \\"masterpeices\\" such as \\"Sgt Pepper\\" or \\"Dark Side\\", and they can't measure up to the GENIUS on this album. His ryhmes flow so smoothly, plus who else can write the deep emotional lyrics that he does. I get chills up and down my spine when I play this album. I start to get a little emotional too when I play this album. It reminds me of my youth, listening to other GENIUSES such as Right Said Fred and C&C Music Factory. 1991 was the BOMB. It's a shame that people have forgotten the true INNOVATORS of music like ICE and the above mentioned musicians. Everyone should own this!

Everyone turned on this guy because he wasn't really \\"from the streets\\", correct me if I'm wrong but the music is still the same no matter what his background is.

It is a beautiful art form if exacted correctly, but Vanilla Ice is just plain awful. He obviously does not get that music should mean something, it should not be a bunch of self praising [stuff], like what this product is.

Add to this the fun of tracks such as 'You're wearin' out your welcome, Matt', 'Wimmen, who needs 'em!', and guest appearances by Emmylou Harris, and Asleep at the Wheel and this album becomes a definite best buy. This is not to slight in the least the excellent musicianship or songwriting of Ranger Doug, Woody Paul, and Too Slim.

There were several helpful phrases, but I would NEVER use adjectives such as \\"antisocial, tense, overcritical, impertinent, quarrelsome, resentful, or nervous\\" to describe a student. They sound very judgmental and can be worded differently to get the point across. I also felt most of the phrases in each category - \\"academic achievement\\" for example, were negative comments... ex: \\"fails to, never, sacrifices, needs to, makes mistakes, is confused about, has difficulty, doesn't always, is inconsistent, would improve if...\\"I may be wrong, but I would appreciate more POSITIVE academic/behavior comments as most of my students are doing well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This product helps me every time I have to do report cards or progress reports.

So just sit back and enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"When three is better than seven","review":"I loved the Three Stooges movies when I was a kid so I couldn't wait to see this with my kids. They loved it! Sure the acting is a twee hammy but this is a kid's movie after all.

My kids are now asking to get the Three Stooges Meet Hercules and In Orbit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow White and the 3 Idiots.(That's a compliment)","review":"This is the first Three Stooges film I ever saw. I must say that as a fariy tale movie it's wonderful. Lots of action, nice acting, a little PG action, wonderful skating, and a little PG action... They provide pretty good comic relief, but compared to their shorts and other films, they just don't have that Stooge humor. The Stooges said their part in this film was small...I have to agree with them. Overall, a good film if you want a fariy tale film, but if your expecting a load of slapstick, sound effects, and zainness, I say this again... Then again, you see the film and judge for yourself:)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people insane?","review":"What's with all of the favorable reviews on here?!? Snow White and the Three Stooges was one of the worst movies I've ever seen...EVER. I love the Stooges, and it was really pitiful to watch three of the funniest men in the history of comedy lower themselves to these depths. Not a single second of this movie is even remotely funny. If you're really interested in watching Moe Howard frolick around with Snow White on ice skates, this film is for you. Otherwise, avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Three Stooges Movie","review":"How can you go wrong with the Three Stooges?I am a Three Stooges fan from way back and I have to admit this is not the best of their movies. The Three Stooges (Moe, Larry, and Curly Joe) stand in for the Dwarfs (the boys are house-sitting for them while they are away), Carol Heiss (1960 Olympic skating champion) is Snow White and the setting is in the fairy tale of castles and forests. You will still be pleased with a pie in the face but there is not a whole lot of other slapstick.The plot is essentially the same as the fairy tale. The Stooges are substitutes for the vacationing Dwarfs, and responsible for uniting Snow White with her Prince. The Prince has grown up with the Stooges, who have a traveling medicine show, when they rescued him from an assassination attempt engineered by Snow White's stepmother, the Queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be a perennial favorite in every family's collection!","review":"This is a beautifully filmed fairy tale with the added attraction of Carol Heiss' fabulous skating talent, and a delightful musical score. Good is just OH-SO-VERRY-VERRY-GOOD, and BAD is TOTALLY-DELIGHTFULLY-DELICIOUSLY-EVIL as only Disneyesque fairy tails can demonstrate. The added bonus of the beloved THREE STOOGES makes this a grand jem of family fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"see Snow White do double axels!","review":"Carol Heiss has a wonderful screen presence, especially when skating in Snow White's backyard.

Well worth the price and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technicolor Stooges feature isn't too bright","review":"In the 1960's The Three Stooges were again in demand (they were unceremoniously fired by Columbia in 1959, never having received a raise) and this was their first color full-length feature. Opinion on this is somewhat divided; some believe that it's a trashing of a classic fairy tale, and others think the fairy tale itself overshadows the Stooges. Nonetheless, most (including myself) agree that this is a real snooze, with minimal slapstick and none of the beloved sound effects. The story stays true to the fairy tale, but the Stooges here are too tame to generate much interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"I had forgotten how much I enjoy this movie. The download to my computer, though, is painfully slow. Not likely to rent online again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow White Milks Out The Three Stooges","review":"I was very anxious to watch this movie when I got the tape, but afterwards, I was very disappointed. This whole movie is a bore! The boys appear in just about 30% of the film, and even the scenes with them are dull. The boys act has been toned down to almost nothing just to it can be suitable for children. BIG MISTAKE!! The only use-of violence in this short is when Moe bops Curly-Joe on the head - that's it! One measly bop on the head, and even that looked fake.The first time I watched this when I got the tape for my birthday 2 years ago, I found myself fast forwarding through almost the whole movie, then the next day I promised myself I would watch the whole movie but ended up falling asleep after 3 minutes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stooges Should Have Stuck To Storts","review":"I love the Three Stooges. Don't get me wrong. But this movie is just awful. Not funny; not like the old days; not as much slapping and eye-poking as there should be. Please rent or purchase the black and white shorts to see the Stooges in their prime. DO NOT GET THE COLORIZED VERSIONS OF THEIR SHORTS. This movie was made in color, not colorized. But it's very bad unless you like cheesy, kids movies that have sappy love plots and forgetable songs. Please don't watch this and say you dislike the Stooges. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THE STOOGES DID.

First, I was disappointed in the lack of Christian message (Jesus Christ is the way). Also, I try to instill \\"the modesty\\" issue in my girls. The main character often wore low cut tops that the camera seemed to be well aware of. There is a scene where the main character is sitting in her boss's home reading from the Bible. The camera shows the Bible and the girl's low-cut top. If you aren't one who cares about the whole modesty thing or you are accepting of today's fashion, then you won't have a problem with it. I just know that I have been showing my children movies where the girl's are still cool while dressing fashionably and over time, I have come to see that my girls want to dress modestly now and they hate anything low-cut or short-cut. Like I said, I know this isn't a issue for most; however, if this is an issue that God has been dealing with you and your family, then don't get this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Hate to Say This","review":"I really hate to say this, but this is just a stinker of a movie. The script is awful. The production quality is B-movie level. And most of the acting is bad. The film's message is great, but, oh my goodness, that message is so horribly packaged that many people will turn off the movie without finishing it. The movie drags horribly at times. At one point there's an obvious film glitch where you see where a splice was done. I just hate to say this about this movie because I was really looking forward to it, but it's just very poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget film with poor acting","review":"I purchased this for my mother as a gift before viewing it myself,which I shouldn't have done. I thought since it was a Christian film she would enjoy it. She was extremely disappointed with it.I asked for it back and finally viewed it and saw why. The acting is not very believable, there are scenes where the main character is just walking with another character and there is no dialog. It's a bit choppy going from one scene to another. It doesn't feel like it flows very well. You feel like you are watching a home movie instead of a supposedly professionally made film.There are better made Christian films out there, so I would not waste money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comercial and easy literature","review":"I considere this book as a comercial action.

I mean, first they lose Dmitri, their original singer, then Mike Patton joins up and records an average EP with them, and then I hear that 'Miss Machine' is on the way with yet another new singer. The third different singer in just about as many years isn't usually a good sign for a band. And I'm so glad that I was wrong to question the mighty DEP.'Miss Machine' is their finest album to date. It retains the brutality of their first couple releases, keeps some of the deranged louge music melodies from the Patton EP, and throws in a bunch of new tricks. A beautifully brutal album that both retains the original DEP sound but also expands so much on it thats its just unreal. I would say that 'Miss Machine' ties Coverge's 'Jane Doe' as the finest mathrock album of all time.

Gundry does a GREAT job of presenting complex material in a simple manner. His breakdown of the Book of Revelation, a complex and symbolic book in the New Testament, is simple and straightforward. Sections in each chapter contains a precise range of scripture references (allowing you to read those sections almost as a commentary).

The problem is that these ideas are not new and most of them have been used by anyone, except for two or three of these which seemed a bit more interesting. Apart from that, it is 90% directed to political campaigns and it's almost completely useless for any charity or non-profit organization. Generally, these ideas are not very useful anyway and all these positive reviews here really make me think that they've been written either by the authors themselves or by someone who actually has no clue about fundraising at all. I consider that this \\"book\\"'s price is too high for what you get, so you better keep looking for something better and more substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better guides","review":"While I had high hopes for this guidebook, I found it a bit topical and overgeneral.

It's a musical that's fun even for people who don't like musicals. It's hip enough to poke fun at the inherent silliness of musical theatre (\\"Dead Old Man\\"), but earnest enough to feature characters that you really care about. I love the moment when Reefer Madam Mae (the most co-dependent musical theatre heroine since Nancy in \\"Oliver\\") finds the courage to turn on evil Reefer pusher Jack and beat him to death with a garden hoe (\\"You once had all the brains/Now they're just carpet stains/'Cuz there's blood upon your necktie/Your corpus is delecti\\"). The CD music is even better than the live show, with some of the arrangements fattened up in the studio. Bonus track \\"Weather Changes\\" is one GORGEOUS ballad. I recommend this CD highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooky, fun, but there's something missing........","review":"Reefer Madness has the potential for being one of the greatest cult musicals ever... so why isn't it?Well it's just too bad it opened in the same year of other \\"cult\\" musicals: Rocky Horror Show, Bat Boy, and Urinetown. Reefer Madness just wasn't a stand-out! All had crazy titles, fun themes, unusual and fun music, and wonderful casts!But Reefer Madness lacks something. It doesn't have Rocky's sex appeal or an already exhisting cult following. It doesn't have Bat Boy's incredible inventiveness, or Urinetown's musical complexity.But it nevertheless is fun and worth buying for anyone who's a fan of musicals like Urinetown, and Bat Boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Whilst the author had unprecedented access to an entire course as aviators earned their Test Pilot certification, i was really dissapointed by the very vague nature in which the book actually details 'flying on the edge'. With the exception of 2 -3 chapters there is very little detail behind the actual flying part of the course. Their exists even less detail on the thory and the author does not even go to the trouble of actually informing the reader of what the course elements are. There is little detail on rotary wing operations also.I wanted to read about test flying and test pilots. Instead the author provides mere glimpses of the flying and seems happier to discuss the politics of test flying and the Navy - he gives a whole chapter to the Tailhook scandal which has nothing to do with 'flying the edge' in my opinion.If you want hard core flying and test flying action look somewhere else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilots beware","review":"There is no point in discussing the many problems with this book in any depth, because one would have to write a book about them. Suffice it to say that Wilson, clearly a non pilot, had all the benefits of access based on his position and made the least of them. Readers who are interested in finding out more about Naval Aviation and its inner truths should read Paul Gillcrist's terrific FEET WET, and his follow-on VULTURE'S ROW. 'Gator' is the real thing, a PAX graduate and immensely experienced in the cockpit, from piston-engined aircraft of the '50s to the F-14, and his books are everthing that EDGE isn't.It's not a matter of 'close, but no cigar.' EDGE isn't even close. Sorry, Wilson, no sale (anyone want my copy, which is being used alternately as a coffee-mug coaster and door stop?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but Good","review":"Propagandhi is simply unable to write a bad song. I swear to it. I'm not gonna lie to you, this album is a lot different than their others. The music is a lot more hardcore, but that doesn't mean it's not good. This CD is still very awesome. I think some of the change in style might be to the departure of their old bassist, who did some singing on their old CDs. Their new bassist, Todd fits right in though. He even sings on some of these songs too. On most of the really hardcore ones. This is a must have. I've been waiting for this CD for a long time, just as everyone else has, and believe me, it won't dissapoint you. Go gey it, today"},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing better...","review":"there is simply no other band out there today that can rock like these guys......no joke, each of their albums has a distinct flavour to it, and i don't think i'm alone in saying this one tastes the best.....the addition of the new bassist (I Spy guitarist/vocalist Todd the Rodd) has helped usher in a new era for these guys and the world is better because of it...anyone who has listened to this cd knows what i';m talking about....for those of you who haven't yet heard it, what the helll are you waiting for? go to g7welcomingcommittee.com and buy this cd/lp...you will be forever changed....in any case, don't buy it here (amazon.com) support the independent co-ops, not these primitive screwheads...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you have a brain (Unlike myself)","review":"This cd is much more subtle than their last few records, the lyrics are probably better but they mention a lot of stuff I'm sure most people have never heard of (I still have no clue what cointel pro is), but it's by propagandhi so you pretty much can't go wrong right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A positive review from a Republican!","review":"Let's get one thing straight, I am a hardcore conservative and will most definitely be voting for Bush in November. While I in no way, shape or form agree with Propagandhi's politics, I still think their music is great, which is kind of weird because they're so closely tied together. For me, their views don't diminish the listenability of this album, because it appeals to me as a rock record. Tracks like \\"Purina Hall of Fame\\" and \\"March of the Crabs\\" are great pieces of music, no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on. So if you by chance are a right-winger and like kickass hardcore with a little melody, download a few of these songs, you might be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're ok i guess","review":"Propagandhi are'nt that bad a band really they just drive me a bit insane at times you know it happens, the band does raise some important issues and it's good that they actually know what they are talking about i also like the fact that they raise the points of Noam Chomsky so thats why im giving them two stars and not one for the points that they raise and the issues they have brought up but the music does'nt really get to me like most the punk rock i hear. The style in which propagandhi play does'nt really get to me but if you like that then this will be a 5 star release from your perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hosers have left the building","review":"The only reason I wasn't hugely disappointed in this album is that I had already heard it wasn't that good. Loyalty to the band and my love of their previous albums prompted me to get this one, but what happened? Their last full length, Less Talk More Rock is a masterpiece collection of songs that fit all together and rocked your ass off while giving you a great message at the same time. It doesn't sound like they're putting the same heart and soul into this record as their previous ones. Bottom line, the album is boring to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in Action","review":"For anyone who does not like this album, it is purely because you don't like change. This album is more outspoken, more intensified than any of the other albums. It's called Hardcore people. If you don't like it, don't buy. You can't expect bands to keep thier same old crap...they need to switch it up. Some do it successfully, some don't. Propagandhi puts it to perfection here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanging them on the wall","review":"We used a small rod from Home Depot and twine to hang ours on the wall in our daughter's nursery.

The stereotypes and ideosyncrasies are portrayed with lots of humor, and with not too much deep drama. Some of the situations are exaggerated, but this doesn't damage the movie at all, just makes it easier for all people (or races if we must) laugh at. I saw this with my daughter, although she was too young to really understand it all, most of it rang true. It was also great the director was there and some of the cast, they really worked hard to get this film on the screen, great T-shirts too! Hopefully this movie will eventually be accepted mainstream and/or will come out on DVD for purchase soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite flick","review":"I saw this movie on the reccomendation of one of my best friends and I loved it ! It's got a good plot, good actors, and amazing music. The plot not only applied to Filipino culture, but many children of immigrants, or even non-immigrants !

If you're filipino, you'll definately appreciate the inside-humor, and even if you're not, you'll still have a great time watching it.I've been waiting for The Debut to come to DVD and it finally is!

Believe me, I want the movie to be \\"good\\", but it isn't. Actually it is no better than a Pilipino Cultural Show and a lifetime movie put together.As an objective avid movie watcher, I can say that the pace of the movie is terrible, the script was better if written in gibberish and the movie was actually painful to watch.Instead of making a good film, the producers tried to address all the issues in the world that affect Pilipino Americans.Overall, Watch the film and support Asian American film makers, but Let's not kid ourselves...This was a disastrous film.Better Luck Tomorrow was heads above The Debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilipino Culture Night (PCN) on Film","review":"If you've ever watched a PCN, then you've already seen about 90% of this movie. You have the stereotypical Filipino parents who don't understand their American raised kids, thrown in a Muslim dance suite, a modern dance suite, a few Filipino-American jokes, and you have this film.....just like a PCN.

This film is a riot. The plot isn't strong, but it doesn't need to be. Between early forms of Stoogery, Fred Sanborn's silent and musical antics (I may even be willing to argue he stole the show), Ted Healy's 'relationship' with an obnoxious girlfriend, and the 'Hat Tipping' device, this movie is more than just a good movie for a Stooge fan, but for anybody that likes the comedy of old. Jus' git it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"This movie is a real bomb. I couldn't watch the entire thing it was so bad. Its only value is to show how the Stooges got their start as extras under Ted Healy. Just for that fact, it's worth having.The silent 'comedian' in this picture is anything but funny, and Healy himself bombs big-time. The only character who seems at ease with his part is Shemp Howard.You could chalk up the poor quality to the fact that talkies were still in their infancy; but then again, the Marx Brothers were doing screen comedy quite well at the same time.The seller is to be commended for offering this DVD at rock-bottom price. It is indeed rock-bottom! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The third U.K. single off The Sophtware Slump.","review":"Track 1 is the glorious 9 minute-long, three-movement album version.

I have a recent one that I received this past Christmas, when he was older, but full of fun, and wise cracks, as it is in a club for the most part, but he still was in great form, and not inhibited at all!

Frank burns through some tunes and the slower songs are mesmerizing..I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best Sinatra Swing Album","review":"I originally heard this album in the 80's, before \\"Songs for Swinging Lovers,\\" and in retrospect, I believe it to be superior to the former. The song selection on \\"Swinging Affair\\" is slightly more energetic throughout. If there were to be a five-star double-album of all time, SFSL and SA would be it. Also get the Reprise Re-mastered version of Ring-A-Ding-Ding. It is totally on-par with the afore-mentioned. Capitol has taken a lot of heat (justifyably) for their re-mastering of SFSL. I believe the re-mastering here is an improvement (albeit slight) over the previous CD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth 10 Stars","review":"You'll be singing and/or humming these tunes for days after giving this cd a listen. One of Frank's best swing albums bar none.

No one did concept albums better than Frank Sinatra. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy durable bed!","review":"From a person who actually owns the bed, it is a very nice product.

Not a tiny crack, a huge crack.3) The legs all had cracks in them.4) The bed was unusable anyways despite all the cosmetic flaws because one of the 4 main screws that hold the headboard/footboard on would not even screw in all the way as though the hole was not drilled all the way.For $50+ I would have expected something a little better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant sturdy and well made","review":"Cant go wrong with Melissa & Doug - I was not disappointed and my daughter loves it!It is sturdy and will be around a long time.

I was either bored to death or completely lost throughout this entire dvd. He spends what feels like hours rambling on about tuning and incredibly simple elements of the bass itself, and then will jump right into theory with no bridge or explanation of how to get there. He never even tells you what key they're playing in, discusses song structure, or teaches anything that a beginning bluegrass bass player actually needs to know.

The paint chips off those, and isn't too safe around little kids.... and this, well it does not. I guess Melissa & Doug have a little more quality put into their products and I'm quite pleased. I will tell you though that the instruction manual was not done well, so be prepared to have a little patience on your side when you start. But other than that, it sits steady and rocks, which I didn't realize and a nice addition, and it looks very cute and classy. I can tell you it's definitely durable as I found my 2 year old sitting in it the other day, and nothing even so much as squeaked. It will be enjoyed for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it......and so do I !!!!","review":"It is a great product.......super sturdy.All wood!I have a 20 month old daughter and she will have Crib for a looong time.It is so strong that my daughter sits on it and asks to be rocked.My only comment is that it would be even better if the screws would be white or if they would inlcude some type of a cap to cover them....they take a little away from how pretty it looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought for brand, not impressed","review":"Usually love M&D toys, but this was a little on the cheap side.

I've put together my fair share of \\"Assembly Required\\" furniture for both children and adults. This item goes together using the ubiquitous furniture dowel and bolt setup, but it is just not constructed properly for that. Several of the pieces do not fit together easily, and when they are finally put together, the holes for the furniture dowels are too large, and the poor fit causes the bolts to go at a strange angle, making it difficult to go together at all. The good news is that this is not designed to hold human beings, so poor support shouldn't cause any injure, but it's just not built well. I would encourage you to know what you are getting into before you buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We were not able to get 4 screws into one side of the crib.

I just received my box set and tested it out this past weekend and was extremely pleased with my purchase. $40 for 395 songs, great quality, and I like the selection. I had previously bought 450-song box sets for $250+, a good portion of those is country, so I'm happy that the majority of this collection is pop/rock hits. Of course your going to have duplicate songs, but that's with any box set you buy. There's a handful of repeat tracks, give or take. If you don't like spending $35 for 50-song sets, you can surely trust all the reviews you found here and proceed with ordering. As for the 1-star rating regarding the song \\"Closer\\", I agree, if anyone ever selects this song to sing, consider yourself forewarned. This track is not family/kid friendly nor is it even pleasant for an adult to listen to for that matter, extremely offensive. Thanks for reading and happy singing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal, great fun!","review":"I was a little worried when I ordered that the quality wouldn't be great for the price.

I bought the latest version - big mistake. So I went off and bought a second copy of the previous version. The publishers broke a very good product - a pity.Why? The old version was Hindi and Urdu - the new version has Bengali also. Although the newer version is thicker, a lot of useful informationwas either removed or condensed in such a manner that is very hard to assimilate. Also the number of entries in the dictionary was reduced. I only wanted Hindi.

I skimmed through this book at my local bookstore out of curiousity (I've had good luck with the demystified series, especially physics, by the same author), and what really caught my attention was the coverage of the elementary high school topics in a lean, mean six chapters with the rest covering hyperspace, warped space, polar coordinates, and basic vector mathematics.The quizzes are pretty good for reinforcing the concepts...they actually make you think (gee, what a concept)! It'd be nice if there were more of the problems, however (but not as many as Glencoe's books do). The tests really give one a sense of being in a classroom, especially since there's a final exam as well.This book is a gem, and for $13, you can't really go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, a little confusing at times.","review":"I found this book a little confusing at times, but maybe its me. I still highly recommend it, it is a fresh new angle on Geometry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and boring","review":"Comparing this book with other thrillers, I think it's not the Casablanca of this century but rather the most confusing book I have ever read. A very good introduction but too many characters lost the plot and thus as a result the reader may find the book boring just like I felt. I've just finished reading Home Run by Gerald Seymour and I really enjoyed the latter. It's about international terro. as well but it's simpler and much more entertaining. Hope that not too many authors copy the style of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This edition is bad","review":"I love Amarcord, for reasons given by other reviewers, but this particular Korean edition is terrible. I have seen the movie twice before, and many of the scenes that were most memorable have been edited out or shortened! How could they do this! Most of the scenes that were imprinted in my memory most vividly are missing! Even the wonderful end, with the camera moving slowly away from the last scene, was cut. This is a cinematic crime! Also, my copy did not have Italian dialogue as advertised, but only English with English subtitles. The subtitles were not the same as the English dialogue--they were awful! Don't buy this Korean fake!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD movie","review":"I think the people who don't like my review of this movie are the ones selling this video! Like an early 80's film that \\"dared to be sexual,\\" the movie is childish, and dumb. I can't believe they found a critic who liked it. I buy and watch a lot of foreign films, but I threw this one away. If you're spending your precious dollars on your movie collection, buy something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing quality","review":"I use this stamp at least four times a day. It looks great, stamps great and works great. The quality is amazing; a must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this cd because I had heard earlier music by this conductor that left me feeling unfulfilled musically. That is, his interpretation, while well executed, seemed sterile and dry. However, this CD is different. It is vivid, full of color, fluid, and exciting. Bruckner 5 is my favorite symphony by this composer and this version is the best I have heard. The only negative is that I wish it was released as a hybrid SACD. This is my only reservation, which is kind of silly because it is not a negative of the recording or performance. When I want to listen to a non-SACD version of Bruckner 5, this is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I bought this because of the cheapness factor and the fact that it matched my new red laptop. It worked great the first couple of hours but the constant shutting itself off and stuttering when it's active is a pain. The battery life may be long, but the device is a pain to use. In the long run, I am going to upgrade to something better, I was pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well - to a point.","review":"I brought this product because the color was nice and the price was cheap. I wish I would have gone to a slightly more expensive one. I works okay with my laptop if there is a good quality mousepad. It still skips around and doesn't move occasionally. This makes it difficult to work with for large projects with fine details. I wouldn't buy it again but I suppose it could be worse. The battery life doesn't seem to fade and it automatically shuts off during inactive periods which is a nice feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible support (which you will need)","review":"We bought this system and installed on a brand new Mac with OSX. Driver failed to install properly. I checked all over the internet including their site for the error that we have gotten and it seems that thousands have gotten the same error while all complain that there is no solution. We called tech support 6 times in 4 days now and have been routed all over India (we are in the USA.) We have never gotten to a tech support engineer. We continuously get transferred and disconnected. Over 4 hours of lost productivity due to waiting on hold at this point. If you have a MAC, do NOT buy this printer. If you have a PC, then you should search for driver problems with XP, because you will also see tons of unsolved driver problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Spotty Beginning","review":"This disc was better than I expected. \\"Out of the Night\\" and \\"Nothing but Tears\\" are passable blue-eyed deep soul cuts (although if that's what you're looking for, check out Dan Penn/Spooner Oldham). Once you get past the soul tunes, the material gets spotty and finally, really weak, until by \\"Bells,\\" you've entered laughable Vanilla Fudge territory (and according to the liner notes, Gregg thought so too). The album was mostly a Gregg vehicle; you wouldn't know that the same Duane Allman that a year later would go to Muscle Shoals and steal shows from the likes of Wilson Pickett is even in this band! You could wonder what this album would have sounded like if it had been recorded at Fame or American, but it wasn't. Pick it up only if you're a true Allmans fanatic, you can't stand not hearing it, and you can't find it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Allman Brothers","review":"I disagree with Paul's review. Gregg's voice is the only good thing about this album. At least you can recognize it as his voice. The boys were forced into doing this album by Liberty Records.

Might want it as a collectors item if you are a die hard AB fan...otherwise, give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"That's how Duane described it---\\"dreadful\\". It is truly lame. I'm surprised Gregg didn't buy every outstanding copy and burn them.

I sent a copy of the book to a friend and his wife who were in the resistance in Holland in WW II. They also loved the book and said it was an absolutely accurate and riveting account of the underground resistance movement in Europe. A wonderful read...far better than any contrived fiction. The folks who saved our downed Allied aircrew members and guided them to safety are true heros. Theirs is an amazing story of sacrifice and dedication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Would Make a Great Movie","review":"Bob Grimes was twenty years old, a pilot in a B-17 on the way back from bombing Germany on October 20, 1943 when an FW-190 shot off the tail of his plane. Wounded he bailed out of the stricken plane. On the ground he was incredibly lucky. He fell into the hands of The Comet Line. This was a network of people from Brussels to Spain that helped downed British and American air crew to escape. This book uses the story of Grimes to tell the story of the Comet Line itself.The Comet Line was the creation of an elegant young Belgian woman Dedee de Jongh. She ran the organization until she was captured and sent to Ravensbruck concentration camp; she survived the war.Parts of this story are seen in the movie \\"The Great Escape\\" where one of the escapees travels down the line to Spain.

Since then, I have read many books discussing Stanislaski's acting techniques, including his own rather dense versions translated from the Russian. None of them have distilled the essence of his \\"objective-problem-action\\" triad better than this book. Also included are eight genderless scenes with three different sets of objectives. After working with these (or other objectives of your own choosing), the value of his system is crystal clear. This book is a must for working actors, acting teachers and acting students alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oasis for the Spirit","review":"This CD ranks up there as one of the most peaceful and relaxing I have. I love Oriental gardens (and, in fact based the design of my tiny, urban back yard on many Japanese concepts) and this gives me the EXACT feeling of tranquility I have been looking for.

I have never used a controller before that was this unresponsive or big. I have had multiplayer sessions of Halo, and all the guys agree that you have to really work the buttons and analog sticks to get the controller to respond. This is not a good thing in a fast paced game. It is way too unresponsive, and the size is a tad bigger than the standard xbox controller, which for someone with small hands, is not a good thing. I donot recommend you wasting your money on a controller that should've been designed better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Controller! Avoid at All Costs!","review":"Regardless of this controller's layout or functionality, they are completely unreliable and break very easily. I bought three of them when I got my xbox because they were sold out of the ms controlers, but within one month, with very kind treatment and care, two of the three controlers had developed major flaws. On one of them, the right thumbstick broke, now it just kind of rattles around in its socket. THe other one constantly makes the xbox give me the \\"controler has been disconected\\" screen even though it was obviously still plugged in. All I have to do is hit start to make the screen go away, but it is very annoying and happens very often. So basically even if you really like the design of this controler, take my advice because it's much better to pay a little more to get a controler that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.O.C.!","review":"This controller is a piece of .... It breaks right away, the buttons aren't very responsive and confortable and the whole thing is messy looking. Interact really ... this one up... just like all the other 3rd party companies do.

The writing is pedestrian, but, worse, there's too much padding.

Shorn of the repetition and generalities, you could take all the content and reduce it to maybe 25 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"This is the best leadership book I have read this year about any business subject.

The story of Carlos Ghosn is irresistible."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful writing kills interesting subject","review":"Being an auto-enthusiast, I was very interested in the story of Nissan's turnaround. However, Magee's abysmal writing made it very hard to read the book. It is written at a 3rd grade level, with short sentences that convey no point whatsoever. The plot wanders aimlessly and points that can be summed up succinctly in one sentence are restated over and over again. It is amazing that Carlos Ghosn, being the brilliant business mind that he is, ever allowed a book of such low caliber to be written about him. Maybe Ghosn's next turnaround project should be having someone competent rewrite this book so that it's not a pain to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Motivator","review":"If you would like to read about how a no nonsense guy took Nissan from being extinct to one of the top automotive companies in the world you need to read this book.

I am taking my GMAT soon and found the sentence construction appaling to say the least... I had to quickly drop reading this book for fear that I would unlearn all the rules of english!! The subject treatment did not help much either. The book did not engage me at all. It does not build a story, nor characters and uses cliched words repetitively.Best to borrow it from the library (as I did).

Additionally, the style of writing is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Is David Magee a pen name for Carlos Ghosn? The book was way too subjective and one-sided. Or perhaps the State of Mississippi paid for the production of this book. And what is that book he quotes, 'Renaissance' by Carlos Ghosn? Could Mr. Magee at least tell us who the publisher is so that we can see what the man (Ghosn) himself has to say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Acceleration; Weak at Cruising Speed","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I knew peripherally the incredible turnaround at Nissan orchestrated by Ghosn, so I had hoped to learn more to apply to my own organizations. This book would have been just as effective as a 40 page booklet--all the nuggets were in the first half. Nothing new in the second half. Borrow someone else's and stop at about page 60; you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and Warm","review":"I love the beanie! It's comfortable when I wore it, sweat or cold, it wasn't itchy or unresistant to the weather. It looks good on men or women, so I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I ORDERED","review":"I ORDERED AND WANTED THE BEANIE FOR MY HUSBAND FOR XMAS.

These have worked perfectly so far. They're easy to put on and adjust, and provide very good support. They are very warm, however. I suppose there is a trade-off between comfort and support, but I started sweating within a minute or two and they were soaked by the time I finished my leg workout. Not sure if that will have long-term effects on the velcro closures, but so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Concept Album of Lost Love and Rememberance!","review":"Frank Sinatra evokes as much pain and suffering in this album as any other singer may do after a lifetime. This is one of Sinatra's finest concept albums to be ingrained by each listener along with 'Frank Sinatra sings for \\"Only the Lonely\\", \\"Songs for Swinging Lovers\\" and every other Sinatra record you can get your hands on.Dig the best and most gifted musical interpreter of popular song in this Century. Remember, if you have had a breakup of a relationship, this album is the prescription! \\"Crank the Frank\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album!!","review":"Great music, great composer, great singer! This album is certainly one of the best in his career! Blue, melancholic, his music lead us to a calm and peaceful world, where his melody touches our hearts and souls! Frank Sinatra rocks =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cover Says it All","review":"To any Frank fan, this album needs no explanaton. To anyone who hasn't heard it, you're missing out on an incredable experience. Sinatras tone is a bit lighter than on his later work, and Riddles arrangements maintain a hint of 40's big band phrasing. I discovered this album 20 years ago when I was playing in a rock band. Every night after the gig I would come home, put on the headphones, and revel in it's beauty. Like my dad used to say; they don't make 'em like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstandingly mellow","review":"As a young man, I never would listen to any of Sinatra's music. My wife and I did, however, have \\"Stranger's in the Night\\" as \\"our\\" song when we got married. But then, look what happened to that marriage....This is one of the most prized albums in my collection. I picked it up on Amazon about a month, ago. On first play, it did not sound exactly right. Must have been in the dvd player. After that I played it again, and again, and again. I don't think a day has gone by when I haven't played this album.Either I'm getting older or Frank is really a tremendous talent. I think experience and age tend to make me appreciate this guy more.......Get this cd; it is sensational Sinatra and oh, so mellow."},{"rating":"2","title":"tied for the best album sinatra ever recorded","review":"starting off with' in the wee small hours of the morning ' this cd is so unbelievable it isn't funny. i can't say enough about this cd. this is down and dirty. i mean it cuts through to the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAWED-wrong songs","review":"THIS ALBUM IS FLAWED---When Your Lover has Gone is MISSING.Replaced with much worse song.DO NOT PURCHASE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overrated","review":"A previous reviewer made the point that this re-recording, which should be better than the original, *isn't.\\" Quite true.It's also true that this is not Sinatra at his best. The musicianship is weak, tinkly and overdrawn. The arrangements are top-heavy and Sinatra himself seems to be led by the orchestrations, rather than the other way around.For a better bet, try \\"Trini Lopez Live at the USO Jamboree.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Frank Sinatra's best albums- EVER!","review":"I bought \\"In the Wee Small Hours\\" two weeks ago, and it was a very wise investment! This is a beautiful, very personal and revealing, album. Frank shares his private pain with us, and does an outstanding job. This CD is a gem, and I would recommend it to any other Sinatra fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra at his best!","review":"This is Sinatra at his best with out a dout. Me being the biggest Sinatra fan and hearing 70% of his albums this is his best. There are so many great songs on this album but there's one that stands out to me it's a tune called \\"Glad to be unhappy\\" the lyric of this song is so haunting and way he sings it, it feels like he's singing to every guy who ever got there heart broken and I think when sintara did these albums like \\"Where are you?\\" and \\"(Sinatra sings for) Only the lonely\\" they were to help guys and girls to cope with there problems and try to mend some of the pain and in his own right help him mend his broken heart.Ps. Check out these other \\"sad and tender\\" Sinatra albums1. Where are you?2. (Sinatra sings for) Only the lonley3. September of my years4. Close to you5. O'l blue eyes is back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic recording from one of the greats of all time.","review":"I've wanted this recording for years and finally have it!What gem this is! Ava Gardner broke his heart but it enabled Frank to produce a piece of work that stands the test of time. If you've ever been in love and had that love walk out of your life, this recording will speak to your soul like no other.If you haven't been there yet, then listen up and learn. Definitely one that I'd want on an island if I were to be shipwrecked. No doubt about it! God bless you Frank!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic album, horrible remastering job","review":"Did anyone at the label listen to this before it was issued? The previous 1991 CD sounds vastly superior to this- the high frequencies are all but obliterated, and there's a strange echo that is'nt heard on either the original LP or the 1st CD. The other remastered editions of Sinatra's 16 Capitol/Reprise are excellent (with the exception of Songs for Swingin' Lovers). Do yourself a favor and pick up the still readily available 1991 CD instead. Capitol, this classic of American popular music deserves better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Album Which Can Literally Block The Sun","review":"Thoreau used the phrase \\"quiet desperation\\" to describe the way most men live their lives. Frank Sinatra gave voice to the pain and triumphs of so many people, especially during his artistic peak of the mid-to-late 1950s. \\"In The Wee Small Hours\\" captures songs that convey their pain with dignity and wisdom. It is almost unheard of that anyone could draw on nearly 50 years worth of classic standards, joining them with empathetic arrangements and stilletto sharp singing to create an album both sadder and wiser; a soft, elegant scream. That is \\"In The Wee Small Hours,\\" Frank Sinatra's best original album."},{"rating":"2","title":"how's your life force going!","review":"Great quick read! A wife discovers that her professor husband is cheating on her with one of his students so she decides to get her own back! She grabs the first available toy boy, and seizes the opportunity to strengthen her life force and liberate all her friends along the way.Extremely witty, gotta love good old Aunt Sarah who seems to have a terribly strong life force, despite her 90 odd years.

I would estimate my wasted time at about 100 hours of installing and reinstalling so far.The HP customer service is abrupt and often rather rude.

The aspect that made this a regrettable choice for us is the sexual innuendo. I think the film is fine for little kids (5 and under) who don't perceive any of this or for 12 and older kids who are already encountering this at school, but between 5 and 12, we simply found the direct connection to the act of sex to be way, way too much. It's carnival in Rio, so clothing is really scanty on the human characters; another negative. Too much shake your booty.I don't mind talking about how babies are made with my kids.

The Rio setting - both the surrounding jungles and the city during Carnivale - are gorgeous to look at, with bright colors and movement. The Latin music adds an upbeat, festive feel throughout. The performances are all solid, and some adult hidden humor is thrown in to keep it from getting too dull for parents. The story is predictable however, and that is the only thing that keeps it from being 5-star.

And done better. With that said, the animation is amazing! The colors truly pop off the screen. This makes the story. The music is not overpowering, but could have had a few more songs. The song Nigel (former \\"pretty bird\\") steals the show. It has enough adult humor without being over the head of the kids. The subject matter does get mature (the smuggling of birds) and Nigel is scary at times, so the more sensitive/younger child might not be the intended audience. Otherwise this is a nice movie for older children and adults who enjoy a love story and/or great animation. The extra DVD or \\"party edition DVD\\" is a waste of time. The extras are weak and weigh down the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun","review":"This movie is a great choice for a child of any age ... and for the parents as well!

It is entertaining and has really enjoyable music throughout. My frustration, however, is with the playback functionality. You can fast-forward through the previews, but then you are FORCED to sit through the promotional reel about the \\"extras\\" on the disc. Anyone with a toddler knows that when you're turning a movie on, you want to be able to get right to the menu so you can start the movie, or even select a particular scene.

I also checked for PS3 software updates. Then I returned Rio for a replacement, but the replacement has the same problem: the video keeps freezing up on the PS3 while the audio continues.

It was a quick read started it yesterday evening and did not want to put it down. I am going to start reading the other books in this series. Mrs Jeffries and the other staff that helps the inspector and very intriguing. I am wanting to learn more about them and see where this goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book you haven't read . . .","review":"Let me prefrace this by saying this happens to be my favorite book of all time. That having been said; Peter Staub, like Stephen King, is no Dickens here people. I will not try to compare him to Dickens. What Straubs writes are great characters and even better plot twist. \\"Mystery,\\" his best work, is about Tom Pasmore a boy who view of the world is changed forever by a near death experience. With a new respect for his life and a fascination with death, Tom Pasmore begins a journey into his small town's past (as well as his own), to solve two murders; one commited in the present and one commited 3 decades ago. It is an amzing story of a boy growing up, finding himself. This is a taught thrilling adventure that I am SURE will become one of your favorite novels.It's fast fun read that you will not regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but slow moving mystery","review":"Of the Blue Rose Trilogy, which also includes Straub's KOKO and THE THROAT, this was the least intense, though it certainly boasts the most intriguing plot. The three novels in this series are almost experimental in nature, resembling an artist's notepad in which ideas for short stories are introduced, discarded, and then reworked later on. The common threads running through the stories are the Blue Rose murders, Millhaven and Tim Underhill, though the latter two are disguised here. MYSTERY can be read all by itself and appreciated, but it should be supplemented with KOKO and, at least, THE THROAT. Reading all three in order of publication, one gets the feeling of reading the same story told from different points of view, like the Gospels so often alluded to in THE THROAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor! Doctor! Give me another dose of Peter Straub!!","review":"\\"Mystery\\" was my first Peter Straub read and, as itwas billed a horror story, I was skeptical of beginning the book. Anymisgivings soon evaporated as I pored through this account of magnifincent characters. The story is at once, fantastic and realistic, and leads the reader through a labyrinth of detail and mysticism.Although part of the trilogy including \\"Koko\\" and \\"The Throat,\\" Peter Straub writes so well that each of the three titles can be read in any order without destroying the image of the others.It's about time we do Mr. Straub justice and give him credit for crossing genre lines. Won't he be happy to see many new faces in cyberlines at Amazon?!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one of straub's weaker efforts...","review":"I find it remarkable how wildly opinions vary on peter staub's books. for my money, koko and ghost story are classics, with hellfire club not far behind. at the opposite end of the spectrum, in my opinion, lie mr x and mystery. never has straub created a character about whom i cared less than tom passmore, unless it might be lamont cranston. only straub could make a caribbean island as dull and mundane as mill walk (an obvious allusion to milwaulkee, though the purpose of this little in joke is lost on me). The dark and terrible secrets of tom's family really aren't that damn interesting, and you have to traverse some awfully tedious turf to fight your way to this non-climax. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully slow!","review":"This book was painfully slow. It's the second book of the trilogy and while it stands alone, it also, with book 1, \\"Koko\\" connects the reader to the last book of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I've read this book several times. The story unfolds at a nice pace and has a touch of the unexplained that keeps the pages turning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expected More","review":"Not as good as one would have expected. A Hardy Boys adventure writ large. Ghost Story is still superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disturbing story, wonderful to open up your mind.","review":"The story follows the life of a boy who has a special gift for seeing past the facade of how things appear to look to how they really are. His death only broadens this spectrum and creates questions that he feels need to be answered. Lamont von Heilitz is his guide along the path to his enlightenment and self-discovery, and along the way he finds out things about his family and world that he only dreamed were true. The writing style is direct, provoking an emotional reaction to the situations described. By a simple style, Straub draws you in and makes you face what Tom faces. I have not read any of his other books, but I feel that this one has made such an impact on me that I will definitely have to look into what other creations he has penned into existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Stating the condition of the book","review":"I recieved the book in a well packaged box. However, when I purchased the book I was told that the condition was Very Good. When I opened the box I found a book that was well read.

I would have stated this books condition as Good.Alanon"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacked any real direction; not a good read","review":"this was my first peter straub book and i was deeply disappointed; certainly not a dean koontz or stephen king tale. plot was weak and very drawn out. characters didnt come alive for me. i could not recommend. will try one more of his books before i give up on the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Poor...","review":"I did not enjoy this book. The characters are weak, the story line is unfullfilling and never really resolves satisfactrorly. A number of issues are never completely explained. Very difficult to empaphise with the main character. The island of Mill Walk in the Caribbean is completely unlike any island that exists in the region.

As the other reviewer pointed out, this figure is probably best for collectors and not so much children.

'Senna' holds you strapped into the cockpit and doesn't let go until the very end.

Senna was a man of great faith and ability, culminating in his untimely death in 1994.

I chose to try it in HD for a price that was $1 higher than the standard def version, and that was a mistake. I assumed that the footage would have originally been filmed and that a HD copy would be better quality than standard def, however it was apparently all or nearly all taken from standard def TV broadcasts, and thus the original was not capable of even DVD quality. Also, there were several minutes at the end of the movie without any audio, and that was without any explanation.Overall, this is a must see for Formula One fans, but save the extra dollar and watch it in standard def."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't play!","review":"I can't get the disc to play!

But it ultimately fails for me as it plays a little too fast and loose with the facts, is overly sensationalistic, and draws too many absurd conclusions. RFID tags, rather than 'spychips', may prove to be a bane to privacy, or they may not. I shall continue to look for a definitive, balanced view on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, well written book on a subject of critical importance","review":"This book is a well written, well documented, factual representation of the dangers of the new technology of RFID chips.The issues are outlined clearly and objectively, without being overly sensationalistic.There is no other book that I'm aware of that deals with the issues involved as completely and professionally.The authors have done a terrific job of presenting the information in an informative, but readable way.This technology is a terrible threat to privacy, liberty and freedom, the very values that our founding fathers gave their lives for in the establishment of this country.

Osteen does a fantastic job of explaining that, sometimes, bad things happen for a reason. You don't imagine them, envision them or bring them about simply because you have been dwelling on them not happening, which is what \\"The Secret\\" suggests. Instead, they are all a part of God's big plan. Bad things take you to better places, provided you can roll with the punches and keep the faith.So for those of you who have not been impressed with The Secret and have been wondering how religion and God/Jesus fit into it all, this book has the answer.

This just happened to coincide with the Sopranos' popularity, but it was a mere coincidence.Regarding the film itself, it's gritty, it's powerful, and it reminds me alot of some early Scorcese films.It is refreshing to see that this style of filmmaking still exists in today's blockbuster shoot-em-up digital crap films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellgate bridge","review":"Well I normally like movies like this but this low budget movie has really bad special effects and the acting is mediocre and the positive thing would be the story itself.

If you haven��t read it you should. However, the quality of these books is horrible. They are printed on paper that feels like cardboard, the pages are much smaller than a normal comic (I admit this is my fault for not reading the description carefully, but it could have been made more obvious in the description), and worst of all THE BOOK FALLS APART!I have ordered the first 3 volumes of this series and all three has lost pages, or their covers are falling off. I treat my books very well, but this is just unavoidable with these books. I even returned the worst one I had for a new one, and sure enough it started to lose pages within a few minutes.I wouldn��t buy these cheaper trades. You may save money, but it is not a good deal.

If the backstory of the villains doesn't do it for you, the comic also guest stars a Marvel superstar and throws in some budding romance for added incentive. I'm still not feelin' the artwork, though, except for the included cover gallery.This comic is rated for ages 12 and up: Violence, Adult Language."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Smith's historical survey of U.S. foreign and domestic policy post-WWII is a must read. His lucid writing, thorough chronology and partiality towards justice will envelope readers seeking to make sense of our politically troubled world. Divided into decades, the book chronicles the misdeeds done by the world's superpower in small capsules making it appealing to even the non-historian or nominally politically inclined. \\"Greatest Story\\" should be required reading for all college and high school U.S. history survey courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michno let us down","review":"I've been really impressed by Gregory Michno, in both Lakota Noon and Indian Wars. However, in this book, it appears he let down his objective intelligent analytical style to go on a crusade, discarding all the research techniques that made LN and Indian Wars so believable. For instance, he could have corroborated Indian Testimony with that of the Army's, a tool which he used very successfully in the past. His failure to even delve into that issue makes it apparent that he had a decision on the whole matter before he even began his research, and only pursued feeble arguments which supported his own theory. His character assassinations of Silas Soule and Major Anthony is a very pathetic excuse to discredit their recorded testimonies in my opinion, and a very boring technique used in politics today to an alarming rate. I look forward to better efforts from him in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"controversial","review":"The most well researched history of this episode. Controversial because Michno includes the brutal context of the battle and refers to it as a battle not a massacre. This book includes an extensive leadup to the battle and the aftermath.

This is a little bit weird since i was used to the microsoft one, but i am used to it now. The second thing i noticed was the buttons. They are slightly larger than micrsoft's, but here is the bad part. The buttons must be pushed very firmly to work. This may be alright on some games, but on others it simply will not suffice. In Madden 2002, what type of pass you throw depends on how hard you press the button. Achieving anything but a bullet pass was impossible for me. Also, on games like Halo where you have to be quick with the buttons, i repeatedly found myself dead because i could not fire quick enough. However, the controller isnt completely bad.

Worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully predictable.","review":"I found this movie to be very predictable and extremely dull. The writing was just awful, even Russell Brand couldn't save it. The lines were not thought out well, and just not funny. Kind of like they were pounded out quickly to get the movie released before something funnier came along. The plot just plodded along in that same old tried and true \\"random\\" love story pattern. The humor was either alcohol or sex based, which albeit can be pretty funny at times, just fell flat here (for instance, Arthur threw a large party. One of the \\"funny\\" parts was the nanny first pulling a thong off a piece of furniture and then finding Arthur under some random girl. Ha. Ha.) Unfortunately, I was forced to finish it.I WANT MY TWO HOURS OF LIFE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAT AND UNINSPIRED ! 1 1/2 STARS FOR RUSSELL BRAND!","review":"I knew the remake was going to be horrible, but I just had to see for myself. The original Arthur film is one of the best written comedies of all time with some truly great performances. This remake has only one saving grace and that is Russell Brand, who doesn't come close to Dudley Moore here, but he contributes the films only laughs.While the original film is sharp and witty, this remake is limp, flat and just fails on almost every level. I don't even understand why they would try to remake this film? It's like lightning in a bottle, the original cast couldn't even do it, just watch Arthur 2 and you'll see what I mean.I would rather watch the original film over and over for a year before sitting through the remake one more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad remake","review":"Just saw this movie and was very disappointed. As many others have said, it doesn't come close to the humor or poignancy of the original. I only know Russell Brand as Katy Perry's husband so until I see more of his work I won't be too critical but I believe he was miscast. I had a hard time telling if he was drunk or sober or when he was supposed to be one or the other.Hollywood is braindead most of the time and can't seem to find original material. Making remakes is easy for them but also risky. Some movies should just be left alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good movie!","review":"I put off seeing this movie because of all the 3 star ratings. I finally saw it and was fully entertained from start to end. It built the story and developed the characters well. I even shed some tears but laughed and dreamed a lot.I really recommend this and its one of the best movies in terms of pure enjoyment I've seen in a long time. If you aren't an art house movie snob and like a fun and heartfelt movie you'll love this.It combines comedy, love story, and a lot of fantasy and imagination. Well done and its refreshing amongst all the other stuff out there today even if it is a remake and the star of the film plays the part perfectly.I'm glad I never saw the first one. I loved this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arthur","review":"This was a poor remake of Arthur.

Running Time: one hour, 49 mins.My only reason for seeing this movie is because Luis Guzman is in it. He plays \\"Bitterman\\".Horrible remake to the original \\"Arthur\\" movies. The dearly missed Dudley Moore was in the original movie as the short drunk and was very funny, in fact, he also did a second movie.This remake with Russell Brand was very difficult to get through and only made me miss Dudley Moore even more.Luis Guzman was cute in the Robin-The Boy Wonder costume.Also in the cast: Helen Mirren, Jennifer Garner, Greta Gerwig, Nick Nolte, Evander Holyfield, Robert Clohessy.For a good time and many laughs, please see the two original movies starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli.Arthur(1981).Arthur 2 - On the Rocks(1988).Both movies on Blu-ray:Arthur / Arthur 2: On the Rocks (2-Movie Collection) [Blu-ray]."},{"rating":"2","title":"good price","review":"This was for my 25 yr old daughter.

The first Arthur played by Dudley Moore was so much better and so much more enjoyable. This version of Arthur was awful. Saw it on HBO after placing my order and it was too late to cancel it because my order already shipped. I still have the wrapper on the DVD and will probably never take the wrapper off since the movie isn't worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked Brand","review":"I think a lot of people didn't like Russell Brand's Arthur because they compared it to the original Dudley Moore version. But I truly enjoyed this comedy when I saw it in the theater. Brand's Arthur had depth to him, his character grew and changed by the end of the movie. Russell was very witty and endearing, especially when he did the scene by the piano at the bridal shower. Dame Mirren was hysterical as Arthur's nanny and Jen Garner excelled at being a snotty socialite. I could tell she had fun with her part. I am going to purchase this DVD when it comes out. I could watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it. Russell was terrific in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek. In Arthur he gives yet another fine performance. I can't wait to see him in Rock of Ages. He's an amazing talent and quite handsome too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Wouldn't Recommend","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Honeslty, do something more pleasurable than watch this movie, like taking a hammer and repeatedly hitting yourself on the head. Russell Brand should be ashamed for being apart of this movie, however based on his other movie roles it is pretty obvious the guy has no shame. Don't bother with this one, and consider yourself lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny","review":"This movie was not funny at all. The only movie Russell Brand made that I really liked was 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. On this movie he portrays a rich childish man who has a drinking problem.His mother puts him in a position to choose money or his true love. The whole movie is based on this simplistic formula. His nanny Hobson makes all important decisions for him.The movie is super unrealistic in that he is throwing away money like it is nothing. Well if he was living like that he would not be rich.I can see that a movie like this might be appealing to some women giving them the false idea that a rich person could fall for some random, not so pretty woman on the street. This idea is not such a bad idea in itself but in here it does not work. Every scene looks staged and fake.I don't know, this movie did not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie does a great disservice to the original. Brand is not funny, has no where near the charm of Dudley Moore and appears more stoned than drunk. Greta Gerwig, while a lovely and charming actress lacks the talent to fill Liza Minnelli's shoes. I waited for the comedy which finely came near the end. Disappointed in the movie and hope they never try for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Remake No One Wanted","review":"The world was not clamoring for an update of the Oscar-winning \\"Arthur\\" (1981), but Warner Bros. didn't listen. Russell Brand delivers zero laughs in the Dudley Moore role, with Helen Mirren a decidedly bizarre choice to fill the shoes of John Gielgud. Sitcom director Jason Winer gives the 2011 version a predictable made-for-TV veneer. Best that you can do . . . is avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Very funny and witty.. You'll need to see it a couple times to catch all of the humor. Great remake of Dudley Moore's version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its A Good One!","review":"I saw this movie in theaters when it was 1st released. I was apprehensive as to how good this would be.

While Dudley Moorewas funny and charming, I found Russel Brand just a cheap knock off. It waslike watching a stand up comic do a bad imitation for almost 2 hours! Sadly,while I usually love Helen Mirren, I really missed crotchety old Hobson. Now wecome to Greta Gerwig, who was perfectly fine but really not special in her roleas Arthur's first real love. I just didn't buy the chemistry. Then JenniferGarner...UGH...why they changed the role of Susan so drastically I will never know.She was sweet and unassuming in the original, and that worked with her overprotectivefather. In this new version, she was just a witch. I thought the whole thing wasa disaster and while I laughed out loud during the original, this one had me watchingthe clock in hopes that an end was in sight. Sorry, Arthur...this one should have beenlost in New York City!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Heartfelt as Origina;","review":"Sure, it is fun to see the new Arthur throw away money on stupid, fun things, but the original really had us feeling 'sorry' for the poor little rich boy who just wnated to be loved. Helen Mirren was a very interesting reinterpretation of Hobson, but the magic between Moore and Geilgud cannot be replaced. Even Bitterman in the original had an aire of dignity which is lacking here. We really felt it when Hobson died in the original--all the scenes here felt rushed. This is a very watered down remake just going throught the motions, the 'presence' is just not there and I don't feel any sympathy towards Arthur as I did Moore's character. Not having Arthur's eccentric grandmother Martha was a disappointment and I think Mirren could have pulled that role off even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sorry for Katy Perry!","review":"What a lame movie! There was nothing good about this movie except when it ended. What a dry, boring, stupid movie, there was nothing entertaining about it. Maybe if you have an IQ of 5 you might think it had some funny parts but that's the only way! I would have to rate this as one of the bottom 10 movies of all time. Russell Brand is generic and forgetable, I can't imagine what Katy Perry sees in him. I'll give them less than 2 years for her to tire of his lame wittiness and sees how lame he truly is.The movie was written, directed, and produced poorly and there was no memorable acting by any of the cast.

WHY did they make a second version of this movie? Dudley Moore would turn over in his grave if he saw the latest \\"Arthur\\". What has happened to the creative people in Hollywood? Do they only live for making money and they think the public is a bunch of brainless sheep who will watch any dreck that is put on the screen? They must as there is so much garbage out there that is more or less a bunch of bad jokes that are mostly computer generated images strip mined from comic books, video games and pitiful remakes of earlier hits.

Russell Brand is perfect for the role and very convincing, and his evolution from relatively useless person to a person of greater substance and a lot of heart makes it largely a feel-good movie. Arthur must face difficulties, but he overcomes them, and as he does he is an inspiration to the viewer.

The beginning was hard to endure as they tried to indoctrinate everyone with the evolution theory. Remember, it has never been observed.The whole Pangea theory was funny though. To think that the continents drifted apart as if the world was a large pond and the continents were lily pads. Hey, if you take all the water out of the oceans guess what you will find? That's right kids the continents are connected.Once the indoctrination stopped the movie was bearable. It had fairly good shots and a good variety. I think the part about Tibet was the best. You don't learn much about Tibet in your nature docs.The narrator was the kind you want when you tired and bored. Hint, He is boring.

It's not uplifting, there are no valuable life lessons to be learned here. If you have ever been or met anyone who is morbidly depressed you will recognize the thought pattern of Sissy Spacek's character. Jessie is incredibly selfish and kills herself in one of the cruelest ways imaginable, suicide already being one of the darkest, selfish acts there is and yet she does it in a way that will leave her mother scarred for life wondering how she could have stopped it.

About a month ago, we decided to transition our other dog onto it, as well.About 3 weeks ago both dogs started to get very sick - the worst diarrhea I've seen. It started with one dog, so we took him to the vet. After screens for parasites and bacterial infections turned up nothing, and antibiotics weren't helping, the other dog also became ill. On the off chance it was the new bag of food we had recently opened, we fed them something different one day. Within 24 hours both dogs were fine.

The Hella's have a very distinct pattern that presents itself on the road and sides at about 180 degrees. You can adjust them vertically and horizontally to suit your driving needs. The Hella's are shipped with H3 55 watt bulbs and run fairly cool at this wattage.

Anyway I was so excited to get it but then I opened the boxand I was very disappointed with the way DVDs were stored.They are piled on top of each otherwith no protection. All I can say is Bad Packaging!! Not even a booklet that takes you thru each season and episode!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transfers look great. Packaging is OK (for the price)","review":"I actually got this set for 27.99 which (to me, no matter the packaging) is a steal! The packaging is pretty cheap but not as cheap as I was expecting based on some reviews. The discs are stacked on two spindles and that does make finding a particular disc harder to find but for the price of the ENTIRE series I'm not complaining.. The video/audio quality look really good! It's funny to me that some of the older shows look better on DVD than some newer ones from the 80s. Wouldn't it stand to reason that the older the show is, the harder it would be to remaster it? I've seen some 80s remastered tv shows that don't look or sound this good. Hint: Google search this series for the best price before buying : D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy 5 to get 1","review":"I just don't understand it. I bought Seasons 1, 2 3, and 4 each when they came out. I continue to wait for season 5 to be released. Now I an expected to repurchase the first 4 season again, just to get season 5? I don't think so! Unless you want to buy back the first 4 season from me at the full prices I paid, You can keep this mess. I'm not that stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We spent money on the 1st four, why not release 5 on its own?","review":"What a crappy way to treat consumers who have already spent their hard-earned cash on the 1st four seasons. I bought all these when they hit the shelves at the stores, and even remember paying almost $50 for the first season alone. Why even bother releasing the complete series anyhow as the first 4 seasons are now available at Best Buy for $10 each. This is just corporate greed and I refuse to buy the complete series just to get the final season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the dvd's, HATE the packaging","review":"There isn't much to say about the dvd's---if you're a fan of the original Charlie's Angels then you'll be pleased with the dvd's. My big complaint is the packaging. The dvd's are stacked on a cheap piece of plastic (on mine, it wasn't even attached to the box) like old 45 rpm records. I ended up putting each one in a dvd sleeve and just putting them in the box. They still move all around when I pick up the box. Also included is a sheet listing all the episodes---no description or anything, just the title. I had purchased seasons 1-4 separately and gave them to a friend when I ordered this set but regretted it. I wish I had just waited til season 5 had been released. But then that's why they haven't released season 5 yet--they can make more $$ by selling the entire set to those of us who already purchased prior seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie's Angel's The Complete Series","review":"I just got Charlie's Angel's The Complete Series it Sucks!!!! The DVD's inside are stacked on top of each other. You have seasons 1-2 on one side and seasons 3-5 on the other. The only good thing about it is the artwork is Great! I will be sending mine back to amazon because one of the dvd's came to me damaged and get a refund and wait for Sony to release season 5.

I wish I hadn't already ordered seasons 1 through 4; because if I hadn't I would surely order this complete set with ALL 110 episodes for $55. However, since I've already got the first 4 seasons, I don't think I'll be buying this complete set and have two copies of 4 seasons.

The packaging is a bit strange since the disks are essential held by two spindles with cardboard disks to hold them in place. Other than that it was a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite complete...","review":"To repeat what other reviewers have already written, the packaging in this box set is terrible. The discs are stacked on top of each other in a big flimsy container. I removed them and stored them in individual paper sleeves. The outer box has lots of nice photos of all the Angels. I previously had bought each individual season (1-4) of the show but I wanted season 5 so badly that I sold them on Ebay and put the money towards this \\"complete\\" set. However, I noticed several episodes are edited down from their original broadcast versions. The set features the EXACT same DVDs that the previous seasons 1-4 sets contained, so there are no new bonus features unfortunately. I was hoping for some new featurettes, commentaries or retrospective documentaries, but sadly no. If you can find this set for less than $40, it's still a good bargain, especially considering how ridiculously overpriced Season 5 is currently by itself. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shows","review":"I still love the shows all shows been playing real good but I'm still in the first season. The package was very good but the way the dvds are just stacked together doe's not seem good but I have not had a problem , other then the second half of the stack the glue came undone and I have to adjust it to keep it straight in the box. But I love seeing these shows so I am grateful to get them even if the way they are boxed is not to my liking. I had gotten the seasons of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman and Kung Fu that had the dvds separate in there own containers, and also Gidget, and Growing Pains, had a very good package to keep the discs in good condition , but I still have not had a problem so I should not say it is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor execution","review":"The basic idea behind this light is very good however the execution of the idea is awful. The bottom of the battery housing uses the flattest contacts you will ever see and the top of the battery housing uses the same spring design for both positive and negative resulting in no contact. I added tin foil strips and it now works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap piece of junk","review":"Cheap plastic, no obvious on/off switch.

Poorly designed, poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed designed","review":"Poorly designed piece - the choice of contact surface is far from ideal - bottom is almost entirely flat and the top contacts are both springed - so besides you no been able to distighuish positive from negative when inserting the batteries, it lacks good contact which results in FAIL when using it.As another buyer suggested, adding a piece of thin foils fixes it, but yet its a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visor Light","review":"The light is bright but the batteries got very hot. The light also goes off and will not come back on after a certain amount of time. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not the best solution","review":"It's interesting that this is the VisorLight by Donegan to be used on the Donegan OptiVisor, because it's not as good as some of the third party alternatives which often cost less. The battery compartment constantly pops open and the batteries lose connection or fall out. The visor clip is loose and moves around. I've had to tape the visor clip and battery case closed with tape. The lens needs to be twisted to turn the lamp on an off. If it's to loose, the lens cap can fall off, and if it's too tight the lamps may not be turned off and will drain the batteries. A switch would be a far better alternative. As far as the light source, it does provide good direct and bright lighting. Overall, the design is poor and doesn't appear that there was much thought went into the creation of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value","review":"I purchased this for my 2 year old nephew, hoping that he would follow in my footsteps and learn to love the piano. I thought it was a great deal at half off considering that it was made by Melissa & Doug. As soon as I received the piano I gift-wrapped it. When I read some of the bad reviews from folks who purchased it during November, as I did, I decided to unwrap it and remove the shrinkwrap. Ewwww! The toy piano reeked of a strong odor like plastic resin. Left the shrinkwrap off a few days. It still reeked. Decided to play it. It was in tune but sounded a $10 xylophone (metallic). I was suspicious of some of the action of the keys. Didn't know if the resin smell would ever go away but I had more than enough reasons to return the monstrosity. If this had been my first exposure to piano, I'd have switched to clarinet or violin. Two weeks later and the wrapping paper I used still reeks of the resin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but sound is a bit off","review":"The piano is beautiful and polished and shiny and perfect for my daughters first birthday present.

We own LOTs of Melissa & Doug puzzles, cutting sits, etc. And purchased this piano for around $35 when Amazon had a sale going on. Was excited to purchase this but when received the product had a very nasty odor and didnt 'air out' for a couple of days. Piano sounds to have one \\"sound\\". It appears when you hit the keys it is hitting a medal plate. The only plus to this piano is it is very sturdy and well made, expect for the sound, odor and it is very small! Def not correct size for my 1 1/2 & 2 1/2 year old toddlers. Needless to say rather than return piano I just sold this product to a personal indiviual within one week. I will continue to purchase M & D products and have since done so.....Overall would NOT recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son of a Music Teacher","review":"We got this for my son when he was 2 months old...a little early but my husband is a piano player and music teacher. It has already earned its keep and our son is just 13 months old now. He used to sit (propped) and \\"play\\" it. Then he would crawl over to it and \\"play it\\". Then he used it to stand up for the first time! He knows the word \\"piano\\" and plays it anytime Daddy is playing the real piano. My husband doesn't mind the sound of this toy piano and that is a hard thing to accomplish! We are very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great musical toy","review":"I bought this for my son, and although some people were disappointed by the tune of the piano, I could care less. I actually bought this for my son to bang on, not learn how to play the piano. He absolutely loves it! He will once in a while try and climb it or push it and it will tip over rather easily.

Like so many other reviews this piano was purchased for our 8 month old baby girl and it's perfect for her. All we did was sit her in front of it and she took over from there.

At this price it's a great addition to any child's toy collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"This is a really neat toy! We got this for my 9 m.o. son for Chistmas, and my 7 y.o. son and 2 y.o. son play with it too! All the kids love it! It is sturdy as some of the other reviews stated, but it is a little top heavy. The boys have tipped it over several times. It crashes down and is fine. The book that comes with it is really neat, but more suited for a little older child. The sharp/flat keys actually play, which is not the case with some of the cheaper style pianos.

I think he is developing a fondness for music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, poor built","review":"Have to agree with others, it is a poorly built item. The keys on this piano are very flimsy. In fact you have to apply different pressure to each key to produce the sound.

I bought the piano for my 20-month old grandson who is average size for his age, but this piano was completely unusable. I give it one star because it arrived in good condition and appeared to be of reasonable manufacturing quality.

Can't really even play any songs on it because the notes are so off. Also, the second day one of the keys stopped working altogether.

She is now 18 months and still loves it. She will bring me the song book and walk me over to it and sit on my lap while I play her a song.

It had no padding at all and was loose in the box. Thus, the back of the piano was broken. So now I had to return this piano as well.

Then today, the whole thing fell apart when my tweenage son picked it up to move it. Keys, panels and everything just fell apart when it was picked up - it's as if the glue gave out. It's just not made well. It's glued together with pegs. Melissa and Doug, you've disappointed me.

Cheap Construction","review":"I bought this toy, which was damaged in transit, and was really happy with the seller's response. I would like to not though, that this toy is very cheaply constructed and should not be described as \\"durable.\\" The description above states that this is \\"Made of hardwood\\" and the packaging says \\"Solid Wood Construction,\\" but neither of these are true. Since mine was damaged en-route I got to see that the construction is actually some kind of pressed-paper/cellulose material, which is flimsy and not at all durable. I've also uploaded a picture illustrating this in detail.The sound is sort of harpsichord-ish and certainly adequate for the price and intended use of this toy.

It has taken occasional abuse and still looks new, unlike some of his other toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this piano","review":"I purchased the piano for my 20 month old granddaughter. We have a full sized piano that she loves to play and wanted her to have a piano to play at home. On Christmas day she had a pile of presents. We saved the piano for last. She played with the other toys we bought her, but when she opened the piano she got so excited that we had to take it out of the box. She sat a played with it for some time. The remainer of the day we could hear her playing with it.I love the bright colors and the wood constuction. My son and daughter-in-law were very impressed with the quality as well. I would definately recommend this product! Good value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I expect great things with Melissa & Doug toys. That is not the case with this piano. When we opened the box, we were almost overcome from the fumes (smelled like gas?). The piano is now sitting in the garage where it has been for the past week to see if the odor will finally get out of it. I'm thinking it may be the paint. It is beginning to lose some of the odor. Perhaps by Christmas?? The little strip with the notes on it is only attached on one end. I give that 5 minutes before its ripped off. To pay to send it back is just not worth it. The notes do sound tinny, however, I expected it to sound like a toy and that's exactly what it sounds like. I wouldn't order it again and I would just say buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"After a week the screws at the top became loose and my kids were able to take it apart. The whole thing fell apart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Sound quality isn't great. The colored scale just above the key's is just a piece of paper glued on at both ends. That came off pretty quick. We've had it for a year and one of the keys is already dead. My son (now 2) likes it okay, he will go over and bang on it for a few minutes now and then but overall it takes up space. Only reason it's still around is Nana got it for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this!!!","review":"All my two year asked for at Christmastime was a piano. We bought him this Melissa and Doug one because we like the sturdiness of his other Melissa and Doug toys. He LOVES it...bangs around on it all day. It has good sound quality and is adorable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melissa and Doug should be embarrased","review":"This is a shoddy, low-quality product. Not what we expect from this brand.The first one we got was broken. The second one sounded worse. It's cheaply made in every way.The \\"Learn to Play\\" claim is just insulting. They put letters over the keys with cheap stickers. Not exactly educational.It looks like they just repainted this product from another company: http://www.amazon.com/Schoenhut-My-First-Piano-II/dp/B000IGEEC6/This is a brand we've grown to trust. They blew it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two pianos reduced to pile of parts","review":"Bought this last Christmas for my toddler grandson. He loved it to death. Unfortunately death came too quickly as we discovered that the cabinet and mechanism are glued together. They came unglued very easily. We obtained a replacement (and an apology) from the toy store, but the second piano proved to be no more durable. Hopefully the American company will demand a lot higher quality from their Chinese manufacturer.Meanwhile my grandson wants another piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"The item was received well packaged in Amazon's usual overkill packaging. It took me 30 minutes just to get it out. Then, disappointment when my niece and nephew opened it up on their birthday only to find that 2/3 of the keyboard doesn't work. I don't think it was damaged in shipping, the piano otherwise looks perfect. I suspect it is either defective or poorly made such that something shook loose in the shipping. Am waiting for a replacement but I am wondering how long it will last given some of the reviews here about durability. I've seen other Melissa and Doug toys and they seem more sturdily made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Not Well Made.","review":"I bought this because i thought it would be great for my 18month old. Once i received it i started to play a song using the book it came with. Right away i noticed some of the keys would get stuck down which made it hard to properly play a song. Also if you tap on a key over and over it will not recognize that and make a sound such as other pianos would do. For this price i think it can be constructed way better. I returned it.It is very pretty though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good book!","review":"I had very low expectations for this book after reading some of the reviews, but I am pleased to say that this book is a great addition to an artist's reference library. I am a mostly digital artist, but was curious about the traditional technique of toning and had to start somewhere. This book goes about explaining traditional inking and toning in detail (shows the different tools used, how to hold the pens to achieve different stroke, .etc), but it goes about it in a simple, easy to follow way. For those who expect this book or any book to instantly make them excellent inkers and/or toners, please keep expectations to a realistic level; only practice and time will do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?!","review":"First, I must say, the cover page is VERY misleading. None of the art in this book is remotely like the cover. But if you strictly looking for pen techniques, this is the book for you and I highly recommend it. But if you are like me and want the book for the techniques but enjoy nice looking manga art, DON'T GET THIS. This book is teaching you how to draw lines and curves through a retarded gag manga. The characters are weird and the faces, oh my goodness, the faces, are the most hideous faces you ever want to see in a manga. But, if you look past all that, it's not that bad of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying characters","review":"I like this artist and yeah I know that most of the time there are annoying characters that pop up in the book but jesus christ. This whole book is like a manga, not even a good manga, more like a retarded picture book with picture and people with odd proportions. There are some good info in there...somewhere but i really DONT recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never there when I need it!","review":"Bought this book over a year ago. Yet again I needed and example/explanation and this book DOES NOT have it.You're far better of using GOGGLE!! visit the various Oracle forums and search for solutions, that's what I've had to do more often than not when I refer to this book. Save the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped from vinyl","review":"I had burned my own copy of this lp a few years ago and was waiting for a legitimate release to come along. As soon as I opened the shipping box and seen the cover I knew I was had. The round sticker that you see in the picture that you can't read here, says it was taken from vinyl. This is NOT what I expected at all. I thought it was a legitimate release only available in Japan.Not only does this release have \\"turntable rumble\\" and surface noise, just like a record L.P but there is also an \\"electrical hum\\" like there was some kind of interference during the vinyl dub to compact disc.It's shame this is so poorly made because the cd design artwork re-creates the original album very well.Don't buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is the Bootleg and never released in Japan","review":"I tell to the Beatles fans all over the world who are checking this title at Amazon. This is bootleg, never released officially in Japan also any other countories. Obi is copied from Toshiba-EMI released vinyl. EMI & Apple never allow to release this legendary concerts. I hope Amazon doesn't sell pirat/bootleg CD. So many live bootleg CDs & DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't believe I found this!","review":"I was so excited to see this album! I originally owned this album, back in 1977. It was my first Beatles album, and I absolutely fell in love with them. I played this album until it was too scratched and worn out to appreciate. To listen to the excitement of the crowd, recorded back in 1964 and 1965, was and still is incredible. It is by far my favorite Beatles album, and I am so glad to have another opportunity to own this treasure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The answer to a reviewer's question","review":"The reviewer, \\"allouciksk\\" asked what is the song that is the \\"'tribal' war cry song thingy\\" you hear in the movie but not on the Election soundtrack. That song is \\"Navajo Joe\\" by Ennio Morricone. The movie starred Burt Reynolds. Ennio Morricone is famous as the composer of the spaghetti westerns soundtracks which starred Clint Eastwood. \\"Navajo Joe\\" is on many of Morricone's compilations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack will launch the new band \\"Taxiride\\"","review":"The hook song of the soundtrack \\"Election\\" is the first one, a quick, energizing song called \\"Get Set\\" by newcomer band \\"Taxiride\\". The bulk of the soundtrack includes novelty, scene-only songs such as \\"Jennifer Juniper\\", reminiscent of early 70's shows and misty-look commercials. An oldie, but badie, is also included, the Commodores \\"Three Times a Lady\\". It is not my choice du jour, but it does fit nicely with the rest of the movie's 70mm beat. The best aspect of this soundtrack is that not all of these songs will be blasted all over music videos for months to come, rather, it will sit quietly, waiting for memory hungry movie viewers to listen and get whisked back to the antics of Flick and MacAllister. The song worthy of the 90's video hype is the infectious \\"Get Set\\". I just simply love that song..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, no score?","review":"The score for ELECTION is excellent, and it is bewildering to me that there is so little of it here. Just one track of about 7 minutes. The song choice is reasonable, but the CD is woefully inadequate for those of us who really want to revisit Rolfe Kent's great and strange music from the film. having said that, 7 minutes is better than nothing, and the suite of score is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP ME","review":"In the movie reese gets really mad when she sees the other guy starting to run for the first time and in the backround music there is this \\"Tribal\\" war cry song thingie...

One copy goes in my kitchen forever! The recipes are fabulous taste treasures that defy adequate description. My family and I simply could not believe how good these meals taste. I did have to search at findng some of the ingredients to the more intricate recipes. The end results were well worth any effort. Since I tend to make a huge mess when cooking and my cookbooks suffer from it, I decided that I needed a second copy of the book. The second copy now occupies a prominent place on the bookshelves in our family room."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal account, but interesting and well-written","review":"Yes, I fully agree with the previous reviewer from Louisiana. This is not a book for those who want to get to know Madagascar and Malagasy culture or history. At the most, in that direction, it provides some 'atmosphere' of Africa for those who have never been there. The book is indeed a personal account of the reader's feelings, as she rediscovered herself during her trip to that wonderful Indian Ocean island. Yet, this is a good subject, and the book is well-written, filled with thrill. I liked it. As long as it is presented as what it is and not something else, I recommend it to those interested in the former."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware of this book's true content","review":"Over The Lip of the World is a FICTIONAL account based on the author's subjective experiences in Madagascar. It is not a recount of Malagasy folklore but rather a history of McElroy's search for her own identity as she looked for it on an island on the other side of the world. Persons interested in Malagasy studies should NOT buy this book; people interested in a black woman's personal history might find it more palatable than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but could be more durable","review":"My son (12 months) enjoys turning the pages back and forth, and he loves to press the block and hear the animal noises. The only problem: he has chewed/sucked off most of the decals on the block showing which side corresponds to which animal. Would be nice if Leapfrog could send extra decals for the sides of the block. Otherwise, it's a great toy, and I think he will continue to enjoy it as he learns more about counting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo cute!","review":"This toy is so cute, although my kids, 2 and 3, have yet to figure out that you are supposed to match the animals on the black to the story, they just like the story and the fact they make the book talk. It has a cute story, a cute song, cute pictures and best of all a volume setting :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's awesome, but the stickers have to go!","review":"My 1 year old LOVES this toy! I think it's wonderful for the educational benefits...colors, numbers, music, etc. The only problem is that Kyle still loves to chew on everything...especially the cool little animal covered block. If they could come up with a decal-free version, it would be great! The block would last forever. At the rate he's going, we're going to have to draw in the animals in about a month! (We could put on new stickers, but the same thing would happen again.) I'd still recommend it....highly. Just try to keep it out of the mouth as much as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"leapfrog does it again-great toy","review":"Got this for xmas when she was 10mo. She loved the song and the pics then. Now at 18mo she is starting to figure out the right \\"side\\" of the block for each page (super cool to watch her learn). Very durable. It's been dropped and dragged everywhere...still works great. Almost a year now and still haven't had to replace the batteries it came with. This IS the only toy I take for entertainment for her at outings (babyshowers, parties, ect). Great with volume control and of course it turns itself off after a few minutes of inactivity.I haven't been too happy with other Leap Frog products (learning band walker, musical alphabet ball, alphabet catapiller) but this one is super great (along with the farm friend fridge toy and of course the ultimate LF baby toy...BABY TAD!!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Prom. Movie. Ever.","review":"I wasn't expecting too much since MTV Original Movies are just recycled stuff all the time. Of course, everybody can know what's the movie about with the title: \\"The Worst Prom Ever.\\"But what I was impressed about, it was the story. It's not only a prom movie, it's a twist of something that could happen to any teenager in a funny way.Chloe Bridges did an amazing job as the leading girl, and I liked how real it felt, because in some Prom movies they don't show the bullies, gay people, and many more but this one did. It's not the best yet, but it was a complete surprise for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"iPhone 2","review":"This was the service package for the iPhone Gen 2 I bought.

The loon sounds were only for the first minute or two, after that it was just melody. The melody was nice but very repetitive. I don't recommend purchasing this unless you either listen to it first, or have enjoyed others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare view of the young rabbi","review":"Readers of other works by Rabbi Heschel are likely to be surprised by this volume; it is not written in his usual poetic, epigrammatic style. While some of this may be due to Heschel's relative youth at the time of writing, it is also the product of a different translation process, done after Heschel's death. The introductory notes to the book explain how this came about, and in the process provide interesting insights on the older Heschel's writing process.This biography of Maimonides is one of Heschel's first works, and as such it is fascinating as a window on the development of his thought. His early fascination with the Prophets shines from every page.This is not Heschel at his finest, but for the discerning reader it can provide, nevertheless, a fascinating window on the man and the development of his thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well-written","review":"Rabbi Heschel may have been a great man, active in the civil rights movement and other just causes. His skill as a young writer and biographer seems lacking in this book though. Very drab and dry, it seems to bounce around way too often. One does not get a good feel for Maimonides and only a limited glance at the era in which he lived. I found little in this book that would encourage me to recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool for Understanding Bilingualism","review":"The book is a great tool for teaching and/or understanding bilingualism in general. The only downside is that it does not have a glossary of terms. You can always make your students do one on their own based on the terms provided in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action-Packed","review":"The only unrealistic part is the basic premise of a satellite system renedering all the worlds rockets and missiles useless is far-fetched. Although to turn the first novel into a series it was necessary. It was defintiely an interesting and fast paced read. The way the old bushido code is thrust into the modern world is very invocative of the fast pace with which it had happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay book","review":"The book has some very good highlights and covers the entire range of the Dell Axim. It is up to date, covering the latest pocket pc from Dell as well as the older models. However, the book is not a \\"how-to\\" reference that I thought it was. It will tell you what is available, but not how to use it. The book does not go into detail on using the Dell Axim, but refers to web sites for further information. This is not what I bought the book for. If you are looking for specific information on using the Dell Axim, this is not the place to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One size almost fits all","review":"You can't beat the cost of a basic welding helmet.

Written as what can best be described as one long prose poem, the storyline is drawn in fragments of conversation, emotion, images, etc. and can be hard to follow at times. However, what's distilled here is an atmosphere of clausterphobia and approaching madness that is definitely Bernhard's forte. I found it to be incredibly lyrical and poignant, and this piece has remained my favorite even after reading several of his more mature works. Maybe because of the dog (read the book!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy separately and save your money!","review":"I LOVE this show, but I think it's ridiculous that you have to spend more money to buy the seasons all together than if you buy each one on its own.

Although somewhat expensive, buying more than one tunnel is highly recommended as the tunnels attach securely and easily together with velcro and increase the fun time. We joined several tunnels together to creat different passage ways within a maze. The tunnels are very functional and durable. Adults as well as kids can easily fit and crawl through this tunnel without fear of ripping the fabric. The padding over the wires is sufficient to prevent discomfort to the knees (at least no more than would otherwise result from crawling around)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonestar-Crazy Nights","review":"I got Lonely Grill last year in 2000 and everyone been telling me to buy this Cd and so I did and I am happy that I got it.

I really love all of song though. Richie and John do a awesome job singing all of the songs. I love the beat to all of song.

However, it is an album that will possibly be looked at as one of Lonestar's mistakes along the road to stardome. That is far from the truth. This album shows the country roots that Lonestar possessed before moving into the more poppy side of life. If you like Lonestar's stuff now you'll love this CD cause it will give you a broader look at their music. They go from soft ballads like \\"week at Juarez\\" to songs like \\"everything's changed\\" which is by far my favourite. \\"Amie\\" was never a single but would have done well on the charts. Have a listen to this one folks and you'll see what Lonestar was before \\"Amazed\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"*A Great Country Album from Lonestar*","review":"Once again...another great album of all time by the best in country by \\"lonestar\\" Their talents are far from over as these guys continue creating great music with a great beat.

I must admit that on most albums that I buy I usually like only two to three of the songs on the album first time listening. But with these guys I enjoyed the songs, the beat and the definite soul that \\"lonestar\\" put into their songs. A great talent from these guys. I have loved every song on this album, but listed above are my favourites.

Although Bing did a promotion tour to Hawaii, staying in the old Royal Hawaiian (ask to see the old photos and posters in their gallery) Not filmed in Hawaii but has a few stock scenes of old Waikiki beach. Kinda hokey but still fun. It's notable for the debut of the song \\"Blue Hawaii\\" which was, amazingly, the *B* side of the Academy Award (Best song) from the same movie, \\"Sweet Leilani\\".

Simon's singing on this particular album is phenomenal. I mean his singing is always superb but on this album there seems to be so much emotion in each song. An added bonus, Sting singing background on one of the songs... listen and figure out which one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arcadia Is Forever","review":"Excellent package and someone mentioned it misses a few tracks to complete this collection but have digital versions of those missing so no problem. Like Power Stations CD / DVD that came out a few years ago, this one is excellent. That too misses a few tracks in which I have as well by the way. This one was great for what it was, a break from beiing Duran Duran. I never thought a second album would come out. I personally think the version here is as clean as my Japanese copy, as for all the bonus stuff, great to listen to if you bought the original 12\\" / 7\\" singles. I also think they missed \\"Say The Word\\" 45rpm 7\\" remix, oh well, have that too, so check this one out if your fan of Duran Duran and buy Power Stations CD / DVd as well. Oh, someone said this is as good as Duran Durans material save \\"Rio\\", I don't agree, but if people think so, so be it.Check out my website for a visit at \\"Judemac Forever\\" Google it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album","review":"This one is definitely in my personal top 10 of all time.

I would highly recommend giving this album a chance, not only for Duran Duran fans, but also for anyone with appreciation for good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Really Great Album","review":"This is one great album that was almost unappreciated by the music press when it came out in the mid 80's. Overshadowed by Power Station, it didn't receive the phrase that it deserved. Well produced, it featured new sides, musically of the three: LeBon, Rhodes and Taylor. And if you were lucky to be watching the top 40 videos show at the right time, you might of got to see one of the rarely shown clips, such as \\"Goodbye Is Forever\\".This was just a really great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor, LeBon, and Rhodes - THE Most Creative Moments","review":"If you really listen, Simon's lyrics were so moving.

I had to go and buy it again. (which I was very pleased it was still available) Before writing this I had to spoil myself by playing it all the way through.A must have for every Duran fan....This project, and era of the band is mystical and hauntingly hallucinagetic.\\"Good-Bye Is Forever\\" \\"The Flame\\" \\"Lady Ice\\" Beautiful, Beautiful work.

I bought this CD out of nostagia as I had the original vinyl version way back when CD's didn't exist. Arcadia were a Duran spin-off where Simon,Nick and Roger did this album and Andy and John went on to form The Power Station. The songs on this album do not come near the quality of Duran Duran and are at best B-Sides...The singles at the time did not sell well and the album received luke-warm reviews...Nothing has changed in 20years and the album still feels like a non-event...Stick to the Duran albums !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DD with a twist!","review":"This is a unique album to say the least!

Simply wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"about as avant garde as christina milian","review":"i would plead with all lovers of good music to stay far away from this awful cd featuring arcadia a terrible band which featured one of the cheesiest songwriters and vocalists known to mankind ever simon le bon.the only saving grace on this album is the presence of david gilmour the guitarist of the greatest band pink floyd playing here only as a guest musician on three tracks.avoid this disaster which bombed badly at all costs.get pulse from pink floyd instead to hear gilmour at his best.half a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best CDs Ever","review":"With so much junk out there on the market these days it's nice to go back to the days of my youth. This has to be the best CD ever recorded, it was almost impossible for me to find this. Most of my record collection is scratched to death. Almost no band can live on like these guys, this is music, not a wanabe mix of kids. This is a must buy for classic rock fans and one who wants true music. This style of music has to move into the future. Duran Duran/Arcadia will never die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any New Wave/Pop fan of the '80s...","review":"This was as one magazine back in \\"the day\\" wrote...\\"the best album Duran Duran never released.\\" That is a compliment. Minus Andy and John Taylors rock influence, Simon, Nick and Andy were free to release an artistic/new wave/dare I say slightly \\"goth\\" album. Hell, they all dyed their hair black and wore mostly black clothes while supporting the album SRTR. Nick was free to let the synths, and Simon his vocals...take center stage in this underrecognized 80's release. Hell, you don't want to take the full leap, just download the original album if your interested...after marinating in that for awhile, I'm sure you will come back for the crisp, clean, remastered version plus the numerous perks this release provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money!","review":"I had checked all around the stores here in town and found absolutely nothing worth the retail price.This Futon mattress is very plush and really soft.It's however not the color of the picture,...It's a very Hunter green,but a $5-$10 futon cover can take care of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track","review":"Love the sport and from what i read so far in the manga it is a must buy with athletics, romance and comedy all in one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the Disco","review":"I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 10 year old son. As a previous reviewer noted, it is a bit tricky to turn on the lights. But once I learned the process, I discovered that lights on ball # 1 did not work at all. Furthermore, the disco lights on balls #2 and #3 did not work. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this toy since it does not fulfill its claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun in light or dark, but caution when replacing batteries","review":"Juggled these around at a few anime dances, and they where amazing in the dark setting with the lights either strobing or constant. The only problem was when I tried to replace the batteries... The screws are very soft, and I wound up stripping one of the heads, and stripping the bore as I took out the other. I tried to super glue it back together, but it didn't last. Lots of fun to play with, but needs to come with a screw driver or another way to replace batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so Rave-riffic","review":"These are a really cool toy for ACTIVE adults, hence the company's name, although it's perceived to be a good rave toy because of the lights and patterns, for the person doing them it requires a bit of effort, so it's really only good for people watching during rave time. Otherwise, a very neat toy! They're really fun to play with once you get the hang of them, tires you out after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a while, but started to rust","review":"This pot was good for a year or so, but we started to notice rust. Worthless now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I learned French in high school for five years, so I am basically familiar with the language, but I am not comfortable speaking it. I bought this set (with the CDs) to try and brush up on my speaking skills. I was not impressed. The dialogs don't always focus on practical situation--these was one that was a call-in talk show! They also seemed a bit short. I use Audacity to cut out the English from the exercises in language books, and when I was done there wasn't a lot left that was useful.The Living Languages Ultimate series is not much more expensive, and focuses more on useful dialogs. I would recommend buying that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"im sure its a great product if amazon didnt ship damaged items with missing parts","review":"its beyond me how something ships in the condition that i got it in. the grinder was broken in 2 different spots when i opened the box and it was not broken during shipping cause the pieces that broke off are no where in the box so someone else broke it returned it and amazon never checked the item and resent it to me. on top of the item being broken there multiple missing parts! great job guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a surf-only album","review":"If the music had been unobstrusive, I might have liked this album. As it was, after about 20 seconds of surf noise, the music took over in volume, and it was the sort of newage trancey stuff that irritates me rather than soothing. It has no progression, just sort of wanders all over the place, dragging my attention unwillingly.After three minutes and a short scan, I turned it off. It'll be found used somewhere. The label or the artist may claim it's beautiful music, and it may be true for some value of <beauty>, but I am not a holder of that value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product and service","review":"The book itself is amazing--several plays written by--in my humble opinion--one of the second half of the twentieth century's most important authors--and I couldn't be happier with the service I received from the seller. I would definitely buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought I was reading a Dilbert strip","review":"This book gave a very intresting view into the building of the International Space Station. As far back as I can remember, I can not recall reading an informative book, that took such an angle as \\"Peckerhead.\\" If you compare the I.S.Station to other American achievements in space, it does not seem very excieting, at least to me. However, combining the technical efforts that were involved, with some quotes, a little sarcasm, some satire, and a good bit of \\"Dilbert\\" humor, prohibited me from putting the book down. If you want to learn about the International Space Station there are probably a good number of books to choose from. However, if you want to have a good time doing it, make Cordoba's book your first choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Before Dilbert","review":"As told from the point of view of one technical manager and the cast of characters he had both the pleasure and misfortune of working with, '...Peckerhead' tries to lay out the taxonomy for all things pathological that serve to stymie the routine hammering out of what would otherwise be only a stupifyingly complicated technical task.Ample proof that there was a well developed sense of Dilbert long before 'cubicle' entered the popular lexicon, the author provides a sense of humor, humanity, and insanity.Unlike works such as Kidder's \\"Soul of a New Machine\\", this is not a narrative retelling of what happened. Rather, it's more a compilation, a \\"Best of Meeting Hell\\", of snips and snatches of everyday occurrences and how they were felt by managers and engineers.One possibly small disappointment is that names, those of people and companies alike have been changed to protect both the innocent and the guilty.A fine read, for hopeful and cynic alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"Advertised as three volumes...but turned out to be only one book of three. I thought this was a little misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"sizing is way off! or they put the wrong size in package.","review":"i purchased the child small (the package says will fit 40-55lbs). Which should have been perfect, but these tights are so short they would fit my 9 month old! This review process was also confusing...asked questions as if the item was a toy, and nowhere on the package or the amazon cite does it say that it's a toy; they're suppose to be children's tights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Desyn has the ability to weave complex rythems, melodies, and harmonies, which can take you out of the mundane into a world filled with lush and vibrant color. Just picked this one up the other day and haven't put it down since. The CD starts off strong and ends strong---not a bad song on here. It gets better with each listen, and thats saying a lot seeing as how I like the sound almost immediately. Desyn is definitely one to watch, and his debut on Bedrock is nothing less than phenomenal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return it","review":"Bought as a gift. Upon opening box immediately noticed this was previously used unit; internal packaging material broken and water spots in the tank. I decided to try it anyway, hoping it had been returned for something other than performance. Nope -- water leaked from below boiler unit quite badly. Really awful for the manufacturer to sell a reconditioned unit as new, worse one that does not work! The item is quite heavy returning it was a real chore. I urge the prospective buyer to be be wary of this manufacturer again. I won't risk buying from tjem again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"Less than a day after we presented this toy for my daughter's birthday, it no longer worked. It still makes noises, but does not move. I've replaced the batteries thinking that might have been the problem--it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"If you have read Life Strategies or have completed any of the exercses in the Life Strategies Workbook, then you are already on your way to self-discovery. Both are excellent self-help tools and highly recommended. However, this journal is not like the original book or the companion workbook and readers could be very disappointed. There is nothing contained in this journal that would lead one to self-discovery other than what the reader actually chooses to write. You are not prompted for ideas, thoughts or feelings but left to your own resources to express your own thoughts. There are a variety of basic journals on the market, many for more outstanding than this one, so invest your money in the Life Strategies book and the Life Strategies Workbook and pass on the Self-Discovery Journal."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Expensive Way to Buy Lined Paper in Bound Form!","review":"Each page in this journal is in the same format. It has a one sentence epigram from Life Strategies at the top. You then get blue lines across the rest of the page, where you can fill in your ideas on this topic.Compared to either Life Strategies or The Life Strategies Workbook, this journal is not very helpful at all.If you have read Life Strategies, you can simply write down your ideas about the key elements in that book on your own paper.If you want to do exercises, The Life Strategies Workbook is superb and I highly recommend it.Skip this journal!Do you learn best by thinking, writing, talking, doing, or some combination of the above? Whatever the best method is, use that method to apply Life Strategies to improving your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"choose a better self help book","review":"I was dissappointed in this journal, because it seemed like more of a workbook. I was expecting more of a self help book, not a book which I had to write my own opinions. I bought this book to hear the opinions of another person, that is not what I recieved. I do not think that is helpful, but if you like to do exercises, go ahead and try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Toy","review":"I just got the toy for my 2 year old and he loved it. The only problem is that after about 5 minutes of play the toy decided not to work. I now had my 2 y/o screaming at me for his choo choo to go and I couldn't make it work. I knew that the batteries couldn't be dead b/c it was only on for 5 minutes. I got it to start working but then it said that there was no block in the coal car, which was not true. I got it to work for about a minute and it then recognized the wrong letter in the coal car. I do NOT recommend this toy for any child. I never had a problem with a leap frog toy ( my son and nieces have a lot of them)and I was terrible disappointed with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited educational value AND limited fun","review":"I strongly recommend against this train. The educational value is very limited -- it only teaches 3 songs and the sound made by a handful of letters. In addition, our version sometimes gets the letters wrong! My 18 month old likes pushing the buttons to start and stop the train and inserting the letter blocks, but there is not much more you can do to play with the train. If he takes it off the track to run it elsewhere or play with it, the VERY ANNOYING voice repeats \\"I'm off the track!\\" over and over again. Bottom line -- doesn't teach much, doesn't encourage (or really permit) creative play, is expensive and is annoying to adults!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We have had this toy for 5 YEARS ALREADY !!!","review":"I was baffled when I saw this in Target the other day. My son who i 5 1/2 got this for christmas 5 years ago and it is EXACTLY the same (thanks Leap Frog). It has been in the basement for the past few years(on and off, sometimes they play with it for a day) but we brought it up to the toy room about a month ago and my 3 year olds friends LOVE IT! I thought it was discontinued but I guess Leap Frog brought it back.IT is fun for the kids, educational for preschoolers and I like the crossing signals that make the train stop and load new blocks etc.It also has two volume levels(IMPORTANT) and lots of blocks so even if you lose one NO WORRIES ! The train does however go off the track alot, but Leap, Lilly and Tad will let you know again and again and again! All in all a good toy for the 2-4 year old set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"train lover","review":"I also bought this train for my 2yr old for Christmas. Nothing else mattered to him but the train. I've also noticed that it sang the wrong letters. Our train had a problem going around the track. It started on Christmas, we could give it a push and then it would go around. It finally started to work fine. After about three weeks the trian would sing but not go around the track. We replaced the batteries and it worked fine. I just replaced the batteries again (3 weeks later) and now the train won't go around the track at all. I called Leap Frog and they said to return it to the store I bought it at. Well to my dismay and my 2yr olds nobody has one in stock. Luckly I found one on-line on clearance. Except for this slight problem I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Aboard! We love this toy!","review":"My son got this last Christmas, he was 21 months old. Months later he STILL loves it. Unlike Geotrax, he can actually help put a lot of the track together. He enjoys the ABC construction part of it, where you stack up the blocks and knock them over with the wrecking ball. He also really likes the blocks that make the train sing when you push them down and sometimes he doesn't put a block in and puts Elmo or Blue's Clues in the hole so that they can go for a ride. We haven't had any technical difficulties with this at all. We're very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our new favorite toy!!!","review":"I love this toy! We have not had any problems with the wrong letters like the other reviews. Maybe they have made an improvement. My 3 year old just thinks it is a lot of fun, but Mommy love that he is learning so much. He sings the song with the train so he is learning all of this letter sounds. He is even learning vowels because whenever you put one the the train, he chimes in the leaps voice and says \\"vowel aboard\\"I have recommended this toy to anyone who would listen! I absolutely love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Frustrated!!!","review":"My 2 yr old received this for a gift and at first I LOVED it...I thought it was the cutest toy.But, after putting it together... it became the most frustrating toy we have. The train constantly de-rails off the track.. I've tried everything to fix the plastic tracks, but the train can't remain on the tracks for long. Plus, mine also has an annoying \\"short\\" inside, so when it hits certain bumps, it turns off.I'm going to put the toy away b/c it's not any fun for my kids...it has to be constantly reset and placed back on the track and since they can't do it, I have to.It's a shame, b/c it is was more durably built, it would be the Best toy and I would have rated it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy, letter problem","review":"the train does get the letter wrong, but I've found that if I remove and replace the letter, it works OK (for awhile). Hopefully the problem will not get worse...if so, I'll give leapfrog a call..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Very Disappointing\\"","review":"As a fan of leapfrog toys I am very disappointed withthis item. It constantly stopped running stating \\"I am off the track\\" even when it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live in the Moment","review":"Bravo! I applaud this author's message to women everywhere. It's time for us to learn to say \\"no\\" and take the time to fill ourselves back up again without feeling guilty. So many times I have asked a fellow mother or career woman, \\"How are you?\\" and the typical response is, \\"I'm so tired...I have 100 things to do...\\" And you know the rest of the laundry list they spout. For once I would love to hear one of them say, \\"You know what? I feel great! I just took a nap, or I read a novel I've been meaning to finish, or I'm going home to soak in the tub.\\" Perhaps if more women would receive Jennifer Louden's books as gift they would begin to see how they can make this time for themselves no matter what kind of life they are living.

The amp distorts like crazy, over heats and shuts of every 20-30 mins (I was not running it bridged), and to top it off doesn't ever produce enough base as a 300 was MTX, Kicker, or Rockford Fosgate would.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely an intermediate dvd","review":"This dvd is definitely not for beginners. You need a reasonable knowledge of the fingerboard and pentatonic scales. If you are a beginner, you'd probably be better off starting with some of Happy Traum's blues dvd's. Weider does cover some of the basic blues stuff that every blues player needs but you'd need to be a very determined beginner to do much with the rest. I thought it was excellent, loved the songs he uses. It was all pretty much at my level with some fun challenges. It will help me be a better blues player. On the con side, the material could have been better organized and Weider could have done a better job tying what he was playing at the moment to the tab. All in all, a good teaching dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be a must for blues players","review":"First off this is not really for a beginner player. You need to also be pretty familar with the fretboard for one reason. If you want to learn more about playing \\"orginal blues\\" for electric this is probably one of the better DVDs around. VEry quality production and Jim is a quality instructor. Goingn Down, St Elmos Blues, Hideaway, and Sugar Cane Blues are the tunes he covers in this dvd. He discusses a few blues scales, blues rythmns as well as some of the classic licks in detail. All these are taught based on their orginal arrangements for the most part. Sugar Cane Blues is Jim's own tune though. If you have been playing electric some already and want to see & hear how to play in the style of Freddie King this may help you out. I woul dnot get this if you are just starting out though on electric in general. Hideaway is a lot harder to do than it looks! Also he demonstrates everything pretty good and then Jim and his backing band let's you play along too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"Instructional guitar DVDs are hard to make, and this one is a lesson in how not to make one. The instructor is awkward and hesitant (it crossed my mind that he was stoned). He throws out bits of useless information (\\"Stevie Ray Vaughn plays this a lot now, but it's really an old lick\\"). He plays a lick quickly several times and expects you to magically pick it up. I kept finding myself staring at the TV, thinking his fingers were one string lower than they actually were. An occassional fretboard diagram would be very helpful. There is a booklet of tablature, but it doesn't always seem to match what he's playing. I would expect a DVD with this name to have a few dozen simple, popular blues licks -- alas, no such luck. This DVD goes through a few uninspired blues songs and a few cursory licks, and wraps up.Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I enjoyed this book and her others with her female detective Britt Montero.

Well, this book changed my mind. I feel like I learned more about the Civil War (in a good way) through this book than I ever did through school. The characters are relatable across time and circumstances. This book gives a look at the Civil War through the eyes of a southern girl who has a loving relationship with the slaves that work for her family. These slaves end up showing her the true love of family and God where her biological family fell short. There are enough unresolved issues to keep you reading as quickly as you can, while at the same time you wish the book would never end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finished it, but nearly didnt..","review":"I love historical fiction.

Such a heartwarming story and not boring as one of the readers said. It is clean and not offensive as so many novels are. As Christians we need to guard our minds and hearts and I never once had to worry that I would read something trashy. Yes, it's true that some of the vocabulary used did not always fit that time period but the story was still wonderful and well written with historical facts. Eli, the slave/preacher, and a man of God with deep faith despite the oppression of slavery, always had words of wisdom based on the truth of God's Word. I was so inspired. It's not easy for most of us to understand what slaves went through but this book gave me some new insight into the life of a slave.

You should know how to read tabs and music. He covers some very important basics like turnarounds, strums, fingerstyle technique, chord extensions and substitutions, things that you can take away from this video and apply to many other kinds of popular music, but especially to great old Hawaiian songs.The only downside to me is that he tunes the ukulele in D in this video, so you'll have to tune yours up from C. That means that your strings will tend to go sharp after you tune them back to C. It's a small price to pay for such a good video, though.

Indeed, as Fallada tells his tale of the time period through the eyes of the newly-married Johannes and Lammchen, he puts faces and names on the poverty that spread through Germany like wildfire during the Interwar period. Reading this nearly 80 years after the first publication, I am delighted by the sardonic humor that Fallada chose to employ and the thick description of his prose.

Otherwise, it was not too objectionable, and in fact I enjoyed the costumes and choreography, but I will not be viewing this version again.

But the film is a gossamer, ancient, tinkling extravaganza, which creaks along at times, but never forgets that the true principle of an Elizabethan comendy is entertainment. As such, Cagney as Bottom brings popularity and 'trashiness' and fun to an ostensibly simple role - Rooney's Puck is irritating, but then Puck always is, especially to other characters.

The thing sounds great when it is off. The sound is absolutely horrible. I don't know if I just have a bad unit or what. One of the speakers sounds like the plastic box is rattling, even at low volumes. The equalizer functions are terrible too. The only equilizer setting that sounds half way decent is XBS setting without the bass boost. And why put a bass boost on it if it is going to make it sound like a rattling trunk lid of an over-bassed car? What can you expect for a free gift though.

Several of the testifying soldiers were filmed in multiple settings to give the impression that many more soldiers were being interviewed than actually were. This, of course, undermines the intelligence of the average viewer, but then again, that target demographic (impressionable youth and/or less than intelligent) is whom this film is aimed at anyway...If you are a \\"Bush-Basher\\", you will enjoy the \\"more of the same\\" tired arguments against the war. On the other hand, if you lean the slightest bit to the right, you may wish to steer clear of this film...garbage propaganda (again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should see this, especially if they plan to enlist","review":"Although I can understand why some veterans might view this film as one-sided, it does not pretend to be a comprehensive survey; rather, it reveals the dark side of U.S. operations in Iraq, the OFFICIAL POLICY of knowingly killing innocent Iraqi civilians, including children, when it is expedient to do so. The film also explores the shabby and hypocritical manner in which veterans with emotional injuries (often related to the guilt of such morally abhorrent actions) are treated in comparison to those with more obvious physical injuries. These powerful truths are not being given their due by the mainstream media. Even though the war is now unpopular, this film will raise consciences to a new level.

If you vote, you should see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the point of this war","review":"Though it is very painful to see this video, it is greatly worth it. Even if one is very well informed about Iraq and some of the abuses of American soldiers such as repeated services, the true stories of individual soldiers on how they became disillusioned is wrenching. The deepest insight I got was that killing innocents in the war tortures returning soldiers and is integral to the post traumatic stress syndrome so many of the soldiers are suffering. The film makes you question this kind of war--especially in Iraq. This is because a soldier can't ever know for sure who is the enemy, that is who is shooting at them so they kill a whole lot of people in the direction from which the soldier was shot at. When they kill a lot of innocent people they create e.g. 500 new fervid enemies (the famiies of those shot) What's the point! This is emotionally created in the viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathleen Battle and Luciano Pavarotti at Their Best","review":"This production of L'Elisir d'Amore is the best performance of this opera available on video and one of the very best performances of the entire Metropolitan Opera Video Catalogue. As Adina, Kathleen Battle is sensational. Her voice is sublime, glowing with a ravishingly creamy, sensuous legato. Not only does she sing with technical perfection and ease, her compelling artistry is the epitome of grace and charm. Luciano Pavarotti gives his finest performance on video in his signature role of Nemorino. This role was his own personal favorite of all his roles and it shows in the warmth and charm he brings to his portrayal and his gorgeous vocalism. Battle and Pavarotti enjoy \\"clowning\\" with each other and the audience loves it. James Levine is at his best, giving an energy and excitement that makes this Bel Canto masterpiece explode with color and sparkle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Opera DVD ever!","review":"This DVD is a must-have for every opera lover.

Extraordinary!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Italian at its best","review":"Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore is a wonderful opera. Light, entertaining and distracting us from all evil things going on in the world. But also reminding us how easily we all are fooled by these charlatans who know the art of changing our hopes into money in their own pockets. The performance claims for both singing and acting and the winner is Mr Battle who is absolutely outstanding as the convincing seller of the functional food of the time, l'elisir d'amore - the love-potion. Miss Battle is also very good with a wonderful, sensitive voice. Of course, Pavarotti is the great tenor but here also confirming his often less successful talent as an actor. Unfortunately his voice can't always compensate his woody performance and (too) impressive body - reducing the rating from 5 stars to 4. Maestro Levine is the ideal conductor to keep it all together with both humour and discipline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect but marred with Pavarotti's performance","review":"What a delightful and fun opera. I disagree with others too. In all respects 5 stars. This is not a dream cast unless you close your eyes when Pavarotti is on stage. His golden voice is now a silver voice. And he is a large lump on the stage with absolutely no acting ability. Opera singers should be judged on their voice, acting ability, stage presence and presentation. His costume was literally a tent due to his massive size. He was hardly engaged with the cast and certainly not a credible love interest for Ms. Battle. A buffoon yes. I now will search for another Elixer of love with a tenor with better acting ability. If you want to see acting watch Domingo in Carmen and Pagliacci."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Impressive","review":"I purchased this DVD after watching an opera on PBS TV.

Pretty ear candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"I did not expect to like this CD; I bought it because I have enjoyed other Barbara Bonney CDs (especially her Mendelssohn lieder) and was able to get it very cheaply.

Unusual for studies of this sort, Williamson's book is filled with photographs and graphs which clearly and effectively outline the trajectory of the Luftwaffe's early victories and subsequent (and inevitable) defeat. His description of the dysfunctional leadership at the very top of the Luftwaffe and the Nazi hierarchy show how they paved the way for defeat by mid-1944. One of Williamson's major contributions is his explanation of the role of the production of aircraft, pilots, and spare parts - things that are all too often left out of histories of aerial warfare. This is a well-written, highly informative work that is a must for anyone seeking to understand how and why air forces win or lose wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely NOT a book to pass up!","review":"I FOUND THIS REVIEW ON ANOTHER SITE AND COPIED IT HERE:This book is very well written... sensual and romantic as well as sexual.

The best performance comes from Rip Torn and he dies half way into the picture. Ken Wahl as a love interest for Bette? I don't think so. He looked like he wanted to leave the movie, hunt down his agent, \\"Wiseguy\\" style and waste 'em. I have never given a Bette Midler movie a bad review, but this one IS BADDDDD!!! Its so bad the DVD comes with its own odor. Its a stink-a-roo. It gets one extra star because I did laugh twice, and one scene was very funny. It had nothing to do with the movie, but it was funny. This movie makes \\"Rhinestone\\" shine if one could imagine that possible. However, if you collect Bette movies then you must own this one. Its safe there will be no sequel, and I think she's learned not to do lame comedies. No, wait! Well you really can't count that sitcom, can you? Ouch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just OK but not worth owning.","review":"This movie was rated R for some foul language and a nude Rip Torn in case you were wondering. This is a dark romantic dramedy with few laughs. If you love Bette Midler than maybe you should rent it or buy for less than a buck but other than that she has few one liners and plays a con artist who hates her husband. Bette's charming personality doesn't shine in this movie like in Beaches or Stella instead it is annoying like her character in The Rose. Overall the plot is redundant and spins in circles.

Misspelling in the Hebrew text itself.2. Missing text or letters.3. Missing Strong's Numbering.4. Incorrect Strong's Numbering.5.

I do enjoy the MKJV, as this to me is the next best thing. However, how can you compare having the exact Hebrew and Greek texts right in front of you? This is the problem of modern translations, including the \\"KJV 1611 AV\\", which I think is an acceptable copy, but it is not perfect. Why try to imitate the original Old English (which is actually about unreadable being early 17th century English)? It is a form of a transliteration. I have read a Nelson Reprint (an exact copy of the original 1611 Bible), and it is quite different from the modern \\"KJV 1611 AV\\".I am more interested in *exactly* what God said (as is Mr. Green), word for word, than a close translation.

Yes, just plain gone! This renders the text worthless for students of Biblical Hebrew. It would be great if I could just read the Hebrew text in this book and have the interlinear translation right there, but I have to actually use a JPS version of the text in order to get the vowels right and then switch back to this text. Very disappointing.

I would not recommend this book, so please save your money and your eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was looking for an exact interpretation of the original Hebrew/Greek text, not the actual Hebrew/ Greek text itself with it's English interpretation; which I imagine not that many people can actually read or comprehend.

The item actually felt like paper, and was very poorly constructed. I attempted to contact the seller a number of times over as many days about a quick return, and finally the seller responded after about a week, and authorized a return minus the shipping costs and a 25% restocking fee. The seller obviously does not stand by their product in that regard. I paid about $55 including shipping and was refunded about $35. An expensive return. I appreciate that the return was made, but it took quite some time for my credit card to be refunded after I had shipped the item (about 2 weeks)and quite some time to get a response.

A week ago, I decided to go to the cinema to see this film,'Shrek'. I spent the most enjoyable 2 hours(approx.) sat on a chair in front of a screen. I am Spanish so I aw the Spanish version. Simply awesome. I do not think 'Shrek' is a film. The magic this Spielberg-film (as always) transmits to its viewer converts it in something more than just a film. I haven't seen a film, I have seen a reflection of life, an exciting story, a disconnection of the same rutine which we experince when we watch any film. 'Shrek is different', 'Shrek' is simply the best film I have seen EVER. The book has also caused an impact on me. It is a beautiful story which will entertain everyone who sees or reads it, doesn't matter the age. This is why I can't avoid giving 'Shrek' the maximum punctuation, because it is more than a film and a book. It's... MAGIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book!","review":"The thing that disappoints me is. The fact that this Shrek is the same as the movie. I found a few goofs in the book regarding one left out word.

I would recommend the other Shrek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Original","review":"If you like the story of Shrek that you saw on the movie screen, I supposed you'd like this version of that story. But, if you want the original Shrek, please read the book by William Steig. You will find a different story, but you'll find the real thing.One objection to the movie's story - supposedly the message was that it doesn't matter what you look like. But it makes fun of short people.One other note: all of the young reviewers of this Ellen Weiss version of Shrek need to go back to school and take some spelling lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Acts of the Apostles","review":"I am a professor in a Bible Institute.

By the end of a long tour that took them to London Steely Dan , the band, was no more. Original members Hodder and Baxter were kicked out not to be replaced and Steely Dan's 1975 tour was scratched. But the music..ah yes the music. 'Pretzel Logic' represented the culmination of the young Becker/Fagen persona; laced with old jazz riffs and black and white New York imagery, sorta of like noire meets Ellington, 'Logic is perfect pop for now people. It even had throw backs to the early country western 'Dan (\\"With A Gun' which featured Poco member Tim Schmit; soon to be an Eagle) and put Steely Dan at the top of the pop charts with 'Rikki Don't Lose That Number' (#2 in August right when the band imploded).

I bought it when it first came out back in '74--and since then I have still not gotten tired of it. IT AGES VERY WELL. The Amazon critic complained that Rikki Don't Lose That Number doesn't make any sense--I disagree. It makes perfect sense. It's essentially about Rikki who did a guy wrong and as a result, decides to leave town (or run away from her problem). Her friend, the narrator of the song, gives Rikki his phone number in case she needs to talk to someone about what she did to the guy--apparently she's taking it pretty hard. He's hoping she has a \\"change of heart\\" and moves back to town. This is a very original song. I wish they wrote more songs like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"mustard for the pretzel","review":"Just a note on the sonics of the remaster vs. the 1993 box set disc of the same title, while I would give the nod to this 1999 (not 1990 amazon) remaster, it is just barely better sounding. There is a little more detail or resolution if you will especially in the background keyboard fills on Rikki... than on the 93 disc.

So what if the Dan aren't a country band, this is a great country tune. 'Monkey In Your Soul' is a great R&B tune. I know, they are not an R&B band either. What kind of band are they then? They are a musical group. Last I checked, all kinds a styles, whether it be Pop, R N R, R&B, Soul, Jazz are musical. Steely Dan are just an amazing musical group. PERIOD.

Set in Melbourne, Australia, this film has it all, an engaging plot, characters we can relate to and/or have fantasised about, a variety of very hot real sex scenes that are sure to suit a wide range of tastes, and a few surprises along the way. The cast, including Amy Carter, Anthea Eaton, Rupert Owen, Butch Midway, Jimstar and Brianna Heart make this film a definite treat for the voyeurists at heart.

But this is an honest opinion. I saw a few screenshots of this movie before I bought it, the story sounded pretty good and it was based around music, which is always good, and an all girl band, another plus. But after getting this film, I quickly was disgusted with it and refuse to watch it again. I am far from squeamish, but this film really raises the bar on \\"disgusting\\" and puts it at a whole new level. From highly detailed scenes of men masterbating, for whatever the reason, I just simply found stomach-turning and completely unnecessary. The girl on girl scenes are pretty nice, but it has a plot that is very hard to follow and its vulgarity makes the overall scene not worth getting, not even worth renting.

I do no know one thing for sure and its that Collins did indeed lift much of her HG story from Battle Royale.Its bloody, its sad. There is some social commentary but very little explanation of what kind of world produced the student games. The acting is good but the script didn't really lead to too much character development except for a few characters such as the student who was strong yet socially isolated, hurt from years of childhood abuse and neglect. Its worth renting but I wouldn't buy the dvd. I would rather invest in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAR BETTER THAN \\"HUNGER GAMES\\"","review":"It has been called gloriously sick, twisted and disturbing. BATTLE ROYALE is a title that thrilled and unnerved audiences with a fiendishly simple premise that has inspired many imitations including THE HUNGER GAMES. Based on the 1999 global best seller by Koushun Takami, the futuristic tale first came to the big screen in 2000. When Kinji Fukasaku unleashed his violently poetic epic about an innocent group of Junior High students forced by the government to hunt and kill their classmates for sport, it not only launched a global phenomenon and was nominated for 10 Japanese Academy Awards but also was at the same time banned from screens by frightened civic groups including distributors across America.

HOWEVER- this 'Director's Cut' is total garbage.Sadly, as with the case for many 'Special Edition' DVDs, Battle Royale: Director's Cut adds unnecessary footage that does nothing to enhance the film. The end is extending by 8 minutes or so - and delves into a sort of epilogue and series of dream sequences.The Battle Royale wiki explains the changes here: (...)No attempt was made to clean up the subtitles: I can ignore misspellings and incorrect conjugations - however at one point the subtitles ran off the screen. The subtitles in the added scenes were far worse than that of the rest of the movie.I am not bashing Battle Royale; I want people to buy the regular version and forget that this Director's Cut is even an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie that may never make it to the states","review":"OK first and foremost, this movie is not banned from the US. The problem is with the Japanese distributor and the MPAA. Due to the fact that this movie features 15 year olds killing 15 year olds, the MPAA would never let this movie be released without serious editing. They could choose not to submit it to the MPAA, but that would mean it could only be played in arthouse theaters. Which is all fine and good, but the Japanese distributor sees this film as a huge blockbuster, which basically means they want a lot of money for it. Because of all this, there will most likely never be an American distributor for it, but you can get imports of it off the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle Royale","review":"I just got this video from Japan town in San Francisco(I had a chance to watch the part of this film in my Japanese class and was really interested..)this is an awesome film for all those who loves some kind of horror and mystery movies.This is about the students in a class(Japan) were put into the island to kill each other in 3 days and only one survival can get out of the island.Nanahara and Noriko, who were eventually fell in love kept their promise to protect each other in that horrible situation.Who would be the last one to survive???

But like everything else in this world, it is aimed at a certain audience, the people who like this movie also like movies like Kill Bill, and other extremely graphic martial arts style movies. so in short, if you like movies with alot of action and plot you'll certainly love this movie like i do, the sequel is almost out on dvd as well but only for region 3 dvd players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as violent as I thought it would be","review":"an above average movie with a rather creative story but and decent acting, the dialouge is nothing to marvel at but it isn't unbearable, it seems have a decent lesson to be learned and accuratley depicts in my opinion what would really happen in a time of desperation some would go crazy some would turn to there lovers some would admit secrets never told before and some would reflect.

No character development, horrible, stupid dialog (\\"I always thought you were cute\\" - \\"You never said anything!\\" - after shooting her male schoolmate...), just 2 hours of kids killing each other. I think I liked Hunger Games more than others did because I read the book first, but that aside, this was the worst $5 I ever spent. Also losing faith in Quentin if he thinks this is his \\"favorite\\" movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but disappointing film","review":"This is no Hunger Games. The idea behind the film may be new at the time the film was shot, but I found the movie thoroughly boring and a complete drag. Many scenes were typically B-movie slash n gore.

Not a keeper; especially not on bluray."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it","review":"This was terrible....please don't think it's anything like the Hunger Games.....please don't think it is worth watching unless you just like to watch crappy movies and make fun of how crappy they are as you watch....nope not even that would make it worth watching"},{"rating":"1","title":"just my opinion","review":"I read the book before I even knew there was a movie, and I'm glad I did. The book was very good but the movie doesn't have the time to go into the back-stories of the characters and maybe that's why it left me feeling kind of \\"flat\\". I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you've read the book and just want to see a movie version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Field Trip...","review":"When I first heard about BATTLE ROYALE, it sounded like a mindless, ultra-violent movie about survival. Having seen it, I can say that, while it deals w/ survival, it's also a social satire / black comedy that uses violence to drive its point home. It reminded me (a bit) of LORD OF THE FLIES, only w/ far more mass murder! Actually, what I liked most were the more touching, emotional moments in between the brutal deaths. The friendships, the doomed, secret crushes, and the sacrifices made for others. Without these parts, BR would have been as stupid as BOOT CAMP! Another thing worth noting is the cast's acting. I never felt like I was watching a bunch of painfully young actors. Very convincing. Another superior offering from Japan..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depiction of the brutality of the young generation.","review":"While some may think of this movie as humorous entertainment or a bizarre horror flick, it is really not so different from the state of some youth today.

It's tacky, badly acted and scripted, and in general a third-rate movie. Perhaps it indeed has a message, but it's lost in the presentation.

Flms such as \\"The Matrix\\" & \\"Fight Club\\" gave me hope that there was still auteurs out there that had the vision of a good film and not just the money involved or the publisity that came along with it but genuienly had good ideas and gambled with this to pruduce films that are at least to say out standing.

The story is great and gritty not for the and this movie is uncut so you get the Directors cut of the film, and contrary to popular opinion this movie was released in limited quantities the problem was that no distributor picked it up because of the lack of interest at the time, now that it has gained cult status it has finally gotten the respect it deserves.

This one has the best footage of any of their home videos. Speaking for the rest of the true KISS army, we appreciate all of the things that you let us see. If, however, you are a newer KISS fan and don't know everything about the band and their history, I would still recommend picking up eXtreme closeup first, as that one is much more KISStory and will give you all the pertinent info needed to appreciate a video like this one. The out of makeup coverage is classic, and it is fantastic to see in depth how the renunion happened. This might be the only chance you will get to see the full blown show with effects and lighting with KISS in street clothes... how can you pass that up.

While much of this video does nothing more than rehash material that you have probably already purchased (Exteme Closeup) it is a great journal of the reunion tour of '96-97. The European and Japanese tour footage is fantastic. I have seen a few reviews stating that there is a problem w/ picture quality. I have no idea where that comes from except an inferior DVD player. In some cases the material is reproduced from 25 year old source footage, and this probably accounts for any \\"picture problems.\\" This is a must for rock and roll fans, and optional for KISS fans who already own the \\"second coming\\" or \\"extreme closeup\\" vhs releases (but you know you will buy this it anyway!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"As a 20+ year KISS fan, I was very interested to see what they had come up with for their newest DVD. After watching this two hour documentary, I was quite disappointed. The picture quality during the first hour is very poor, and the documentary rambles on with no particular theme. The band constantly displays their larger than life egos, and the numerous scenes showing footage of girls baring their breasts at concerts seems awfully tacky to show over and over again. The lack of uninterrupted concert footage, other than the three songs at the end, was disappointing. After you watch this video once, it is unlikely you will ever want to view it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"Ok, I just read some of the others' reviews of this product, and a lot did not seem to like it, etc. I remember one reviewer even saying it was lacking in concert footage??? Hey, watch the second half of this, it's packed full of concert footage! Ok, maybe it's not packed full of full concert footage, but this is bacially a documentary, not a concert dvd. Not to cut some down here, but if some don't like this, for whatever reason, I would like to see some of you make your own Kiss documentary, and release it nationally, to see if some of you can do a better job. Ok, some of you probably could, but I hope you understand what I am saying. I have liked Kiss since the age of 9, and am now 36. I grew up with Kiss. Yes, I have even met them.

There's no one single interview made direct for the film, containing the band member or their manager or whatever. The DVD is empty, it lacks depth.

The DVD dosen't contain much good material except the three live songs they have put as extra material on the disc.

While Molly and Ralph visit their Uncle Claude and grandfather, their mother takes their two older sisters around the world in preparation for marrialge.

When Ralph asks her what dirty words she knows, his name, too, is added to the list of \\"unforgivables.\\" Molly's presence inhibits Ralph's male maturation.

For me, the book was all about the dualities of life: California versus Colorado, the city versus the wilderness, civilization and nature, childhood and adulthood, life and death. All of this is bolsterd by Stafford's writing style, or rather two styles, which further reinforce the conflicts within the story. And, just when I thought I had everything figured out, the ending blew me away.

First off, the book will make much more sense if you are a reader of thier convention fanzine, Monster News, as the book contains a collection of articles from past issues. All the articles are relevant to early horror movies, movie stars and more along the vien of Boris Karloff and Vincent Price. Articles are short, but informative and I found them light and fun to read. There is also a collection of short-short stories that are about monsters and horror. They are all easy reading with a twist at the end. There is also various mixed informantion about the online club and zine and some of the content might not make a lot of sense to those not in the club or not familiar with the fanzine.

Here he offers a dazzingly brilliant interpretation which emphasizes the rich textures of Shostakovich's score. Gergiev offers drama and tension when necessary, but also leads his combined forces in graceful, often lyrical, playing when called for in the score. This is a far more interesting interpretation than an old Decca recording I have of Bernard Haitink conducting; his interpretation seems far more clinical and less intense than Gergiev's. Without a doubt this has to be the most fascinating interpretation of Shostakovich's famous 7th \\"Leningrad\\" symphony I have heard. Audophiles will be pleased with the sound quality, but be prepared to have this CD played at a volume sufficiently low enough to hear the more tranquil passages, but not too loud for the fiery climaxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Paper at a Great Price","review":"I read the other reviews carefully.

I needn't have worried - Kellerman is back with a book that reminds me of the early books in the Peter & Rina Decker series. Kellerman focuses on Cindy Decker, Det. Decker's daughter in this mystery. Like the best of the Rita and Peter Decker books, this one has a love story interwoven with the mystery/police story that deals with cultural differences: Cindy meets and falls in love with an Ethiopian Jew. You don't have to have read any of the other Decker series books to enjoy this one, but if you have you will rejoice that all the familiar elements are here. The central mystery is well-paced and the solution isn't obvious unlike many mystery books. Peter and Rina play a supporting role but Cindy and her new romance are the stars.

The mother was soon discovered, by Cindy talking to a high school class of pregrant girls. Now these girls are street hard, tatooed, young and alot of attitude so how do they notice a girl that may or may not be pregrant that sits on a bench. The whole story just falls into place - too many people that would never talk just seem to want to tell Cindy everything. The sub-plots are as pat in that they provide no challenge.Sorry, to say that I will not backtrack to see why Cindy and her dad are so emotionally distressed nor do I really care what happens in their future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"I really like the Kellermans' books, but this one totally lost me when it compared a character to Kobe Bryant, down to the same first name.It seemed to drag on forever.Not one of her better works, and definately a bad time to use that character.

Cindy Decker is becoming a good cop and her lieutenant father, was integral to the plot. I was troubled by the turn that Cindy's romantic life took. I don't think I was ready for this part of the book. I enjoy mysteries, not social commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multi Story Line","review":"Even though I have read several of Kellermans books I could not finish this one . I made it through chapter 6 and tossed the book .There is just to many useless words to take up space that has nothing to do with current storyline . Like author goes into great detail to tell what a house looks like or what character is wearing , and there is parts in book where police's wife has a friend read some sort of Jewish writting for her and the useless words just go on and on . WORST BOOK WRITTEN BY KELLERMAN TO DATE ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninvolving unfortunately...","review":"I've read many of Faye Kellerman's books and have always enjoyed them but this one was really weak. Cindy Decker is not a particularly interesting character and she certainly wasn't helped by a weak plot. I've never been a fan of multiple storylines and this book is no exception. The secondary story involving Rina's missing grandmother was really much more interesting than the primary story featuring Cindy. I would have loved the entire book to focus on the WW2 murder. Unfortunately there was no resolution whatsoever to this secondary plot and the resolution to the main story was very undramatic and appeared to be almost an afterthought as though the author said, \\"Uh oh, I better tie this up now\\". Since some of my favorite books have been by Faye Kellerman, I will still read her in the future but I certainly wouldn't recommend this one to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faye Kellerman never disappoints.","review":"Everytime a new novel by Faye Kellerman becomes available, I am reading it and anticipating the next one. These books are great reads, and Street Dreams is no exception. I love the intertwining of family issues, detective work, and religious traditions. This latest novel was particularly interesting because it deals with racism from a new point of view. Keep writing, Ms. Kellerman. Your books are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing hodge-podge","review":"I was disappointed. This book reads as if Kellerman was required to include as many controversial subjects as possible. We have an inter-racial relationship with so much sex it would sate a nympho queen; we have Jewish vs Christian issues, we have mentally challenged, Hispanic gangs, blacks, good and bad cops, medically trained immigrants, old people, even remnants from the Holocaust. Give me a break, I was exhausted trying to keep track of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller Alert","review":"I thought that this was an outstanding book that had a lot of important issues come alive. The two issues that come straight to my mind abondend baby and a seierl killer on the loose.Both of these topics are things that happen in every day life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonathan is no doubt the better Kellerman author.","review":"Tried hard to finish this book. No compelling plot, boring dialogue, bogged down with religion, predictable characters and elementary writing style. I have always considered Jonathan the better writer. Have read all of his books with no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Street Dreams","review":"This book was very bad. Nothing like prior books in the series.She needs to stick with Decker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Bad Weather in Los Angeles","review":"A really good story. This one has the oddity of changing narrator from a character to an observer. There is one point that the narrator gets confused, but it is very minimal and the story goes along very well.It is unusual to read about bad weather (rain, mist, cloudy days) in Los Angeles. To those of us from the Midwest, we just do not get the feeling that there is ever bad weather out there.I liked the development of the daughter, Cindy, into a better person. She acquires a boyfriend and truly helps people get their lives together. It is amazing how wonderful these characters are, like in the John Grissom novels, they are above average, even superhuman. This is not bad, just odd and really good stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I find it difficult to believe that readers have given STREET DREAMS four and five stars. So far, I'm on page 311, most of it has been redundant and boring. If Cindy whines and repeats herself much more, I'll have to scream. I usually enjoy Faye Kellerman a lot. This time I'm tempted to simply put the book down for good. Sorry folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically correct drivel","review":"This is one bad book. I read Faye Kellerman years ago, didn't like her, but recently thought I'd try her again. Bad decision. This book is terrible for so many reasons:1. The cardboard characters: The devout and saint-like Rina and Koby (notice that the more devoted to Orthodox Judaism they are, the more saint-like Kellerman draws them); the overly-sweet father who actually calls his cop-daughter princess. The bland and saint-like half-siblings. All very boring, all very predictable.2. The heavy-handed focus on political correctness in long-winded discussions of WWII, race relations, Orthodox Judaism, and Israel. These were pure distraction that only interrupted what could have become a solid, fast-paced mystery.3. The side story about the saint-like Rina's grandmother's murder during WWII. Again, distracting, not interesting, and just plain useless.I won't buy another Faye Kellerman book. Boring! Where are today's editors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Street Dreams","review":"What happened to Faye Kellerman? I have been hooked on her books. This one is clearly not up to par! It's choppy, all over the place, the story line doesn't flow.... Other than the fact that the same characters were used, it almost seems like the book was written by someone else. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Rina and Pete","review":"Sad to say, Faye Kellerman, although ostensibly female, has no knack whatsoever for writing from the perspective of a female character. The one-dimensional quality of Rina (do we know much about her other than her hair is ebony and her eyes are blue?) in previous Decker novels should have warned me, but I laid out the bucks for \\"Street Dreams\\" anyway and had to force myself to finish it. Cindy's every action and scrap of dialogue is patently unbelieveable and forced--she's like Pete Decker in drag without the religious convictions that make him interesting. The boyfriend comes off as some kind of politically correct composite culled from a Frum Harlequin romance. The plot never comes together either, despite a nice twist toward the end. Do yourself a favor if you're in the mood for a mystery starring a woman, read Sara Paretsky or Sue Grafton instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful dont waste your money","review":"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.

Besides explaining things in great detail, the manual also tells you if your problem should be referred to an experienced mechanic, because of its complexity or the need for a special tool only the dealership will have. Most important thing the book taught me: Porsche cars are over-engineered; that is part of the reason why the parts are so expensive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Haynes Craptastic Waste","review":"Compelete strip down, yeah right. This book offers rarely more knowledge than you should already have if you own a 944. Nothing important. Everything you want to do and need specifics on are nicely pointed out as \\"Too difficult for the home mechanic\\". Sounds like Haynes' \\"master\\" mechanics are a bit to busy to make a compelete book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find the factory manual on cdrom instead...","review":"The Haynes manual is the first I bought for my 944, way back in 1986. It brought me no insight as to what makes this vehicle unique, and what special tools would allow me to work on the car myself. After I suffered a timing belt failure (all too common to this series), I discovered that there was not nearly enough information for me to fix this problem myself.I purchased the factory service manual (for $250 at the time) and was able to fix my problems, and to prevent many other problems. There is no substitute for the factory service manual, and it is now generally available on CDrom.If you have a 944 turbo or 944S or 944s2, this book is absolutely worthless to you, as it has no wiring diagrams or real information that is covered in the factory manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Porsche Dealer must have written this book!","review":"I just bought a 1983 944 and I was hoping to get some information on timing belt replacement from this book, but it is way too general.

That goes double if you own a turbo version of the 944, as there is not a single reference, example, or illustration of anyting specific to the turbo (and there are many) that I could find, even though Haynes claims it is covered by this edition.Robert Bentley, please, please, please bless the poor 944 owner with one of your excellent reference works... until that happens, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"better than chilton's but needs more info","review":"general knowledge very good but was weak on fuel system and automatic transmission information. still searching for good manual. let me know if you find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The process descriptions are perfunctory and without insight","review":"I found this book disappointing.

They are just a boon, even if not perfect productions. If it captures the heart and makes you laugh, it has succeeded, in my opinion. Good \\"rags\\" to riches and back story, with lessons learned. Charles Coburn is a treat in one of his fuller roles. The young Rock Hudson and Piper Laurie dancing the Charleston are fun. You'll see the old raccoon coats popular among the college set at that time. And be sure to catch young James Dean at the soda fountain (uncredited). There's something about a house bustling with family activity, where love is, working out their situations of all kinds, that makes a good deposit in the heart.

It's a perfectly enjoyable, jangly, little bauble that fits right in with other wonderful twee Glasgowian bands like Belle & Sebastian and (early) Del Amitri. At times, it can veer toward the precious and prententious, but for the most part it is a sweet pop record.And I really like the singer's voice! Don't listen to that grump up there! It is untrained and far from virtuosic, but it has a dreamy, innocent quality that gently guides you through the songs.I've listened more than a few times, and I have to say that I enjoy this record more than the last few B&S and Arab Strap records. Get it if you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zzz...","review":"They have to be one of the most boring acoustic indie pop bandsi've come across. The only comparisons to belle and sebastian i see are the use of the same instruments and producer. The songs as a whole are monotonous. You can stop a song in the middle and play the next track starting from the middle, and you'd think it's the same song. At least change the melody/arrangement/dynamics of the vocals or sOMeTHIng.

Caunitz shows how government hacks, Mafiosi, reporters, spies and even New York's Catholic Diocese are linked to the cops and each other by a system of favors Malone's manipulation of his superiors and his relentless dedication give this novel the page-turning pull we expect from a good thriller. Its special strength is its carefully exacting depiction of what the working life of a big city police department really is like. With the same bold clarity that served him as a New York City police detective, first-novelist Caunitz delivers a powerful tale of murder and espionage. . . Caunitz expertly depicts the stark reality of the police officer's life and work, and his hard-edged prose drives the story to a stunning conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"One of the classics of Quality Control - the amazing book written for teaching Japanese Quality Circles.

It ignores that whiplash can lead to disc injury in the neck, fibromyalgai, tempormandibular joint dsyfunction, and traumatic brain injury. It is scientifically flawed and fails to consider the science now know. It is written at the behest of the insurance industry so they can refuse to pay or underpay claims. Most people with whiplash do recover within six months or shorter. However the unlucky ones can go on to develop permanent injury like traumatic brain injury, fibromyalgia, or disc injury.

You are paying for a whole lot of material that should have been trimmed off and smoothed down as indicated in the picture. I would like to find the brand that (apparently) has been discontinued.

First, they have a tendency to splinter; and since most dogs tend to swallow faster than they taste, I became quite concerned my dog might sustain internal injury from those shards. Second, the aftermath was a bout of diarrhea. However, my dog has a sensitive gut, so take that for what it is worth. Lastly, and of least concern, is that they stink horribly.

But Atkinson, writing from the perspective of young Ruby Lennox, somehow manages to write about her tragically dysfunctional family with humor and spirit-and the effect is even more heartbreaking than if the tale had been told straight.This is a wonderful book, chock-full of details that add up to create an evocative picture of what it was like for Ruby growing up in York in the 1950s. I am going to order all of the other books Ms. Atkinson has written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching portrayal of a dysfunctional family","review":"I know that some readers found it hard to jump between the different stories - but I loved it and think it was what kept me hooked. I love the theme of intergenerational emotions and events repeating themselves and the possibility of inheriting your destiny from your forebears. Having studied my family tree I often wonder about old ancestors long dead and what their hopes and dreams and loves were.I found the portrayal of George and Bunty's marriage very real and though I finished the book many months ago can recall with clarity Patricia's adolescent angst. It was with real sadness that I read about Ruby's eventual breakdown(?). She seemd to feel so unloved and with a huge lump in my throat, I wished that I could reach into the story and hug her.I also enjoyed the setting of the story in York, which now makes me want to visit it.

I finished it but it was difficult. While the quick wit and vivid images kept me reading, I found that the chapters drug on and on and on. Perhaps Kate Atkinson is making a feeble stab at sick british humor, but really I found it annoying that every chaper and sometimes each sentence was filled with tragedy. The weaving back and forth of generations was very annoyingly difficult to track. I read for pleasure and while I like to escape, I really dislike reading a book that loses me in each and every chaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"first book clasic","review":"This is an amazing first novel. Kate has written some other great book, but this first one is my favorite. She displays a portrait of a family from the view of a little girl and we live life through her eyes. This can be a make or brake in the world of novels and Kate made it. Every loose end is tied up by the finish of the book and there are twists and turns along the way you'll never think of. This little girl deserved my sympathy, and sadly, there are too many little girls living like her right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"This is truly a wonderful book. I loved the dark/dead-pan comedy. It made me laugh, and it made me cry. I was sad when I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far one of the best books I've ever read","review":"I came across this unassuming-looking book while in London. I asked what was good over there and the saleslady put this in my hands. I couldn't put it down. One of the most remarkable things about the story is the cyclical format that takes you back to the past like an undertow, then shoots you back into Ruby's time. However, I did find the \\"lost memory\\" of her lost twin a little new-age hammy. Still, I recommend it every chance I get."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book so warm you might want to wear it....","review":"A scene in the recent movie \\"As Good as it Gets\\" finds an editorial intern asking Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) how it is that he \\"writes women\\" so well. One might ask Mrs. Atkinson how she writes men as well as she does. I was reading this book at our club, when I was chided by a colleague that I was in possession of a \\"chick book\\", inferring that its content might be appropriately read only by other women. While similar perceptions might discourage other (most) men from buying this title, those few who take the time to do so and to read it will discover a marvelous little book. Never have I been so involved in the fictional lives of those of whom I read, so much so that I closed the book wondering if I might find in a Greenlandic telephone book a listing for a Ruby Lennox, such that I might continue my friendship with her for years and years to come. A \\"gem\\" of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing!","review":"I devoured \\"Case Histories\\" and ran out and bought all Atkinson's books. Unfortunately, the two books on Jackson were great but this one is just too confusing. Most of the time I had no idea about whom I was reading. I was over halfway through the book before I began to understand the time shifts. It was just one big mess with a few good laughs. Glad to finish it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed and depressing","review":"I know many people like this book -- I get that, but it fell way short of the mark for me. While Atkinson is never cheery, this was a dismal, unhappy book about dismal unhappy people and I have yet to see the point. Ruby's parents were unsympathetic, her sibs shallow and mean and Ruby herself hard to empathize with. The big secret wasnt so big, (My Pearl? Did she really need to say it over and over so we'd get it??) The back story (when not confusing) was actually more interesting but the flash back to any random year got really old, really fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great family sagas","review":"It helps to make a family tree while reading about the four generations of relatives whose lives impact Ruby's. There are patterns -- wartime affairs, sisters who support and then fail, immigration to escape family -- these patterns leaf and flower on the many branches of Ruby's all-too-human family tree. I couldn't put the book down. (It's a cliche, but it is true.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly comic and tragic","review":"This was a really interesting book, discovered years ago. My only complaint is a problem I commonly find in stories with delightful child narrators...once that child grows up, I am no longer as fond of them. Still, there are some crazy-good bits, and the fact that Ruby Lennox begins narrating from her conception is terribly amusing. A very interestingly told story, dark comedy and tragedy mix well. Ruby is a wonderful narrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"sensitive entertainment","review":"I loved the book. Through easy and sometimes cynical prose you get a sensitivity without the melodrama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curious","review":"Yes, our Book Discussion Group all loved and were amazed by this fascinating and clever novel.However, there was debate about who was the Father of Lil's son, Edmond?\\"For a while Nel feared the baby would be born with thick black hair\\". This would have indicated that Jack was the Father.\\"but it seemed so much worse somehow when he turned out to have golden curls like an angel and eyes the colour of forget-me -nots\\" Did this mean that Albert, Lil's brother was the Father?It was not until near the end that Lil suggested to her granddaughter-in-law that she name the child after Edmond's Father. The Baby was subsequently called Jack.Some of our group are convinced that Jack was Edmond's Father.Others are convinced that Albert was the Father because of Edmond's golden girls, not black hair.We would all be grateful if someone could reply to this query with a definitive answer.Looking forward to some more Kate Atkinson intrigue and literary pleasures"},{"rating":"1","title":"In this book, the plot does NOT exist!","review":"When I read the reviews of this book, I thought, \\"How neat to start a book with the words I EXIST\\". I thought certainly the book would be about the character making the statement. I suppose in a roundabout way, the book may be about Ruby, but mostly I found it a rambling, pointless family history. My own personal journal entries for the past ten years are more interesting.On a positive note, I thought the writers style was kind of neat, and I found the material easy to read, and sometimes humorous. If she had just added some meaning or point to her story, I think I would have loved it. But, as it was, I got to the end and it was so bad, I swear I heard a \\"phhht\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing here?","review":"I bought this book based on the glowing recommendations.

But I'm going on six days with this one, two-thirds of the way through, and have decided to abandon it. The structure is confusing and the characters are mostly unlikeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Family From Hell","review":"Reading this book makes you think, thank goodness I haven't been born into Ruby's family! The story is loaded with energy and imagination: Starting with Ruby's description of her own conception in the early 1950's and ending in the present, with chapter-long footnotes alternating with Ruby's account flashing back to the tragic-comic catastrophes haunting her family since WW1.It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you gape, it NEVER bores you. The characters are so alive (and some of them are truly repugnant!), they threaten to jump out of the pages.You have to read the book quickly or you stand no chance remembering all these brothers, uncles, sister, aunts and where and when and how they died (almost all of them do!)Enjoy and hopefully Human Croquet will be just as good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time plays with the Mind","review":"Enjoy bites of the life of Ruby Lennox and some of her more colourful relatives.Both flippantly realistic and romantically idealised, the various competing agendas of the stories, the telling of the stories, the imaginings of the stories, can seem like a confused tumble of impressions, ideas and certainty (all the more suspect because it seems so certain - and how can Ruby know?)The effect: 1) You can read it and be superficially entertained. 2) You can start to question the reliability of the narrator Ruby (the book I think, is an attempt at self-reflexivity). 3) You can start questioning not only the narrator Ruby, but that of any story told. 4) You can reflect on yourself and the way memory and truth (and untruth) collide, mesh, gel, repel. 5) Also, as an added bonus, it tests what a \\"good\\" reader you are - did you get all the clues, did you see that, Ruby TOLD you, why didn't you get it? Perhaps a comment on reading as a whole?Really a mind bending experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous family history","review":"There's supposed to be a deep-dark secret in Ruby's family, but the fact is that you will become so engrossed in this family, and their ancestors, that when the secret is revealed, it won't matter that much. So, if you believe that the discovery of this \\"secret\\" is the plot of the book, than the book is plotless - but if you believe that this is a historical account of a fictitious (but stunningly detailed) family in York, then it's a marvelous read and one that is hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the fuss????","review":"If you will allow a voice of dissent here, I almost gave up on this book several times but had heard so much about it, I kept plodding, in the hope it would get better. It didn't. It's badly structured, full of grammatical errors, has too many irrelevant characters and a fairly uninteresting plot. It seems that Atkinson had two ideas- a historical novel and a 20th century soap opera, neither of which was worthy of a full novel, so she threw them in together and came up with this. The characters were too thinly drawn for me to care about and the end of the book suddenly introduces new characters and story lines when it should be drawing to a close. A good editor would have helped - a little. If you really want to read a quality Brtish woman writer, try Rose Tremain- or anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloomy","review":"I don't necessarily have an aversion to sad or dark stories but I'm finding I have less and less tolerance for gloomy ones.

The rainbow will not stay up and the slide lost air immediately. The kids did not enjoy it as much as I thought they would. It does hold water even though it constantly leaks air. I can not find a hole to patch, I think it just has weak seams. This might be worth twenty bucks but not the near fifty I paid for it. It does have plugs to make it easier to drain but mine got clogged with grass so I had to dump it anyway. I would not buy this again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I thought it would be a nice change from the hard round kiddie pool but it really isn't. I will keep it until it just absolutely doesn't hold water but then it will end up in the trash. I hate throwing things away but I am afraid this is just not something that can be kept and used again. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"This toy was bought for my son's second birthday party and it was a blast! It is actually ALOT bigger than it looks and a ton of fun! It takes ALOT of balls to fill this little pool/ball pit up... i would say well over 1000 balls!!! It was the best feeling ever to see my son's face when he went outside and saw this ball pit in the yard filled with all the balls!!! He was extremely excited!!My only bad comment on this product is that fact that once its outside... you have to keep it outside because it doesn't fit through any of the doors without having to be deflated and than reflated. Which takes a long time and you will need some sort of air pump for it because blowing it up on your own is just impossible!!However, I just ordered a second ball pit/pool for my son because it got ripped/popped coming into the house :( but now i just know that it needs to be completely deflated before moving it from one place to another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ton of Fun for Toddlers","review":"My 2 year old daughter LOVES this pool. The size is great for the price. Her favorite part was the rainbow sprinkler. Well that and the slide. She will go down that over and over again.

Fun all day! My daughterand her friends had blast . I wish. They can. Make only one. Inflation. Hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pool!","review":"This is a great pool! It has so many activites, my two-year-old would play in it for hours all by herself, and really had a great time when a couple of friends joined her. They loved climbing from the shallow end to the deep end, going down the slide and tossing the balls around. The rainbow always leaned one way or another, which is annoying, and the slide did not line up quite right with the deeper end. But that didn't slow the kids down one bit. It is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, good for the price, great for the little ones","review":"We purchased this pool for my son's 2nd birthday party. It was easy to set up (we used an electric air pump for the majority of it). I wish we could of gotten the rainbow to stand up more, it kept flopping over no matter how much or where we put additional air. That was really the only downside to the pool. My son loved the balls and being able to roll them into the water. The slide is perfect for the little ones (a little short for bigger kids). It was nice to put the littlest ones in one section of the pool while the bigger kids splashed in the other section. The durability of the pool was good. We'll see how many more uses we get out of it. Draining it was okay - fairly quick. I would recommend this pool to someone with small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confirmed: NO drain PLUG!!!","review":"I purchased this product for my daughters 2nd birthday. She LOVED it once it was up. The problem was taking it down/emptying it. There is no drain plug. The other review that stated it had 2 holes is referring to the air holes. Unless you wish to deflate and inflate each time its not worth your time. A pool cover will only delay the inevitable and increase chances of bacteria with the sitting water. I'm returning it and going with the intex pool that is shaped like a star and has an inflatable bottom with a drain plug. Doesn't look as toddler/kid appealing but kids just like pools. So I hope it will work. Returning this pool has also been a hassle....Don't do it. I think your little one will be just as happy in a more practical pool...and you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pool That Can Entertain In Any Temperature","review":"This pool is great for the 6 and under crowd. For the price, you get a swimming pool with a sprinkler, ring toss, slide, ball toss/ramp and the option of using it indoors during cold weather. Just fill with play balls instead of water and don't use the sprinkler in the winter. The option of 2 pools with different depths is nice. I've bought alot of kiddie pools and this is the ONE that has held my kids attention the longest and they have yet to drag out abunch of other toys to play with while swimming. Be sure to put unattached toys somewhere safe during high winds. Lots of possibilities, no batteries and will wear your little one out with out leaving home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remove the slide -- mold alert!","review":"The slide is attached to the pool on the bottom left and bottom right side. There is a space under the slide where water can sit and get trapped. Ours became moldy. I ended up cutting the slide off the bottom of the pool (this does not affect the actual pool wall itself). This solved the mold issue AND created much more space in the shallow pool. When there is no slide, you can easily fit 6-8 toddlers in this pool. Ours lasted all summer. It kicked the bucket in late August when we had a bad storm. But it did very well the rest of the season! I plan on buying another this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"came damaged!","review":"was so excited to receive this product knowing its the best deal!so had it blown up but lots of parts has holes.the main part to be blown up,air cant stay.air comes out after an hour or two from blowing air."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun but damaged","review":"fun toy but it arrived damaged--luckily the part we couldn't inflate wasn't crucial, but it's annoying--no time to replace it because our grandchildren were already here when we opened the box and inflated the pool. the part with a hole was superfluous, so definitely not worth the trouble of shipping it back. our grandson greatly enjoyed the shower and the slide."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 happy little girls","review":"This item is used as our summer backyard playpen.

We just fill it up and the kiddos jump in! The ONLY caveat is that the rainbow arch doesn't really add anything to it and it doesn't stay up as well as the other parts...

When we tried to inflate the pool this year one of the valves seemed to be warped in a way that prevented the cap from keeping the air from leaking out. When I called the Intex company to see if there was a possible fix for it I was quickly told that \\"we don't warranty any of our products\\"...In my opinion this pool is a little pricey for something that needs to be considered entirely disposable.

Echo went in the same pop direction with excellent results as well. I love Comsat Angels in all their periods. Whatever they did, they did very well and with heart. There are a few songs that don't go over so well, sure, that happens to nearly everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a size bigger!!","review":"Returning these shoes was heartbreaking but, there was no way around it.

OK for bleeding but no good if you want to completely change the fluid out like I wanted to.Only plus I can think of is the different sized rubber attachments for bleed nipples.

I've read HUNDREDS of children's books and I am just puzzeled as to how an editor can let this lady get away with this lifeless and choppy writing chapter after chapter.I haven't read any of the newer volumes of Judy Moody, but I truly hope they are written with some style and a more developed character than the first volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This book is okay, it has a terrible plot though.

The fine folks at iRiver have informed me that since I don't have my original receipt (it was a gift) and any valid proof of purchase they couldn't help me even though it was still under warranty. To add insult to injury, when I complained they were not standing behind their product, they informed me that they would stand behind their product and service the product past the warranty date \\"IF\\" I had proof of purchase. They claimed legal compliance prevents them from helping me. It's amazing they can bend the warranty rule but not the proof of purchase rule. My proof is I have the player in the original packaging.

It seems to be much more rugged than most players I've seen. However, it is a bit bulky and the built-in clip is awkward to use. The packaging is good for wearing it on your arm or belt, but I just carry it in my pocket. If you plan to wear it around your neck, consider the weight - it is heavier than some other products. Overall, I am pleased with the ease of use and the sound quality. It does the job for me, and the color display looks really cool. I agree that the color of the product is different than what I expected, but I wouldn't call it pink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I returned this product after a week - it was difficult to manage, the screen way too small to read (and I have 20/10 vision!) and just a very disappointing product overall.

The product I ordered was for my wife because of it's friendly usage and also because it used one AA battery for long playing time.

I suggest this particular mp3 in your stock not be sold until it is adequately repaired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good not Great","review":"Good not Great.Product works just fine and dandy.Packaging was less than professional, and the battery was taken out/missing.

Overall, I would recommend this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge.","review":"The product information lists the measurements for this unit, but if you are like me measurements probably don't help you much. This MP3 player is huge. One reviewer wrote that it would easily fit in his hand or pocket, well so would my cell phone and guess what they are practically the same size. Compared to some of the Sony and Samsung units this thing is a Cadillac.The sound quality is very good, but not better than my wife's Samsung, which she can easily clip to her shirt or put in her pocket.

Memory is not expandable, but that is fine for general use. The most annoying feature though is that the last 1 to 2 seconds of each mp3 file is cut off. While listening to music, you hardly notice this, but with audio books (my main reason for purchase) it is horrible. Every 5 minutes or so you miss 3 or 4 words. So if you are listening to books, you would be better off spending your money on a player that plays the entire mp3 file.Also, while it plays back the files inside of folders in alphabetical order, it does NOT play back the folders themselves in alphabetical order. So for audio books this can be a nightmare. For example, if you labeled your folders \\"Disk 01\\", \\"Disk 02\\", etc. it will instead play them back in the order the folders were created on the mp3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"My fault . . . they were too small","review":"I'm not saying these aren't good, they are! I needed tags for jewelry pieces, and for that purpose . . . not so much. First of all, they're very tiny. That's fine if you want tiny, I didn't mind that. However, the string is very, very thin . . so when I tried tying them on my jewelry pieces, they all got tangled together, and were hard to get off the jewelry pieces themselves. One woman wanted to wear her necklace, so when we went to cut off the tag, I couldn't do it. She almost didn't buy it!! So, just be sure the size, etc. is what you want. My fault . . .

I was wrong in fact.The book seems to \\"beat around the bush\\", offering facts obout what people THINK heaven is or should be.A few chapters in the book merely consist of bible verses that contain the word \\"Heaven\\"Having read the book from cover to cover I believe it is a complete waste of time. The author, Harvey Minkoff, should have offered a little more than a few known facts.Most, if not all the questions stated in the book are not even answered, but in fact left to the readers interpretation.

The setting has an ordinary contemporary girl-next-door heroine put into a topsy turvy situation. The handsome hero is a sci-fic fantasy man, who controls fire and has babies. The turn about with a submissive man trained to serve women and bear their children makes for a change of pace from the usual romance. He's also in danger and in need of rescuing by the heroine. The plot is action filled, the romance is light hearted and the sex is heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a new book","review":"I have read this book before.

The spiciness is about right right for me, but no one else in my house can handle these.While they can not be directly microwaved, these are easy enough to prepare by following the directions. All you have to do is pull the cover halfway up, open and add the contents of the flavor packet, add hot water, and let it sit for three minutes.My only concern about these is that the nutritional information lists the serving size is listed as 1/2 the bowl (didn't notice that before we ordered them), which means you have to double the values if you eat the whole thing. A whole bowl then contains 380 Calories, 50 Carbs (too much for me), and 78% of your total daily recommended Sodium. I get around this by braking and removing half of the dry noodle bunch before adding the hot water.Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"this is the best product!

This was my second Sony VCR. I love Sony brand, so when the first VCR started chewing my tapes, I bought another Sony. This one doesn't chew the tapes, but its rewind is the slowest. It takes about 30 seconds to start rewinding. Ironically, fast rewind was an advertised feature. No more Sony VCRs for me.To be fair, I must say that I am not going to buy any more Sony TVs either. But the reason for that is different. The reason is that the TV that I have (Trinitron), just doesn't break down. It has been over 10 years, but it keeps going as new.

The best part...you don't have to feed it, keep a litter box clean, or worry about it when you go on vacation! Two thumbs up with this kitty! (Get them now while you can, though, as they are IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN THE STORES!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Realistic","review":"I bought the 3 different colors for my grandkids. This white one has one downfall. When it is loved by a youngster, it becomes very dirty. So, for practical purposes, I would purchase the gray color instead.This cat purrs and meows when given attention. It you pull its tail, it hisses at you. The eyes are gorgeous, and almost hypnotic. This is probably a good way to see if your kids are ready for the \\"real thing\\" without harming a cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"both kids like it","review":"My daughter got this for her 7th birthday, but my son who is 5 also loves it. He calls it his cat, since our real cat is hers. It is a great toy, and I often do double-takes because I think it is real!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the hype","review":"I do not understand at all why this toy was the craze this Christmas. For one thing it is WAY overpriced (and we got it before the price went skyhigh). It really did not live up to expectations at all. My kids did not even play with it for an hour, I do not even know where the thing is right now. The really annoying thing was it does not have a 'sleep' mode. The toy purrs constantly. At least most interactive toys do cut off after a few minutes of no use, but not this toy. You'd have to mess with cutting it off each time. If you ask me the Fur Real Kitten is much cuter, at least that one moves its paws. I would say if it were priced at around $10-$15 it might be worth buying, but not at current prices. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 7 year old loves it!","review":"Santa brought this for my 7 year old daughter and it is her favorite present. The cat comes in a case that when opened carefully can be reused as the \\"cat carrier\\". The box will not last a long time though, as the the tabs are made of bendable cardboard. The cat is adorable to look at, moves it's head and tail and meows and purrs. If you lift it by it's tail it hisses and growls. Be aware - it also sheds its white fur. It is not a snuggly cat, the fur is soft, but the insides are mechanical and therefore, hard. It has an on/off button, but it does not turn off automatically as many children's toys do. I am glad that Santa brought this cat - the smiles and giggles are well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother of two year old","review":"THIS TOY DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY!! Sometimes it will not work at all or it does not do what it is supposed to. Maybe my dauthers is defective but read several other reviews with the same complaint!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The only thing positive I can say about the FurReal cat is that it's pretty. Other than that, it's worthless. The electronics don't work properly if they bother to work at all. It's not \\"huggable\\" because it's as hard as a rock. It has been sitting on my 6-year-old daughters shelf collecting dust since Christmas and will end up in a summer yard sale. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"FurReal Friends: White","review":"I'm twelve years old, and I have been begging for a white FurReal Friends cat since November. I talked to my grandma on the phone, who by the way lives about four hours from where I live, and she said she would send me one for Christmas if I was good. My best friend, Kendra, who gets anything she wants, told her parents she wanted one.. and the next week, she got an orange and white one! I came over to play with it, to see if it was worth my grandma buying one and shipping it over, and it wasn't! I hated the mechanical movements it's head made when it turned around, and it made this annoying hissing sound, even if we didn't pull it's tail! I told my grandma, Don't waste fifty bucks buying one and sending it across mail. She said she's coming over for Christmas.. with a real kitten! A grey striped one she named Lionel. Much better than this fake one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, not cuddly, not a thrill","review":"I just knew my 2 year old would go nuts over this cat like she did over Furby...especially since she likes cats so much. My husband is allergic, so this was a great option for us. The #1 FRF I bought, didn't function, his head clicked a lot. Luckily, I bought 3 backups because I had read about them on these reviews. Seems the quality is pretty low. My little girl came down the steps on Christmas day, said \\"Kitty! Kitty!\\" and I showed her how to rub it and brush it. She liked him for about 2 minutes and went off to her old toys. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of supply","review":"why can't we find this item. our child was so excited when the commercial came on she would like to have this for Christmas but you created a great product and a great ad but you didn't forsee the supply in demand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"First of all my daughter wanted this cat real bad for her birthday. Called and traveled into alot of stores trying to find it but couldnt find it So I went ... and paid more than I should have and I am very dissapointed. Very hard body, ears, tail. Works so so but the hair that comes out of it, it sheds worse than a real cat. Just hold it against you and you have hair all over you. Its cute but not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Cute!","review":"These are as cute as can be. I got it for my Sister so she could give it to her Granddaughter. She could not find one. I got on Amazon.com and got one right away. Had it in 3 days. Good Luck everyone. I hope all kids get one that want one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I bought this for my daughters birthday. My cat does have pretty good head turns, but it hisses all the time!! Even when no one is touching it. My daughter got tired of it hissing when she was petting it so she decided she wants to take it back and get something else. Pretty loud motor. I definately would recommend no one waste their money on this product!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"I've tried a few times but I just can't make it thru this CD. While I'm listening to it I find myself saying out loud \\"This is BORING\\". The story is dull, the music is dull. I got really tired of hearing \\"where is the love to shelter me?\\" The drummer sounds like he's beating on garbage cans half the time. I didn't care for his singing either, it was too whiny. I didn't think there was even 1 song I'd ever care to hear again. I can't see me ever putting this CD on again. However, a couple of other people really liked it as you can see from their reviews. I think the only people this might appeal to are really young people who haven't experienced much and think this junk is meaningful. There are HUNDREDS of MUCH better CDs than this dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOWNWARD SPIRAL FOR WASP - i.e. not a good album!","review":"yeah well its too bad that Blackie Lawless had to go through alot of mental anguish making this album and wether its about his life or not does not mean that we (the fans) have to buy or accept any old album. The songs are lousy with little to no rythm or feel. the lyrics are a little to deep...just not wasp lyrics. The album sounds more like a heavy metal band trying to do a cover of Pink Floyds the wall. Dont buy it if you into WASP that put out Circus and last command."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great stuff","review":"W.A.S.P has done some great music but this is by far and away their best stuff to date.

Am very happy with it as it works very well. However initial setup was quite difficult - it appears to me that although the product is labelled G102, the utilities and driver supplied on CD do not work with it. I downloaded and installed the G120 (G one hundred and twenty) software from Zyxel's international site and with this it works perfectly.Overall I am happy with product, but is a hassle to setup. Think twice if you are not too technically inclined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death to This Movie","review":"I decided, even after reading many of the negative reviews, to give this movie a chance. I thought that with Jaime Pressly in it, it couldn't be too bad? Man, I was wrong. The movie was just dumb. I actually prefer the off the wall type comedies, that most reviewers don't like. But this was just out there. I never really laughed, except at myself for actually spending $5 to buy the movie. It was a horrible movie, with an even worse ending. I wouldn't even spend the money to rent this crapfest.

This movie is not deserving of any further comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Is \\"The Soap\\" - Pure, Plain and Always Affordable","review":"As far as I know, this is as close to a plain unadulterated soap. I don't like artificial fragrances and harsh chemicals. Most soaps are expensive due to heavy marketing and ads, but they come and go. Ivory has been around since I was a little kid and still the same soap as I know. Very gentle to your skin, great for the kids too. Always very affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh...alright","review":"it's good for what it is, though the author writes it as a term paper for college \\"This is what the chapter is about...\\" exactly like that. Lots of dryness there, lots of facts. It's also mostly focused on the Economy of and existing in MMO, not so much the culture people are thinking of (dating, avatars selection, gender bending, etc.) or how MMO's are ran as a buisness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps Worth a Read, but Out of Touch and Out of Date","review":"The author offers some interesting perspective, but only if you are unfamiliar with online gaming and social media. This book is very out of date now (published in 2004). 6 years isn't usually too terrible for a book, but when the entire foundation of the book is based around technology, especially social media and gaming, this book lost its relevance quickly.It certainly did not help that I did not choose to read this, but rather read it to fulfill a class requirement. However, being an avid user of social media for both business and personal use and a player of online games I felt this book was terribly dated and would have only been useful to people who knew very little about the book's topic in 2004. Today this book would not educate anyone very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a revelation","review":"I read this book, not having much experience in virtual gaming, and found this book to be quie a revelation. There's so much going on in this world behind the scenes that it's scary and fascinating at the same time. I recommend this book for anyone who is already into this sort of thing, as well as for those who are curious about what computer technology is doing to change the way we live."},{"rating":"1","title":"I COULDN'T FINISH IT!!!","review":"I came to the local library for a good read and found \\"The Pieces From Berlin\\". It looked and sounded interesting, the WWII setting sounded gripping, and the plot even more so. But the book moved so slow that by the time I got half way through I was bored to tears that I could hardly keep my eyes open reading it and I decided to put the book down and find something else. A beautiful and moving story set in WWII to the present about friends and family searching for answers to their unanswered time-old questions was completely drained by Michael Pye's long, redundant, almost unecassary text. A good idea gone wrong, by the time you're ready to finish you're not even close to done. But if you're a patient, fast, thoughtful reader, then this would be a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby a pretty good waste of money . . .","review":"Sound quality is so poor that one has to be almost on top of the TV to hear it & to flip through the channels, you must go one at a time.

At 24 inches, this would have been the pooh bear of my five-year-old's dreams. But thanks to truly shoddy manufacturing, our Pooh came with his back seam completely unsewn. Not loose or unraveled, mind you, this poor doll's back was never touched by a needle and thread. So what promised to be a great Christmas gift turned out to be a bust. I can't complain about the price, but the construction was just terrible.

I use to read it everyday for my daily laugh. I got one of the first copies when I found out it was available. These were the strips from the first year that I missed. Although I liked the funny single strips, I really liked the Televised Public Execution story with it's twisted ending. I recommend this book of comic strips and I don't even like comic strips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Are the Subtitles?","review":"The lack of English subtitles in the Mya/Ryko release of this major 1953 Italian film is shameful -- especially at a list price of $24.95. Mya is an Italian-based company producing DVDs of European films -- mostly but not entirely horror/action/sexploitation films -- for the US market. If they think American viewers are content to put up with cheesy dubbing by nonactors who sound nothing like the original performers, they are sadly mistaken, and deserve to be boycotted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just want Dreamin'? Look elsewhere","review":"I bought the MP3 version of the song Dreamin' from this digital album, seeing the note about outtakes but figuring it might just include an Oops or something. However, the first 35 seconds of this 2:57 version are taken up with two false starts. Then they call Take 7 and the full song finally begins. If you're trying to put together a nice mix \\"tape\\", this version of the song would be a distraction and ruin the flow of music. It's a great song, and the sound quality is good, but I have to take off a star for my having to repurchase a better version of the song from another collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good and works well","review":"This looks real good on the boat and it works very well. I think it is definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love the British Invasion, buy this DVD!","review":"This historical snapshot of a very significant time in rock/pop music is a must for British Invasion fans or simply Beatles fans. It is extremely well-done and entertaining. I have always been a fan of Gerry and the Pacemakers and am even more so now. What they did in the time frame in which they did it is extraordinary. Not interested in developing away from what they started with, they remained true to themselves to the end. Gerry Marsden was a unique vocalist, a fantastic songwriter (\\"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying\\", \\"Ferry Cross the Mersey\\", etc.)and really accomplished guitarist. The group's skills honed in Hamburg, Germany along with the Beatles resulted in a true supergroup whose statistics in the British pop charts have never been exceeded. I strongly recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"G&P have officially been released on DVD! Great footage!

Claire soon discovers dating is harder than it seems.I have to be honest when I say that I really wanted to like \\"How Will I Know\\" by Sheila O'Flanagan, but I really didn't.

It took 4 years for the previous ones to wear out. These ones didn't make it one session! The web site claims 1000 lbs EACH but I lifted less than 500 lbs and the hooks ripped from the wrist part.The company was quick at communicating with us, fortunately. We were told it was a manufacturing error and that the next ones would be stronger. Well, they came a few weeks later, and they were a little bit better.But they still ripped. And nowhere near 1000 lbs (or for two hooks, that *should* be 2000 lbs total).After almost 2 months of not being able to work out at our max, my friend and I had enough. I will say that the company was very good at customer service, but this product just isn't ready for prime time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unbelievable album that has slipped through the cracks....","review":"I discovered SS at Milwaukee's Summerfest in 2005. Just walking by, they have a distinctive jam band type sound that grabbed my attention (and many others). As I walked into the venue and listened, I discovered they are truly an impressive act with a lot of excellent original material. The crowd was having a great time, and I ended up getting No Worries after the concert.No Worries is great throughout, without a bad song in the bunch. Several of the songs you'll find humming to yourself later. I'm suprised that a couple of these tunes didn't find their way into the mainstream...either college or (gasp) mainstream radio.This album is highly recommended, and is on my list of classic albums in which every song adds value to the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this poorly designed contour gage.","review":"I took a chance on this contour gauge because my old one with the wire fingers rusted and fingers fell out. This gage has fingers that won't rust and won't fall out.

Highly recommended!","review":"For starters, Bob Hoban is a jovial guy with awesome chops, so this DVD is a pleasure to watch. It is packed with information and know-how, history of rock, suggestions for playing with a band, and recommended recordings for further study. He shows you each lick played at full speed and then plays it very slowly so you can clearly see what he is doing, and he even names the notes he is playing to make sure you get it. A booklet is included with some examples written out in notation (but many more are not notated, which you could do for yourself). This is one DVD I will be using a lot, and when I saw that Bob Hoban also has done a Country Piano DVD for Homespun Tapes, I had to get that one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can work with Linux","review":"I've been able to run the MTP-US version without WinXP using Linux (Fedora Core 4).

I wanted an mp3 player so as to get rid of those clunky portable cd players and I am very glad I did however, even though I am pleased with the overall performance of the iriver t10 it does not have enough space.

Initial quality was fine until thewarranty expired. Both units started failing. Units would boot up and play a song or two then make a static sound and reboot itself. iRiver support was non-exitant because the units were no longer under warranty. They would not offer any help except a reference to an expensive 3rd party repair service. Firmware reloads and formats using the iRiver firmware code did not fix the problems. Battery case cover is fragile. You'll end up needing to tape it closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good product","review":"My only issue with the device are the controls. Could be a little more user friendly. Other than that, it plays great, the sound is perfect and it is extremely durable. Dropped the device, while music was playing, from a distance of about 5 feet straight to the concrete. Picked it up, put the ear buds back in my ears and it hadn't even missed a beat.

Man, I wish I had found them sooner! They are sooooo much easier to use than the cheapie, non-compound ones I got at Lowes. These didn't hurt my hands and no blisters.I have a wet saw, too, which I use for all the big, straight cuts. But for curved cuts or for cutting small tiles, a tile nipper is essential. There is a learning curve, and I suggest you purchase a couple of extra tiles to practice on if you haven't used nippers before. I have also found that scoring the tile where you want the cut first (with a scoring tool) gives me almost perfect results! As another reviewer mentioned, take small \\"nibbles\\" rather than trying to nip off a big chunk. Once you get the hang of it, these nippers let you work quickly and accurately without the hand fatigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Nice look and feel to this tool.

I didn't have huge expectations for the V4523S, since VCRs in general seem to be on the way out, replaced by DVD recorders and TiVO. However even with lowered expectations I found the V4523S to be very disappointing. Recording at the LP and SLP modes produced wobbly, grainy pictures with distorted sound.

NEVER AGAIN!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic PV-V4523S Review","review":"The Panasonic PV-V4523S is a good VCR. It's one of the last to record in LP mode. The following models only record in SP/EP. The shortcomings are the silver finish and the tape advance. The silver finish wears off quickly in the high use areas, especially on the remote. The tape counter is awkward. It only shows on the TV screen and not on the LCD panel on the front of the VCR. The screen only shows Play and Rec on the LCD panel while in use w/o showing the tape counter. In REW and FF the screen only shows those terms briefly while the tape starts moving, making a precise rewind or fast forward imprecise. After one year of heavy use it has held up well. I bought two more to have one that will record in LP for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reviewers are right...","review":"I bought this based on my last Panasonic VCR and ignored the negative reviews.

Its a shame, because the unit's record and playback quality was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much more vocal-based album","review":"I enjoy this album, just like any music by The Living End, but I noticed there is much more emphasis on the vocals and melody than before. There seems to be a lot less lead guitar than they're oldest music, and it seems like basslines are used a lot less than before. In the past, it was obvious by the technique that they were using a standup bass, but now, it is not quite so apparent. Over all this was a very enjoyable album, and I really can't complain much. I'm sure I will be listening to this album for quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Disc","review":"This CD is really spectacular.

This album is incredibly dense and sophisticated.Perhaps the most amazing thing about this album is that it actually works more strongly as a collective 10 songs (unless you're lucky enough to find an 11 track bootleg including left handshake (a stunning track omitted for copywrite reasons), than as seperate songs.Mirrorsaw and inquistion stand out (although the single version of inquisition is slightly catchier). Inquistion is amoungst the bands popiest songs. despite the washes of noise, people who can't stand this band have actually really been impressed by the song. Mirrorsaw is as beautiful as a wall of noise could ever be. One of Skinny Puppy's all time best tracks.the only complaint is that this album is nightmarishly dark and challenging. It is in no way a casual listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Rad","review":"This is, hands down, one of the greatest pinacles of pop music achievements. The sounds you will find here is very organic, human and ugly created by seemlessly layering real instruments with synthetic sounds and voice samples.

He was 6 when the war ended and cannot possibly speak of his personal experience. Reflecting the propagandist views of postwar \\"historians,\\" he swallowed it all, perhaps to further his journalistic career while pleasing all enemies of the Reich. I find his interpretations of his father's diary entries typical of what twisting is done to form \\"popular opinion.\\" I suspect that an adult N.F. would have made a fervent supporter of the Nuremberg Laws himself.In case you make my comments available to the author, please inform him that I was 14 at the end of the war and my father perished at Auschwitz in 1942.

Victoria London weaves a tale about an ordinary girl who becomes extraordinary because of circumstances and who she is. Lots of positive themes for girls growing up today. I also thought Ms. London handled the backdrop of the September 11 tragedy with grace and sensitivity. This book is sure to be a classic - if not for the introduction of the wonderful characters in the Lucy Series for the Gifted Girls, but for it's timeliness and handling of the September 11 tragedy for girls and their parents. Highly recommend this book and the series.

From her experience going back into America's early days, Lucy learns what she must do when the September 11th tragedy in America happens.

I want to find out what happens to Lucy when she goes looking for Cleopatra in the next book, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad writing","review":"Was this book self-published? There must not have been an editor. There were several spelling errors and misused words. However, the worst part was the generally poor writing. A good editor might have saved this writer from writing about a little boy's blue plaid shirt while at the same time having him cry over the falling of the Twin Towers in New York. \\"He was wearing a blue plaid shirt.\\" There are lots of short, choppy sentences and no realistic connection from one idea to the next. There are way too many examples like this.To top it all off, the Amazon description never mentions that there is a heavy religious element here. Lots of praying to God to solve it all. Perhaps a prayer for a good writing course would be more successful than this book.The upper grade teachers at my school will be using this book as an example of bad writing so that our students won't grow up to write this poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yasmien's the best!","review":"I love the song \\"In The Name of Love\\" and \\"Enjoy and Ride\\".

There is no grate or ball to break up the powder. I heard it was small but I didn't think that was to much of a problem. It really is far to small. If you shotgun your supplements alltogether in a gritty barely wet mixture of water and powder then this may be for you. I want enough milk to go with my protein shake to actually make a protein shake. That is not that big. Standard size is way enough. This however is so small its a wonder you can get a scoop of powder in there with the water. And once its in there? Nothing works to break it up, so using milk is much more difficult.

You'll suck but people will cheer anyway because the songs themselves are so damn great.And even if for some sick reason you don't care for this style, it's worth buying just for the classic cover picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrecognised beauty","review":"Blur's debut album Leisure is never acknowledged by the press or the band itself but it does include some real gems.There are two major styles of song running through the album, the first of which is simple post-punk/grunge music (fool, come together) that shows Damon Albarn's more naive attempts at writing.The second style however shows elements of Blur at their best with beautiful Beatlesque harmonies, (Sing, Bang, She's So High),outstanding backward guitar played by the underrated guitarist Graham Coxon (There's No Other Way, She's So High) and hammond organ (There's No Other Way,) giving it a mid-60's Revolver feel with a fresh 90's twist.Though perhaps not as consistent as its follow up albums, Leisure contains some of the most intriguing songs Blur have released. With songs such as Bad Day, Birthday not even making it as singles, it is easy to see why Blur soon established themselves as guiding lights of the British music scene in the 1990's. Well worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Songs","review":"Although not bad for a debut, \\"Leisure\\" isn\`t quite a keeper either, even if has some quality moments to offer. Here, Blur still had a naive, unpersonal an not very focused sound, falling into the (mildly generic) shoegazer movement bandwagon. Many songs sound the same and the lyrics are the typical \\"boy-meets-girl\\", which can be cute and appealing but not particularly exciting or engaging. Some moments already show promise, though, like the dynamic and danceable \\"There\`s No Other Way\\" or the excellent and subtle \\"Sing\\". However, for the most part, \\"Leisure\\" consists of dated britpop songs, listenable and entertaining enough yet equally vapid and ummemmorable.Recommended to die-hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"For all the huge Blur fans, like myself, this cd has to be the worst out of them all.

You can still tell that they want to experiment and expand their sound, but it is still limited to that shoegazing style. Wanting to know which one to get, US or UK version, I was able to hear both \\"I Know\\" and \\"Sing\\" from start to finish, and I like \\"Sing\\" a lot better. For one, \\"I Know\\" just fits in too perfectly with this album, that I wanted to have \\"Sing\\" to add some diversity. Not to say \\"I Know\\" is a bad song, I just like the other one better. So I got the UK version for \\"Sing.\\" Now on the album as a whole, it's a good effort, but the music starts to sound the same. The musicians are good with the instruments they are playing, but the music sounds a bit tiresome after a few songs. Not to mention that Albarn sings like he's bored most of the time. Get this album if you must, but I enjoy their later albums for their diversity and bizarre music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure blur","review":"No other band, apart from R.E.M. has put out such a solid debut as blur's \\"leisure\\". a solid album, but still nowhere near the genius of \\"modern life\\" or \\"blur\\". the best tracks are easily \\"fool\\", \\"come together\\", and \\"bad day\\". \\"birthday\\" is just one of those songs, along with \\"repetition\\" that can make you feel that when you are depressed, people are out there being depressed with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A phenomenal book","review":"I'm so glad I bought this.

It provides a lot of information about the Amazon basin wildlife and though I have seen it many times I still enjoy watching it. It contains information on a wide assortment of creatures as well as the continuous cycle of flooding and draining the Amazon forest goes through. It talks about all sorts of strange creatures that are very exotic and beautiful. I like the way the information is presented as well as the fact that it is very scientifically accurate (I am a scientist). I also like the fact that it closes by talking about how the forest is being changed through cutting the trees and building dams on the river. It provides lots of information in a short period of time and gives a good rounded view at a land that is strange and different."},{"rating":"2","title":"flooded forest","review":"As a teacher,I have been sharing this story with my fifth and sixth graders for years.

I'm glad I didn't waste my money. It's very poorly written, with choppy character and plot development.

I got halfway through and decided I couldn't take anymore; I flipped to end...unsurprisingly, she found Jesus.If you have any sort of literary or intellectual standards, then this is not the book for you.

Don't get me wrong, I likes me some drama but I just couldn't get deep into it. The author did a good job at building up the drama only to leave you hanging and disappointed.

However, after reading the first few chapters i realized i was set up for a disappointment.. The book spends the first like 150 pages just on background. By the end of the book i knew not only chris and gail's life story by their mother's, father's, cousin's and the rest of the family background too.. There simply was not enough story line on what the story was supposedly about. I couldnt figure out what i was just reading all the drama that went on with the main characters at the end with Chris talking to a shrink.. Everything she told the shrink should have been more apart of the actual book.. I was just bored to peices and really still looking for the plot by the end of this book. However, allthough this review is not about part II which is \\"Undercover\\", i must say that book was soo much better. A much needed relief after dragging myself through Fire and Brimstone.."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND","review":"MY DAUGHTER WANTED TO LEARN ABOUT GREEK MYTHS SO I BOUGHT HER THIS BOOK, THIS IS NOT A PRE-TEEN BOOK.

I bought a 3rd edition from 1983 and despite its NEW condition got none of the pages of color photos that others rave about. The 3rd edition is on low quality paper, with only B&W photos, many of which are too dark to be of use. Additionally, because this book (regardless of edition) is in fact a reprint of the original published in 1955, it does contain lots of dated information regarding equipment and various aquarium set-up and maintenance practices.In my humble opinion....save your money despite the low prices for this huge book in good used condition and buy a more up to date book with full color illustrations and less \\"intellectual\\" language."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Swimmy helps his friends.","review":"A children's book about a small fish who is different than the other fish in its \\"school\\" and who teaches other small fish how to survive by \\"camouflage.\\" Little children really enjoy watching Swimmy in the illustrations.

Our daughter,Kathryn, now 24, graduated from the University of Chicago with her Masters in Social work, emphasizing in Community Organization. I wanted the young kids coming to her graduation party to have an idea about what Kathryn had studied, and Swimmy offered a perfect example of a group of individuals working together to change their outcome for the better. Leo Lionni's story discusses community relationships,the process of overcoming tragedy, resilience, and the ability of the individual to make a positive impact on society. What a great message for kids to hear. Thank you Leo Lionni, this story never grows old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read.","review":"A little sad to begin with since his entire family gets gobbled up, but an enjoyable read none-the-less. A little fish who looks different from everyone else uses his differences to help himself and his new friends. I probably like this book better than my son does. And perhaps it's controversial for me to say this, but my son enjoys Rainbow Fish more. I like both books equally, but Rainbow Fish does have nicer illustrations, and I think the \\"lesson\\" in Rainbow Fish is easier for him to grasp. But, you really can't compare the two beyond the illustrations b/c the lesson in Rainbow Fish and Swimmy are really different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy w/ the message","review":"First off, let me stress that I'm not saying that Lionni intended this. But the plot has a vaguely fascist feel that I find disturbing.Swimmy is a different colored and physically superior fish in a school of otherwise identical red fish. Swimmy is the only individual presented in the book. The other fish are an anonymous collective; they even speak as a group. The first group is massacred in the first few pages. Swimmy encounters the second group, fearful and disorganized, and takes command. They all learn to swim in regimented formation, with him as the commander, so they can scare all the big fish.The artistry is good and this is certainly a child's classic. Parents need to read this one carefully before buying it to make sure they're not accidentally sending the wrong message."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the little fish get eaten in the first few pages","review":"Is it just me or doesn't it disturb people that all the little fish except cute little swimmy get eaten in the first few pages of the book? This book was read to my 4 year old at preschool and he had nightmares and did nothing but talk about little fish getting eaten for days. I can't even say that eating all the fish really added anything to the story. Perhaps with an older child, you can discuss the benefits of working with others to help fight off oppression, but at 4 it just seems to be a careless handling of the concept of death.

I don't like it at all, however, because at the beginning of the book all the little fish (except Swimmy) are eaten by a big fish. Basically they are all killed, which I thought was heavy stuff for a kid's book.I am not against the concept of death in a kid's book, but I think it should be handled very carefully.

I agree that new fans need to know the greats; however, your job is to rate the top 100 players. Now, to Yzerman. He did not have the \\"Gretzky Rule\\" where no one was allowed to touch him or the size of a Lemuiex. He did everything on pure talent and a dogged determination. When someone has a top 100 without Yzerman in the top 10, it says more about the author than the player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top 100?","review":"How can this book claim to be about the top players of all time when Steve Yzerman is conspicuously absent from the top 50.

The album as a whole is just about perfect, displaying her ability to rock and her perfection at digging into those areas of the soul few musicians can tread without going sappy. She gets ya' where you live.The bluesy 'I'm the Only One' and the song 'Come to My Window' put Melissa into the mainstream, the potential building on her previous three efforts. On this one it all came together as she returns to her roots and avoided going toward the pop sound. She gets much more raw and after her personal life became as noticed as her musical talent, many of the lyrics make a lot more sense in hindsight. Yet they are such that they transcend her own personal life.My interest in her waned after this album but this album shows that she is one of the strongest and most talented artists in the entertainment world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid all the way through","review":"\\"I'm the Only One\\" is a bit corny, but fun nevertheless.

As Director of Bands at the University of Massachusetts, this little book soon became my constant companion. In just a few words and pictures, it provided each of my percussionists exactly what they needed to know to practice intelligently and perform with good taste.

It is necessary to haul the bed off to the local laundramat and use the commercial machines with the highest capacity. Not fun. Not convenient.

He uses the rim as a chin rest to watch me.It's very soft and lightweight, the kind of bed you'll find yourself picking up and taking from room to room so your pet can be with you without being on you. That's what I do, anyway. Just throw it wherever because it's not going to damage anything.Excellent quality. Nice material, soft stuffing. It just begs to be jumped into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable bed for Izzy","review":"After Izzy shredded her last bed I wanted to find a bed that was less fuzzy. I liked the high sides, Izzy likes to hang her head up and over the sides of things, and the oval shape. The color is very nice and the bed large. Even though Izzy is only a 14 lb mini schnauzer she likes to lay stretched out.When we first unpacked the bed the bottom was curved and the bed rocked like the foot of a rocking chair. I was concerned it would bother Izzy, but she jumped right in and made herself at home. She likes tucking herself in the crevices between the sides and bottom. The stuffing is very nice, very fluffy and the construction seems soft but durable.*edited 10/23/12Update- despite daily wiggling, happy dancing on her back, digging in her bed, this bed continues to be great. I have tossed it in the washer and dryer and it's really holding up. The bottom continues to be fluffy, the sides are still firm and the sherpa covering still looks very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loves it... what can I say?","review":"When I first received the bed I thought it was way not what I expected. I have a 13-year old Corgi and didn't think he would even be able to jump the sides of the bed. Well.... he loves it. My only complaints are: It is definitely NOT washable. (Would kill any regular washing machine). Also, the center is white, which any dog owner knows will NOT STAY WHITE for more than a day. We have put a fleece blanket over the white, and it fits in fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"lumpy, seam tore quickly","review":"It started out good looking. but the seam tore quickly under my dogs scratching, and it lumped up as well- should have read the reviews better- no zip off cover. It got dirty real fast as the fuzzy inside liner (not really true sherpa, thin and flat) was white and shows dirt and hair. After a week- it does not look so hot unless I put an extra blanket in the center. Will be buying a different bed in the future and likely not online. Should have sent it back but shipping was too expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bed!","review":"This bed was great for my dog, Baxter. He is so comfortable in it. He is a large dog and I got the large bed. My dog is 60 to 70lbs and fits into it with room to spare. The cushion is thick and bouncy and keeps him warm on cold days. He chews on everything so we will have to buy a new one after just two months, but I expected it to last 3 wks so I am very pleased. He loved it enough to spare it a month and a half. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dog Bed!","review":"Our 3 year old, seventy pound pitbull is very particular about his beds. Some he likes to destroy right away while others he cultivates a relationship with over time. This bed became his best friend right away. He has many options for where he can sleep during the day, but he chooses the bagel/donut bed most, if not all of the time. Its raised sides give him a sense of security, while the smooth middle lulls him to sleep.I was worried that it wouldn't be big enough for him, but it is the PERFECT size. I could even curl up in it!

I have this on vinyl and I remember liking the album for the most part, and this stellar mix is a prime example of how a 5.1 music mix should be. The only observation is, and it's just that, an observation, is the back surrounds can be a tad shrill on the higher notes at times. Not really bad considering how old the original recording is. The bass is about as good as you can get, not overdone and boomy like alot of todays music.

I think mine says 24 hour protection, but it doesn't last even a few hours. Also, I found that if I get dressed right after I put it on it leaves wet marks that show through my shirt. It makes it look like I have sweaty pits. So now I have to wait a little while before I finish getting dressed, wipe my armpits with some tissue, and then put a shirt on.

I apply it right after getting out of the shower (i.e. after I've shaved), and I haven't experienced any burning or redness. Of course, it is winter right now, so we'll see how well this does for me during summer.

Initially, it worked fine, by the end of the day I had some b.o. but it wasnt much and I'd just shower anyway. However, a few weeks in I felt a burning sensation in my arm pits that would not go away. I thought it was because I was using an old razor, but the burning continued after I replaced the razor. My skin has been red, raised and burning for a week. Now I read that this has happened to other users of this deodorant. I'll be switching to another deodorant right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, it Does Burn","review":"I am only on this site because I began using the Tom's Unscented (purchased from Walmart) and for the first week it was great. As of two weeks ago, I've noticed this painful burn. I thought it was because I was sweating and possibly \\"sweat gland acclimation\\" or something like that, to not having the aluminum. As of today, my arm pits are red, raw and in pain.. So much, that I haven't even been able to switch back to my old deodorant. As a female who is trying to eliminate as many inorganic products as possible from my life, this is a real disappointment to me. I don't want the aluminum, but I definitely don't want this red burning. I'm a real customer, with a real voice. Please (Tom's) evaluate this product make-up.

It's not just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst deodorant I have ever used!","review":"This deodorant irritated my skin and caused painful, itchy, red spots. I have used many different deodorant brands before and I never received such a bad reaction from using one. I bought the Tom's brand thinking it is natural and therefore can not be harmful to skin but just the opposite of that happened to me. I even had to go to the bathroom and wash it off from my armpits due to the painful reaction. I will not be buying anything from this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"smells great, lasts long, leaves you with horrible rashes. Very disappointed in Toms.

I do not have sensitive skin by any means, but this deodorant caused my armpits to burn for an hour after application. I tried it every day for about a week before giving up. I was hoping that maybe my skin would adapt to it or something, but it didn't happen. It gave great protection and I smelled fresh all day and night, but I couldn't get past the burning. Also, Tom's of Maine is a little more expensive than regular deodorants at about $6 per stick. One other thing I didn't like too much about it is that it went on more like a gel so it took a while for it to dry after applying. I did like that they have a wider variety of scents to choose from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Winning Product from Tom's of Maine","review":"I use many Tom's of Maine products, and am generally satisfied. However, this product is awful. It's so drying that my armpit skin peels and flakes off. No one wants peeling armpits. The roller ball version of this product (in the clear, squat container, not the taller opaque container) doesn't have the same drying effect, and seems to last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the one if you like smelling stale","review":"I used to use Tom's deodorant when they had a great product for a man. Then because some whinny customers called in about being allergic to oregano which used to be one of the ingredients, they changed all their formulas over to hops -- the same stuff that's used to make beer. This hops-based product smells stale as soon as you put it on and it doesn't get better throughout the day. My girlfriend doesn't like it either. Tom's should have left well-enough alone since they had great products before. They lost me as a customer and probably many others. It's very difficult to find a natural man's deodorant that smells pleasant without overdoing it with things like Pine or Woodsy. This is the 21st century, not 1970!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, it didn't work.","review":"I've been interested in trying a natural, aluminum-free deodorant for quite some time. I picked the apricot smell because it was pleasant and not too strong and the other choice was lavender, which can sometimes smell too \\"organic-y\\" for my tastes. Unfortunately, this pick just doesn't work.This deodorant says it provides 12-hour protection, whereas my aluminum-containing Dove deodorant claims 24 hour-long protection. I don't usually struggle with body odor and have never smelled myself with Dove deodorant, even after a period longer than 24 hours. However, with Tom's, even while I'm aware that it wouldn't last as long, I can smell body odor in just 5 or 6 hours. Gross!!! I feel I need either to shower or reapply the deodorant every few hours or so, which just isn't realistic. On a minor note, I also don't like how the solid stick becomes liquid in consistency upon application and takes forever to dry. So sad. I really would like to find an alumnium-free deodorant that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work well","review":"I've been trying to switch all of my personal care products to organic products, so I like that this is a widely available organic deoderant. (It's sold in my local grocery store and in Target.) I also like the apricot scent. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work for me. I've never been a really big sweater or had to worry about whether I stink, but with this I am constantly reapplying and worried that I smell. I don't care for the sticky feeling when I first put it on, but it dries so I can get over that. It just doesn't last though. It says 12 hours but I find myself starting to smell sweat much sooner than this. I really wanted it to be great, and I guess it's fine if you don't mind reapplying throughout the day, but that's not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"Not only did it not stop body odor, it irritated my skin. This is supposed to be better for me?This product was the last straw. Between this and the toothpaste that didn't prevent cavities, I'm never using a Tom's of Maine product again. If you want to go natural, there are much better and more effective products out there. For example,Crystal Body Deodorant, 4.25 Oz, (Pack of 2)- 4 Totalworks better and doesn't give you skin irritation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soapy Arm Pits","review":"While the product did do the minimum job of blocking B.O., the deodorant had one major issue that made me throw it out. If you get out of the shower, dry off, and then apply the deodorant, your arm pits get sudsy! I think this is to do with the sodium stearate, aloe, and glycerin byproducts, all found in soaps. So if you want a similar effect from this deodorant, just take some soap and rub it under your arm pits! Probably would work just as well, but if you don't want sudsy arm pits, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long lasting...yea I don't think so","review":"I have sensitive skin and regular deodorant makes me break out so I started using Adidas aluminum free deodorant which worked really well. Eventually though I couldn't find it in the store anymore, I guess they stopped selling it. So I started using toms and I thought it smelled pretty decent but it doesn't work! Like, at all. I put it on and literally a minute later I'm sweating and the deodorant it starting to smell really...I don't know how to describe it but it's just weird. Not weird in a good way either. My advice is use it if you want to but not if you sweat a lot like I do or if you're about to do something where you know you're going to get really sweaty because if you try to go to the club and dance or something while wearing toms then trust me you're gonna be pretty ripe in about 30 minutes so just wear regular deodorant.

Bass-driven guitar led the way in rockers such as Dancing In The Moonlight, The Boys Are Back In Town and Don't Believe A Word, while their introspective side is showcased in the tender ballad Sarah.

If only Apple hadn't screwed up with the external drive, I'd have that plugged in too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, pricy","review":"This costs more than your average USB hub but it also does a bit more. A good option if you want something with a long cord and easy access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy I bought this.","review":"I had been looking for a USB hub for a while and after reading many reviews for many products, I'm glad I choose this one. I've now had this product since 08/09 and it is still fully functional. I love the weighted design, although It would be nice if it were a bit heavier because it still easily gets pushed around. Having USB outlets both in the back of the unit and on top is wonderful because you don't have to mess around with cords to get to your removable devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well for me","review":"this is a great item if you need extra USB ports. I have had no problems with it and actually thinking of purchasing another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I bought this for multiple reasons. One is that I have more devices than usb ports on my laptop. Two, one of the usb ports on my laptop died, and Dell refused to do anything about it. I have had this product for a few months now, and I have not had any problems with it at all. I was a little hesitant at first to get it, because of some other reviews. They said that it dies after a couple of weeks or months, and gets hot. I have not had either of these problems. It stays cool, and is fast. I do not see any reason why someone shouldn't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last Long","review":"I've had this about 7 months and it burned up on me today.

I really like the two ports on the top of it for plugging in thumb drives and things you don't leave connected all the time. It stays put on my desk, despite being relatively lightweight. Everything I plug into it seems to run as fast as if it's plugged directly into the computer.I only had one issue with it overheating right after I first got it. It tends to run a little warm anyway and this time it actually stopped working.

Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It'll probably die on you","review":"I bought three of these hubs for different locations. All three died within the space of six months. It's a pity, because I like the design - useful number of ports and handy having two on top. But three duds makes it more than a coincidence.I've also had problems with the long-term reliability on some 7-port hubs from other manufacturers, but generally have a better experience with four-port models, so I'll be sticking to the latter from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item may be a fire hazard","review":"BUYER'S WARNING: This hub and items attached to it (e.g. my wireless mouse) were frequently spontaneously shut off and on. The unit got extremely hot, so hot in fact that I could not keep a finger against its base. As I had it sitting on a wooden desk, I was fearful that this could realistically represent a fire hazard.

I have to plug them directly into my computer to be recognized.Now, my HP 4400 printer is no longer being recognized as being connected when on the hub, after months of OK use via the hub.

The one attached to my main, tower computer fails repeatedly. Whenever I insert a flash drive, nothing happens. I have to unplug the USB cable to/from the computer, and reinsert the cable. The flash drive usually starts up when I reinsert it.The hub attached to my laptop is powered by the AC adapter. Periodically, the wireless transceiver to my keyboard quits working. I have to unplug the transceiver, unplug the hub from the laptop. Then, reconnect everything. (The wireless transceiver works fine when it is connected directly to a port on the laptop.) The hub also fails on other occasions when I connect a flash drive. The devices disconnect briefly, then reactivate/reconnect. This happens with only two or three other devices attached. Belkin always had quality products, and this hub has a high-powered AC adapter (3.5-3.8A); however, this particular hub continues to fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heeding the Call","review":"I've never understood why The Call wasn't a huge hit. their consistently catchy and intelligent music is complemented by serious and thought-provoking lyrics, and as far as I am concerned they never made a dull album. Named for their one big radio hit, The Walls Came Down includes the best of their first three albums, none of which is otherwise available on CD.

The songs are just flat out disappointing, except for There's No Limit. No surprise that No Limit was the radio single released to hype the CD before it became available. But nothing else on the album sounds like There's No Limit. The first song, \\"I'm Just a Girl\\", is okay - but pretty bubblegum poppish and she keeps singing about a back seat in a Corvette - doesn't exist! (Just a mild annoyance.) The third track, \\"You and Tequila\\" is a downer, but Matraca Berg has songwriting credit here so it's good. The album falls apart after the first 3 songs. Some of it is truly unbearable (\\"Girls Night Out\\") but most is just forgettable. Hope her next effort is back up to speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"I really liked the songs there's no limit and I'm just a girl but the rest of the cd is crap. She definately is not a true country singer (she listens to rap music, stated in an interview). One reviewer stated that the cd has a video of there's no limit, this is untrue.

I hope this is the record label's idea of a good album, cause if this is truly reflective of Deana's talent's, she's going nowhere fast. The songwriting is one-dimensional and though her voice is unique, it can become irritating if you listen to more than two songs in a row. If you're a fan of garbage, go and pick this album up because you'll love it. Those of you looking for quality music, stay away from this album.

Songs like \\"Crashing\\", \\"Are You Gonna Come\\", and \\"Zepp\\" could fit in easily on a King's X record while other tracks like \\"Equal Rights\\" and \\"Change\\" find dUg treading new ground with acoustic and slide guitar. The drum tracks on this album are played phenomenally well by Joy Gaskill, son of King's X drummer Jerry. This is a must for all dUg Pinnick fans and for anyone interested in something straight from the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy","review":"It does what it claims it does--it measures different volumes of stuff by adjusting it's position.

Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely the last Hurrah.","review":"If you don't own this one and love the mid 70's apex of thisgroup you will definitely want to make this purchase. To me thisis a more solid record than the previous release Contradiction and it boasts 4 great songs-Body Vibes, Merry go round, OHIO,and Angel. Actually Body Vibes is one of my favorite OP songs ofall time and it was never released as a single. In conclusion, if I didn't already own this disc i would definitely shell out the big bucks to obtain it since it is out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"op's are losing it","review":"angel's tight but when you hear this you can tell op is losing it by now o.h.i.o is tight but still the fire is slowly burning out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Personal Prayer Mentor","review":"This book is one of the most personally significant books I have ever read. Aronis offers a personal guide to using scripture based prayer to enter into a profound encounter with God. It is much more than a book about prayer; instead it is akin to a \\"how to\\" guide, acting almost as a prayer mentor. I appreciated the fact that the book teaches flexibility in prayer rather than indicating \\"the\\" way to pray. Aronis also tackles other areas of spiritual discipline while keeping the overall focus on prayer. The eight weeks I spent with the book enriched my experience with God in ways I had never imagined before. I have often returned to it and I now use the book in my college hermeneutics class for a section on devotional prayer. I highly recommend the book for anyone who seeks a deeper spiritual encounter with God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"I have a friend who is pregnant and needs massage therapy. I'm still in school for my licence but am practicing at home as I go through school. I bought this video tape to learn how to massage while keeping her comfortable and not hitting those pressure points I've heard about that can cause contractions. I learned a lot of really good techniques and there is a lot of good streching involved in this tape. I didn't use everything I learned in the video, but the table set up, posturing and foot and leg massages were what really did the trick. I'll warn you - the tape is DRY! Nothing exciting about the way these two people present. That is why it doesn't get 5 stars.Overall - my friend/client was comfortable the entire time, felt fully relaxed and stretched when the massage was complete. I would reccommend this video. The proof is in the work and a happy client and I had a great expereince with that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Prenatal massage video","review":"Very informative once you've had a basic class in Prenatal massage.

Unfortunately the disc is defective and will not play on my system without constant freeze-ups. This does not happen with any other DVD's. Sadly, I'm going to go through the refund/return process. My two star on the movie is my frustration with the disc, not the movie itself. Wall-e is one of the cutest little animated characters produced. Some might call the film a message movie, I don't think that's the primary point. A case can be made for most animated films having some kind of message, it's all how/why you want to see it.

For Pixar to be able to animate them in such a way that they show all their feelings and emotions...wow, wow, wow. It was just amazing. The animation was breathtaking, the story is great.

I have enjoyed every Pixar film I have seen, until this monstrosity. If I tend to use the word \\"torture\\" frequently in my descriptions, it doesn't even come close to conveying how much I suffered trying to make it through the movie. Honestly, I should have walked out, but I kept expecting the pace and plot to pick up..it never did. This film is about as tedious as it gets.Imagine hearing two robotic, mentally-challenged voices repeating \\"WALL-E\\" and \\"E-VA\\", NON-STOP, over and over again...for what seems like 4 hours. I've just summed up \\"Wall-E\\" for you. That's it. That's the whole movie. Nothing more to see here.

The plot is extremely thin, the characters (human or otherwise) are forgettable and, worst of all, it's boring.I can't see why people are calling it the best animated movie of all time. It doesn't work for adults because its plot is so childish and feeble, and it doesn't work for kids because it's just plain average.The proof is in the repeated viewing. My kids will (and indeed have) watch Toy Story, Monsters Inc, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, etc again and again and again. I can happily watch them again and again!They never get bored with those movies and they want a Buzz doll, a cuddly Nemo, the book of Monsters Inc... they just can't get enough.But they watched Wall-e once and maybe a half times more and that was it. No more interest.

Go back and look at the depth of the stories in Toy Story or Bug's life--the humor and the grand themes. The last 3-4 Pixar offerings are straight out of the worst of Hollywood conformity and unoriginality. Are people confusing great animation with great stories? Wall E was maudlin, predictable and Cars rewritten. Boy, car, or male robot is lost--female of same type helps him find his way or himself. Pixar has run out of good ideas, and maybe even ideas. They are currently at the point where they need a new direction, having used most of the usual environments, space, ocean, nature, imagination, and industry. They could try fantasy next. Whatever they do, they need to get rid of the tired formula that has taken them from \\"infinity and beyond\\" to mediocrity and the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM??? No wonder they offer the digital copy","review":"The movie skips and doesn't play on my computer. However, it plays on my friends DVD players but not computers.

This, along with no early dialogue, left the movie with the oomph of a pile of tin cans and meandering trash heaps. The film's artwork of a futuristic world is well depicted, but WALL-E is alone on the earth and he cannot sustain interest. Later on, he meets a girl robot, and love blooms - just beeps and squeaks throughout. Much of it reminded me of a silent film with Charlie Chaplin. Having a cockroach as a friend was repulsive, not cute.Earth has become a garbage heap with a cloud of toxic smog. Us fat humans have escaped, sent to outer space in a Space Ship that looks like a gigantic Caribbean Cruise ship. All they do is eat and float around in deck chairs. This is in the last half of the movie and the simple message is overdone. The movie had a couple of smiles but the wait for something interesting to happen is tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"the DVD arrived. but the package was damaged.

So I purchased it and just watched it for the first time.The movie was great. It was funny, and touching. There is a message in the movie about the damage we are doing to the planet. Sometimes I felt the message was over-done, but at other times it was perfect.I don't want to give away the story. My recommendation is to watch the movie and enjoy it. You can enjoy the movie without being wrapped up in the message. Or you can watch it with kids and talk about the message. Either way you should enjoy this light hearted movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have noticed that Pixar still hasn't made one bad movie yet!","review":"I have noticed that Pixar still hasn't made one bad movie yet!I've liked all the Pixar movies, and this is IMO the best one.The message that I think was behind this movie was really good as well. A robot left behind and forgotten about cleaning up the Earth for 700 years and the only friend he has is a cockroach. Well I guess that he doesn't have very much else to do anyway.

This movie is just fantastic in that regard; I often had to remind myself that nothing you see on-screen is real in a physical sense. That said, I can't quite give WALL-E five stars because most of the time it's all style with little or no substance. The second half contains some entertaining riffs on \\"2001,\\" but for long stretches there's just a lot of frenetic action for action's sake. I enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to just about anyone, but I wish there had been more substance to match the spectacular production values!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is the best movie I have seen in a while.

A sad situation indeed.So I will go on to say, if you're attention span is that of a spoiled, A.D.D child, then this film will not be for you.However if you actually appreciate art, & would like to see an entirely new spin on a very familiar theme, then this is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wall-E","review":"I got a promotion for a free rental on Amazon so I thought I'd try Wall-E.

Wall-E is innocent and adorable, his obedient ways break your heart and instantly draw you in.

And more importantly to love and care for our planet because taking it for granted could lead to devastating results. Animation is riveting. A must have for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun film!","review":"Full of beautifully-done scenes, Wall-E is fun to watch. The subtle things done with portraying the robots in this film made them sympathetic characters in their own right, especially when it came to Wall-E and EVE.

Nonetheless, \\"Wall-E\\" is yet another instant Pixar classic. Combining affecting love story, grand adventure via space odyssey (without losing any clever references to that certain Stanley Kubrick masterpiece), and genuinely funny Charlie Chaplin-esque comedic antics by virtue of smooth and natural storytelling, \\"Wall-E\\" achieves a lot on many levels, and yet it is seemingly easy to dismiss it as a mere \\"cartoon\\".

Disney went all cheap-o with this dvd.Now what am I supposed to do? Wait to see if Disney fixes the problem and hope I'm informed of it?

This Wall-E 3 Disc Edition, however, will not run at all on my computer, not on Power DVD or Windows Media Player. All it does is cycle through all the chapters in a few seconds, and then returns to the menu. To add injury to insult, Disc 3, the digital copy of the movie, when I type in the redemption code, mocks me by saying that I don't live in the USA, so my registration is invalid.

I love it and would greatly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I've always wanted this movie.The packaging it came in, however, was more of a cardboard foldable flimsy sleeve.. so upon opening the package I saw the edges had been bent and out of shape which was probably damaged during delivery.The movie was in mint perfect condition though.

The editing is beautiful and the story is downright adorable. You'll find lots of love for this movie and the characters in it and soon cherish this film as it has become a timeless classic for Walt Disney films. Your children will simply adore Wall-E. He's the cutest! I highly recommend looking into this film if you have children (or even for yourself!). I purchased this set because I simply love this movie. It's one of my top tens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and well written","review":"Great movie with remarkable sensitivity for an animated film about machines. Beautiful imagery and cute characters make this a very entertaining family-friendly film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie","review":"Just watch it, the main theme is love and commitment, as well as some great cultural jabs at laziness and inconsideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kung Fu Panda might have the fun, but Wall-E has the soul","review":"Is the silent film era back? There is very little talking (especially in the first 45 minutes), but I was never bored. This tiny box of metal conveys so much with his little beeps and body movements it is just amazing to watch. Then Eve comes along, and these two have some great chemistry for robots who can really only say each other's names. Okay, so it can be slow at times and not what the kiddies might expect from a Pixar film, but I feel this one falls in with Ratatouille in terms of quality filmmaking. This isn't just for the children. It is done in a way to make sure it is a timeless story for all to enjoy.I almost forgot. The little bunny short film before the movie is really good, and dare I say I enjoyed it more than the main feature. Or maybe Wall-E was just a little too much of a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Pixar hit","review":"Unless you count A Bug's Life (and I don't), Pixar has been churning out the hits for Disney over a long time now...and WALL-E is easily one of my favorites. The Blu-Ray edition is flawless and has some pretty cool special features worth checking out. Just a note: take a second to reflect on how much emotion and gravitas they were able to put into the WALL-E character...a character that doesn't speak throughout most of the movie. Impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful, special edition worth it","review":"Great DVD to pick up, high replay value. The cardboard packaging is iffy but consistent with the movie (one would have difficulty imagining landfill/carbon-unfriendly products). The story is probably one of the best of Pixar's excellent line, both friendly to adults and kids (who woulda thought a robot would be this cuddly). The added bonus stuff is highly watchable - an extra short BURN-E in addition to the theatrical short, commentary, BnL commercials, robot specs, making of documentaries, and a history of Pixar. I feel the extras make it worthwhile to pickup the special edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie; nice extras; lousy, lousy package","review":"Loved the movie, enjoyed the extras (especially the director's commentary), hated the package. I'm fine with eco-friendly packaging, but someone got cute with this one, and there's a flap on the inner box that catches on the flap on the outer box/sleeve, which makes removing the inner box a toughie. Solution is to insert the inner box backwards, but it shouldn't have been necessary. At least they didn't have the evil seal on the thing (you know--the one that's meant to guarantee that the DVD or CD is factory new and is hard to get off completely)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Cure Your Insomnia","review":"Someone please tell me why this movie is ranked so high? I have never seen anything so boring. There is no dialogue for the first 40 minutes.My son will usually watch anything animated and he couldn't last through it. I kept watching thinking it would get better. It was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather live in a post apocalyptic world than watch Wall-E again","review":"If you believe this is a kid's movie, then it clearly was made by people who don't have kids, and marketed by people who don't have kids. If you believe it's an adult sci fi movie (as I do) well, it's truly hard to imagine something harder to sit through. I couldn't help but howl, \\"Make it stop,\\" and I wept tears of joy when it mercifully ended. Less fun than a sack full of kittens and a brick."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOORRRRRIIIIINNNNGGGG!","review":"This is the most boring movie Pixar has ever made. (And one of the most boring EVER made!) It was almost painful to get through. My son who is 3 LOVES the other Pixar movies, so I thought this would be right up his alley. Three-quarters of the way through he was asleep. My husband and I watched the rest just to see what would happen, but my son refuses to watch it again. Just hates it. It's a great adult commentary on the world today, but does not translate well into a children's movie AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"This movie was propaganda. Fat, mostly-white Americans have taken over control of the human race, and do nothing with it. I hated this movie. I made the mistake of buying this movie without seeing it first. The movie portrayed Americans in the worst light I have ever seen them portrayed in 'film'. If you like or have any faith in the human race, do not get this movie. We are not all fat and lazy Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and a disappointment","review":"Considering I am a huge fan of Disney Pixar movies (Nemo being my all time favorite, with Bugs Life coming in a strong second) I was extremely disappointed with this film. However, I did find Walle to be cute and I liked the interraction with him and Eve. But then, it struck me as too preachy. Humans are now so lazy they have lost the ability to walk, drink food from cups, and have no interraction with eachother, living on a ship in space because they have ruined Earth with too much trash. Save me the lefty liberal BS and ENTERTAIN ME, please!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Version","review":"I'm rating the Blu-ray 2-disc edition only, not the film. I preordered the Blu-Ray versioin of Wall-E months before its release--at the time there was no description. As the release date neared, Disney started running ads touting the Blu-Ray with the digital download. I thought it would be great to have a choice of watching it on my HDTV or iPhone. When my package arrived (a day early), I quickly opened it and looked for instructions on getting the download. When I couldn't find any info, I checked Amazon and discovered that now there are two versions of the Blu-ray. This two disc package and a three disc one. Only the three disc version comes with the digital download. Worse, both are priced the same. Amazon, you ripped me off.Since I opened the disc already, I'm sure I can't return it. Maybe I can save you the same mistake. Be careful which you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big let down","review":"This was a big let down for us. My 5 year old son just didn't care for it and found it boring, he has not asked to watch it again. I think he got a couple laughs near the start and that was about itI honestly came to the same conclusion as we sat through this movie, it was a slow moving movie and just wasn't very entertaining and the underlying story wasn't anything new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the family","review":"They really give Wall-E a personality. The story is only ok, as far as plot lines go, but the animation makes it fun to watch over and over. There is a certain charm that will win over most skeptics, but if you read to much into it you may feel it's too intense or sad. For Pixar fans it's a must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"much fun movie for any age","review":"We got this movie for a good price, delivered promptly and it is great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie - Family Fare","review":"It's a fabulous family movie that everyone will enjoy.

My Samsung HD931 can play the bonus features but not the movie. The same for my XP-based PC (WMP - I'm not sure what DVD decoder). It does work with the Mac OS X 10.5 DVD player application."},{"rating":"2","title":"WALL*E is a winner - a must-see film for anyone & everyone","review":"WALL*E is a simple yet charming & enjoyable story. Truly wonderful & skilled filmmaking from the mind of director & co-writer Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo also), as shown by how much emotion and heartfelt moments can be conveyed with such little dialogue. WALL*E reminded me a lot of E.T, with his curious look at the world & his heart of gold. Along with stunning visuals (especially the large vistas), WALL*E is another more than solid Pixar film. Without a doubt, I anticipate it will bag the 2009 Academy Award for Best Animated Film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Ever!!!","review":"This came exactly when they said it was. I'm so happy to have it as part of my collection now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price","review":"There are plenty of reviews for the movie but as far as price... here is a consideration. I was going to buy the 3 disc Blu-ray set from Amazon but when someone gave me a $25 gift certificate to Target (a store I never shop at) I decided to buy it there. But the price at Target was utterly outrageous $37.99 BEFORE tax. after tax it was over $40.00Amazon's prices are fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greener Acres, M' Love","review":"The set works. The movie was more than enjoyable, it had a timely message and a heart-tugging story. I haven't seen the second disc which holds a lot of extras, but the third disc is a digitized version of the movie which I was able to download to my harddrive--however, when I tried to transfer it to my new iPod Touch (which did have enough room)it wouldn't transfer. I might have to call iTunes to find out what is happening with it. I tend to believe first that I missed something rather than having a defect in the product. I do recommend the movie and have enjoyed it more than once already. The dialogue is something that takes a few times to hear to catch all the great lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly depressing film","review":"I purchased this film expecting to love it. Instead, I found it a terribly depressing tale about man's habitual pattern of self-abuse, environmental destruction and abandonment. There is no clever dialog to engage the viewer, indeed, there is very little dialog at all. Wall-E is an adorable little robot who has been left behind to clean up the catastrophic mess that has covered Earth, while all the remaining humans travel about space in a perpetual holding pattern, eating themselves into deformity. I cannot fathom what the other 700 some odd viewers who loved this movie found to love about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"memo to Disney Studios","review":"Region A Blu-ray discs are intended for America the continent (Canada, USA, Central America, South America & the caribbean islands) and we are french, english, spanish and portuguese speaking citizens, please consider carefully to include at least these subtitles for all future family releases !!!!, you can be sure your sales will rise and money is all you are after, after all !"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but not a block buster","review":"missed it in the theatres and always wanted to see it.

They liked watching it the first time, and each time I have tried to turn it on after that, they don't give it any attention.

This Blu-Ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-Ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-Ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-Ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful animation, boring story","review":"The kids left the room before the 30 minute mark.

I am assuming you got a whole shipment of defective DVD's which by the time of our return you should have known and not shipped any more from that shipment. Now we had to go through the hassle of returning it a second time and not trusting that you would not send us a third defective DVD, we requested a refund and bought it from a local discount store.

The basic plot may have some content and a hint of morality with its warnings about trashing planet earth, but it comes through as a slow moving sequence of images with no meaningful dialogue. Having said that my 3-year old still likes it.The cardboard DVD case is also flimsy and would not last long in a household with children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't seen the movie yet, the product package is garbage","review":"This review is for the Single Disc DVD edition... box/packaging.The DVD is housed in 100% cardboard/paper with no plastic at all. The box is flimsy with the disc sliding into a scratchy cardboard sleave.The middle insert wouldn't pull out cleanly because of a flap of cardboard they put in it with a security chip on it (this got ripped off immediately.) The middle insert doesn't even fit in the outer box correctly. It is an embarrassment to put this nasty paper box on my DVD shelf.I expect way more from Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, horrible manufacturing","review":"Be very careful about purchasing the special 3-disc Blu-Ray set. They had something go horribly wrong during the manufacturing.

As any good grandparent knows if it keeps them entertained so Mom and Dad can get some things done it is well worth the money, even if you have to purchase more than one.

I found it really condesending that the only \\"fat people in space\\" were Americans! I really don't think we need to be sending THAT message around the world especially in a cute little Disney vehicle called Walle.... Sure there is redemption in the end but only in still shots like the animators were \\"mailing it in\\" and didn't really want a happy ending. I can't be the only one with that take on the flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for adults","review":"I read the raving reviews and expected a walt disney classic for adults - something like The Sound of Music for the 21st century or Star Wars or something, but with an environmental theme.I drifted off when they reached the spaceship and awoke when the robots led a revolt.Definitely not for adults. I should have spent my money on Angelina Jolie instead ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING.","review":"This is the first Disney/Pixar movie I have seen that I felt was boring. (I was checking my watching every ten minutes to see when it would be over.) These are the reasons I did not like it: 1) It took too long for the story to get going--or for Wall-e to board the spaceship; 2) the characters lacked development--especially Wall-e who is the main character (I didn't feel anything for these characters: Wall-e, the Captain, etc.); and 3) this movie was filled with cliches, such as the Captain is going to rebel against the Higher Authority, insignificant Wall-e is going to save the day, we reap what we sow (or in this case the garbage that we made is the garbage that our planet turned into), etc. I would have to say Wall-e is the first movie that I thought could NOT be enjoyed by both kids and adults. For a much better environmental animated movie that is filled with original ideas, I highly recommend Spirits Away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say BORING","review":"This is one of the top 3 worst movies I have ever watched. My son is very much a Disney fan and he would not sit still watching it. It did not keep his or my interest for more than 5 minutes.Awful.

I will try to sell it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad product from Walt Disney/Pixar. Pathetic!","review":"Here is a minimalist approach to children's movies. Forget the story line. Forget what was learned in Finding Nemo. The cricket ends up as a pathetic device. Create a film without dialogue or characterization, except for the scene where the robot runs about calling Eve's name. Have an environmental message that would completely baffle little children before putting them to sleep, Embrace the abstract while making some obtuse reference to fat people drifting along on floating rafts who cannot do for themselves. What this has to do with Wall-E is a lost cause. Oh, yes, create a captain character who has no personality, who is pathetic. Who would have believed that Walt Disney would forget their primary market--children? Gee, if Walt Disney/Pixar continue in the same direction as Wall-E, their future will end up as dismal as the brown planet in the movie! What were they thinking? Have they run out of plots and lovable characters to tell their story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this one will make you wan to shoot yourself","review":"I guess i'm not really the cerebral type.

If i had a gun with me in the theatre, i would end it all there and then.Uri Gofman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pixar Movie Ever","review":"It's almost useless to rally against this movie, but its rather gross in its portrayal of obese people. It also incorrectly links obese people to environmental problems. As was displayed by many newspapers, it is not fat people who pollute, but thin and wealthy people. Most overweight people are middle class, with the majority of poverty level being overweight. These people create the least amount of waste in our society. They own less cars, less property, less stuff and pollute less.Children are unable to understand such nuance and will think be given the message that fat people are to blame for what is the fault of all humanity.If Disney wanted to make a social commentary, they should have created a movie about an overweight family living below the poverty line whose overweight because the only food affordable to them is low nutrition, high fat, chemically packed food. It would have at least been a social commentary on a problem that's actually real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not great movie","review":"Personally, the first 20 minutes without dialogue were the most engaging, creative, and humorous. Once the story hit space, it became quite prosaic, with much of the activities and dialogue onboard being straight out of other stories, and nonetheless with several logical holes, even for a kid's movie. The return to earth was strictly formulaic and feel good as well. Despite this, still a respectable, sweet, and humorous tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"the box was badly damaged","review":"i bought it under the confidence that vary good condition was not that the box was so smashed that to even look at the disk i had to bend the box to get it out, I will say the disk works fine and seems in good condition but i am still mad about the cast"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overhyped but decent","review":"The Bottom Line:Wall-E is a bit overrated (here come the unhelpful votes!), with a middle section that drags noticably after the stellar opening act and suprisingly poor animation of the human characters (in contrast to the excellent rendering of Wall-E and EVA); if you like animated films and haven't seen it, you should know going in that this isn't the end-all be-all.3/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cute Family Entertainment","review":"Our children received this as a Christmas gift and wanted to watch it the first night they got it. And they've wanted to watch it every night since. As parents we found ourselves laughing and cheering on the robots. The animation is incredible and who would've thought you could make a captivating love story about a trash compactor?There is no content or inuendo to be concerned with for children of any age. It was clean, wholesome, family fun. Pixar did a GREAT job and should be commended. They should take note and make more inuendo-free movies. Another homerun for Pixar - like Nemo.We had no trouble with our dvd (we did not get it from Amazon) nor do we know anything about deleted scenes as we did not see it in the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Disney movie for all ages","review":"Once again, Disney delivers a great famil film that even a 15 year old would love.

Perhaps one day we will learn from a movie like this, one can only hope.And the Blu Ray quality is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"With Amazon You Can Wear It Out","review":"My grandson LOVES this film so much he wore out his first CD. This is the replacement.I love it, too. The love story is endearing, especially with the wonderful music we don't get to hear very often. The background subjects, subtly shown in comedy, of super-sized meals, too much garbage and no exercise are things we should all address.Definitely a great movie for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible message in movie","review":"Wall E starts out fine but in the second half a message that is dangerous and just wrong comes across. The message is that fat people are lazy and stupid. Every human character in this movie is grossly obese and lazy. They stay in recliner chairs that hover and move around so they don't have to. They are so lazy, they don't even eat their food, they drink it instead. Then they are portrayed as dumber than dirt when their captain tells them they can grow pizza plants on earth. They are so excited to grow pizza plants, they wobble and waddle out of their chairs to follow the captain. It is sickening and untrue. If Pixar or Disney showed a race of people the way they show fat people the movie would be banned."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies of all time!","review":"My 7 year old hated this movie as did all her friends - younger and older. They said the best part of the movie was the popcorn. Too bad Pixar usually makes great, fun movies for all. They blew it this time. I'd give it less stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst movie of the year!","review":"I think that Wall-E is a dismal failure as a children's film. Oh, yes, throw in an environmental message. Forget to use any meaningful dialogue throughout the film. Use songs from the 1960's with which children cannot begin to identify. Show earth as a desolate planet. Take Wall-E's purpose of making garbage cubes and repeat it over and over. Bore little children, whose parents thought they were bringing their kids to a quality family movie. Love story? Oh, yes, children really like a love story between two robotic personalities who don't talk. Lastly, everyone has got to be attracted to a film with fat people floating around, being too lazy to care for themselves. Ah, that captain figure was really something. What ever happened to Wall-E during that detour? What a sad waste of Walt Disney/Pixar talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining for kids and adults.","review":"Kids loved it and it had a good cynical view of the future of humanity for the adults.

That was a big mistake.This movie is pretty to look at, but boring as hell. I can't see how any one, particularly children could sit through this film.This film is not even the same ballpark as Finding Nemo or Toy Story or any of the other Pixar films for that matter.There is barely any speaking and the movie is not even funny. Where is the entertainment value? I still get laughs out of all of the other Pixar films but not this one.Like I said, it sure was pretty to look at, but overall the worst pixar movie yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Years Pixar Flop!!!!!","review":"This was a complete disappointment!

If you like watching a Robot trash compacter run around the planet picking up trash, and you think that the rave rievews from the so called experts must be right, then this is the movie for you!!

Enough said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst dialogue and plot of any Pixar movie","review":"Wall-E unfortunately had the worst writing of any cartoon movie.

Skip this movie and watch Up or Nemo or Ratatouille."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"Wall-E is not a movie that I enjoy watching.

They made their recommendation based on the amazing digital effects. However, the story is basically a propaganda film, trying to make children believe that capitalism is ruining earth and that pollution could become such a problem that earth is uninhabitable. It's too bad that Disney has decided to buy into the liberal idea that companies don't care about people or the enviroment.Besides that I found the movie rather boring, since the robots don't really talk to each other, and most of the scenes are brown or grey. Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will regret it","review":"I could only see this movie only once and that's it. I did not liked this movie at all.

The story is slow and the themes are too sophisticated for most children (and, arguably, not entirely appropiate). I was watching it with three other adults; they all left half way through.

Not since \\"Johnny-Five\\" (Short Circuit I & II) have I seen a movie with robots as the principle characters. It does have a good theme on team work and friendship throughout and Wall-E's eccentric personality shines through it all its circuit-board hilarity.It is worth having this one to keep with Cars, Toy Story I & II, Short Circuit and other such movies if you are into that genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"I <3 this movie.","review":"Okay, so I had to be stuck in a plane to watch it all the way through because it's a little (a lot) slow moving.

It's the perfect gift for someone you care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great \\"film\\" experience","review":"Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and other great early silent film stars must be applauding at the first thirty minutes or so of this amazing little film.This film not only belongs on the same mountain as Sleeping Beauty and other Disney classics, but alongside the truly great masterpieces of motion picture art.I honestly don't know what higher praise I could give."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Cute!","review":"Not sure if this movie is for kids, but this 40-year old loved it.

We have watched it a few times since getting it & we are very happy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wall-E","review":"This is a cute movie. The kids love it. The lack of dialogue is refreshing. Lots of physical jokes and action more than make up for the regular snappy spoken jokes and innuendo. I have only tried the extras you can see on the TV and they are all wonderful. The games are a bit hard for my little ones (3 and 5) to understand. Actually, they were a bit hard for me to understand also, but the games are not why we bought the movie so it doesn't really matter.The only thing with this set is, I HATE, HATE, HATE the packaging. The paper is already showing a lot of wear and is ripping apart. I guess it makes sense (with the point of the movie being conservation) to not use a plastic case, but what sense does it make when your DVDs get so horribly scratched that you have to buy a new ones in the end? It's also difficult to store the thin cardboard packaging because it is lost among the bigger DVD cases. I think I will try to find an extra DVD case somewhere.Summary, movie great...packaging stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wall-E DVD has scenes cut","review":"We had seen the original movie in the theater and had looked forward to seeing it again.

The visual and audio quality is beautiful.The BluRay \\"features\\" of this apparently mean that it is a BR-Java disc, which means that you can't resume play of the movie at any point like you can with a normal BluRay. Which makes this an extremely frustrating movie to watch if you ever have to stop it.This is particularly because I was initially having trouble getting surround sound until I put my PS3 in \\"Bitstream\\" audio mode instead of \\"Linear PCM\\" which is the default. I must have watched the opening Disney cruft at least 20x trying to get the audio sorted.Another very annoying privacy violation by this BR disc: When I allowed it to download updates from the internet (something I normally do not do), it somehow PERMANENTLY set the \\"Allow disc to connect to the internet\\" to Always Allow instead of Always Ask.To be honest, if I had it to do over again I probably would have just gotten the DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic Tracking","review":"Although I loved the movie, I returned my original purchase once, and even the second DVD replacement still didn't play correctly.

The scenes of Wall-e and EVA being chased on the spaceship makeup for half the movie time. Wall-e is cute and there is an important message about saving earth and plant life- but that cute robot and message were copied from the science fiction classic \\"Silent Running\\" . Even the design of Wall-e was ripped of from that movie. Disney added binoculars for eyes, but its the same robot design. Too many concepts and scenes just drag on in this film. The floor mopping robot for example, is shown over and over again without adding anything to the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work : (","review":"The box the movie came in was in terrible shape, but the movie looked fine.

Songs like the belting 'Sugarcube', the feedback-lashed 'Little Honda' and the very MBV-esque 'Deeper Into Movies' create sonic cyclones as they rush by. But these are rapidly disarmed by the intermittent presence of lilting love songs, delicately acoustic and country-tinged. And the balance is perfect.. The penultimate 15 minute epic 'We're an American Band' makes for a dizzying ending, arrested beautifully by the impossibly gentle 'My Little Corner of the World', which brings to a close one of the most rewarding albums you're ever likely to hear. Por que no la tengas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless rock--as powerful as it is beautiful","review":"I've always admired Yo La Tengo but this may be their finest album yet. It's one of the best albums I've heard in years by anyone. The songs have such variety of mood and such hypnotic tempo changes, the album never gets remotely monotonous. The songs are great at any speed and the vocal harmonies gorgeously ride the waves. I can't recommend this one highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album I own","review":"This album is a masterpiece. There's not a song on it that doesn't have some kind of remarkable emotional power. The stretch of pure genius from tracks 3-11 is my favorite music, period. If you listen to this album religiously, you'll become more human and your soul will grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums...Ever.","review":"I've had this CD for 5 years now and I still listen to it on a regular basis. There's a little something for everyone on this CD: Instrumentals, catchy pop, distortion, a cover of a Beach Boys tune, bossa nova, and a country song. This is Yo La Tengo's masterpiece and one of the best albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"Living in Hoboken (the same city where Yo La Tengo live), this album has special meaning for me. No other CD captures the sounds and movements of Lower Manhattan and Hoboken so well. When I worked overseas this summer, I listened to Moby Octopad, Stockholm Syndrome, Spec Bebop, among others to capture the hussle and bussle of this area I missed so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Amazing Amazing","review":"This album is any music lover's dream come true. It somehow manages to combine elements of pop bliss, lullabyes, synth pop, and rock into a grand album that really never gets old. Every song on here has its own personality. The instrumentals are probably the most beautiful songs in the world. \\"Green Arrow\\" is the unoffical sountrack to every humid summer night spent looking at the stars and \\"Damage\\" just might be the saddest break up song ever written ( that's too be expected with a line like \\"I hope I mumbled goodbye as you walked out the door\\"). But of course, the band never takes itself too seriously. There's \\"Little Honda\\", a song about riding a moped, and \\"Autumn Sweater\\", a pseudosynth pop ditty that mixes art rock with a booty beat and creates the best reason to get big speakers in your car. Yes, this album is amazing. It's the soundtrack to my college life. They really should give you a copy of this CD upon your graduation from high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful, A CD for a stormy night or a broken heart","review":"Yo La Tengo is a wonderful pop/rock band that can bang out rockers like \\"Suagrcube\\" or wonderful melodies like \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" and \\"Deeper Into Movies\\", they can also do a damn good Beach Boys cover with \\"Little Honda\\". \\"I Can Hear The Heart...\\" is a lovely mix of guitar crunching and spacy rythms, and beautiful singing. It is a great album and the one CD always in my player. If you like this one also pick up \\"Painful\\" and \\"Camp Yo La Tengo\\",as well as Elliot Smith's \\"Either/Or\\" and Richard Davies new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only one of the best albums of the year...try the decade","review":"what can i say. this one from YLT brings me to tears, gives me goosebumps and has made me a true fan. ranks up there with the addictive and obsessive listening i experienced with radioheads \\"ok computer\\".one directive: BUY THIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I purchased this recording a year ago and it remains a \\"staple\\" in my music rotation. Very unique, fluid, and well done. Reminiscent of Velvet Underground, but more up-to-date and very listenable. I love this recording and recommend it as an addition to any music lovers collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"1997 Album of the Year","review":"No disrespect to Radiohead, The Chemical Brothers, or Bob Dylan, but this was the best album to come out last year. Most often compared to the Velvet Underground, Yo La Tengo reminds me more of My Bloody Valentine in the way they combine crunchy, swirling feedback with caressing vocals and luscious melodies (\\"The Lie and How We Told It\\" is a perfect example). They even step into bossa-nova territory with the sweet \\"Center of Gravity,\\" and close the album with the obscure cover \\"My Little Corner of the World\\" that sounds straight out of VU drummer Mo Tucker's songbook. Taken as a whole, I Can Hear the Heart Beating As One is perfect ear candy you'll want to fill up on over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"My friend wanted me to check out this group, so I listened to her entire album and wait...I didn't cause I fell asleep. This is a group that has very boring music, and downtempo isn't the word for it.They need to step it up or get stepped on."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this if you are thinking about getting married.","review":"A fantastic book that covers a wide range of subjects, a must read/go through for couples considering the biggest decision of their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many questions, and not enough depth.","review":"This is a good book for getting to know someone if you have no idea what to ask them, but common sense covers almost all the questions. I would try something else, if you want more than a few sentence answer from someone. I would not recommend it for a preparation before marriage, you can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver","review":"My girlfriend recomended that we fill out this book together. We did and it saved me a second divorce. It has questions you wouldnt think of asking untill too late. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"This book was a great find! My boyfriend and I are seriously considering marriage and found this book on Amazon. Going through the questions has been great for us because we realize better what we agree on and where we need to compromise. There are questions listed that we never would have thought to ask each other on our own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"My boyfriend of 2 1/2 years and I are in the process of reading the book, we do about a chapter a night. Although I live with him, the subjects brought up in this book were not ever touched on before reading it. This book has been very helpful and has really made me feel as though we can take the next step into our life together. Excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this before getting married","review":"If marriage had an SAT this would be it! If you follow the guidelines in this book you will know for sure the answer every couple wants to know before they leap, are we really ready ? If u aren't this book will help u pin point why u aren't and if there is hope that one day u will, it truly awesome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great relationship tool!","review":"I love this book! My fiance and I went through it and it's taken us over a year to complete it, but we're talkers. It gave us a great opportunity to share information about ourselves that we might not have thought of or that we might have been reluctant to bring up on our own. In other words, it's a great vehicle for meaningful conversation and exploration. I'm a psychologist and I recommend this book to couples (married or not) to help with existing issues or to proactively address many questions that come up naturally in relationships. I even bought it for my brother and his girlfriend. It will make you think about what you really want in a relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in small doses!","review":"Although we know the answer to most of the questions so far, it is a nice way for my boyfriend and I to bond and discover the extra details we have yet to share. The book gives that lil' bit of clarity you might be looking for.Girls, he can only take so much, so try doing a section a day. You can get burnt out on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to pass on........","review":"My husband and I went to high school together and have known each other for over ten years before we were married. I guess when you have known someone that long.....through high school and college there isnt very much you dont know about each other! I bought this book thinking it would be a great way to learn things about him that I didn't already know.....a way to re-connect. What I learned, was that I knew all of the answers to these questions. I was disappointed with this book because I wanted it to be a way for us to get to know each other on a deeper level. The questions were more about family life, life growing up and so on......I knew all of that! I guess our situation made things a little different. If you know each other well......pass on this one......"},{"rating":"2","title":"1001 Questions to Ask Before You Get Married","review":"This was a present for my daughter! An excellent way to conveya common sense and realistic approach of marriage to couples who may be thinking about a trip to the alter! If it gets a couple to THINK, and DISCUSS, then maybe it will create a foundation for a successful and LONG marriage ahead! It can't hurt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"eh\\"","review":"This one was alright, it had more of a cuban beat than a crack-smoken old school Eek-A-Mouse. I liked it, \\"Love Me\\" is a good song. Its alright, but I like his others a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool fixture","review":"Used this unit to replace large chandilier in kitchen. Really like the multi directional aspect of this fixture, and using 60W spots provides just the right amt of light needed. No issues mounting it, and it seemed light weight yet sturdy. Would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad company to buy from.","review":"The product was not the same as it looked in the picture, and even worse the packaging was so bad that the interior box was destroyed. I had to redo wire work to get the light to work. I would not recommend by from the supplier of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known!","review":"In the promo there was no clue this fixture was designed for light-weight incandescent bulbs. I intended to use it with PAR30 LEDs. The heavy LEDs cause the sockets to sag, so the bulbs are off center. The low price should have told me this is a dog the vendor is trying to unload. I'm dumping it in a charity bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"MULTI-CEILING LIGHTS","review":"Wow! These light were so easy to install. It took mere minutes. I now have enough light in my hallway to see into my hall closet and not trip over any thing that might have been left out. This is so good that we are installing two of them in the new pantry we're building (one at each end) and one over the new tub we're putting in. (I like to read in the tub and standing lamps aren't all that safe.) I'm considering ordering more as they give an updated appearance and more light to whatever area (house built in 1950s) they are put in. I would recommend these lights whole-heartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, not entertaining, not witty. Just bad.","review":"I was psyched to buy this because Rolling Stone made him sound like somebody talented. He writes his own songs, he makes his own films, he records everything by himself in his room. He basically has the life I'd want to be living if I had some money. But if I had the opportunity to make something using all the equipment he's got in his room, it wouldn't sound anything like this. His lyrics are only there to make the beats go along with something, and his joke songs aren't funny. His tribute songs make you wonder if he has any grasp of the inspiration behind the artists he loves. After \\"The United States of Whatever\\", which is song 2, it all goes downhill. Haven't seen the bonus DVD yet, but don't get this for the music. Oh, and don't let the presence of Jack Black and Ringo (??) fool ya. This guy is the Ugly Kid Joe of the Internet Age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be worth a gambleon this one.","review":"I didn't really know what I was getting into on this one. I've never seen Liam Lynch's t.v. show, in fact, I had only seen the video for \\"My United States of Whatever\\" before picking this one up. Fortunately, I am pleasantly surprised. This is not another Weird Al, Lynch's songs are actually cool and worth listening for more than just humour's sake. Most of the album is for humour's sake such as the previously mentioned \\"Whatever\\" and the amusing \\"Still Wasted from the Party Last Night\\". If you're familiar with David Bowie's early '70s work then the \\"Fake Bowie Song\\" will leave you in stitches, as well as in awe at his dead-on imitation.The album also comes with a dvd, although increasingly common, this is actually one worth having. Lynch's videos are funny, and the home videos and puppet clips are worth checking out.This album is a bit of a gamble, but is certainly an entertaining collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven, but overall not that great","review":"The standout is, of course, \\"United States of Whatever\\" which is pretty good, but the rest of the album falls flat. His fake Bjork, Depeche Mode, etc... songs are better than the rest, but they don't make this album worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction, despite the notation","review":"Although I agree with the reviewers from Berkeley that the notation is confusing and different from other texts such as Reif, this book nontheless is highly recommendable. Particularly attractive is the choice of presenting statistical mechanics as a precursor to thermodynamics since as Gibbs is quoted, \\"the laws of thermodynamics may easily be obtained from the principles of statistical mechanics, of which they are the incomplete expression.\\" Of course a book is seen in a different perspective depending upon the quality of the instructor, in my case the instructor was excellent, I find it very difficult to see where some of the negative reviews are coming from. The presentation has an elegance not to be found in other texts at this level, while the range of topics and the depth at which they are covered is very encouraging to any reader desiring something beyond a traditional course in thermodynamics. To reiterate, highly recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Builds a strong foundation for advanced study","review":"The key ideas in the book are very clear. As already pointed out, multiplicity of states is brought out as the central theme, and the concepts on entropy, temperature, free energy etc are derived lucidly from it. I've since read some advanced books on the subject or related ones (Feynman's graduate lecture notes on statistical mechanics and Fetter and Walecka come to mind) but whenever I find myself confused I go back to Kittel and Kroemer for the first principles, and that usually clears things up. One piece of general advice: it's always a good idea to have taken a course on multivariate calculus before going anywhere near statistical mechanics. Without knowing the difference between the partial and the total derivative for example, you'll end up with what looks like a disconnected heap of equations that all look alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kroemer Should Remove His Name From the Book","review":"I'll start on a good note: The choice and order of topics has potential. The introductory example of cars in a parking lot was interesting, building stat mech from its core in probability into a very physical science.That said, anybody can write a good outline. It's just too bad that Kittel can't write a good book. This book is exactly like Kittel's book on solid-state physics: Drier than lunar soil. Lots of equation manipulation, and very little discussion or insight. I much prefer McQuarrie's book on stat mech.The most confusing thing about the book, however, is not the actual text but the fact that Kroemer's name even appears on it. Look at his quantum mechanics textbook: thorough, clear, and insightful. The complete opposite of this book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kittel's book very hard to learn.","review":"I dislike this book as an undergraduate student, because Kittel knows the material very well, but is unable to communicate the subject in a pedagogically sound manner. There are many steps missing from his proofs, there are no answers in the back of the book, and the problems themselves are difficult to begin. Kittel does not usually make it clear what a problem is asking. My advisor chose the book because of its organization, which is good; yet he also admitted the difficulties above mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comprehensive, but a BAD book","review":"I'm using this book for an undergraduate thermo class. It is one of the worst textbooks I have used. It may be large and comprehensive, but the organization is horrible. The book is extremely unclear, and when you start to do the problems at the end of the chapter, you really see how little got through to you. The problems are often vague and hard to understand, which adds to the problem. You can read it over and over and still get neither the math of thermodynamics, nor the physics behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst textbook ever","review":"Many of UC Berkeley professors use this book because Kittel was an influencial professor here before he retired. But at Berkeley, many of the professors themselves know this is a BAD book. I am taking a physics course which uses this book. My classmates and I think this is the worst textbook we have ever read. This book doesn't explain things in clear fasion. Many of my classmates have stopped reading this for the class. This book has so many errors and sloppy notations. This uses the same letters for different things. Sometimes s is a state label, and sometimes spin. M is sometimes magnetization, other times mass. And on and on! This is a very confusing book. I highly recommend NOT to use this. Also, many of my classmates' book are falling apart even though they just bought new ones. very bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple,honest,clear book about thermodynamics!","review":"This book in my opinion is the best book at the entry level for understanding thermodynamics.Basic concepts like entropy,chemical potential,perfect gas properties,black body and many others are developed here from scratch with a clear approach,emphasizing use of simple mathematical instruments and illustrations.While the point of view of this book is a little eccentric compared to other textbook competing in the same arena,authors have to be praised for their willingness to educate the reader in a realistic and effective way.Special attention is put to elucidate the very important subject of \\"equilibrium\\" a much abused but seldom explained concept in physics.As for problems i agree with other reviewers: they are totally out of sync with the excellent level of the book and they only add entropy to the student brain,but this apart this book is great:5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the lesser of evils","review":"I am taking a course that uses this book as its text, and I have to say, I am sorely unimpressed. In agreement with a previous review, I would say that the problms set out by kittel have two dominant themes; 1 they are painfully difficult to interpret as to what kittel expects you to learn from them, and 2, they are trivial to complete once you pierce the fog of the question. A message to prospective future instructors of a stat-mech course, PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS TEXT, YOUR STUDENTS WILL THANK YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Thermal Physics\\" by Kittel and Kroemer","review":"This is an excellent introductory text for students of thermodynamics and/or statistical physics. The approach of the book differs from the more traditional thermo texts, so it is very important that the instructor understand and convey the critical points of each chapter clearly. The summary at the end of each chapter is very helpful in this regard. The problems are exemplary of the material, and most are challenging. Students often complain that the book is too terse, but when I used it as a student I found the terseness to be of great value. A careful reading (and yes, re-reading!) of the text makes the concepts very clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book with no examples","review":"This is the worst book I have ever purchased (and the Solid State Physics as well -also by Kittel). The books have no solved examples. I am using these books in my Solid State Physics class, and have to do very hard homework and exam problems, yet I have no examples in the books. This has been a nightmare. I do not recomend these books to anybody. I believe, even if you ask Kittel, he would not know how he derived half of his formulas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decker is Awesome","review":"I've never been to Utah, but I feel like I have after reading Rod Decker's incredible book!

I wanted a player that would be easy to use for working out and simple to take anywhere. The T30 has managed that and more.I love just hanging it around my neck and listening anywhere. I have XP and WMP10 - but I use Napster and Yahoo to transfer music, they both seem to work better than WMP10. The battery seems to have a good life, and the sound is great. If I had one complaint it would be not being able to do playlists. This might be possible but I have not figured it out yet. The firmware updates were a slight pain - it amounted to doing a manual update first which was hardly difficult. I am fairly computer adept - but nothing was overly difficult. Hey for $99 this little machine rocks. After I got mine - I bought one for my daughter and my brother bought 3 for his family. My husband is waiting patiently for me to order one for him too. Basically we were very happy and satisfied with the T30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, terrible user interface","review":"I bought this unit mainly for its voice recorder feature, very handy if I want to record myself dyuring music class. As other reviewers have already confirmed, the sound quality on playback is very good, and given that it it it has a mono built-in microphone, recorded sounds also sound good. Also useful at the expense of greater thickness, is its use of AAA batteries.The bad is the user interface. The buttons are divided above and below the screen, and depending on how you hold the device, the feature you want is accessed either from the top or from the bottom. Not that accessing the feature is always intuitive, in the beginning I was forever having to re-read the manual to understand how to use it. The iPod this is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays for Sure -- NOT!","review":"I bought the iRiver T30 1GB after researching extensively, mostly based on the \\"plays for sure\\" feature. The idea is to be able to play all your legally bought, legally downloaded (from MSN Music) songs on a player that is compatible with the whole MSN system -- Windows Media Player, etc. I was therefore extremely aggravated and disappointed when the T30 wouldn't play any of my MSN downloaded music, or even some other .WMA files.I spent hours trying to \\"fix\\" the problem, then discovered via an online search that this is a KNOWN problem with the T30.It sounds great. I like everything about it -- except that I can't play all of my music on it. Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"requires Windows XP and Media Player 10. Why?","review":"Here in the USA you get basically a crippled version of the T30. Own a Mac? Windows 2000 machine? Forget about it. This thing doesn't even have basic features like drag & drop, you have to use the crummy Windows Media Player v10 to do EVERYthing.The unit itself is OK, but putting music on it is enough hassle that I'd rather use my old Samsung MT6.I give it one star because there's no option for zero stars. Poorly designed, poorly executed, and downright user unfriendly.The worst part is, with proper UMS firmware this thing would be OK. Only ppl in the US get the crappy \\"MTP\\" (aka Windows Media Player) version."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I have a different iriver, the ifp 899 which was apparently made before iriver decided to save money every possible way they could, in order to maximize their profits. the T30 costs almost the same as the 899, but has all the worthwhile features taken out. You have hardly any control over the quality of the recording you make, way less ability to navigate--you name it and it is NOT in this machine. Not only that, but after a few months of VERY light use, it started making corrupt recordings which makes it a huge hassle to load them onto my computer and compress them. Plus, recorded files are ENORMOUS unless you use the \\"low\\" quality recording setting--and then their quality is rotten"},{"rating":"1","title":"SORELY DISAPPOINTED POTENTIAL USER","review":"I was in the market for an MP3 player. Not knowing much about the capabilities of what was on the market I went to Amazon to find something that would fulfill my needs. Finding many (most) were so similar in touted features I settled on the iRiver product because I have purchased iRiver products in the past and found them to be outstanding. My disappointment on recieving this product which on install arrogantly advised me that I must UPGRADE my OS to XP. A change of my OS from 2K to XP would not be an upgrade in my opinion. Regardless, the idea that iRiver should require me to change my OS to install their software is so arrogant as to beyond belief. I called the company to question this and was advised that was their position.

Although the iRiver T30 handles the first two functions pretty well, I advise you not to buy this unit for its support of Audible files. In this mode it works (sort of), but I have discovered several very annoying quirks.As soon as I use the voice recording feature, the unit:1) Will not save bookmarks in an Audible file.2) Will not retain the last position in memory when I exit from an Audible file.When this happens, the only solution I have found is to completely reformat the device and reinstall the operating system.As well, when the unit's battery runs out in the middle of listening to an Audible file, the entire file is no longer recognized by the player. I must load a new copy of the file to continue."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],W={key:0},B={key:1};function C(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(M,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-d7cae1cc"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/9.md","filePath":"quotes/9.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/9.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
