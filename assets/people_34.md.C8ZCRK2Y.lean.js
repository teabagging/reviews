Donner recorded his vesion only because RCA refused to issue the Presley original as a single.Aside from 'Girl Of My Best Friend', which is perfect 60's pop, the album demonstrates the Presley genius on 'Reconsider Baby', 'Like A Baby', 'Fever' and Such A Night - all covers and all superior to the originals. 'I Will Be Home Again' is a little known masterpiece. 'Make Me Know It and 'The Girl Next Door' don't reach the heights of the other cuts, but this is is one of Elvis' top three albums. Want to hear the greatest blues/R'n'B singer of his generation at his vocal peak - buy this album.

Unfortunately, not every song is up to those standards, and I can't rate this quite as highly as _Chairs Missing_Although _Pink Flag_ is Wire's most straightforward punk rock album, the band's experimental leanings are already on display in some of the album's more interesting tracks - \\"Reuters\\", \\"Strange\\", and even \\"12XU\\" itself come to mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless creative rock that still sounds great!","review":"I picked up Wire's Pink Flag album after reading a book hailing it as one of the greatest seminal albums of alternative rock. After hearing it over and over again, I confidently say that was a sheer understatement by the book. It is the greatest. Besides Buzzcocks' \\"Singles Going Steady\\" album, this album is so perfectly crafted, you don't have to stop to skip any tracks. My all-time favourite track is \\"Mannequin\\". The raging yet haunting guitar riffs fronted by the playful and fiery vocals of Colin Newman captures my blatant liking and admiration. Another quirky but catchy \\"Strange\\" gets you to nod along to the jarring addictive guitars and strange echoey monkey calls. The short incisive \\"Three Girl Rhumba\\", \\"Lowdown\\" and Start to move\\" are unbroken rhythmic rock. The album is sheer brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allegories of Broadcasting, at Mass Appeal","review":"As far as I'm concerned, you either like *Pink Flag* considerably or you don't really have the background to evaluate it and much of the semipopular culture of the last twenty-five years.

No: the first true cover band, the Ex Lion Tamers, was formed to play Pink Flag note-for-note as an opening act for the reformed Wire (who might need defenders). Do you need to own a copy of *Pink Flag*? I'm not gonna say that; I don't think it would hurt your musical appreciation skills any, but it might interact poorly with Adderall or other \\"mind-enhancing\\" substances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.

We decided to go for a more practical fan in the living room to circulate air and provide light and went with this Hunter fan. I guess that's a lot of backstory to just tell you that we are in love with this fan. The installation was relatively easy, except none of the guys could get a good angle on the last screw. Still, it's a great fan, really sturdy, has a nice glass light that produces a ton of light for the room. (Before the old owner had the chandelier and also two other lamps to light up the room- this fan provides as much light on its own and we ended up storing our lamps.) It looks really nice in our older home. The only complaint I have about this thing is that the pull chains are ridiculously short. So I guess, consider that and your ceiling height when ordering and maybe also buy some chain extenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunter Fan","review":"Great fan, but the light is not.

I would buy more of these for my home. The only thing I will mention is that if you want a very bright light, you should choose a fan that has the 4 or 4 bulb style. This fan has only one overhead light that is not incredibly bright, but for my bedroom, it is appropriate and good for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as always","review":"This was the 5th Hunter ceiling fan I've installed in our current house. I've installed Hunters in previous homes also. This fan has not disappointed (none of them have) though I got the impression that they've moved away from some of the sturdy, long-lasting materials of the past.

Thank God I had not strewn all the parts about and was spared the nightmare of trying to repackage. I do not know if it was a packaging problem at the company or if it happened through careless shipping. I returned it immediately. I am disappointed in the way Amazon now requires me to return items through the USPS instead of through UPS. In my view, if they deliver it to your door through UPS, then they should be equally ready to have it returned from the ease of your doorstep instead of having to lug it to your vehicle, drive to the post office and lug some more up the steps to hand over. It was not this way in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blades create windmill-like shadows on ceiling","review":"While we love the appearance of this fan (the wood is very attractive with the darker metal trim) and the fan runs quietly and smoothly, BEWARE that the glass of the light kit is open at the top, meaning that the light shines upward onto the ceiling. When the light is on and the fan is running, you get shadows on the ceiling of the spinning blades. It's VERY distracting and hard on the eyes. Think of the people who live in the shadow of a windmill, it's that sort of effect. I read reviews on this fan before purchasing, and I can't believe no one mentioned the awful spinning shadows. It's especially bad as the evening gets later and there is less natural light in the room to diffuse the shadows. I would not recommend this fan to anyone, as the spinning shadows on the ceiling are just awful to live with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought three","review":"Bought three...Hunter 22460 Astoria 52-Inch Five Blades Ceiling Fan, Brushed Nickel...Hunter Fan Company gave 4 stars because they no longer include the hand pulls????

No response to either after 24 hours. Called Hunter again; after 20 minutes on hold, got a representative who noted the fan was under warranty, and shipped out a replacement switch housing. It took a journeyman electrician close to an hour to replace the broken part, but now it works just fine.It is an attractive fan, but I fear too much went into the appearance, and not enough into quality components. We got a white GE ceiling fan at about the same time for the kid's room; it's not nearly as pretty, but it works like a charm and the action of the pull chains is much easier and nicer than the pull chains on the Hunter fan. I won't be buying another Hunter fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a *white* fan!","review":"Having purchased a \\"matte white\\" Hunter fan locally, only to open it and find that matte white is some cream-color, I researched Hunter fans at the Hunter fan website and decided on this model, whose color is \\"white\\".I ordered 2 of them from Amazon and when the boxes arrived, I opened them up only to discover that the fans (blades, housing, etc.) are NOT WHITE. They are that same cream/ivory color as the \\"matte white\\"!!I am very disappointed in Hunter fans and will be contacting that company directly to see whether they even understand what the color \\"white\\" is any more. Harbor Breeze and Hampton Bay still make WHITE fans!I am hopeful that Amazon will take these fans back without costing me an arm and a leg for shipping. Unlike many colors in the world, I do not feel that \\"white\\" is open to interpretation. It is either white (devoid of pigment) or it is not, which means it is a different color.

I bought a couple of Hampton Bay fans for other bedrooms (same size), and the high speed is higher on them.

It was missing the tassel ends for the chains, so I'm contacting Hunter directly on getting them. If the electrician had not already installed it, I would have returned it. Hopefully, the motor will last longer on the Hunter. It was supposed to have medium base bulbs, but it actually has candelabra base - not my favorite. In its favor, it is a very nice looking fan and it is quiet.

I've always had good luck with Hunters. The one in my bedroom is 15 years old, only stops for cleaning & runs silent. Delivered on time.It's not the first fan I've hung. I had to add a 2x4 between trusses for fan support....took about 45 minutes and required a trip into the attic. The actual fan installation and assembly took 20-25 minutes and was fairly easy. Pull chain for the light is very easy and smooth....not so much for the fan speed chain. I find it myself reaching above the light shroud to pull it. Not a big enough deal to take away a star since I tend to \\"set it and forget it\\" with ceiling fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance","review":"This is the third Hunter ceiling fan I've purchased in two years. The first two were for small bedrooms (less than 130 SF) and this third one is for a larger bedroom (150 SF). The installation was straightforward, simple and went up quickly. No problems there.Turning it on and adjusting the fan speed proved a disappointment. The other two ceiling fans for the smaller bedrooms turn much faster at its highest setting, but this Astoria 22461 fan turns about the same speed on its highest setting as the other two on their 2nd or middle speed. All three were approximately the same price.Don't buy this fan if you're expecting strong air movement for a larger room. Buy another brand or different model of Hunter.

This book is an excellent segway into more advance studies in Physics. The later section of the book is also very philisophical, which is a welcome addition to a subject which has traditionally been very cut-and-dry, matter-of-fact. It is a book which will make you awe at the wonder of the world in which we live. Reading it once, however, is not enough.

Yeah, right.","review":"In the beginning of his book, Mr. Zukaz swears up and down that he is a lay person and that if you are a lay person too, don't worry; you will understand the concepts in his book.I didn't. I consider myself a reasonably intelligent fellow; college educated, cum laude, steady career, and so on, but I simply could not follow what he was talking about. My wife was reading over my shoulder at one point and noticed the complex diagrams Mr. Zukav uses to explain a concept and she pointed out that it didn't look like it was written for a lay person as I had told her. I had to agree.I have a genuine curiosity about the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics and this book did not sate my thirst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bull","review":"After reading the first paragraph of this book, I determined that Gary Zukav has absolutely no idea what he's talking about. He obviously has no physics training, and what he is in essence doing is trivializing physics. Physics is not easy, yet he tries to sell it as something that's quite simple. Many of the observations he makes and the conclusions that he draws are simply wrong. There's no other way to put it: this book is absolute garbage written by someone who just doesn't have a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Western new age nonsense","review":"Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking. This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.

Zukav's general formula for the dogma in this book is of the form: (A <relationship 1> B) and (C <relationship 2> D), where relationship 1 and relationship 2 have the same name but different domains of discourse, therefore A = C and B = D. It's the typical charlatan's play on words, repeated many times - attractive only to the ignorant and the gullible. Don't let this be your introduction to quantum mechanics (or new-age philosophy).

It requires very little thought, unlike serious physics or philosophy, and simply reinforces the notiion that all is one and none of it requires and study. Hence it's very attractive to those who are unwilling to deal with anything that isn't obvious or gleanable from television. Is all one? Yeah, sure. But that's no excuse to blow off Western science- or to think that a book like this says anything interesting about Eastern traditions.If you want physics, read physicists like John Gribben or Alan Guth. If you want Eastern metaphysics, read D.T. Suzuki.

I initially wanted to lose weight and work out at home because I was a bit self-conscious about my size. This book did the trick! After following the book for two weeks, I even treated myself to a slice of Sicilian pizza every Wednesday and still lost 2-3 pounds per week. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a healthy eating experience.

I realize that perhaps if I had stuck with it I might have seen results, but I couldn't make it through another week. The 5 days did NOT change my life. This diet is high maintenance and all you ever do is think about food, not because you're hungry, but because you have to. Eating every two or three hours as is REQUIRED by this diet is very inconvenient and can be very stressful. Also, at the end of the first five days, I felt worse, not better.

When it comes to diets, I have wasted more money and spent more time HUNGRY and in agony than I care to think about. With this diet you are never hungry. With this diet you lose the (for me anyway) nearly constant whispering of cookies, cake, etc. to come and gobble them up in irrational portions. Cravings literally vanish. (That's the miracle to me!)

Thing is, I'm also an avid exerciser and I found this diet didn't give me enough energy to do my usual workouts.

However, it is really difficult to get past her cheesey, disorganized, scatter-brained approach to writing. Rather than putting the core information in a accessible place in the book, she scatters it about, and fills the middle with pseudo-inspiring mantras (she must say 100 times that extras should be something you ABSOLUTELY ADORE until I can practically envision her doing a high kick in her cheerleading outfit). My advice: give it a quick read and outline the good stuff in a page. One other comment: this book seems to assume that the reader is overweight in part due to a complete lack of exercise. If you, like me, exercise at least 5 times a week, you may need to eat a little more for breakfast than her diet recommends."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent choice for any comic book fan.","review":"I was first introduced in RoLW a while back, from the OVA which aired a few times.

I don't know how this would work if you were going to wash the object after restoring the gold line, nor did I investigate whether it is food safe, but for refinishing display pieces it works fairly well.

The O-ring that fits on either end of the little barrel filter had not seated properly. Water all over the place. Took it down. Took it apart. Put it back together. No leak for two months. Then the other day, turned on the shower, heard a pop, and it leaks again. Took it down, took it apart. Put it back together. Still leaks. It's going into the trash. Don't bother with this filter, if for no other reason than it's not very good at what it claims to do. There are more effective products out there. I have one in my other place."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this shower filter!","review":"Ordered one for myself for the home and immediately noticed a difference in my hair once the chlorine and chemicals were filtered out of the water.

It was very easy to install and I can detect a huge difference between having the chlorine filtered out.

It may not be their best (as I have not heard any of their other stuff), however this CD kicks some serious a**. Unlike Suicidal Tendencies, these guys seem to pay as much attention to rhythm and music as the usual angry message of a punk band.Mind you, with me nearing age 41, this CD is far out of my demographics - but growing up with the Pistols, Ramones and Clash, I am not only curious but fond of the bands that are trying to put a fresh new face on punk.

People like that will eventually turn away from the band when they're not that popular anymore. If you want good punk rock, listen to Pennywise's Unknown Road, or anything by Black Flag.

The truth is that even though this is a little slower album in some parts. It is probably the most branching out that Pennywise is going to do. Most of the songs are still very aggressive and the lyrics are always meaningful. I think this is a very good follow-up to Full circle which is a good album. Best songs: \\"Greed\\", \\"my own country\\" and \\" badge of pride\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm, did I miss something here?","review":"Well, call me crazy, but I don't really listen to this piecer much.

Previous pennywise stuff, while nothing more than Bad Religion's last album a lot of the time, always had an energy behind it that saved them from being written off as another wannabe. Said energy is lacking on this release from start to go, I'm afraid to report. Straight from the get-go, you notice that the lyrics are a lot weaker than their previous stuff, and the music plays the background role, and most of it sounds like BR's \\"Suffer\\" 12 years later and slowed down. \\"My Own Country,\\" which many people think is an awesome political anthem, NEVER SAYS ANYTHING! How can you make an anthem without a political message at all? It's this vagueness that plagues this whole album, and makes me wish it had never come my way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your Pennywise shirt today","review":"If theres one thing that can be said about Pennywise, its that they found their style early on and have stuck with it. cd after cd, you know its Pennywise cuz it all basically sounds the same, which i love. I hate it when bands experiment. But this one is somehow different. Sure, it sounds the same as every other album theyve put out, and the first several songs are amazing, but after those, all the power and catchiness seems to leave and you just get empty songs. I dont know. Go with Full Circle or About Time first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh","review":"I really hate to slam a cd, and I know I'm gonna get into big trouble with the serious fans, but I really don't like this cd. I bought it mainly for \\"Alien\\" (Which is a great song.) The only problem is the other songs can't back it up. It's really driving; there are no other melodic songs like Alien on it. One thing that's pretty stupid is everyone bills them as a \\"positive and uplifting\\" band. Sure, 'Might be a dream,' and 'Still can be great' are positive. With lyrics like \\"One good shot and you'll end up dead / it's violence on the streets and it will never end\\" on 'Victim of reality,' you'd think they might be a punk-Soundgarden without the creativity. Okay, I said it. Sorry, but that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incredible","review":"This is one of the best CD's I have picked up im\\\\n a long time.

Only time will tell. Pennywise is about not conforming and deals with issues such as the government and the popular culture. The irony is large, because their last 8 tracks are barely even punk rock, made to get on the radio. Although I like songs like \\"Greed\\" \\"My Own Country\\" and \\"My Own Way\\", I think this band needs to stay true to their roots and not go mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!","review":"I bought this cd today knowing it would be great.

Although \\"About Time\\" and \\"Unknown Road\\" are better, I'd have to say \\"Straight Ahead\\" is on par with \\"Full Circle\\" and better than their other two albums (although all six of them are amazingly great). Straight Ahead is different than their previous albums. Pennywise seems more musically mature than on previous albums, which is saying a lot because their muscianship has always been great. The songs on this album are for the most part slower, but don't let that fool you. This is still punk rock. Lyrically Pennywise are at their powerful best. Jim's vocals are crisp and mature, and he displays some of his best singing on this album. I'd highly recommend this CD, along with other Pennywise albums. If you're a newer Pennywise fan or looking to get into another punk band, buy \\"About Time\\" or \\"Unknown Road\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"LISTEN TO PENNYWISE!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I actually give this album(and Pennywise)10/5 stars. They are a perfect band. They are great musicians and their lyrics are raw and relate to real people. This is by far my favorite album, there is not one mediocre song on here. Badge of Pride is one of the all-time great punk songs and a Pennywise classic. They have never sold out and always stay true to their roots. so many of my favorite Pennywise songs are on this album, it's hard to count, but here's the top 5-Badge of Pride, Can't Take Anymore, Greed(Byron's drumming is out of control!), Straight Ahead, My Own Country, and American Dream. Buy this album, you won't ever regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect eye appeal","review":"Neolithic art is, at best, dissapointing. Facial features weren't very important in the Neolithic and the statues shown uniformly have undersized little pinheads. Many have no recognizable facial features at all. With the modern emphasis on the human face, modern viewers will find little connection to these statues.Partially what determines form is the medium. Ceramic breaks when it falls. Top heavy statues fell to their destruction quickly, and people learned to make bottom heavy statues if they wanted them to last. Hence lots of photos of squat, bottom-heavy statues that sit stable on a shelf. No heads or arms, just enormous kneeling thighs for these paper weights. Many photos show the heads and arms broke off anyway.Those looking to be swept away by the mythic beauty of powerful goddesses will be disappointed. Those looking for Neolithic Europe as it really was will find it copiously filled with photographs and drawings."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: wordy","review":"The perfect example of critics falling in love with excessive writing. Supposedly, the sentences Whitehead constructs are beautiful works of art, but I was always taught to keep things concise and precise so the reader could follow the story. Not so here.

Some of the writing was inspired and creative, some was just contrived and for its own exposition, not the enhancement of the story.

Ah well, they can't all be a Franzen."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Henry Days","review":"Frankly, I was disappointed in this book. Many of the reviews I read raved about it, but I found it laborious and disconnected. While there were many instances of some very good writing, the overall story, if there is one, gets lost in meanderings of J..

He met many scholars and leaders, had access to many works, learned Arabic from the bedouin Arabs themselves, whom he lived with for some time.

Although having commentary can hinder/impede reading sometimes, it's not as bothersome as people make it out to be. It is better to have the commentary and not use it than not have it and use another text as reference. Lastly, this translation might not capture the essence of the Arabic Quran, it is one of the best translation you can find.

This edition contains extensive footnotes, with liberal alternative explanations of key passages from other leading Islamic scholars. Every surah also has a brief introduction into the historical context and/or the significance of the revelation.

I'm sure the classic novel upon which this is based is vastly better, and full of allegorical meanings. But this early 60s sci-fi got pretty quiet in places, and the production looks very cheap by modern standards. They did manage to get the look of modern flat screen TVs uncannily well, don't you think? People are actually still staring at those flat-screens today, just as the novel projected they would when books disappear. The dialogue and acting are wooden throughout. Be prepared for an artistic experience, just not a very entertaining one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing adaptation","review":"While the original book was not particularly well written, the theme is one of the more poignant and enduring in modern literature--often placed with the other great anti-totalitarian visions of dystopia 1984 and Brave New World.Sadly, the film adaptation conveys little of the original book's sense of urgency and seriousness. Between weak directing and uninspired acting, the final product is rather flat and unemotional, and there is very little one could honestly call \\"memoreable\\"--particularly if you have read the book. Worst of all, significant parts of the book (which is not that long to begin with) are cut out, making the story even more shallow, and the significantly altered ending is horrendous. The image of people milling around the woods reciting literature is one of a 60's experimental art film, rather than the realistic vision of dystopia Bradbury originally created."},{"rating":"2","title":"1960's future is old stuff in 2012","review":"My high school students watched this movie after reading The Lord of the Flies. Although, the story/film was great, the film is futuristic from an early 1960's perspective, but the problem was that everything that was futuristic in 1960 is old stuff in 2012. For example, their transportation (aerial trams) is commonplace today at all amusement parks and most major cities; and the same for large plasma screen televisions, and Skype. Therefore, the movie was a little boring to my students; consequently, to encourage their interest, I had my students identify items that were futuristic in the 1960's that we now use everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"REVISITED AND CONFIRMED A CLASSIC","review":"This film gets rapped a lot, and certainly went unappreciated upon its release. I recently bought a video and was astonished it was as good as it was. Nic Roeg's cinematopraphy is a stand out, and you can see his little red touches that presaged DONT LOOK NOW, and, honestly, its one of the more compelling films for me in the Truffaut canon. Of course, Julie Christie plays two parts, and I, admittedly, would pay to watch her sew a sweater. And Bernard Herrmann delivers an at turns icy and heartbreaking score. Yes, it is cold, but isn't it kinda cold in cyberspace, too, as they predicted it would be? I mean, can we really touch?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My classroom collection","review":"This is a welcome addition my my classroom collection of videos.

I also recommend \\"Two English Girls\\" and \\"Jules and Jim\\" as well. It's impossible not to think of the Heinrich Heine quote, \\"Where one burns books; one will soon burn people\\" while watching it. The inversion of a fire fighters who, rather than put out fires, start them was a very innovative idea on Bradbury's part. The main character is quite compelling and easily evokes our sympathy. This work is prescient and timeless. In today's talk show era, do books still not remain dangerous and subversive?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not oddly intriguing, just odd","review":"Many years ago, I wrote a book report on this Lame movie adaptation of a great book. It was pretty low-budget, and didn't follow the story well enough for me to like it. I still remember a Montag afraid of *the firepole*, and the cheap hover machines on strings swooping down after him. Two stars for at least ripping off a good plot in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to understand!","review":"I think that this movie was very hard to understand because of the characters' accents. The charaters in the movie hardly talked, but when they did, they talked very fast. The background of the story was good, but the movie wasn't. I really suggest that you read the book. I understand that it was made a long time ago, but I think that the special effects need to be updated by a director of this time making a new production of Fahrenheit 451, the movie. If you do not like reading, then you will get the basic idea of the story, but I strongly encourage you to read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak and oblique.","review":"Its an ok premise but its the weirdness that comes through more than anything else. And its oh so slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truffaut's darkest hour","review":"The Truffaut Taste Police can say what they like, but this film is an abomination. It's not only a poor adaptation of a great book, it's an insipidly mediocre film in its own right. I count \\"The 400 Blows\\" and \\"Jules & Jim\\" among my All Time Top Ten. But I still feel embarrassed for Truffaut every time I see this one. It tanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Idea of the Book","review":"A large fan of the book 451 may watch this movie in hopes for a deeper and more potent film, but be presented with a tangent. The book made the reader truely feel for the characters through simple dialogue, but the movie skewed from that and edited large important portions/characters/ideals from it's presentation. Though a movie is subjected to mpaa/budjects/deadlines it could have used them to thier advantage. Not to say this film is dissapointing, but it just doesn't feel right compared to the book.If someone asked me If I had seen the movie, I wouldn't be able to tell them I had, because I wouldn't quite want to put the creators down who did a moderate film, but as a fan of the book I would simply say I hadn't seen it - to prevent any explanations."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever made","review":"If you read one review for this movie, let it be mine. I don't know what sort of valium these other critics are on, but if you are a reasonable person you will abhorr Fahrenheit 451. They took Ray Bradbury's classic, and butchered it beyond all recognition. I have forgotten most of what happens (thankfully), but I will never be able to extract that dreadful music played during the firetruck sequences from my memory. To date, this has been the worst movie I have ever seen. To poor, even, to rent for a laugh. I suggest we take Cpt Beatty's advice for this one, and BURN IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A picture of indifference","review":"I saw this movie years ago and I felt very impressed; in spite of its defects it is still one of my favorites. Others seem to have disliked the movie's atmosphere, but in my opinion its pared-down and unsentimental style is one of its stronger points: I cannot think of a better description of a society pervaded by anomie. I read the book later and, though I liked the book well enough, I still liked the movie better. Many situations come across more powerfully in the movie than in the book, and the ending (which is quite different from the book) is one of the most beautiful and haunting things I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, but read the book, too!","review":"I bought the video to share with eleventh grade students who had read and discussed the novel. The film captures some of the symbolism of the book (having spoken credits at the beginning was a nice touch)but fails to deliver much of the science fiction that was part of Bradbury's horrific vision. I missed the mechanical tracking dog and Faber's earphones (and Faber, for that matter!), and the anti-war message was diluted. Still, the film entertains and provides a nice point of comparison for the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature vs. comic-book","review":"I saw \\"Fahrenheit\\" the first time when I was 12. I was entranced. I had never seen anything remotely like it before. This is science fiction film-making at it's best, a triumph of the human spirit. It is packed with many interesting and powerful scenes, wonderful and subtle acting, and thoughtful premises rarely seen on a sci-fi screen, and is infused with a lyricism and pathos that is as poignant and relevant today as it was in 1968 when the film was made. It proves that a movie doesn't have to cost 80 million dollars to create a lasting and profound impression, and that science fiction isn't just for children with high thresholds for lime-green gore. Absolutely classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When you start burning books...","review":"Oskar Werner plays Montag, a fireman in in the future who, like other firemen, is in charge of finding books and burning them. Julie Christie stars as his bored wife AND also plays the school teacher who he falls in love with. The school teacher, Clarisse, who also collects books!What happens when Montag himself becomes interested in the very books he is burning?I like this film. It's crisp, with sharp colors, and a great cast of actors, like Cyril Cusack who is also in the film version of '1984'. He is a GREAT bad guy.I also like the scenes in which, yes, you guessed it, they burn books. A rich, if twisted tale.Update: Got the DVD - Extras include Making Of, Commentary with Julie Christie and others, Photo Poster Gallery and more. 5 out of 5 for the DVD also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Dated","review":"It's time they made another updated movie version of this great book, because this movie version is terribly dated. I'm a teacher and I found this movie wouldn't even hold the attention of my 10th graders when we were studying the book.And another thing which mystifies me: Why did they pick an actor with a THICK German or some other undecipherable accent to lead? I don't get that.The special effects in this movie are almost non-existent (they simply cut out most of the parts in the book which would've required special effects, like the mechanical dog)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a look","review":"As with other reviewers here, I had not read the book before seeing this film, but I would recommend it on its own merits.

I have read a fair amount of history books that outline the things that men (and women) have to done to either advance the cause of man or destroy all hope.

The examples given are both plausible and easily understood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Concept, Tedious Execution","review":"I purchased this book because I love reading about history from different perspectives. I guess I was hoping for a Bill Bryson-esque treatment. This book is very academic and while it would undoubtedly be useful for someone doing a research project, it doesn't work as a purely educational read. The theses is very straightforward and the bulk of the book is composed of dry anecdotes and lists of names and dates.

Clemens (aka Rollins) does a great job at creating an interesting world and interesting cultures, societies and characters, and spins a unique mythology with territorily bound (or unbound and resultingly mad) gods and formulaic magics based on the bodily humours of these divinities. If you read his \\"the Banned and the Banished\\" series and didn't like it (I know I didn't,) don't hold it against the Godslayer Chronicles. The two books out so far are well written, coherent, and just plain awesome.

The gods themselves are classical Greek in their general character, able to mate with one another and with humans. They display the same interest as the Greek and Roman deities in messing around in human affairs. They are immortal in the same limited sense that the classical deities were.The Shadowknights, as another reviewer has commented, are not well-defined in this opening novel. They remain, as it were, shadows.Ultimately, I found the work disappointing. The characters were more chessmen moved around on the board than characters that captured the imagination and interest of the reader. Perhaps the strongly-worded blurbs from John Saul amd R. A.

I will not read more of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't start, he won't finish","review":"I love the series but if you notice, he wrote these in 2006 and hasn't done anything since.

As a reader-in-training, am collecting a variety of decks so clients can choose which deck they'd like me to read from. Have collected a few male-oriented decks so any male clients wouldn't feel as intimidated as they would if I brought out, say, a deck with flowers and faeries on it.

Much of the resulting album consists of little more than grunting and groaning as they all \\"get it on\\" with each other. Then, every once in a while, one of them remembers they're supposed to be making a \\"rap\\" album and starts semi-rhyming about glocks and \\"poppin' a cap in dat nigga's ass\\", at which point the others giggle knowingly.I'm not homophobic or anything, but frankly I found the entire thing disgusting and utterly out of step with what I understand rap to be all about.Next time, guys, get it all out of your system in a hotel room before you set foot in a recording studio. Remember, you are supposed to be bringing a positive message to the community about guns, whores, crack, and bling bling.

Nordic Nights was all of those things plus much more. It was full of suspense, humor and a terrific sense of place. I could practically feel the cold as she described it. The twisty plot kept me glued to the book until the very end. McClendon's characters jumped off the page and told the story to me, and I was entertained throughout the book. I highly recommend Nordic Nights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I'm hooked...","review":"Having read Nordic Nights, I now need to go find all the other Alix Thorssen books. She's a very likable and real character in an interesting location. McClendon has a real talent for describing people and places in an interesting manner. The book revolves around a winter festival in Wyoming -- and it made me homesick for real snow! The art gallery as the base of the plot was not \\"insider-ish\\" (something that's a turn-off for me, the whole \\"I know things you don't know\\" style of writing) but still educational. All in all, an interesting, fun read about someone I want to get to know better. (her brother too!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nordic Nights","review":"I sent all three of Lise's Alix Thorssen books to avid readers on my Christmas list. Everyone responded with positive comments. They were glad to have all three in their possession so they could continue the adventures non-stop. They compared them to the early Hillerman books. They thought the books were excellent gifts, which, of course, I liked hearing. Lise has the skill to keep the mystery alive throughout the book, keep the reader intrigued with the relationships among the characters, and throw in interesting, educational tidbits about the settings. After reading Nordic Nights, I was ready for the next Alix book. Unfortunately, I have to wait awhile until it comes out. Fortunately, Lise has another book soon out with a new strong, female lead character. I look forward to more of her stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing mystery","review":"This is an enjoyable mystery, with amusing information about Norwegian-American traits--though to be fair, the noted characteristics are more human than specifically Nordic. The book is an enjoyable bit of fluff. However, there were instances when I was not sure if something had been left out, such as location 889 of 6306 where a paragraph and sentence begin \\"paolo's sister\\" The first word of a sentence, a character's name, should be capitalized. Also, there appeared to be a break in the story which should have been indicated by a blank space. I assume there was poor proofreading done, an all too often criticism of Kindle books. Conversely, at location 1070 of 6306, a break in the novel is indicated by a space--yet there is no change in the scene. I'm not willing to go through the entire book listing these errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby, it's cold in Jackson Hole","review":"I won't waste your time by detailing the plot which others have commented on in their reviews.I'll just state that this is a good book. What's particularly well done is the setting. The reader gets a real feel for Jackson Hole and what it's like there in winter.Why I didn't give it 5 stars: Stephen King once said something to the effect that the formula for his books is that he puts his protagonist up in a tree and throws rocks at him. At the start of the book, McClendon does indeed put her heroine, Alix Thorson, up a tree when her stepfather is arrested for a crime he does not commit. The problem is that McClendon does not throw any \\"rocks\\" at Alix for almost the next third of the book as she concentrates on Alix's character. It would have been better if she had combined the two devices. However, I should state that once she does up the tension, the rocks come flying one after another, and the plot builds nicely.A good book and, better, it's free for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping!","review":"I sat down this evening to read a few chapters of this book because I was in the mood for a mystery, and then couldn't quit!

Understanding that this book only covered the basics, I was still disappointed. The outline of different training exercises was practical, but the notion that anyone could learn anything about stance; positioning and correct form from a book is simply stupid.This book seemed superficial and had that cash-in-rush-it-on-the-market feel. Not only that, but you can find ALL of the information contained in this book, on the net.

I feel sorry for the students who were in her region -- she obviously has a giant chip on her shoulder and does nothing more than glorify how much she looked down on them. Though the author asserts that this is not a book about how to get into college, that's certainly the market she's aiming for. Methinks she doth protest too much. She takes great pains to distance herself from \\"other\\" authors who write about the admissions process even though they do an infinitely more credible job and don't hide their motives as Toor does. As the reviewer above points out, there are much more informative books (A is for Admission, Writing the College Essay) than this one which is so offensive that it was hard to read through it at my local bookshop. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. What an ego-trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doubtful Objectivity; Not Carefully Written","review":"This book seemed to be too quick, too breezy and a little self-serving. It is always suspect when a former insider is revealing the goings-on in an environment that she las left and I felt that Ms Toor was more than a little superior-feeling and perhaps even bitter. The personal information did not seem to blend well with the rest of the book and I found it forced and not terribly interesting. Also, I saw one case in which she is talking about a student and changes mid-paragraph from \\"he\\" to \\"she.\\" If you are interested in this topic, I would recommend you read \\"The Gatekeepers\\" and \\"Bright College Years.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"More about the author than the process","review":"From a \\"former editor of scholarly books\\" I expected better. Instead of informative, I found this to be more an annoying autobiography of Toor herself (do we really need to know about her dating life or her pet pig?) with run-on monologues about the Duke admission process. I suspect that what little information this book had to offer could be summed up in a pamphlet, and is of interest mostly to prospective Duke applicants or alums."},{"rating":"1","title":"The person exposed in this \\"tell-all\\" book is the author.","review":"While styling her book as an honest, tell-all account of life in the admissions office of an elite university, Rachel Toor merely exposes her own smallness as a peson. She reveals her disdain for most of the applicants in the region for which she was responsible, building herself up by tearing them down. This book has such a nasty tone that I would not permit a college-bound senior to read it -- it is designed to create anxiety among even the most talented of kids. If you want the straight scoop on admissions to the elite schools, try \\"A is for Admission.\\" Rachel Toor appears to be on a major power trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"candid","review":"a fast read. some parts have value as an insight into admissions. the author almost comes across as at times somewhat mean and meanspirited.the book does have entertainment value.lousy picture in the dust jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't get into Duke...","review":"...just get over it and move on. It is possible that the woman hired by Duke to decide the path of the rest of your life was just too busy timing how many minutes (3 at last count) it too her pig to pee.How can anyone reviewing this book get past the author's relationship with her pig? Where was the editor? Were I to write a serious book of non-fiction, wishing to come across as a credible author, I would delete references to my deviant lifestyle. Is that just me, or is everyone sleeping with pigs because they are the \\"hypoallergenic\\" pet of choice?Perhaps there is some useful information between the covers pages of this book, but keep in mind that \\"between the sheets\\" with Ms. Toor, is her pig! This begs the question, is there any correlation between your life and your advice?While many admission process questions may go unanswered, you will be treated to the depth of Ms. Toor's love for Emma, the pig she sleeps with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing for people who want to go to a top college.","review":"After reading this book, I was conflicted on what kind of a score to give it. \\"Admissions Confidential\\" is by no means a guide on getting into the top schools. It is instead the author's perspective on what her life was like during the three years she worked at Duke's office of admissions. It is certainly worth reading.

In any case the finish and grind are very good. Above 3/8 the bits have hex flats growned in their shanks,. This could affect concentricity, but it also prevents slippage in a chuck. I like the hex shanks as they make a perfect accessory for todays keyless chuck drills. Now I bought this set from Amazon when they had a half price sale.

The government \\"agent\\" played by Michael Ironside (in one of his most effective recent roles) is planning on using Wincott to wipe out some people he says are dangerous to the government.The movie rests on the new Wincott: is he still the heartless, cold killing machine or does he really want to change and start a new life. There are some tense action scenes, good fights, and crisp direction. The ending is somewhat of a downer, and it caught me by surprise, but that's what takes this movie up a notch.

If you have these and some discipline, then this is the best way to take control of your own destiny.

I assumed the blades were dulling and it was time for a new one. When I went back to the store, they didn't have this brand any more and I bought a Finishing Touch model.

There isn't any of the glossed-over Hollywood imagery that so often accompanies anything to do with Montana these days. This novel is about the raw, hard sides of life not just in the west but everywhere else. It's sharp, compelling, and through a set of well-developed, unique characters tells a gripping story of love, loss, adventure and understanding. It weaves legend into contemporary life, using touches of magic realism without becoming a fantasy. It left me feeling haunted and at the same time satisfied. There is no doubt that The Last Buffalo Hunter is a remarkable accomplishment, more so because it is the writer's first novel.

I remember enjoying the voices in the English dub when I was younger, but then I was a kid - and therefore stupid - and I can imagine that they\`ll probably grate nowadays!I have to say I always enjoyed these six episodes far more than the original series. Maybe it was because the animation seemed a little cleaner, but I think it\`s more likely that the story was more engaging. Although the episodes may at first seem disjointed and unconnected, they actually form one whole story. The action is exciting, the characters (by the master of simultaneously intense and farcical characters, Masamune Shirow) are likeable, and the finale when they get their man is really satisfying.Highly recommended viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Dominion Collateral Damage","review":"I fondly remember having this on VHS back in the mid-90's; it's the 6-episode sequel to the late 80's 4-part \\"Dominion Tank Police\\" series.Though not as engaging as the first series, it does have it's merits, and for those who had a crush on the awfully bad-behaved Cat Sisters Anna and Uni Puma, they will be rewarded by many appearences of the badly (un)dressed duo throughout the story (I'm not sure if they're androids like in the manga, or modified humans--- there is a scene with them featuring opened cans of food at one stage, but no matter; they're still adorable/spiteful/mentally backward as ever).

Despite some poor reviews I saw on the web, I personally enjoyed the first one greatly, laughing aloud frequently. The second version struck me as typical Saturday morning garbage--lacking in humor, personality and utterly boring. I'll go into the differences here:New Dominion does not follow Shirow's art style, uses a generic rock soundtrack, forgettable voice acting, poor animation and lacks both any ties to the story in Shirow's manga, any visual similarity to the setting (polluted air, organic-looking buildings/city), and completely lacks the over the top humor of the manga, and almost completely misses the personalities created by Shirow.

I know everyone is going to make the comparison to Giger - fine get over it. Beksinski and Giger are as different as Van Gogh and Dali. No one has come along with this, this ... look(?) in art for a long time. It is the type of art that is going to be on book covers, but it is much greater than that. I would like to see a biography on him, as he has the tragic life of an artist. He was murdered in 2005 and his son committed suicide.

Read that book and you are set with much of what he has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Income Increase","review":"Using his trademark direct style, Alan creates a valid case for value based fees. As a result of this book I immediately adopted a value based system. The results so far: One client paid double what I would have proposed previously. Another client agreed to 400% increase. Focusing on output rather than input sounds simple, but you must have confidence. Alan provides that as well. He not only shows you how to determine your fees, but why YOU can and should use this approach. A must read and apply resource for all consultants, speakers, and coaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start charging what you're worth--today!","review":"This book is an absolute 'must-have' for any consultant who wants to dramatically increase sales, profits and fees.

Written in Alan's inimitable style, \`Value-Based Fees' is engaging, inspiring and loaded with down-to-earth, real-life examples, plans, guidelines and instructions to launch your income into the stratospheric range. Whether you want to jumpstart your consulting career, or boost an already solid consulting business to a totally new level--you will want to get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have high payed friends, join them.","review":"I would agree that Alan is a very good sales person, \\"selling his books\\". But I would have to say that the ideas or suggestions he has for \\"value based fees\\" ( VBF ) takes advantage of friendship on corporate business. It's hard to understand \\"I think you are undercharging me, increase your proposal by a third\\". Alan probably is very lucky and/or is surrounded by very nice business people with money to burn. I need those business people next to me!No doubt that he gives good advice but to apply VBF is a win win or loose loose situation.

And the extra tracks particularly Kentucky Rain I love. Elvis is very energized and puts on a good show. The only bad thing is the re-mastered copy of this CD toned down the instruments too much. You no longer can hear ronnie tutt's awesome dumms as well as on the orginial. And James Burton's guitar playing is awesome but also very quiet which makes performances like Polk Salad Annie and Release Me far less powerful then the original. I would stil buy this CD due to the extra tracks I just wish they wouldn't have toned down the instruments so much. This CD does not come close to comparing to disk 2 of the new That's The Way it is box set. There is an example of a good mix and a great and complete show. But if you don't want to spend the money for the three CD set this is a pretty good compelation of his Las Vegas work."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELVIS IN COMEBACK PRIME!","review":"This re-release of Elvis On Stage with bonus songs showcases Elvis in his prime following the '68 comeback special and the Memphis recordings. The remix is excellent and makes the songs sound fresh and new. Especially when comparing it to my old phono record. I was especially delighted with his rendition of \\"Long Tall Sally\\". It is fast and rocking! For some reason, following 1970, Elvis never sounded quite as committed and intense. He had a kind of raspy rocking vocal delivery in '69 and '70 that I never heard again in later live albums. It is just this intensity that Elvis brings to the material on this CD.

Even the title, \\"God is the gospel\\", makes you stop and scratch your head. What? What does that mean? Well, it means God's goal is to have us realize the pursuit of Him is the ultimate joy in life. There, I just gave you the theme of this book.By the way, I'm reformed and think John Piper's work on Romans is probably the best I've ever heard.

He has creativity, a way with words, humor, and a way of connecting with free-spirited readers. YSKOV can be abstract and strange at times, and you might not understand what you're reading, or might want to look further into what you're reading so you do understand it. I think it's hit or miss with readers. Give it an hour to see if you enjoy his style, and if not, move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"great entertainment","review":"Poignant and extremely funny, this is even better than AHWOSG.

Appropriately enough, I read most of it on the crapper. Had it been printed on toilet paper it might've been good for something.

It is indeed sad that something this bad merits publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice paper..crappy story","review":"This book is printed on lovely thick paper. That is about the highest compliment I can muster. I have only managed to read 160 pages, but I'm not sure I'll waste my time finishing. This book is nothing like AHWOSG. Do not buy this book if you are expecting a similar experience. Buy this book if you feel like owning a book printed in Iceland. Yahtzee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Staggering Work of Heartbreaking Genius","review":"I still have chills from this book. Never since Kerouac has a simple story of life and a trip seemed so alive, so real. This book is a true piece of art, every line carefully crafted to make you stop and think and apply it to yourself. I recommend this book to any hopeless wandering romantic, or anyone who wishes they were. Please read it! It might change your perceptions, or if not, it will at least make you look deep within the core of your humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, get an editor","review":"I think Eggers is a really good (sometimes fantastic) writer, but I also think he needs some help paring things down and coming up with a book that doesn't grind you down. I've read both his books and scanned them at the end. I sometimes think he's playing games, seeing what he can get the critics to buy into. I can't believe the hype surrounding his books, the awestruck accolades. I doubt that half those critics ever made it through the books. I'll leave it at that, because I agree with most of the negative commentary on previous posts. Eggers is an excellent writer in spurts, but I think he's a bit (ok, a lot) arrogant and needs a good editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who ever said this guy was all that great??","review":"I have read both of Egger's books and I appreciate the freshness of his voice, but his 'cleverer-than-thou' rants are self-indulgent. It's interesting for awhile but can't be sustained for more than half of the book. A plot would be nice. His writing style reminds me of Douglas Coupland, author of Generation X. It's interesting, but will seem juvenille and self-absorbed with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"Eggers is a genius. Don't expect this to show up next to Da Vinci Code on a bestseller list though. Apparently nowadays people care quite a bit about plot, and while this book certainly has a plot, and a very good one at that, it is entertaining in a very very different way. This is real literature here, folks. If you like multiple layers of meaning, read this. But if you're stuck on books that read like action films, maybe this isn't for you. Then again, if you enjoy honest, sincere literature that celebrates life and makes tired and mundane things seem new again, maybe you should read this after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"You shall know Dave Eggers","review":"Dave Eggers will win the Nobel Prize someday if they decide to award smugness. He is the master of being self-effacing, and at the very same time self-indulgent. He wants both sympathy and adulation. Dave Eggers should run for political office instead of write.Eggers engages in what I call \\"prose babble\\" which is very common among today's writers. Prose babble is a disease that has brought American Literature to its grave. He does not know how to write well, as much as talk well, and then write down how he talks. So essentially you get a first-person talk-a-thon novel rather than a written novel. Things like economy, vocabulary, and style are gone from these works. But you got a good friend talking to you, but you may not want to hear him go on and on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"suprisingly disappointed","review":"After reading Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius I was expecting this book to be a great entertainment, however, I was greatly disappointed. Even though most people gave it great reviews, I know I am not alone in thinking this book sucked. It was hard for me to finish this book because I was waiting for something interesting to happen. It has plenty of random things in the story that make it somewhat humorous but nothing of substance. I guess the point was to create a book that does not have to say anything (breaking conformity so to speak) but I didn't enjoy it here. So disappointed in fact, that I sold the book immediately after finishing it. I will say it is unique but definitely not interesting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this review","review":"And if you're investigating this book on the advice or recommendation of a friend or news article, don't read the other ones either. It's always unfortunate when a book based on simple but beautiful ideas and executed with creative, sometimes enlightening writing gets passed over because a few bored amateur wordsmiths think the Review section is for book reports.If someone you know told you would like this novel, buy it.One other note: I as raised as a global nomad. If you know what that means, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are many books more worthy of consideration!","review":"I would have given 0 stars if possible. A real time-waster - I am loathe to set aside any book that I have paid for without completing it, but I could not justify spending any more time on this book once I struggled gamely through the first half, hoping that things would improve. Two young men of obviously impaired intelligence stumbling around the world without a clue - very sad. Tons of irrelevant detail mislead you into thinking there might be some depth to this meandering tale. Then one of these pathetic fools says, \\"Wait a minute, everything you've read so far is a senseless lie, here's my take on the truth that is equally boring and idiotic.\\" At this point you've just got to say \\"WHO CARES???!!!\\" and go find a decent book to read. If you buy this book, don't say I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Shall Know Mediocrity","review":"Let me begin by saying the title of my review is being generous. If anything, at least Eggers managed to include some funny and interesting observations. There was the occasional flourish of beautiful writing, like when he compares the waves against a person's hands to a soft kiss or the sadness associated with cleaning out someone's storage unit. But beyond these few moments, there really is nothing here. Is this anywhere near \\"On the Road\\" as LA Weekly says? Not even close. Does Eggers stand now with Joyce and Bellow as Entertainment Weekly states? Um...No. Did these people even read the book? Or maybe they did and that makes the positive reviews this got all the more scary. If this is where literature is heading, then I'm getting off the bus now. I'll spare you any details concerning the plot, because that is oddly interesting and you you may as well read the first 30-40 pages to learn about it. Afterwards, give the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Hated the central gimmick!","review":"I love some of Eggers' other books, and perhaps that's why I'm so disappointed by this one. In the paperback YSKOV, Eggers inserts a second narrator who contradicts the primary narrator, then returns us to the primary. It's a fun gimmick for him, I'm sure - or an interesting classroom exercise. I wasn't that into this one anyway, but it destroyed the book for me. I thought about tossing it aside, but kept going for some reason. Thumbs down unless you enjoy gimmickry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eggers reigns again","review":"This is a great read with many of the Eggerisms we come to expectbut, in my opinion, it does not come near to \\"A Heartbreaking Work\\" which is about as perfect a piece of writing as ever you will find. How Dave could top this is hard to imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but self-indulgent and ultimately boring","review":"One thing really drove me crazy about this book.There are these little pictures inserted into the text from time to time. Which is fine. But at one point, the main character describes seeing three new cream-colored Broncos. And then there are these little pictures of three little trucks in the text.Problem? Well, first of all, the little pictures are actually Mercedes M-Class SUVs. And secondly, Ford stopped making Broncos well over a decade ago.Eggers, if you don't know anything about cars, don't write about them. The Car-Nerds are watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the quintessential generation novel","review":"It is rare that boastings like a perfect combinat��on of Kerouac and Salinger is true, but in this case it is.Mr Eggers is a funny and engaging writer. I counted and found a funny quirk every four lines in the beginning of the book.Mostly it tramples a cogenial middle ground of the funny and the sad making it tragically funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new literary hero","review":"Dave Eggers who gave us a breakthrough masterpiece in A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, is back with a wildly original whirlwind You Shall Know our Velocity. In the tradition of Kerouac's On the Road, Egger's tale of two friends journeying around the globe in a frenetic act of benevolence is set among a cast of perfectly imagined characters. Making us focus not on the acts but on the warm=hearted humanity of Will and Hand, despite their clumsy methods,is a rare talent of Mr. Eggers. A joy from cover to cover, You Shall Know.. is a brilliant sophomore effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that eyestrain for naught...","review":"Frankly, I'm still ticked at having wasted however many hours of my life it took to read YSKOV! (and does anybody else find the exclamation mark as pretentious as all get-out?) The original hardcover was fascinating: I'd never seen a book in such a hurry to get started that the text began right on the cover. This was a guy I could get to like. Problem was, I bought the later paperback edition in an effort to save a few dollars. If you're still curious, do yourself a favor and spring for the original hardcover--it's a good deal less bloated. Were there brilliant pages/paragraphs? Sure. Too bad they were so interspersed with self-indulgent, pseudo-self-deprecating, unfunny filler as to nearly ruin the book. I spent the first 100 pages or so enchanted and the last several hundred wishing he and his friend would just go home already."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful","review":"veryhard to beleive this endless story is by the same author who wrote his other engaging novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the Only One Who Thought This Book Was Crazy?","review":"My book club read this novel.

I am a mature woman who found these two young men hopelessly dangerous. Almost every decision they made was senseless. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone over thirty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No This simply won't do","review":"Eggers, my friend, go to writing school. Your writing style is unpleasant and verbose. Not that writing programs can fix your immeasureable lack of talent, but they could at least show you what a good story looks like. And you should really try to read a book once a while that hasn't been written by one of your friends. Your atrocius writing leads me to believe that your reading habits extend only to the works of your fellow hipsters, in which case you should really try to remedy that with a thorough reading of the classics. Also, your titles are pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but far from classic.","review":"I liked this book but it could have used a once over by an editor, eliminating some typos & cutting about 200 pages.

The result here is an egocentric mangled mush of smarmy lines.Amazon reviewer \\"The Forth World\\" sums up the story pretty well, but I gave the book the two stars because, like a few other reviewers here, I found the writing style trite and annoying.The catch to my review is that I only got 20 or pages into the book, and I already knew everything about the story that \\"The Fourth World\\" said.Yes, it's THAT predictable. I then scanned through the rest of the book, and decided I couldn't take 300 more pages of glib, self indulgent turns like that \\"...using my brain as a coffeemaker\\" line.

I will admit that this is the weakest of her collections (though it would be hard to top Tell Me and The Philosopher's Club). Even so, it is great work, especially \\"First Kiss\\" and \\"Stolen Moments\\" which are classic Addonizio. Also of note are \\"Dear Reader\\" and \\"Fever Blues\\" and \\"California Street\\" which is definitely one of the best in the book. She also writes a well done sonnenizio (it's explained in the book) and a very workable paradelle. I can never say enough good about the work of Kim Addonizio, and her latest collection is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"old-time model","review":"This model comes in cast metal pieces and must be assembled and painted.

I wouldn't call this 'pop-rock', more along the line of progressive rock, at least. Unlike the previous Wire albums, this makes great use of electronics, along with other non-punk instruments (which, needlessly to say, is not just guitars and percussion). I think this is sort of the kind of album Wire have always wanted to make, or maybe even been destined to make (no one can listen to 154 or Chairs Missing, or Document & Eyewitness for that matter, and not see the shift). Fans of Pink Flag will probably stay away from this one, just because this isn't a punk album, per se. Listening to this, I really feel more a fan of Colin Newman than just Wire, and I hope to get more of his solo work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information you wouldn't already have.","review":"While not poorly written you will find yourself skipping pages in this book.

Sure, it's full of all kinds of life lessons, environmental warnings, poignant introspection and blah blah blah. But, the satire wasn't lost on me and I think it's absolutely hysterical. I enjoyed every moment of it. I haven't stopped talking about it to family and friends.

I found the characters to be shallow, unsympathetic stereotypes. There was a wealth of images he could have followed through on: weather changes, species extinction, human (and animal) disease, and he left it all undeveloped. He did show a skill for weaving metaphors, however, and some were fascinating. I will try his short stories, as someone suggested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, but sloppy writing","review":"I've never read anything by TC Boyle before this book, so I can't compare this book with his previous works. However, I don't think you have to be familiar with his work to know that his writing seemed sloppy and rushed in \\"A Friend of the Earth.\\" Boyle's writing style is flowery and verbose, and I think he should spend more of that energy on developing more of the characters and tidying up his storylines. None of these characters seemed worth caring about because they are so flat. I barely cared about the protagonist. I will say that I enjoyed reading about what Southern CA is like in the year 2025, and all of the descriptions of climate changes, erosion, and extinct animals.

Virtual everything is bad at the beginning and goes downhill from there. There are times you want to grab the protagonist by the collar and shake some sense into him. All that is probably very intentional. Did I enjoy it ? Not one bit.There are definitely things to recommend about this book.

The main theme of the album deals with his responses and expansions on 9/11, but donft expect any bold commentary or outright opinions. Straightforward and dictative, he is not.

It's okay. She only plays with it for a little and really only likes the button on the microwave. But at age 3 (the minimum age for this toy!!), she is much better off with a larger kitchen so she doesn't have to squat down. Her imagination is also beyond this toy. I kinda find the toy annoying bc it goes on and on before stopping finally. The stickers already fell off and the cookies are small enough to entirely fit in the child's mouth but too large to easily get out by a 3 yr old!! She can't swallow them but it was gagging her repeatedly until I was able to get it out of her mouth. Needless to say, we don't use the cookies. But the others seem fine.

I will admit that the ages listed for this toy are 3-8 and my kids aren't that old, but my son mows with Mike and vacuum's with Dusty every time I do, so I took the chance. Out of respect for the ages listed I will put the kitchen and Bobby Q in the closet for a few months and see if my son likes them better after he turns 3!!

Musically, The Cranberries show influences from 80's Brit Pop like The Smiths and Depeche Mode as well as more rootsy artists like Fleetwood Mac on this album.

Like Wallace Stegner and David Guterson, Mr. Doig's feeling for the land is aparent in his careful and lovely descriptions. Most of all, he presents us with characters so well developed and described we feel we know them.

It's a brilliant concept to begin with, and one that only Westerfeld could ever have come up with. The book begins with an ordinary girl, and as she learns of her new life in the \\"secret hour\\", so do the readers along with her, providing a unique and relatable point of view. While the first novel of the series sets up for an amazing plot to come, on its own, it's nothing special. The writing, particularly the descriptive portions, is at times sloppy and weak, and too much of the focus is put on Jessica (although you do get to know and love all of the other characters as well). Nevertheless, it's worth working your way through, if only for the fact that the next two books will blow your mind.Rating: 3.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"kept me guessing","review":"Usually I can guess fairly early on what the secret is in a book.

The basis of all nightmares is awake and moving around with them. These nightmare creatures usually leave the humans alone, but when the fifth person (new in town) arrives, they come out of the shadows after her and they definitely mean harm.

Students can read and respond to the ideas and opinions about education on this book. This book has also shown me that most of all the teachers actually do care about students'. I found out that what Holt says is true in many cases. Holt says that all teachers teach students the same way and some students learn but not the other students because the teacher doesn't know how to teach them the right way. After reading this book, I asked myself a question: why do the teachers let themselves get tapped by the same tricks they used with their teachers when they were going to school?"},{"rating":"2","title":"teachers book","review":"I think this is a must read book for every preschool teacher because this book will teach them what they did not learn in training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for teachers, homeschooling parents","review":"Holt analyzes the classroom situation--in detail--taking care to think of the children, where they are coming from, decoding their emotions, understanding their fears. This reads more like a case study than an essay; Holt watches and records, speculating about why the children respond as they do in certain situations. Most of us don't have the patience to sit and watch, but he's done this meticulously, kept records, than allowed us to see. I found it difficult to argue with his conclusions because they followed so naturally from the incidents he observed. This book provides an opportunity for educators to rethink their procedures, and mandates that we consider the children first. The level of detail may be too much for the casual reader, but this is excellent material for anyone who works with children."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Children Fail","review":"I am a college student at Macon State College majoring in elementary education. I am currently enrolled in EDUC 1000, the Introduction to Elementary Education. At the beginning of this semester we were assigned to choose an educational book. I chose How Children Fail, and I think I really did make a good choice. As I started reading, I was not very interested because of the format of the book, the journal entries. I continued reading and began to enjoy the book more and more. As I reached the summary at the end, I was able to put all of the information I had read together and it seemed to make more and more sense. After all, I really did enjoy reading this book. It enabled me, as a future educator, to see what I can do for my future students so they will not fail. I want to make a difference in the lives of my students, so I feel that by reading this book and other educational books, I will be able to gain knowledge that I will need to know as a future educator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Some","review":"I believe that John Holt's book, How Children Fail, is a great tool for teachers who don't have a clue about teaching. It goes into too much detail in some parts about how different children learn and how the teacher can help those children. The book is good for students who are going into teaching, while for others it just drags on. With re-writing the book, Holt looked back at what he said previously and explained how teaching styles changed. Over all, read How Children Fail if you're interested in learning why your child or you yourself can't learn. Not a good book for just free time."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Children Fail","review":"Our opinion about John Holt's book is very two sided because he talked mostly about what he observed in his own way about students. John Holt was very pointless on many occasions about what he was writing about in How Children Fail. Why couldn't he write something positive about children on why they fail? Some children have different learning styles and that's why some fail. The book in our opinion needed to have a different topic and have some other meanings to it because he never talked about what type of things that children can do to make them stop failing and what type of teachings that they can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Children Fail","review":"This is a very good book for Special Education classes. However, I found it a very poor book because it was very repetitive and detailed. It would talk about Cuisenaire rods and detail different ways to use them on many different days as well as making it sound like they spent hours on just that activity. There was also a balance beam idea that was good. The book was written in the form of daily notes and not chapters and was just very hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive and Negative","review":"In John Holt's book How Children Fail,he speaks about the positive and the negative of the school system. Some of what he said was useful and some not. This book was written in the 1960s so a lot of things have changed. Overall this book was a good book that taught me alot about ways to make children learn better. This book should be recommended to parents and teachers becasue it explains ways to get inside of the child's mind and understand how it works.It's easier to teach children more now with new technology and greater resources so some of what John Holt said is out of date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory Card Still Works With Phone After 5 Years (2007-2012)","review":"I think the review title says it all.

A small, juicy, masterpiece by Jack Ford has been cut from the original 1,33:1 format to 1,85:1. We are left only with the small consolation to deplore it. More: we have been deprieved of the real product for HOW LONG?. Shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Wayne","review":"This movie was all about the military character John Wayne was portraying. Not so much about airplanes. I was disappointed there were not more airplanes. It's all about Army vs. Navy, I did not relate to it too well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for small pets","review":"I got this gate to keep my dwarf bunny from entering my living room when she's running around outside her cage. Since the doorway was so large, conventional gates were too small to cover it and larger gates had holes too big to contain my bunny. Overall, this gate has worked very well--it has even withstood the gnawing of my bunny. The only problem I had is that the gate gets shorter the longer it's stretched, which can be a big problem for a bunny that can jump over anything lower than 2 feet! Regardless, I haven't had any problems with the gate. I highly recommend it for people with small pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Diet product","review":"I purchased this liquid for a diet program and have been very happy with it.

After trying many brands and being disappointed, finally found the KAL liquid and hit pay dirt. I will not purchase any other brand! In restaurants I am often asked what it is. This leads to a sales presentation to anyone interested. No, I am not a paid rep, just an ordinary citizen that loves this product. It travels with me in my purse! Also, keep extra bottle at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love stevia! Good product at a good price","review":"I love stevia and think it has a pleasant taste, without that artifical sweetener aftertaste. This product is great for adding a few drops to tea, coffee, drizzle a few drops over some berries and yogurt, etc. It's pretty sweet so you don't need a lot to get sweetness. The only comment I would make is that I've used the Now brand liquid Stevia before, which has a thicker consistency and I like that consistency because it's a bit harder to overdose when the liquid takes a bit of get out of the dropper! This liquid stevia is like water and it's easy to get too much. Otherwise, a really good product at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Stevia in powdered form is very, very sweet. a dusting over tea is fine. I hesitated to try is droper form as I thought that it would oversweeten too easily. This produt is not that concentrated. Easier to control, but more expensive than the powder. Stevia is the bomb for sweeteners. meow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect sweetner!","review":"I just love this as a sweetner, natural, and tastes great! The liquid is so easy to use, and this size works for my purse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I love stevia...it's really helped me keep my weight in check and overall improved my health and addiction to sugar. I always get the alcohol free liquid stevia and this brand along with another one are the ONLY ones I will use. I always have stevia on me at all times and use it daily. Coffee, tea, oatmeal, whatever...it's amazing! I highly recommend it, especially to those who want to curb their addiction to sugar, drop weight, be healthier, and/or for diabetics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweetening disappointing","review":"It may be a good health supplement but I bought it primarily for using it as a healthy sweetener (I am diabetic).

Big let down.","review":"There is no smoke or burger taste at all in this. This was a big let down. There is an overwhelming bean taste. Reminds me of Hot dog chili without the chili powder.

NR - 2008In the recent years I have grown fond of anything made by BBC and this film is good example of why. This is the fourth major film version of the novel by John Buchan, with Hitchcock's original being the most well known. The story revolves around Richard Hannay who is given a notebook that contains Germany's secret plan to start World War I. After being framed for murder, Hannay must get the notebook to the Secret Service all while being chased by the cops and the Germans. The movie is a perfect blend of action, suspense and humor with that classic British touch.Don't be a pillock and buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is an utter desecration of the original. As you watch this, you can hear the scriptwriter and director thinkging, \\"OK, this is going to be a really cute scene,\\" \\"Oh, this is going to get the viewers all hot and bothered,\\" and \\"It doesn't matter how many times people have seen these phony coincidences and plot contrivances, we can still sell it to someone.\\"Avoid, avoid, avoid. Watch the original. Then, if you really must, watch this one and tell me I'm not 100 percent right.This works like a comic book for 14-year olds. I give it one star because the two leads are pretty faces, and the guy who plays Scudder is fantastic. Unfortunately, he dies in the first scene. The rest is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several Steps too Few","review":"I am really fond of mysteries, but I like for them to be at least plausible. If you don't mind stories with gaps too large to connect, then you might enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice British update of a very old story","review":"If you like English countryside mysteries, this is right up your alley. Like an Agatha Christie story, this has characters you would expect, spies, clues, and hunts.Rupert Penry-Jones is very good, and all the acting is top notch. I enjoyed him in MI-5, and am not disappointed with his performance in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb movie","review":"This movie started out fine. It seemed to have a good plot and held my attention for about the first 15 minutes but went down hill from there. I don't know why I hung in there through the whole thing other than to say without a doubt the plot got thinner and thinner and the ending is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Original is FAR FAR Better","review":"Everything that the original, Hitchcock-directed version was, this modernized piece of rubbish is not: suspenseful, unpredictable, credible, well-acted, well-written. The lucky breaks, the hokey lines, the obvious manipulation in this version were insulting, as if it were the film version of a comic book. This borrowed, not merely from the original, but every stale idea in the book of romantic spy fiction moviedom. I even felt cheated on the scenery of Scotland, with some very poorly done painted backdrops.If you haven't seen the original, do yourself a favor and don't spoil it by watching this prosaic and mediocre copy. It reeks of hack dumbness, and made me feel embarassed for the makers, it was that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky Fun","review":"Expected this to be a typical suspense-filled drama, but it was more along the lines of intelligent fun.

No Limit is a very hot RAP label, but it's other 2 r&b acts i liked very much (Sons Of Funk, and Mo B. Dick). But Mercedes album has been \\"coming soon\\" for almost 3 years! i would have bet my life that it was never coming out. And i never even heard her on any other No Limit albums before. But i'm very glad i got it! She has one of the sexiest voices out there, especially when she sings, but she can rap quite well also. There's only about 2 songs that i dont like, all the rest are HOT!! My favorite song is \\"Pony Ride\\". Also my other favs. are \\"Hit Em\\", \\"I Can Tell\\", and \\"Do You Wanna Ride\\". This isnt typical No Limit music. But if you like rap and r&b combined, get this! you wont be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hott Album!","review":"This album is tight!

Most people who buy Counting Crows music already have all their c.d.'s, except for those who only bought AAEA and left when the band changed their style on RTS. Between those two albums we got a double live disc filled with very different recordings of our favorite songs. Why not give a similar treatment to Hard Candy and This Desert Life, along with some of the songs left of that first live disc. Instead we get a bunch of songs we already have, one cover and two old songs they finally decided to put on a record. In addition, these are mostly the songs that failed to generate requests on the radio. No one remembers This Desert Life for Hangin' Around. Even if you're just barely getting into the band, buy the albums one at a time, or even the live album Across A Wire, don't give into this bands first attempt to just make some money"},{"rating":"2","title":"A collection of great music.","review":"While I do believe owning \\"August And Everything After\\" is a must, this is a great collection for fans old and new. Sure it's missing a few favorites, specifically \\"Murder Of One\\", but what's here is all wonderful. It not only includes the hits like \\"Mr. Jones\\", \\"A Long December\\", \\"Hanginaround\\", and \\"American Girls\\", but it also has the favorites \\"Round Here\\", \\"Omaha\\", and \\"Einstein On The Beach (for an eggman)\\". Plus it's got covers of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\", \\"Friend Of The Devil\\", and the new track \\"She Don't Want Nobody\\". Overall, it's a great 16 songs, in a nice little package. \\"Adam Duritz\\" may not have become \\"Bob Dylan\\", but there's no doubt that they're one of the best bands of the last decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs taken out of context","review":"Yes, these are all great songs. Anyone who knows Counting Crows knows of most if not all of these hits. However, the appeal of the band is that they produce albums that hang together as whole works, and by taking these songs out of their original context and placing them haphazardly next to one another here, much of their magic is lost.So don't buy Films about Ghosts, buy August and Everything After and introduce yourself properly to one of the great bands of the 90s. Then enjoy it so much you buy all the rest as well. Maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of it is nice.","review":"This album is essential for any Counting Crows fan, however, I was saddened because my favorite song by them, \\"Colorblind\\" wasn't on there. I would reccomend it, but the only songs I really listen to/like are: Round Here, Rain King, A Long December Hangin around, Mr. Jones, American Girls and She don't want nobody near."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a bland pop record.","review":"At one time people compared them to Van Morrison and The Band, but sadly it's been almost 10 years since they've released anything worth a damn. What happened to those guys who released August and Everything After in '93?"},{"rating":"2","title":"They converted another WF fan","review":"I first herd about the Counting Crows through the band \\"The Wallflowers\\". I figured if the toured together the CC can't be bad. I had never heard any of the CC songs in till I first put the CD. The first time I played it I skipped around. I finally listen to the CD the whole way through at 4 in the morning at a friends house when i could not sleep. I will remember the dark seemed perfect for playing it. This is a CD I am glad I bought. With upbeat songs like Hanging around that made me sing along to the slow Long December. In each of the songs the CC seemed to capture my moods. They have a song in the CD for every emotion you could be feeling. It's one of the few CD's you can get in to I found myself singing along to \\"American Girls\\" on the bus. If you were to buy one CD this year let it be Films About Ghosts"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been Counting Crows since I got this album","review":"I was never a \\"real\\" fan of Counting Crows before seeing them in concert this summer. I had the songs \\"A Long December,\\" \\"Mr. Jones,\\" and \\"Colorblind\\" in my collection. This \\"greatest hits\\" album is a great way to experience the band without buying their myriad of CDs, if you can't afford them. Some of them are old favorites, including two of the three mentioned above. Some were new to me, including \\"American Girls\\" and \\"Einstein on the Beach (For an Eggman),\\" both of which I had never heard before and now really enjoy. I would suggest, however, that you do purchase \\"Colorblind\\" separately, because it is one of their best songs and is not included in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Masterpiece","review":"A huge Counting Crows fan, I was delighted when my brother bought Films About Ghosts the other day. I immediately fell in love with the new song She Don't Want Nobody Near. The entire CD is perfect - the only fault perhaps being that there are so many more of their songs that you want to add on there as well. Such a talented band, Counting Crows is unparalleled in the music business and their lyrics are wonderful! Buy this CD - you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking me to back in the day","review":"Most people liked the Counting Crows at some point or another. For mean this CD ( which my good buddy Steven sent out to me) reminds me of like grade 8, when I thought I would be a great singer. I remember singing at the top of my lungs to Mr. Jones and not caring who coudl hear me. This CD is great for that.. Long car rides or getting ready in the morning and singing to your heart's content.There are also a lot of songs that I didn't remember they did which they did and I really likeed. This is good mellow CD to listen to at work or get depressed with."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF THEIR BEST WORKS!","review":"This is a very well selected and comprehensive collection of Counting Crows best works. If you're looking for all their best in one place, or just want one album of all their hits, this is the CD to get. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"substance and soul","review":"a solid overview by a band that captures real emotion with their music. The songwriting is strong and the special energy of the band comes through on so many of these songs. I caught them live last night (HOB charity event in Dallas for Mike Modano foundation) and it's refreshing to see how well these songs have held up through the years. Each song tells a different story. There is substance and soul present that is sorely missing from most \\"pop\\" music these days. This band proves enduring and continuously satisfying.Long live Counting Crows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate pet manual","review":"I have almost 50 pets, so I do a lot of reading on my special friends. This book is my favorite book about rats. I recommend it each time I sell a rat at the pet store I work at. It is wonderful to have on hand as a reference and to read just for fun. The chapters on health care and training are especially well done. Anyone who loves ratties should have this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the book!","review":"This book is great for the beginning rat person. It has very good and current information, excellent pictures, and is easy to read. The section on different markings and coat types is quite informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita's Most Depressing Novel Yet!","review":"I've read most of Brookner's novels. I've recommended her work to others, but I cannot recommend this book. Her characters are often passive but the two women in The Bay of Angels excel at inertia. Brookner's beautiful style doesn't compensate for how very depressing this novel is. The women in this book can't seem to DO anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another terrific study of women","review":"Brookner is known for her deep burrows into the minds of serious British women. Not much happens in any of her books, but the reader does learn of the motivation of each of her characters and their relationships. This is a slow read, but rich in insight. Zoe is finishing high school when this book begins, and lives alone with her widowed mother. The mother is the most passive character I've ever encountered, but is introduced, and subsequently is married to (notice the passive voice), a man who makes her life, and Zoe's, quite comfortable. Of course, he dies. A mere 200 pages, this book will haunt me for a while, because I have come to know Zoe and her mother so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"reading this book is like eating plastic","review":"This is the first book by this author I've ever read, and it'll be the last. I had to grit my teeth to get through to the end. The narrator rambles on and on and on about her pathetic boring life, and everything is always about her. It seems that she expects everyone else to take care of her: her step father should have left her and her mother more money when he died (the flat and the bank accounts he gave her obviously weren't good enough); the doctors should have paid her more attention, both in and out of the hospitals; the proprietor should have been kinder; her mother should have taken care of herself; the stepfather's nephew should have let her stay in the house... Even in the end, she never learned to stand on her own feet. What a sorry existence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I used to be a huge fan of Brookner. In fact I have read every book but one, her very latest. I don't know if I will read it. Perhaps I am outgrowing her, but \\"Bay of Angels\\" was not only one of the worst Brookner I have read, but one of the worst books I have read. It was hard work, with no reward, and I never believed in the characters. If you want to read Brookner at her best, try \\"Dolly\\" or \\"Look at Me\\" or \\"A Closed Eye\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, What a Dreary Little Book","review":"What a tiresome trudge it was to get through this slim book. In a mere 220 or so pages the writer manages to repeat the same boring, navel gazing tosh several times over. The Bay of Angels has nothing of any interest to say and the ennui filled mood of the characters and plot did nothing positive for me. Anita, your characters need to get a life! (I would have liked to give this book zero stars.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was terrible. Ruminations disguised as a novel. This is my second Anita Brookner novel (after Hotel du Lac). I know plot is not her forte, but this entire novel felt like the underpinning for a novel, not the novel itself. (Plus, the woman is rescued from her depression by -- tara, tara!-- a MAN, of all things. And only in the very last chapter. Is there anything more clich��d than this?) I slogged through it a sentence at a time: took me two excruciating weeks. I kept hoping for SOMETHING to rescue the book, but alas, there I was at the last page, and it ended with a clunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressed, boring, passive, weak women","review":"I've been listening to the book on tape, and am giving up. The characters are totally self-absorbed, shallow and uninteresting. A story may develop as time goes on, and Zoe may find some gumption and energy by the end of the book, but Brookner takes too many pages for me to persevere. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality doesn't seem up to old dashmat standards","review":"I have a dashmat from years ago for the same car, now I have a second. The new dashmats are really poor workmanship in comparison. It looks like a reject. Major sewing errors and miscuts, sloppy factory defects. I had to send it back.I already have same exact mat from years ago that always fit correctly, this one is ridiculous, not right at all. I'll try a different brand, I guess.I also ordered for a different car and that one had less defects so we kept it. Still, We will do some sewing to correct one poor detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie will keep you in one-liners for years to come!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. That's because all of us can clearly relate to being obsessed with a member of the opposite sex, and this movie's tremendous humor and well-developed characters keeps what could be a depressing subject watchable. A group of friends and I have seen it at least a dozen times and are fond of quoting the movie's best one-liners to each other .. i.e. \\"very sharp, Betty!\\" and \\"I've got an unemployed jacket salesman living in my spare room!\\". We do wish we could see the original version, just because none of us have, and I haven't been able to find it on video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved The Original Ending","review":"This is one of my favorite films of all time. The original ending is the only way for the film to end. There are those of us out there who really do believe in fate and happily ever after. I am one of them. If you ever get the chance to see the original, see it! Head Over Heels is what it was called when I saw it on HBO nearly 25 years ago (not the Chilly Scenes of Winter, how did that title come about?), anyway, is a very emotional and intellectual film. A+A+A+A+ Long live the romantics in the world. Will SOMEONE release this film in it's original version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic or stalker?","review":"I first saw this movie last night, it was fascinating. Young John Heard was handsome and it was fun to recognise Peter Riegart (crazy hair) Griffin Dunne, and the always great Gloria Graham. It was hard, however, to fathom what Heard saw in his Laura, altho maybe that was the point.She herself thinks he's idealising her way out of proportion and it's driving her mad.In today's world it's funny, instead of a romantic, John would be consider a creepy stalker. He made me want to scream, \\"get over it and get on with your life!\\"...I would love a dvd of this, hope they do release it, especially with a commentary.

The main female character was an insult to women everywhere. If she had to 'suppress a giggle' one more time I might have roared. I don't expect a lot out of Harlequin-type stories. They are good for a quick downtime when you're in need of a happy-ever-after type ending, but this book was pitiful. It had no plot, no interest, no substance, and no romance. My sixth-grader could have done a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough of Ann Margret!","review":"Bought this as I am an Ann Margret fan, but she is really not in the film enough.

The economic system chosen and the implications of the policy chosen. It analyses the recovery and the outperformance after the war and shows the upcoming weaknesses of the German economy. Shortyly the reunification is mentioned and the economic implications of it. This book however is at this moment a bit dated as it doesn't tell the story of the last few years. Still the book shows what the structurual weaknesses (and strong points) are and it points forward towards the current bad economic performance. Recommended when interesting in an in depth analysis of the German economy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"Although this is not an exciting book, it is highly informative and well-written. Watt makes a case for why Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding all have a claim to the paternity of the novel. Laborious academic bloviation is relatively nonexistent in The Rise of the Novel, and if you do much of this type of reading, you know that's a plus. Even if your focus is not Defoe, Richardson, or Fielding, this book is important to read, just so you understand where your writing fits in the greater literary tradition, or even to give contemporary writers context."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first cinematic slacker, maybe?","review":"A surreal comedy set during England��s swinging sixties. Tom Courtney is unbelievably funny as a working class boy unable to leave the safety of his family home and venture out on his own. He creates a fantastic world he retreats to when his daily encounters and unconventional actions get out of hand. Not even Julie Christie can drag him out into reality.One of the most entertaining films in cinema history, Billy Liar is a universal character that has surely set the bases for many slacker characters in film since then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture quality","review":"Excellent movie.

Always respectful of the text, Alter reveals techniques of purposeful characterization and structure that are at work to achieve the effect of these ancient, yet ever-timely narratives. Never overly technical, written in clear and skillful prose, Alter's criticism is top-notch. I recommend this work highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honoring the literary expertise of biblical writers","review":"Alter's presentation of the deep artistry and the artistic continuity/discontinuity in biblical literature is such a gift to the rest of us. I do not agree with his assumption that the narratives are mostly fiction rather than based in historical events, but the demonstration of the seriousness with which the writers took their craft of writing narratives is certainly a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Liberal and Nearly Useless","review":"This book has only one redeeming quality. The author helps you see the artistic, literary aspect of the Bible. He is a typical academic type who believes that the people and places in scripture are all fiction made up to teach about God.It is not at all recommended and I would throw it away now but it is required reading for a course."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opening Approach","review":"I recently purchased Alter's Five Books of Moses, and decided to follow that up with some of his earlier works. The book was a real eye opener for me in the way it presented the use of various narrative and literary techniques in the Bible. I think this book will prove insightful for anyone looking to appreciate the Bible as something to be read, rather than merely as a \\"text\\" to be analyzed for historical layers. I'm not sure that higher criticism does much for the average person once you've seen it; a literary approach allows for modern scholarship to be applied in a meaningful way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Educated Christianity and Interested Parties","review":"As a Master of Theological Studies student, this book is a wonderful supplement to a class I am taking. It is wonderful as it fleshes out the narrative study of the biblical texts that is often glossed over in \\"technical\\" biblical study classes. The emphases on source and textual criticisms often remove the beauty of the biblical stories. Alter approaches the text from an academic view, but recaptures the beauty of the Hebrew Bible.I personally have recommended this book to family and friends interested in Bible study from an academic or devotional perspective. It is a wonderful read and not so dense or academic elite that anyone couldn't understand where Alter is going.I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about the Bible and I would say that every Christian should read this to fully appreciate the Old Testament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art of Biblical Narrative by Alter","review":"This work begins with connecting archaeological discoveries toimportant biblical perspectives. It teaches that the Bible issacred history and that the 3rd person narrative is a bridge tofuture meanings/interpretations. The author shows where thereis much verbatim repetition in Biblical stories/themes. Thebook anticipates a more meaningful theological purpose with thepassage of time and experience with Biblical themes. This isa wonderfful work for biblical scholars, theologians, historiansand a wide constituency of academicians of all faiths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and depressing","review":"Tried to get through this a couple of times, but it was just too dated and depressing.

The main detriment to this endeavor he (and Walpole) believes is his domineering and shrewish wife Ruth. After an extended visit by his independent-minded niece Nathalie, he is inspired by her to separate from Ruth and to move far off from home base London to Cornwall and a little cottage where he will attempt his masterpiece once more. The best part of the book, because it's the liveliest, is the ending where Frost confronts Ruth with his plan. Walpole, not known for his humor, writes with wry wit here that adds much to the book's freshness and naturalness. The novel's bookish content should be appealing to those who revere the literary life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome carrier!","review":"I bought this carrier for my second child.

But the main deficiency is that too many of the songs go nowhere, despite their epic lengths. Not all - \\"Join\\" is the kind of sweeping, catchy anthem rock radio was made for, and the final epic \\"To Say Goodbye\\" actually works despite its excessive length.

I think it's terrific that she allows the characters to get to know one another as they fall in love. I'm sad to say that a lot of authors now days just write about people in lust that think they are in love. Don't get me wrong Dara Joy's stories are very sensual, but she also gives the reader a couple with substance. I love Dara Joy and her MATRIX series. Be sure you read \\"REJAR\\" AND \\"MINE TO TAKE\\" they are terrific as well. All three stories have been beautiful so far! Dara keep up the great work!P.S. Who is going to be next?

I never quite cared about the so-called quest they were on and frankly would have stopped reading it if it wasn't for the appearance of the supporting characters of Yaniff (who surely was Merlin in another dimension!) and the irresistable (or should I say insatiable?)

I was dismayed to realize that the hero never demonstrates any empathy for the heroine - he gets her into some terrible messes and seems to think it's his right to haul her along behind him like a child's toy. Many romances feature men with less than enlightened attitudes towards women, but they are usually redeemed by the hero's realization that the woman in question has many good qualities and isn't really an inferior. In this case, the misogynism/chauvinism never ends. If you find that you don't like books where the woman has absolutely no control over her own life and is treated like a mindless child, then I wouldn't recommend you read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!!!!!","review":"If you like a fantasy in your romance, then get this book!!!!!!!!!

I'm okay with sex scenes in romance novels. There's gotta be some, right? Well, in this book it was kind of overdone. I also don't think that the author has given enough consideration when creating the female lead character. She had no control of herself whatsoever when it came to Lorgin (the main guy). I think it was pathetic. She was also unbelievably dumb. Even male authors would have given their female characters more credit that that.

Also, bit of wit is displayed now and then, but this can't sustain committed reading. I'm not a big romance fan generally, however, right after this I read Kurland's, \\"This is All I Ask\\" which is I thought was very well-written and touching.

I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I did have a bit of a problem with Deana. More than once I really wanted to tell her \\"Knock him in the head & make him listen to you!!!!\\" She really did give in much, much too easily on a few things that she should have put her foot down & at least made him explain things or compromise. I did not find the humor 'laugh out loud' like a lot of people (well, EXCEPT the morning after the Transference! Know THAT was laugh out loud funny!), but I did smile & chuckle quite a bit thru out.

I like cheesey sci-fi (\\"Earth Girls are Easy\\" used to be one of my favorite movies), and I can stomach a lot of unlikely actions in the name of some laughs - but there were almost none to be had, here.

Yes, the vocabulary you learn is limited, but this is an introductory course, so how much can you really expect? The tones are the most important thing to learn in the beginning with a tonal language, in my opinion. One thing I do wish they had though is maybe a card that relates the sounds to the letters in the Vietnamese alphabet. Some of those relationships are not at all obvious to a native English speaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book works with kids, Coaching works for adults","review":"Kirk is my entrepreneur Coach, helping me transition from the corporate world to starting my own business.

The author paints too broad a picture when describing the process. In doing so, it is impossible for the reader to learn any true specifics that would actually be used to make a deal. As a developer myself, I like to see more substance when any discussion of real estate takes place.

Yes, for one tune, Cirith Ungol went death. Can't figure out why it's not on the CD.This CD is cool (Tim Baker still sings, 'nuff said) but not really in league with the 3 earlier discs. Tim has a love him or hate him vocal style, but he sounds like noone else. On earth. Period.Michael Whelan still does the cool artwork. Part of the problem was on Paradise lost, only Tim Baker (singer) and Robert Garven (drums) were left from the origional band. The bass playing of Michael Flint was gone, as well as the guitars of Jerry Fogle and Greg Lindstrom. It's hard for a band to lose 3/5s of the origional members and be the same. After all, these guys ain't Skynyrd. They're a really good metal band from California whom borrowed their name from J.R.R. Tolkien.Overall it's a very good album, just not excellent by Cirith Ungol standards. Maybe it'll get re-released with ALL the tracks one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an overlooked gem","review":"I saw this movie in a film class at UCLA and I loved it.

What is the real relationship between the servant and \\"sister\\"? (I've never seen the appeal of Sarah Miles who looks a lot like Daisy Duck.) The film implies a homosexual relationship between master and servant especially when the camera peeks into the servant's quarters exposing male physique pictures plastered on the wall above the bed. Later the two men are seen horsing around like a couple of gay playmates. Even the old woman with the big hat in the orgy(?) scene looks like a drag queen. I like Dirk much more in \\"Victim\\" which costs an arm and a leg on Amazon. The only thing I liked about this film is the snobby horseface girlfriend being humiliated and dumped. \\"The Servant\\" is basically dishonest in the old Hollywood fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliciously Dark!","review":"What a creep fest! This film is fantastic.The idea of having a manservant, like the main character does, is frightful in itself- I certainly wouldn't want anyone lurking around picking up after me & every movement I make. Shiver!When this particular hired helped (played to perfection by Dirk Bogarde), brings his sex kitten 'sister', into the household, & the sinister sex & drinking begins- watch out!It's enthralling to watch, & brings up thoughful (albiet dark) ideas about class, & friendship & working relations- a definite thriller & one of the best I've seen.Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for moderately heavy purchases","review":"I bought this - more expensive - cart after my $20 cheap one fell apart on my way home last week. The cart was reasonably easy to put together, and when empty, it works well.But, when you put things in it - even moderately heavy loads - the front wheels lock up, and because of the propensity of the wheels to roll under the cart, the cart becomes unbalanced from the front, and wants to fall over towards the front all the time.I got this cart because I carry water and soda about half a mile home after supermarketing. These are very typical loads.Don't believe it when it says it can carry 200lb - rolling on a smooth surface maybe - at a push.However, if you want to use this cart to carry loads home - on pavement and walking across roads - this cart fails miserably.The last time I used it, I literally had to drag it behind me because of its propensity to topple over at the front.My advice - DON'T BUY THIS CART."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!","review":"I bought this cart because of the swivel wheels...So far they have fallen off 3 or 4 times in the parking lot.

Mrs. Arsht is a talented writer who makes the reader see and enjoy her climb from a rural community to the highest levels in this country.

It took me back to the Africa I lived in as a young bride, to its stark beauty, its dignified and desparate people, the language of its silences. Her tale of matter-of-fact mercies, and of cruelty equally unremarkable, is the stuff of life, as full of hope as of despair, for its millions of people. Her sensitivity instructs us in things as disparate as a young zebra's personal quirks, or the way the setting sun reflects off a downed plane creating an illusory lake in the dry Serenghettti. We learn of the hunger of a dying man for news from the city, and of the joy of friendship restored, but mostly, we learn of the heart and mind of a brave, independent woman for whom Africa is, eternally, home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for anyone who considers themselves a writer","review":"This book is a hidden treasure. Markham offers a rich history of her life and the western influence upon east Africa, the land where she grew into a woman. Her writing style takes descriptive to a new level.

Her adventures rival those found in any adventure book I've ever read. She flew primarily in Africa and this book contains her memoirs, primarily of her time in Africa.Markham states that \\"You can live a lifetime and, at the end of it, know more about other people that you know about yourself\\" (p.283) She is a very adept observer of other people and her writing demonstrates this quality of hers.My favorite chapters were as follow:Royal Exile - About the foaling of her horse, Pegasus.Na Kupa Hat M'Zuri - About a horse race and how her horse won despite having weak leg tendons.West With the NIght - About Markham's attempt to cross the Atlantic Ocean by air.I found all the stories interesting and anyone who cares about early feminism, women of strength, or Africa will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Markham's hypnotic prose will transport you","review":"When this work was first recommended to me, it's advocate mistakenly told me only what it was about and nothing else. The subject matter seemed as if it would be drier than a Serengeti breeze. After repeatedly underselling why I should read it, I gave in and read it to get her off my back. I then realized that if she would have told me it would be one of the most beautifully written books I would ever read, I would not have take so long. I think Modern Library did this one a disservice by placing towards the end of the Top 100 Non-Fiction books of the 20th century. It should have been as close to 1 as they placed it to 100. If you are a aficionado of fine writing, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to compare this book with others","review":"When Beryl Markham grew up in Africa, she did not just grow up, she had adventures. While growing up with neighbor boys and being raised by a father, she did not act like a regular girl.The whole story takes you through her remebrance of growing up adventures to show the reader how she became an airplane flyer. While it is not until over halfway in the book that she tells of her flying experience, she does spell out even the most remarkable of details that she remembered of her somewhat fairy tale life that she lived in Africa.If you enjoy hearing true stories, then you aught to buy this one. It is worth every second of it. If you enjoy fiction , this one is still worth every second and not a dull moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story of an Inspirational Woman","review":"I'd never heard of Beryl Markham until a friend of mine loaned me this book. He thought I would enjoy it since I'd been to Africa and loved the places I visited. He was right! Markham grew up in Africa and her book relates many stories about those years. It also describes her encounters and adventures in the continent when she learned to fly and became a pilot as an adult. Much of the action takes place during the same time as \\"Out of Africa\\", and the two books share some characters. \\"West with the Night\\" is just as interesting, and an easier read.

In addition to the remarkable experiences, she brings a wonderful style to her writing.Her writing style is very understated and yet she captures the intensity of her adventures through her skills as a writer. As a pilot I loved her descriptions of some of her night flights across the empty vastness of Africa.Highly recommended.

But not as this book.The main charcter I feel does not show her real self. There is not major plot or theme to this at all.

I just can't get it to work so that he seems comfortable. He usually cries when he is in it. He fell asleep in it once, but he looked so contorted. It's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way. And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head. And I know I got the correct size. I've given up and am looking for a better sling.

I kept trying to figure it out, thinking that I must be doing something wrong because it was just so uncomfortable. I had the right size, and I kept going back to the instructions to try to figure it out. Finally my husband said, \\"Stop trying! Use your other carriers!\\". I love my two other carriers... very comfortable for me and my baby falls asleep in them. With the New Native, he would scream and cry as I tried to shove him in, and then once he was in there he looked all contorted and his neck was bent in a funny way. I could wear it for about 5 minutes and then it felt like it was digging into my shoulder and the weight was unevenly distributed for my back. There are some really awesome carriers and slings out there-- I recommend getting a different brand for your own comfort, and for the well-being of your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment . . .","review":"I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son. When I put him in it, he looked so uncomfortable. I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit, but it still covered his face. So, I decided to shell out the $[...] for the infant support pillow, expecting that to make a difference. It didn't. He still looked uncomfortable and squished, only now I wasted MORE money. My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz. I can't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all. A big disappointment. If you're looking for a carrier, try the Bjorn. A million times better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky-baby.com","review":"Rather than this sling... I recommend you check out [...] for your sling.

The cotton fabric doesn't offer much support for the baby's weight and I found it became uncomfortable very quickly. It also didn't feel as secure as some of the padded, over-the-shoulder style slings. I actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times, which defeats the purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"better slings out there","review":"This sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap.

Envenomed was very good. But to be honest, there's no post-Hoffman material worth listening to. Yeah, there's an image of a tank on the cover and it's heavy and br00tal and anyone who doesn't like it is a mallgoth poser [or whatever], but this album is simply boring. Kyle Symons proves to be one of death metal's most uncharismatic vocalists album after album, and more importantly, the band's sense of creativity and life has seemingly departed. It's easy to string together some chugging palm-muted guitar licks and call yourself death metal, but if those riffs can't serve a higher artistic purpose, it's a lost cause. I gave this album multiple chances, and whenever I hear it, I just hear one-dimensional, generic death metal. Even the awesome Dave Culross couldn't save this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I was very disappointed with this product.

Still, \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\" is a very strong Tull album. The first three cuts---the title song, \\"Cold Wind To Valhalla\\" and \\"Black Satin Dancer\\"---are all wondrous hybrids of acoustic beauty and tough-as-nails rock. \\"One White Duck/0 = Nothing At All\\" is a great solo showcase for Anderson, one of his finest moments on record. And the lengthy suite known as \\"Baker St. Muse\\" is an awesome Tull piece. And, as an added bonus, this new remastered edition of \\"Gallery\\" contains five bonus tracks, including such Tull gems as \\"Summerday Sands,\\" and the flute instrumental, \\"Pan Dance.\\" All in all, \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\" is a very good Jethro Tull album."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEY! I'M A TATTERED MINSTREL!! GET IT?!!?","review":"This is the album where Ian Anderson became a self-parody, a real Olde Englishe minstrel/bard straight from Central Casting. Tull's music always had a strain of English folk in it, but it was always just alluded to and was balanced out by enough blues and rock elements to keep them from sounding like a historic exercise a la Steeleye Span. And while Ian's stage get-up included some strange medieval-looking boots, he basically looked like just another wacky hippie. But for some reason on this album Ian decided he needed to beat everyone over the head with Ye Olde Concept and started appearing on stage in some second-hand Shakespearian garb. He pursued this schtick relentlessly through the next two albums, \\"Songs from the Wood\\" and \\"Heavy Horses\\", at which time I stopped buying Tull albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much Jethro Tull's worst recording to this point.","review":"Try singing to yourself this lyric from Requiem: \\"Saw her face in the tear-drop black-cab window\\"--the chords are Eb, Cm, Bb, and the \\"melody\\" notes are G-G-G-Ab-G-G-F-F-Eb-Eb-F--, and notice how unmusical it is.How much sense does this lyric make to you? \\"Moon jet brave beam split ceiling swerve and light/The old Valhalla.\\"And this? \\"He polarized the pumpkin-eaters --- static-humming/Panel-beaters --- freshly day-glow'd factory cheaters (salaried and collar-scrubbing).\\"Does this feeble attempt at humor strike you as hilarious? \\"I have no time for Time magazine or Rolling Stone.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":">I'm sure that if they don't have Sheet Music in front of them, they don't know what to do with an InstrumentIn fact, I'm not aware that any \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" sheet music has ever been published.

Page-long paragraphs of dialogue without quote marks make it very tricky to follow what's being said by whom. The role of the characters in the plot is frequently vague.

This one was too far-fetched to enjoy. The idea that the Commissaris and de Gier are the right people to go undercover in Japan is just unbelievable. Hence, the rest of the story, no matter how \\"abstract\\" and \\"thought-provoking\\" just doesn't work. Also, the commissaris is hardly able to get around back in Amsterdam because of his rheumatism, so how is he going to be able to function in such a serious operation in a foreign country (he struggled enough on his trip to Curacao in a previous book). Van de Wetering gave too much detail about sailing and about the party at the daimyo's hideout (that was so annoying). De Gier's attitude in Japan--he has given up on life--is actually the only interesting part of the Japan sting operation.I am already starting the next book with the hope that it will be more like the author's previous Amsterdam mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange, intersting but left me wondering","review":"This is part of a series and it took me a while to separate the two detectives due to the difficulty of the Dutch names.

Not even close to the chapters, questions and problems from the 1991 version that they advertised. I was very unhappy with the purchase.The old paperback vols.(1-4) were not in very good condition. The picture shown is a hardback of the proper edition. What I got was nothing like what was shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Standard Text a Generation Ago","review":"This was a widely used text a generation back, still mentioned but no longer in print. Since even a large and expensive text has some limits, and the class year also has time limits, every author (or committee) has to make some decisions on what to include and at how much detail.In Physics, this often means where to gloss over something that otherwise may lead quickly into deep water. Two examples are simple harmonic motion, and heat, energy and thermodynamics.I wanted to see how much this differs from the current standard introductory texts, so I looked for a used good condition copy.This was a good book; you could still teach a course from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare find","review":"For those who are interested in Russian Prison Tattoos, the Baldaev series is really the only resource.

Heck, even if you don't read it, would make a good coffee table book for a conversation starter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy...","review":"Tis is by far one of the creepiest books I have ever read. I felt like I needed a shower after reading it. Yuk...Clara, an unattractive, crippled heiress agrees to marry handsome, fortune hunting Frederick, who lies and schemes, as she feels it is her only shot at a chance to marry. Frederick does not really have any friends left as he kidnapped a girl who he grew up with (that story is written about in a previous regency), before she was to marry his friend as he needed her money. Then he has to leave town and he runs into Clara, an easy target for Frederick to charm with his good looks. The scenes in bed were awful, Frederick is a creep, Clara is a fool. The book was one of the most unromantic books I have ever had the misfortune to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTING!","review":"This was the most insulting book I ever read. The hero cheats on her constantly! He admits to it and tells Clara that he probably will do it again while he is confessing his love for her.

His chops are so subtle and fluid, yet have a complexity that he can call his very own.On this album is Jeff's take on some great tunes and a style that intrigues so many other guitarists and musicians, you will hear them imitating his phrasings and tone in years to come. The recording is second to none, and on a decent sound system, you'll swear your are sitting with the band.Once again, Jeff has proven that his name will someday be mentioned in the same breath with Wes Montgomery, Chet Atkins and other guitar greats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backward","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Jeff Golub; I have all of his previous CDs. His last CD, \\"Dangerous Curves\\", was the best yet and took a real step away from \\"smooth jazz\\" (oh, how I hate that term, and the music it describes) and toward a harder-edged sound that I felt really played to Jeff's strengths.Oooops! \\"Do It Again\\" is a big step BACKWARDS. This CD could be shown in the dictionary as the very definition of \\"smooth jazz.\\" Which is to say, BORING.Also, what's up with the drum programing on what is ostensibly an \\"old school R&B\\" cover CD? (Especially when you've got a KILLER drummer-- Steve Ferrone-- playing on some of the other cuts.)Sorry... this was a BIG disappointment to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry","review":"I misunderstood this product and received the wrong size.

My husband recently fractured his arm and was severely bruised and in pain. I use this to gently rub on his arm to promote healing of his bruises and it works well. The gel form is easier to use than the liquid form.

This couple loved their wolves and did their best to accommodate them. The first two wolf pups were retrieved from Eskimos when their parents were killed for a $50. bounty. The Crislers had to make hard choices regarding their charges when they left the Arctic and headed for home in Colorado. They did the best they could, showing immense compassion for their wolves. They truly loved them.

The difficulties with \\"A Passion Play\\", the initial recording sessions as well as the concerts, ought to have made it clear that the end was at hand. We could have been spared the excruciating torment of the vacuous singles \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\" and \\"Too Old to Rock, Too Young to Die\\" and of the interminable series of dreadful Tull LP's and CD's beginning with \\"War Child\\" and including \\"Heavy Horses\\", \\"Stormwatch\\", etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"Ian Anderson often complains in interviews that the name \\"Jethro Tull\\" hangs like an albatross around his neck. He particularly dislikes being mistaken for Jethro Tull, the historical figure--or something. This is understandable, I suppose, but the solution is rather obvious, isn't it?We can reasonably assume this disc's title song, or just plain title, for that matter, is not intentionally autobiographical, and certainly I would be the last to say that thirty is too old to rock and roll, or, for that matter, forty or fifty or sixty. By the time of this record's release, however, SOMEthing HAD gone wrong with Jethro Tull (the rock group, not the historical figure), and if you don't believe it, just listen to how excruciatingly awful the title track is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album released at the wrong time","review":"1976 saw the breaking of punk rock and disco music ushered into our lives. Being a Jethro Tull fan wasn't fashionable...and the lame \\"cartoony\\" cover art of Tull's latest certainly didn't help this record. But this album ranks up there with \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\". As always, great guitar work and tone by Martin Barre. Ian Anderson has some really nice songs on here. \\"Taxi Grab\\" being a highlight for myself. \\"Quizz Kid\\" and \\"Crazed Institution\\" are good rockers.I had this album when it first came out. I saw it was remastered and recently picked it up used, thinking (even if I just listen to it once or twice) it'll be worth it. It stayed in my car stereo for two weeks. It took me back and made me appreciate this album more than when I was a teen. The remastering really helped a lot of frequencies find their way into my old hairy ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Too Old Too Rock 'n' Roll","review":"Once again this one just doesn't rate in Tull's top 5 albums, but having said that, it is remarkable for its stand alone quality (think Broadsword) in Tulls catalogue.This is the closest Tull ever came to mainstream R n R, and not really that close at that. It really is hard to fault this album at all and it will remain one of my favorites just for being what it is. Once again I will state NEVER COMPARE Tull albums and don't listen to those that do, you'll only be dissapointed and might miss a classic for your ears.No doubt the remastering of this one was warranted, but once again the added tracks nearly destroy this masterpiece, it finishes forever with \\"The Chequered Flag\\" and that is how it should be. Find the original if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tull in the good times.","review":"An excellent concept album with just a couple of mediocre tunes. The bulk of the mix is Ian Anderson at his poetic best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven: some okay songs and some amazing songs","review":"\\"Too Old to Rock and Roll...\\" is an uneven album, it's a case of where the album is just o.k., but there are some amazing songs on there. As a whole, the album isn't one of Tull's best, but it has some of their best songs on it. \\"From a Deadbeat to an Old Greaser,\\" the title track, \\"Pied Piper,\\" and \\"The Chequered Flag\\" are some of Tull's best, if lesser known songs (well, obviously with the exception of the title track...). \\"Quiz Kid,\\" Salamander,\\" \\"Crazed Institution\\" and \\"Big Dipper\\" are good, and the are pretty catchy songs. \\"Bad Eyed and Loveless\\" and \\"Taxi Grab\\" are both songs I never really cared for.If you're a Tull fan and don't know whether to get it, get it. If you're new to Tull, wait before getting it - it's not the album to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Tull albums ever","review":"First off, let it be known that,I realy dislike critics.

My music collection would not be complete without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be recalled, horrible style is taught!","review":"I don't even know where to begin to describe how bad this book is but perhaps teh following two examples are enough1. The author spends more time on modules then objects: has a chapter on modules way before the chapter on objects. Hasn't the author been listening to Microsoft that VB .NET is a fully object oriented language - modules should not be used therefore, objects everywhere!2. The author advocates Hungarian notation even though the VB .NET team says in the online help not to use it!Again I have to ask: why didn't Microsoft Press run this book by anybody on the Visual Basic .NET team? The principles it suggests go completely against what teh team members say in their talks.This book should be recalled.

I would caution the baker who is looking for a whole-grain only or whole grain-heavy cookbook tho.

The sticker on the device reads g-protection, but its anyone's guess what the hell that is if it is in fact not a shock protection feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasts","review":"I bought this in 2005, long before my first mp3 player. It was a nice little cd player and worked well until last year, when I made the mistake of putting a scratched CD inside it. All of a sudden, it spun the disk very slowly. After that happened, it never worked again - just kept spinning any disk I put in it really slowly and the display will eventually read 'no disc'. Just now I tried using it again with fresh batteries and there is this snapping noise along with the super slow disk spinning.Anyway, it was great while it lasted. The controls on the front were kind of awkward and inconvenient but it had nice features and sounded okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews and AVOID!","review":"I should have read the reviews. This is a bad product: Where to begin? Difficult to read, poorly positioned display, difficult to see and use control buttons. Fiddly battery location. And the final straw - \\"no disc\\" now permanently displayed. Time to junk this piece of junk. I'm ashamed - I'm a designer, I've should have spotted these flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Discman","review":"I had one of these for 2+ years and it worked awesomely. I'm actually going to buy another one just because i like it so much. I have had many personal cd players in the past that skipped for no reason and were totally horrible. When I finally got my own job, I shelled out 5 extra bucks and got something that was 10 times the quality of a $15 walkman. I only had problems with skipping discs when my son decided that it was a great toy... hahaha! I would recommend this to anyone as a great, inexpensive walkman."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Who Dreams: A Journey into Healing through Dreamwork","review":"She Who Dreams is a beacon of hope, a lighthouse on a cloudy day. In the pages of this book you will find a personal triumph over breast cancer, hard fought and sustained by a combination of medical and dream therapies. We are urged to listen and respond to our own dreams, as the author did during her diagnosis and treatment. Wanda Burch opens her life to us--doubts and fears, as well as successes. Her honesty is a rare attribute in today's world. I recommend her book for those who wish to dream a healthier future for ourselves and our communities. Along with her friend, the renowned dream teacher Robert Moss, Wanda shows how we can use our dreams in an active process of sharing, re-entering and re-shaping. They offer us guidelines and proven techniques for improving our physical and spiritual health. In the end we understand, like Wanda, that dreaming is a lifelong and lifesaving process."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Skeptic Won Over","review":"I confess that I came to this book as something of a skeptic. To my rational, scientific mind, the idea that one's dreams can affect or predict the future seemed pretty iffy. Yet it is hard to deny the truth of personal experience. Wanda Burch has a fascinating story to tell, and I was drawn in by it. She describes her life-and-death experiences in vivid detail, with honesty and insight that leap out from the page. The author is more than a survivor; she is clearly a woman of extraordinary courage.For anyone who has struggled with special health challenges, or anyone who has wondered what their dreams mean, or for that matter anyone who just enjoys a good original biography, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"I honestly thought this would be shadowboxing drills, it is not. Its just them talking about shadowboxing and trying to hock their products, was not worth the money at all. \\"You can add dumbbells to shadowboxing or many of our other ringside products.\\".....wow, thanks, totally worth 15 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always disappointing","review":"I've read Rose Daughter twice now and I didn't like it much better the second time. Robin McKinley is my favorite author and this is one of my least favorite of her books (behind Dragonhaven). It just doesn't fit together. The writing is as beautiful as ever, but the story seems like a lot of unrelated ideas sort of smashed together."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Perspective on Beauty and the Beast, but confusing","review":"I was disappointed with this book. All of McKinley's books up to this point had at least been good. I found this book very slow moving and the characters not that well developed. I found that a lot of the conflict was not concluded at the end of the book. I am a sucker for happy endings and this did not have a very good one. It did, however, give me a different veiw on the story of Beauty and the Beast."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Alice in Wonderland...","review":"You might like this. While I love the story of Beauty and the Beast, I have to say that this was a incredibly over written book. The entire book seems to drag painfully and tediously through every tiny, inconsequential, insignificant detail. The language and dialogue are like those of Alice in Wonderland. The characters are incredibly unrealistic and unbelievable. To be fair, very rarely the story becomes interesting, which is why I rate it with two stars, but most of the time it's unbearably dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For a book of this length, the characters are flat, the beginning of the story is not adequately developed and the ending is rushed. The \\"ghost story\\" is the most interesting part and would probably be a better book. There is no reason described in this book for Beauty and the Beast to fall in love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"Beauty\\" instead","review":"Years ago, I read Beauty, McKinley's first attempt at the Beauty and the Beast story. I loved it. Earlier this year, I picked it up again and read it. It held up well and I still find it incredibly charming.Given how much I enjoyed Beauty, I really wanted to read \\"Rose Daughter\\" and see how McKinley's second crack at the tale fared. I expected a lot. I assumed McKinley would have matured as a writer and I was hoping to love it as much as I loved Beauty.I was wrong.The term 'florid prose' springs to mind. This novel is absolutely strangled by the egregiously wordy prose. You have to wade through painfully winding and ultimately pointless descriptions of everything, large and small. After slogging through a single run-on sentence that choked up the better part of an entire page, I threw the book away. This novel is a fine example of writing at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened, Robin?","review":"I was SO excited when this book came out- \\"Beauty\\" , of course, having been one of my all-time favorite books as a girl. Surely the amazing Ms.McKinley could strike gold again, especially with such a beloved story! But... But... I started reading the book and... nothing! I could not get into the book at all. The exciting, colorful immediacy of \\"Beauty\\" seemed to have vanished... All that seemed to be left was a dull, abstract narrative where the heroine spent an incessant amount of time puttering about her flowers. I felt very disappointed indeed. First \\"Deerskin,\\" now this! What happened, Robin?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Truly tragically disappointing.","review":"I absolutely adored Beauty, McKinley's first novel. Rose Daughter? No. Not. At. All. Whereas Beauty had a spunky heroine, full of doubts, ideas, and heart, *this* Beauty has no soul. She's merely lost in the vague, page-long descriptions, muddy plot, and inching action. I was bored to tears, and frustrated with the rambling sentences and wooden dialogue. I like my magic in big doses, but it would take a sorcerer's potion poured through my ear to get me to try to attempt this mess again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I loved Robin McKinley's \\"Beauty\\" so much, I was hesitant to read \\"Rose Daughter\\"; and rightly so. While I try to recognize growth and maturity in McKinley's much more elaborate and imaginative retelling of the classic Beauty and the Beast fairy tale, I was still disappointed. Embarassing as it is for the feminist in me to admit, I thoughroughly enjoy a good fairy tale, and what made \\"Beauty\\" so wonderful was the main character and her strength and resilence; not the wild departure from the classic storyline that \\"Rose Daughter\\" has. I admire McKinley's tenacity, especially in her unusual ending, but I hated seeing the classic story gone so astray in the name of originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, yuck?","review":"ok, i have to admit that some of the details in rose daughter were lovely, but a bit too much at times. i mean, how much time can a person spend in a rose garden anyway? take my advice and read Ms. McKinley's earlier book Beauty. it remains one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Mckinley rewrite this tale? What's the challenge?","review":"I really don't want to say this, but truthfully, I hated this book. I dreaded the story from cover to cover. The context of the story was much more developed than the previous BEAUTY, but not for the better. Details did this book no good. The characters were much more deeper and emotional, but didn't seem to place this book on a higher level both ways.But if you like to read retellings of conventional fairy tales, you MAY want to try this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read such McKinely books as \\"The Blue Sword\\", \\"The Hero and the Crown\\" and the original Beauty and the Beast tale and sadly this book cannot compare. The language was so difficult to follow that the plot was extremely confusing. Her attempt at \\"mature\\" writing in fact led to pages of descriptions that when you finished reading them it led you to a headache. It made the Oddysey look like an easy read. This book was simply, over written. I love her earlier books but it seems as time goes on Robin's books decrease in quality and legibility.\\"Rose Daughter\\" to me is a lesser version of her first, if you want to read about Beauty and the Beast read her first version, trust me you will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Nonsense","review":"Rose Daughter was a terrible bore. I don't want to put down Ms. Mckinley, her novels are great, but this was just a bit dissapointing in comparison to her previous works. Rose Daughter was highly detailed, for the worst I would say. The plot was going around in circles, and the most dissapointing thing is that this book was of such tremendous weight, but nearly 40% of the book's size could have been reduced if there was less tedious useless details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone has a favorite","review":"I agree with whoever wrote that Beauty and Rose Daughter are different the way that two flowers are different - both beautiful, but with different ways of being so. So everyone who reads both Beauty and Rose Daughter will have a favorite, not necessarily because one is spectacularly better than the other. I have to admit that my favorite is Beauty, but Rose Daughter is still a good read. Beauty and Beast are more deeply explored, and I agree that McKinley has grown more mature since her first try at the fairy tale, but being a sucker for happy endings, I prefer Beauty. Of course, there are other things to like about Beauty too - the characters seem more warmhearted and believable. Rose Daughter's characters are fascinating, but at times a little distant. Read them both and decide for yourself - it's worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully complex and human look at the tale","review":"McKinley has grown up a lot since her first telling of this tale, and her deeper understanding clearly shows. The story has a rich texture, the characters are full and lifelike, and with a loving hand she brings to life the background of the story, making this more of a tale in its own right. It is not simply a re-telling of a tale we all know, there are many surprises, twists, and additional layers present. The book advances with a thoughtful subtlety, with a maturity that knows the tale as more than a bedtime story. Her writing is thoroughly enjoyable, lifelike, and has a tender touch with regard for the tradition of the story as well as the changes McKinley makes in it. If you have loved the tale as a child and now find yourself an adult longing for magic, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the dullest books I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"A very dissapointing Mckinley novel. I find ZEL by Donna Jo Napoli a much more exciting and mature spin-off of a fairytale. Nevertheless, I'd rather reread Beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Beauty","review":"As wonderful as the book Beauty is, that's how awful this book is. I can't believe they even published it. It was long, boring, and pointless. It has none of the wonder and charm of Beauty, and all the characters have really annoying names."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This book was wonderful to read until the end. The ending shocked me and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe Robin McKinley was trying to make this retelling \\"her own\\". If she was, she should have chosen another way to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"I Have read all of Robin McKinley's books and I must say this is McKinley at her worst. Rose daughter doesn't hold a candle to her previous novels. All the other book combined fantasy with wit, humor and demonstrated that McKinley is a fabulous story teller. WHAT HAPPENED???? IS SHE IN HER DECLINING YEARS OR WHAT?? I got such bad vibes from this book that I had to read my most favorite part of the BLUE SWORD to get myself back in synch. Do Not Read this book it is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague and lacking action...","review":"Like a lot of other people, I had read Beauty and loved it, and so looked forward to Robin McKinley's retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story. I found the first 1/3 of the book fascinating, but as I got farther into the story, I found myself getting frustrated at the lengthy, yet vague, descriptions of things. It was strange how she could go on in great detail about how various roses or rooms looked, yet at other times I found myself re-reading a passage several times trying to figure out what was going on. I really disliked the ending, too--after several re-readings I finally figured out what had happened. The author's imagery was certainly very beautiful, but sometimes it was so out there that it was difficult to catch her meaning. I prefer Beauty much, much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love conquers all in this beautifully written novel.","review":"Beauty is a strong character who comes alive on the pages and guides one through the every changing land of fantasy. This is by far the best telling of the story of Beauty and the Beast. The detailed description allows you to imagine the unreal beauty of this magical land. It is a great novel for those who are romantics at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few flaws, but basically great","review":"I think that this book is wonderful, and I have been searching for other Robin McKinley books. The language just sweeps you in, and the description is wonderful. The plot is great, too, though we all know it. I like how she twisted it to add some of her own charm. My only problem is the characters, because I find Beauty less of a straightforward, smart person, though she is caring and loving, and of course, that's always nice. I think that this book with the book Beauty's character would be simply head over heels. I recommend this book to anyone who likes \\"Beauty\\". This isn't Ms. McKinley's best work, but it's worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as the original","review":"Twenty years ago, she wrote \\"Beauty\\", a wonderful retelling of the fairy tale \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". Now she comes back to the same theme with a fresh perspective. However, this lacks the simple beauty (pardon the expression) of the original. The language is lyrical, conjuring up wonderful images, but somehow I felt more empathy for the characters in her first book. Which is not to say that the characters here are lacking - they simply pale a little bit in comparison. There is a slight feeling of trying too hard - more description and devotion to atmosphere than concentrating on the tale itself. But for all that, still a beautiful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally wrong ending","review":"Have you ever read a book that was absolutly perfect untill the end? The end of this book destroys the whole point of the fairy tale. I was so disapointed. It seemed that McKinley just threw everything together to create an ending. I was so excited, this book was so good untill the last two or three chapters. Then it just disgusted me. I would write a whole new ending for this book and then it would be perfect. But unless you want to write your own ending, don't waste time or money on this book. I must say though, that the sisters were great and I loved the way she wrote them. That was actually worth my time. I gave a star to each of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Change","review":"Reader beware: the only way to read this book is to NOT compare it to \\"Beauty.\\" Otherwise you will be disappointed because it is not the same book and takes on a different perspective to the tale. However, the characters are more realistic and complex. Lionheart and Jeweltounge (the sisters) were interesting characters although I really liked what she did with the beast the best. He was much more \\"human\\" in terms of emotions and his relation to Beauty. A good book. Not quite as happy as \\"Beauty\\" but definitely a nice read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I am a huge fan of Robin McKinley. I've loved the Damar books since I was a teenager, Deerskin was excellent, I reread Beauty often. I pounced on Rose Daughter as soon as it came out, but it was a big disappointment. The heroine is much less compelling than McKinley's original Beauty, and the characters in general have less depth. In some ways this makes it more like an actual fairytale (Beauty's sisters have names reflecting their personalities, for example, and McKinley creates deliberately parallel storylines for them.) However, the plot completely fails to pull together the different threads of the story, some of which seem completely pointless. The Beast is an artist? And where did these unicorns come from?! McKinley's attempt to avoid a predictable ending results in one that is completely improbable. I won't say don't read this if you are a die-hard fan, but if it is the first of her books you have picked up I suggest you reach for one of her stronger works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has really changed. Not worth it.","review":"Robin McKinley's style of writing has really changed and for the worse. Her books are now slow-moving and the stories have definitely taken a darker side. I enjoyes her earlier retelling of Beauty and the Beast much better. The characters were easy to relate to and it had a more \\"fairy tale\\" feeling. The plot in Rose Daughter is confusing and undefined. The curse was badly explained and it is unrealistic that she would have fallen in love with the beast in under a week while months go by in the outside world. Bottom line: not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...Hated the Ending","review":"I wanted to read this book since it was by McKinley and I had read BEAUTY (which I loved and love to reread over and over). I had expected this book to be just as good as BEAUTY, if not better since it was longer and looked more interesting. I think it started out pretty well...but then just got worse and worse. I found parts of the book confusing...I wasn't able to picture what was going on as I am usually able to do while reading McKinley's books. I absolutely hated the ending...I know Beauty is supposed to love the Beast for who he is...but I can't even imagine a human girl marrying a huge beast. The fairy-tale ending with the beast changing into a human is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a real shame...","review":"Robin McKinley didn't just leave the Beauty & the Beast story alone with her first take.Beauty was a fabulous book, and one I recommend highly to everyone. Rose Daughter was a serious disappointment. I would not suggest anyone spend any money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf?!","review":"I have always considered myself a fastasy freak. I've read over a hundred version of Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, etc. So I can honestly say this book is the worst version of Beauty and the Beast I have ever read.The main character came off as, well, kind of retarded and there is more romance between a brother and a sister than Beauty and the Beast. At times I felt like Beauty was talking to her large dog rather than her \\"beloved beast\\". Furthermore, the names of the characters were just rediculous. Those of you who read this book, you know what I'm talking about.Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to trash talk Ms. Mckinley. I loved THE HERO AND THE CROWN and THE BLUE SWORD, but either she definately lost her touch with this book or some third grader wrote this book and gave all the credit to McKinley. I am so serious, there were grammatical errors in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!","review":"I don't quite understand why everyone is giving this good book a bad review. I loved it...the names were a little weird, as someone commented, but what do names really matter. The characters were great, the plot was good and it kept me reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than BEAUTY","review":"I think this was a story definitely worth retelling. I particularly like the ending . . . Beauty's choice about her future with the beast, I mean. Some people have complained that it's slow; I didn't find it at all slow. In fact, it was hard to stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I loved the story line, I loved the discriptions, I loved how beatifully lyrical Ms. McKinley can make many of her passages. I really enjoyed the fullness of the pictures she painted in your imagination. This book has atmosphere; it feels just as a fairy tale ought. If you like things short and succinct, this is not the book to read. But if you like attention to detail, lots of lurking symbolism, and way too much thought provoking stuff to ponder over in one sitting, this book's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rose Daughter","review":"Although I discovered the beauty of Robin McKinley's magical tales, I have only recently read both retellings of Beauty and the Beast. Rose Daughter is very different from the original tale. In Robin McKinley's second version, all thsisters are beautiful. None are arrogant or spoiled. Each is uniquely characterized and beautifully described. Lionheart, Jeweltongue, and Beauty are down-to-earth and sensible. The sentences are descriptive, but sometimes too much so so that the excitement is taken out of the moment. But don't let that stop you from reading this fantastic book! The Beast is also wonderfully depicted. He seems perfect for Beauty. It's wonderful that, unlike the traditional fairytale, the Beast has a more complex, harder to solve problem that confines him to his palace. Robin's McKinley's writing make you feel like you were experiencing everything, that you're there with the characters. This book is perfect for any fairytale lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not McKinley's best work","review":"I fell in love with Robin McKinley with the novel Beauty, her first write of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. It was an amazing novel, and I was excited to see she had rewritten the tale a second time. Rose Daughter, however, falls sadly short of McKinley's other work. The writing style is difficult and choppy to follow, too many sentences are strung together to make the words flow smoothly. This was the greatest drawback to the novel and made it much inferior to Beauty. At the story's finish, you realize the novel has only spanned a few days, but it felt like centuries to wade through McKinley's over-wordiness and failing attempts at a more \\"advanced\\" writing style.What is more, Rose Daughter isn't different enough to even have points for originality, or a very clever plot. I would definitely suggest against purchasing this book, and instead sticking to Beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of photos, little substance","review":"I returned this book, because it wasn't what I wanted.

The single contains the regular version of the awesome song Lavatory Love Machine, as well as an acoustic version that rocks too, and they do an extremely great cover of an old Europe song called \\"I'll Cry For You\\", this cover is so well done and emotive, well played and very catchy (very very catchy)... it beats out the old Europe version by a mile. Also included is a really cool new song called \\"Reach Out\\", a typical Edguy \\"life-searching\\" ballad that is quite great.

I wish only to have read the detailed outline of each segment first to make it easier to keep track of them all. Otherwise, Weiss' book brought me back to my days in the college library, contentedly absorbing \\"American Demographics.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful look at how geodemographic clustering works","review":"Weiss gives an entertaining and well-written overview of how geodemographic profiling works. He explains the concept, compares the US profiling to other countries, and talks about its applications in marketing. Finally, he provides a breakdown of the 62 PRIZM clusters that existed at the time that the book was written.

The wording is elevated and many will appreciate his touches of humor. Eventhough the first person account of Isabel was a nice addition, there were points that seemed forced into her conversation (e.g., a kid describing headlights as something akin to \\"stabbing into the night\\" placed next to text of \\"like\\", \\"sure\\", \\"as if\\" or any other youthful colloquialisms. Overall, the story is original, conceived well, and delivered in an exciting fashion.

His most enduring contribution to the field has been the notion that the \\"savage\\" mind engages essentially in the same kind of thought processes as the \\"moderns\\" do. In \\"Myth and Meaning\\" L��vi-Strauss concentrates on myths in particular, and argues that myths are far from being nave fairly tales and are actually a very sophisticated narratives that capture a lot of important concepts and meanings.This is a very readable little book, and is probably the best introduction to the writings of L��vi-Strauss.

Little wonder that sometimes my hair felt as if it had been dried and fried.

My hair became sticky and I could barely pull my brush through without extreme pain. The lotion did make my hair a little less frizzy, but I was expecting dramatic results for product that is popular and much more costly than other brands.

It's true, marriages do fail in this day and age, and it's better to have contingency plans in place (e.g. pre-nup agreements) if things head south.The goal of a divorce is to break away gracefully, not have a temper tantrum like some enraged little 4 year-old. A vindictive attitude only plays into the hands of the legal system, which will drain you like a hungry vampire and bob-sled you to the poor house if given the opportunity.Ladies, remember that revenge fantasies go both ways, and the ones that men have tend to be far bloodier than yours.

It is full of factually incorrect assertions woven together into a distorted picture of the most influential and complex theater worker of the twentieth century. There is a total absence of critical perception or analysis, and for someone who claims to have been working so long in the field, Fuegi betrays a remarkable lack of insight into the dynamics of theater production. He pays lip-service to what he seems to believe are feminist principles, but underneath them, he shows great disregard for the opinions and achievements of the remarkable women who worked with Brecht throughout his life. Fuegi seems to have learned nothing from Brecht;his writing is plodding and turgid - all the more so in the context of Brecht's own sharpness and economy of language.

I minored in anthropology at university and still found it pretty chewy at points.Third, extrapolating the _entire_ Pagan community from a very limited sample (virtually all Wiccan), in my opinion, utterly ridiculous. Certainly it isn't going to tell anyone much about actually _practicing_ the religion, so don't plan on reading it for that purpose.

As someone who enjoyed the scene, it seems that many new albums have dissapointed me. The new Agony Scene is a good example of a once good band adopting a more formulaic approach of songwritting. So when As I Lay Dying came out with a new cd, I had my doubts. Turns out there was no reason to. While this cd doesn't break any new musical ground, it definately perfects what As I Lay Dying was trying to do on their first cd. With almost an entirely new line up, the guitar work has improved vastly. Tracks like \\"Reflection\\" and \\"The Truth of My Perception\\" are punishing sonic assaults with intricate melodic guitar lines. With the bassist now handling the melodic vocals, a metalcore band actually sings and doesn't have come off as cheesy. He shows their new dynamic in \\"Confined\\" and \\"The Darkest Nights.\\" If you are a fan of metalcore, this is a definate must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick rythemic pulverizing music with a subtle touch of melody","review":"When first listening to this album, i thought it was a stepdown from frail words of the collapse since the general tone in this album had less melody and not as many catchy vocal hooks but, when listening to it again it grew on me big time. The guitar grooves on Shadows are so damn aggressive and they capture an empowering feeling more so then Frail words of the collapse. In fact I actually like this album more then frail words for that reason.Every song on this album is done well. The overall tone here is pulverizing rythemic guitars with change over melodic riffs which still sound aggressive. The vocals are in line with everything and add value to each song.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very generic metalcore.","review":"This is a very boring album that could have been so much better. The vocalist is very talented but the whole album sounds the same. This band is much like It Dies Today, and sounds a tad like Trivium. Frail Words to Colapse is a much better album and has MUCH more creativity. The guitar riffs in SAS are very generic, although if you like the sound it will suit you. I would recomend bands such as, The Black Dahlia Murder, Darkest Hour, and Lamb of God instead of this band.

I listen to everything, from Immolation to Immortal and Deicide. Heck, I'm not even religious at all, but being open minded allows me to take in fantastic music like this. P.S.

Good musicians who care about their music by adding feeling. Eventhough it is hard at times to understand the vocals, the lyrics are powerful and delivered with meaning. Everything about this band is good. If you love metal, don't listen to the lame reviews about this band not being heavy enough.

So then a friend gave me a burned copy and thats when I thought to myself, \\"Is this supposed to be a concept album?\\" I ask that simply because the lead singer, sang in the same monotone growl on the entire album, the guitar work had the same chords the entire album and mostly all the songs practically sound the same. Its very hard to distinguish from track to track, only if you listen to this cd all day you will be able to tell the diffenrence.

Do yourself and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadows Are Security","review":"Shadows Are Security is As I Lay Dying's second album from Metal Blade Records. Just as in the previous album, Frail Words Collapse, this one contains Intense metalcore breakdowns with ferrocious screams.

I would recomend buying Frail Words Collapse first to get the feel for this awesome band.xx"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent CD from AILD","review":"This CD is an excellent follow-up to the already MAGNIFICENT Frail Words Collapse. I purchased this CD looking for more of the cream-filled deliciousness I found in the previous CD and this filled my desire. Confined is an excellent song, as are Meaning in Tragedy (#1), The Darkest Nights (#4), and Illusions (#11). What makes this CD a great idea for your next music purchase?

Firstly, any 23 year old woman who is intent on marrying a 36 year old doctor after knowing him for ten days is clearly a cause for parental worry! For the mother to throw up her hands and say: \\"Joey (the daughter) knows best!\\" is lousy parenting at best. Secondly, while I can appreciate the fact that the daughter was raised without prejudice, the fact that she seems rather oblivious to the fact that prejudice exists makes her out to be an incredible moron! Also, the fact that the character of the daughter is played by a complete bubblehead who is completely devoid of talent does not help this film!

Excited to have it among my movie collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dinner I don't mind missing...","review":"Maybe it's a case of needing to be there but I hated this movie! Yes...HATED! What a waste of my time.The token Hollywood Negro of the time chides his father with his -blah! blah! \\"I am a black man speech\\". Whatever. Does being a doctor give him a free pass against the reality of race? This movie assumes so.Maybe it's the time period but this movie tried too hard.I guess it was supposed to be an enlightening and daring look at inter-racial mating with the \\"correct\\" type of Negroe male hooking up with a white girl. Oh My!It was nauseating. It is celebration of false social pretense and bogus racial harmony.I realize Mr. Poiter is the sacred cow of \\"black\\" acting. I have never enjoyed any of his work. He always comes across as a long suffering yet strangely noble Negroe in every role. It's an Uncle Tom has gone to Hollywood type of display."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK For Its Time","review":"I guess this was an importabt movie when it came out, but when I saw it, it seemed a bit dated. Your daughter want so marry Mr. Perfect, so what's the problem. This wouldn't be an issue to me or to many other people nowadays, but it was apparently more loaded in the 20th century when race tensions were not quite as relaxed as they are now. Tracey and hepburn do a great job of portraying a very liberal minded couple whos convictions are finally put to the test, and Poitier does an excellent job of being every woman's dream fiance, but I still thought it was fairly dull. A sign of progress, maybe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, foolish, contrived","review":"Silly plot played out in cliches. Preachy and moralistic in a pre-cursor to 90's facile political correctness. A waste of Hepburn and Tracy. Right in line with Poitier's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is a timeles movie but, considering when it was made it was very daring for its day. All of the actors are perfect for their parts. I can't think of anyone else who could have done it better. The sad part is it was Spencer Tracy's last movie and he died shortly afterwards. But, if you think that the actress who played the young woman in love with Portier looks like she could have been Hepburn's daughter, you would be partially correct. She is actually Katherine Hepburn's neice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden love, daring movie.","review":"This movie was very daring for its time. I watched it on streaming Amazon video. Although a lot has changed, Romeo and Juliet stories never get old. Seeing these parents grapple with a tough decision, all the while having their child's best interest at heart and in mind is great. As is seeing Hepburn and Tracy's relationship. The daughter is a little idealistic and naive but all the other roles are strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Senior Living is Great at Harbor Chase","review":"Twice a week I volunteer at an Assisted Living Facility in Tallahassee, Fl.

One lady commented that she had never seen \\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\\" and if anyone had a copy she would love to see it. Nobody had it, so as a surprise I ordered it from Amazon for them to watch. They were so overwhelmed, said it was great, and loved it so much I gave it to them to watch over again whenever they choose. Thanks to them I am rewarded everytime I'm there and have as much fun as they do. I have also ordered from you The Help and plan to share it with them soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Movies","review":"Three of the finest actors you will ever see and an outstanding supporting cast in one of the most important movies of the last 50 years. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\\"","review":"The DVD, \\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\\" is a first class reissue in every way. Both color and sound are excellent. The story of a mixed race couple, first meeting in Hawaii and returning to San Francisco to meet their respective parents brought together, was a dangerous filming venture at the time. Today as before this film is very funny, but also very serious in its content.In 2011 it stands as a timely, clear reminder that racism is unacceptable. We humans all have the same origin, skin color is irrelevant. Enjoy the humor, but understand a very strong message, well expressed and acted by a brilliant cast. This DVD gets my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Well, I finally sat down and watched this movie. For it's time, I'm sure this was really pushing the envelope. I think it's kind of funny that an interracial couple meet in Hawaii and the white woman believes their children will grow up to be President. (Obama's parent's maybe?) Anyway, the performances were good...except for Katherine Houghton (Hepburn's niece.) I thought that she was too naive by half and listening to her made me cringe.. She was supposed to be 23 but she really acts 16. It didn't come across as mature love at all. Plus, I'd like it if Poitier wasn't a doctor. Why couldn't he have been the mailman or the manual laborer? There we would really be turning up the heat. The timeline seemed contrieved. There really wasn't a reason the couldn't wait 6 months. Truly, for the subject matter, the movie played it safe...and to that end I was a little disappointed, but this is still a movie worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Collection","review":"Fleming Rutledge is an Episcopal priest, and a well known preacher and teacher in more progressive mainline circles. I recently read her series of sermons on the passion entitled THE SEVEN LAST WORDS FROM THE CROSS. I found her writing compelling, thoughtful, and insightful.Each meditation begins with the Scripture text, moves on to her sermon, and ends with a hymn that brings the message of the text into song. My favorite of her mediations is the \\"Behold thy Mother...Behold thy Son\\" message. In this particular section of the book, she very clearly defines what she is NOT trying to communicate, and then very forcefully makes her case for what she does want to communicate. Her insights helped me understand the passage in a new way.If you want a Good Friday reflection that is both briefly written and deftly insightful, pick up this book by Rutledge.

I hate to exercise, but I can talk myself into 25 minutes at a time. This DVD contains 3 different workouts that are varied enough to prevent boredom and allow the viewer to choose just one or a combination. If you want to do more than one, you don't have to do two aerobics sessions; you can do a cardio (aerobics/kickboxing) and a muscle conditioning (chi ball) or strength and flexibility (Pilates). If variety isn't enough, the setting is beautiful, so, even if I am stuck in my living room, I can at least see the sandy, sun-drenched beaches of Barbados and take my mind off the yucky exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Exactly Deaf/HoH Friendly","review":"I originally purchased this DVD because it was supposed to be subtitled. No subtitles or closed-captioning to be found (I told Amazon.com to change the description).And to make things \\"worst\\" for those who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the screen shot focuses on several areas rather than the whole body view.Wish I could comment on the content of the video, but really can't if I couldn't follow the movements and instructions.I wouldn't suggest the Caribbean Workout series for those who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"much noise","review":"There are too much noise in this DVD, so I can not see.

It sounds like a great deal though, I hope other customers get to have it. What would have been courtious of the company is if they had at least apologized or said something themselves! Amazon sent the apology. I did not hear at all from the company. Major thumbs down, and I am a person that has never complained about a company mistake.

I have not yet tried to get the skin off, but my dad put the skin on and said it was very difficult. You never want to hear the words \\"Well, we shouldn't use soap, but...\\" when you are talking about such a nice piece of electronic equipment.It is true that after you close the dock access there is a bit of the iPod left uncovered, but it is just a sliver of space, and it isn't that big of a deal. There is some slight stretching, but after you adjust the skin a bit,there is a significant differance. I reccomend these skins because they are pretty, and because they will prevent the grubby fingerprints and scratches to the silver back."},{"rating":"2","title":"New generation on MPB!!","review":"With Adriana Calcanhotto, C��ssia Eler, Paulinho Moska and many others, Z��lia Duncan became one of the most important new generation's singer on the Brazilian Popular Music (MPB). Her album 'Intimidade' is easily a first team pop album worldwide as per its lyrics, rythms or magical compositions. The brand new album \\"ACESSO\\" is simply amazing and it realy represents the richiest brazilian criativity on swing and music matters. ENJOY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars content, plus 1 for great potential","review":"If you listened to all the tropicalismo-MPB stuff years ago and wonder why the U.S. is only now stumbling upon Caetano Veloso (how old is he now, 60?) and OS Mutantes (duh! maybe it would've been nice to hear about the band while it still existed?), Zelia Duncan and Adriana Calcanhoto are two interesting new Brazilian singers who write their own stuff. Duncan's singing voice is maybe even lower than Simone's or Maria Bethania's -- if you know these singers, you know that's sub-alto somewhere -- which will add interest value when your friends ask \\"who's that guy singing\\" and you hand them her CD. Regardless, her songs are tight and rock-oriented (no sambas, none of the interminable Buarque/Veloso/Djavan covers that even late-1990s Brazilian singers can't seem to stay away from). It'll be interesting to see how her career progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Immolation's Best!","review":"Here we are again. I wanted to review this disk again and give it another chance due to all negative feedback from my first review. The second time around is still not the charm for me. While I really like the new album (Harnessing Ruin) and Unholy Cult, this album is just boring. I saw Immolation live in Sac Town and they can produce a lot of noise on stage. They are a band you really have to pay attention too while listening to their music. I will give 2 stars and leave it at that. That's 1 more star than last time because I found at least 1 track that was memorable. This is by no means Immolation's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography disguised and packaged as art","review":"The title of this movie is about as far removed from the subject matter as is humanly possible. The box cover boasts \\"Possibly the sexiest movie ever made\\"...pure hogwash. This is a deeply disturbing film about a young woman who has no self esteem or sense of self worth who engages in sexual encounters more as a covert weapon against the man she loves than as a path to her own self fulfilment. There is nothing sexy about the explicitness. Actual fellatio, penetration and ejaculation are depicted, along with several bondage scenes, a rape and a murder. This movie left me feeling as though I'd wasted 98 minutes of my life and $14 on a DVD. The only thing 'groundbreaking' about this film is the place in the landfill where it belongs. If you're going to make a porno flick, don't try disguising it as high art and therefore 'legitimate.' One doesn't have to eat the whole egg to know if it's rotten. I threw my copy in the dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance isn't everything.","review":"The female lead is involved in a completely barren and unemotional relationship with her boyfriend. In an effort to 'jump-start' her life, she embarks on several pointless physical relationships... all of which lead her back to her original problem. She cant feel love, nor can she express it, though she wants to. This movie is typical of the French cinema experience... pragmatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On Now!","review":"Although intelligently written and acted, this film operates on two huge misconceptions: 1. A woman must debase herself in order to love and be loved. 2. There's a woman alive who can't be brought to pleasure by Rocco Siffreddi.Get real!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Erotic at all!!","review":"The prview for this movie advertised a erotic journy through female sexuality, and as a woman I feel this is definatly wrong I don't think very many sane women fanatize about being raped by a bum in any real way other than one of thoes passing disgusting thouts that pop into our heads every now and then. The boyfriend charactor in this film is appaling a control freak looking for an emotionless incubator. There is nothing even slightly erotic about this movie even watching recording of actual sex acts any possible eroticism is drained by the main charactor's apart dis-intrest. The part showing rape and a gang medical exams rid me of any sympathy I felt for the main character because not only did she set these things up she welcomed and enjoyed them. Also the only time I ever want to see the graphic closeup of a baby being born is if I rent a birthing tape. I am now wondering if I really want children that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring movie I have ever seen","review":"This movie is not erotic at all. It is slow and boring. The most erotic part of the package is the picture on the box. I don't recommend it to anyone who has something better to do, like watching soap operas.Sorry about it, Amazon, nothing personal. But I am dissapointed that I bought this movie, watched it once, and WILL throw it in the trash. I suggest Amazon provide a better way for us to find movies on its site. Unfortunately all the reviews I read about this movie were completely wrong. \\"An Eyeful\\" what a joke. Teaches me a lesson: don't trust what is written in the back of the boxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No date movie","review":"Do not be misled by the cover statements re:sexiness or eroticism. This is a nihilistic, stereotyping, sexist, film. It is an infantile and simplistic representation about the basicness of the female/male sexual enmeshment that spins the cycle of creation/destruction. While it does provoke discussion, in the end it is as intellectually and emotionally unsatisfying as a blank piece of paper that is presented as a minimalistic novel. If you've been depressed and comtemplating suicide, this one may send you on your way. By all means, do not watch this with your lover; it will put you off sex for days, or at least hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disfunctional Gobblygook","review":"One of the worse films I have ever viewed. The husband's character is unbelievable. The female lead is somewhat believable, but tedious and boring. There are lots of beautiful scenes and beautiful bodies, so visually it is extremely well done. There are not many films I can say that I hate, but this one is very close. I love foreign films, films with an edge but this was not interesting to me in any way. I feel robbed of my time and my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This movie is all talk and no action. The protagonist, Marie, is an unsympathetic person. you never care what happens to her. The film promises eroticism but never delivers.

It is cut, edited, in other words, censored. It's not just that the graphic sex scenes are cut and that much can be left to the imagination; it's that the cuts eviscerate the film. Breillat made the film in anger, and her anger is most evident in the explicit sexual scenes that were cut. What's left is drivel.I plan to ship it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavily edited","review":"I saw this movie at a film festival, and it was intended to drive home a point by shocking the viewer. A woman is upset by the lack of love she is recieving from her boyfriend so she looks elsewhere, and gets herself into a few uncomfortable situations. There are some graphic sex scenes which are a little bit unsettling.The version available here is so heavily edited (an entire scene that is crucial to the plot is missing, and others are zoomed in to avoid nudity) that you will fail to see the point the film is trying to make. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're easily offended or traumatized, slowly back away","review":"This movie is fascinating because it forces you to completely reanalyze your view of sex, however it usually manages to at least slightly traumatize most people that watch it. I've seen quite a few movies and this is one of the only ones I've watched thats really made me uncomfortable. There is a lot of sex in the movie and it is presented in such a way that you're not meant to find it pleasurable. Pay attention to the color scheme: red, white, and black. Why do you think that it's like that? What does this mean in the context of the movie? Prepare to be disturbed while you follow a nymphomaniac school teacher on a strange sexual adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Immature","review":"I first wanted to see \\"Romance\\" when it was released as \\"the most explicit French film in along time\\". The characters talk as if they were profound and enlightening, but it all comes off as rather annoying. If you do decide to check out this film, however, DO NOT get the \\"R\\" rated version. It cuts out 14 minutes from the original, and those sequences are badly edited out. Overall, this is a mildly amusing glance into the pathetic life of a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance/Bondage","review":"A psychological study into Bondage that is well done, interesting and not too scary!! Well written and preformed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confronting","review":"Emotionally lacerating, existential view of love and sex which has unfortunately been overshadowed by the film's reputation for graphic sex scenes.Certainly this film should not be seen by the prudish or squeamish, but I feel the message is only enhanced by the unblinking honesty of Caroline Ducey's confronting and courageous performance as a self-hating misanthrope in a loveless relationship. If you don't believe this type of person exists, you should get out more.There is much that is insightful and thought-provoking in this film, although a star is taken off for the disappointing ending, which is too pat by half.Definitely worth seeing if you are open-minded and questioning of the mainstream candy-floss depiction of relationships between men and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"about the movie romance.......","review":"The story is basically about a woman whom was refused sex with his boyfriend(could be husband) went to have sex with other strangers which in the end resulted in pregnancy.

Let's assume you are saying to the whole world something like this: you do need to learn english, we don't have any remote intention of learning your language. I would most certainly call this attitude an example of double standards. Do as I say, not as I do myself. Cinema Paradiso is a good exception of this \\"golden rule\\" of yours. It does include an italian subtitle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over","review":"I was so bored by this film that I thought I might be missing some subtle French cultural context or emotional triggers that would make it interesting. I asked a younger, French, female friend, who said she found it at least as boring as I did.The characters didn't engage my sympathy. Nothing explained why these people were even remotely interested in each other, so I didn't care what happened to them. Scenes like long car drives from the marriage bed to a first infidelity didn't build any dramatic tension or advance a plot or provide any interesting insight into the characters themselves. The sex scenes were banal and the bondage episodes in particular laughable.I sat through to the end, thinking there might perhaps be some breathtaking ending to redeem the wasted minutes. I want my money back. Plus damages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unromantic - but interesting","review":"A confrontational film - not just because of its more explicit sex scenes (but this is no porno). It is in fact so explicit that my country (Australia) banned it for a short time.A woman (Caroline Ducey) bares all in her search for love - but the love of her life doesn't notice her, even when she is being very intimate with him, so she finds sexual relief from Paolo, played by real-life continental porn-star Rocco Siffredi.Caroline Ducey goes through quite a lot for her role!I have to say it again; it is confrontational. In this respect it's similar to the Italian film Guardami, and another French film, Baise Moi (both of which I have also seen - the former is about a porn star who discovers she is terminally ill, the later is like an over sexed over violent version of Thelma & Louise, but is in fact a very poor film)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found it...tiresome....","review":"My advice is to watch this in French, which is less painful especially if you don't speak French. In English, its unbearable.Slow? At one point the DVD froze and I didn't realize it for several minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"A wretched and tiring movie with characters that deserve each other but that we certainly don't deserve to be subjected to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, this movie is exceptionally ...[bad]","review":"I was fooled by the 3 stars the movie rating had been before i bought it. Dont buy it! It's not worth the money or the time you will spend watching it.Anybody can write a plot like that. ...There is no soundtrack to this thing. There were times i could not take the voice of the main character anymore and had to fast forward...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak script, poor performance....","review":"Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top 10 or top 5 ? (worst ones)","review":"One of the worst films ever. Absurd. The whole story.In adition, tring to be an \\"important, deeply movie\\". Just pathetic. Don't even try to rent it, don't even try to talk about it. The sex scenes are awful too. Nothing to save, nothing to see, nothing...really, a full horrible experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"This move dragged on and on. There was very little action at all. There were often scenes where there was no conversation or action of any sort except for walking, or dancing, or just starring off into space. The movie was poorly directed, and the plot was thin. The director did not develop the characters well at all, and you never feel as if you know them at all. Even the sex scenes don't save it. The only thing that saves this film from getting only one star is the ending, which was a bit of a surprise. I would not recommend this film at all, unless you don't have anything else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rohmer film gone bad","review":"That being said, I enjoyed this film, although 'enjoy' is probably not the right word. It's a bit like watching a car crash, but one where no one dies. Lots of flesh on display, but nothing really hardcore. She massages a man to get him aroused, puts him in her mouth. It doesn't work. So she searches elsewhere and has a few 'wild' experiences (rape, bondage, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other side of Love","review":"This is a pretty amazing movie, that does get graphic in nature and crosses the line in parts of what is art and what is not. Very good story in which Caroline Ducey goes out looking for love when her boyfriend, Sagamore Stevenin refuses to pay any attention to her. Caroline's character finds love in many different forms, men and means. From picking up a lover at a bar (Rocco Siffredi), to finding an older man into S&M, to having a quickie on a set of stairs by a total stranger (which I think is the best segment). A great film from Catherine Breillat. Also check out her 2003 masterpiece, 'Anatomy of Hell', which also stars Rocco Siffredi."},{"rating":"1","title":"For women.","review":"This movie has excellent cinematography in the first half. (the beach, the apartment) Other than that the script is really bad. The main female character's ponderings on how men treat women are misguided. She is basically troubled and needs to get help. Her boyfriend is causing her great emotional pain, by refusing any sexual contact, but that is also her problem, she should leave him, he provides nothing for her. The sex is amazingly BORING, there is no passion, no atmosphere, no intensity, and no love. Its not a terrible movie or a classified B-movie, but it is not written well. It could have been better if the script provided deeper insights on the main character and allowed her more freedom to break out of her misery and just get a new life. She is only falling down a dark spiral trying to find out if sex can give her the love her boyfriend can not give to her. This movie really kills your libido."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought...","review":"This was basically porn with a story line. If you have interests in a film beyond that particular premise, I suggest you steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"The cover's sub-text states (a) love is desolate, (b) romance is temporary and (c) sex is forever. To me, this is pretentious. It suggests either a degree of titillation (placing emphasis on the sex) or a complete lack of belief in the emotional conditions of 'romance' and 'love'. What is in the film's favour is that (as in my other reviews of similar movies), the female perspective is worthy of exploration. The theme is one of unrequited love and desire from the man she clearly loves. This sends her to alternative erotic scenarios. If you want explicit sex, there's not much here, compared to others in the genre. An understanding of emotional and sexual disappointment is attempted.Ian Hunter.Author of \`e-Love'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth A Rental","review":"This movie is a tedious monologue interrupted by some fairly explict sex scenes which are clinically presented (it's one of the points of the film) and whose novelty quickly wears thin. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most Unerotic Hardcore you'll see...","review":"For all its explicit sex, \\"Romance\\" is a very very cold film. The problem lies in the fact that the star of the film spends 90% of the time discussing the meaning of sex and love during the explicit scenes that it becomes a complete turn off. But what I found more annoying about this film is that it is supposed to be about the liberation of a woman through her sexuality, yet the heroine constantly allows herself to be humiliated. This is not liberation...it is self-loathing. Proceed with caution on this one, it is not for everyone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Excuse For Romance","review":"Regrettably, Romance is a disappointment. If you are looking for an \\"adult\\" film that is both titillating and thought provoking, this movie will fall short on both. There is nothing romantic about the movie, the sex scenes may be explicit when compared to an \\"R\\" rated movie, but many PG-13 movies are \\"sexier\\" than Romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the point was?","review":"I watched the \\"edited\\" version on video. Perhaps the unedited would have made it more interesting. Needless to say, this was one screwed up, insecure woman who played her own games as much as the boyfriend she so wanted. I could NOT relate to her. There really was no plot. Her whinning soul-searching and her \\"intuition\\" about men and their dastardly wants started to drive me buggy. She should've dumped the SOB a long time ago. The end of the movie sideblinding me like a drunk driver - it came out of nowhere. I didn't get the artsy part of the flick and I didn't see what ANY of it had to do with female sexuality. Guys, if you decide to watch Romance, please don't think this movie is a model to all womens inner thoughts. I'd stay away from this self-destructive chick, and this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art? Porn? Breath Mint?","review":"None of the above. Pretentious in that particularly galling Gallic way, ROMANCE is one of the most turgid and unerotic pictures ever made. Featuring a heroine as masturbatory and irritating as any character from a Rohmer gabfest, this flick's too arty and pretentious to succeed as drama, and too woefully self-absorbed to succeed as erotica. The home viewer won't even have the incidental pleasure of moviegoers in the film's initial New York release, that of watching yentas of various sexes stifle alternating yawns and shudders of disgust as they struggled mightily to be \\"with-it\\" and wring every last drop of meaning from each unrewarding frame. If sex were as boring as its depiction in ROMANCE, the human race would have died out millions of years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"The only possible use for this movie would be to use it as a litmus test for potential lovers. If they like it, run.The central character needs to punish herself for the sexual ambiguity of her partner.

But unfortunately \\"different\\" does not always mean better. In this situation, it turns out to be much worse. Provocative, it is. Not because of the rather ugly sex scenes but because it is mostly degrading to women. But this may be excusable since the film is directed by a woman. More disturbing is the fact that this movie is presented to the American audience as an intellectual art French Film. Nothing like that, I'm afraid. French audiences passed it. Check it out but you don't have to like it to look intelligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This was a frustrating book to read. The author would mention a topic briefly in one paragraph, just enough to confuse me, only to \\"introduce\\" it and fully discuss it in future paragraphs as if it had never been mentioned before. If I had to guess, I would say it was written and edited in parts and never looked at as a whole to ensure that it flowed in a way that made sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breeding a Litter","review":"I have been trying desperately to find a book that would give me complete and detailed information as far as breeding a litter. This was not easy to do, but Breeding a Litter is a wonderful answer all book. For the person just starting out in Dog Breeding this is a wonderful source. If you have a question this book definitly has the answer. Great Book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get My Money Back??","review":"I found the author's views on early puppy socialization to be wrongheaded and even dangerous. With a large potentially aggressive breed the responsble breeder begins handling pups AT BIRTH. The daily frequent contact with pups enables them to handle stress and bond with humans from the beginning of life. It is a very poor breeder who does not handle those babies every day or even several times a day. Cutting nails, etc. begins later but holding, cuddles, breathing on, petting must happen at once. Worst book I've ever read on breeding and puppy socialization!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic and non updated","review":"This book was written 1n 1993.... even though the basics remain the same, there are other books on the subjet like the ones written by Myra Savant-Harris that are 100% more updated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Television has saved my life!!!","review":"I always knew that all those years I spent in front of the tube were not wasted!

How astute I must have been to sense that \\"Bewitched \\" was really a feminist's view of men in marriage. Reading this book has made it all so much clearer.

The psychological insights into so many of the popular 70's, 80's and 90's TV shows are hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tongue-in-cheek wit","review":"I have seen Dr. Will Miller on TV many times, as an analyst of our culture and media. This book shows the Other Side (another Dr. Will credit) of a bright and entertaining man. While the subjects (patients?) of the book may be fictional characters, the psychological insights are quite real. Therefore, within this well crafted satire, there are grains of truth to be had. This is a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick at Nite's Dr. Will Miller uses Classic TV for therapy!","review":"An expanded version of those clever spots on Nick at Nite, Dr.Will Miller's book uses classic tv as a metaphor for psychological analysis, insight, and self-help. For example, do you suffer from Barney Fife Syndrome? Is your Inner Skipper rising to counteract someone's Inner Gilligan?Who do you suspect of putting the ottoman in Rob Petrie's path? Do you travel on the bridge of the starship Enterprise, or in the cargo hold? Essays include \\"Lassie: Saintly Martyr or Severe Codependent?\\" and \\"If Only the Rifleman Had Prozac\\". The last half of the book contains in-depth analysis of thirty classic shows. While the book offers some fascinating and insightful looks at TV shows, TV characters, and our society in general, one must first sift through some overworked and tired attempts at humor. Still, if you're a fan of Nick at Nite or classic tv in general, this book deserves a spot in your bookcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was awful!","review":"This book was awful!

There seem to be comparatively few books written on the Marianas operations, considering its overall strategic importance in the Pacific Theater.However, I have never read a book with as many typos and grammatical errors. I agree with previous reviewers that the Civil War military analogies are way over done. The writing style in some instances was like pulp fiction.

Maybe Amazon will get the real thing in soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting a different film","review":"If you were looking for the highly praised Chang Cheh directed film (aka Unbeatable Dragon), this can't be it! The director listed on the box is a different name altogether, unless it is some sort of translated name. My recollection, in fact, is that the \\"other\\" film was named \\"North Shaolin vs. South Shaolin.\\" The production quality here is poor and choppy. In one sequence, in fact, the film frame is offset vertically where you see a thin strip at the bottom of the screen representing the very \\"top\\" of the film frame (how sloppy is that!). The fighting throughout is mundane. The final lengthy fight is reasonably entertaining, but it comes after 85 minutes of torture. The fact that this was a subtitled film, with cramped truncated subtitles, and not a dubbed film made whatever plot existed impossible to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned, this is NOT the Shaw Brothers classic","review":"I bought this thinking it was the Shaw Bros. classic movie wherein teachers from North Shaolin are sent to train the manchu's, they give a beating to the current instructors (the South shaolin teachers). The Shaw Bros. movie's english title is Invincible Shaolin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invincible Shaolin, as good as 5 Deadly Venoms?","review":"Fans of 5 Deadly Venoms, Masked Avengers, Flag Of Iron,Kid With The Golden Arm, will without a doubt love this film. Without giving away the entire story a short synopsis would be, the Manchus pit North Shaolin against South Shaolin in bids to get them to fight one another, there is plenty of action, excellent training sequences, and a great story which is easy to follow. I have seen many of the Venom stars movies and I must say I actually enjoyed this one a little more than the others. I would definetly recommend this movie to be part of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Venom Movies","review":"Just as I remembered.

Highly recommend this movie be added to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The lighting is poor, the subtitles are lousy, the cropping results in words going off both sides of the screen, all of which still can't distract the viewer from the fact that the story is mindnumbing.

There's an odd girl inside all of us and the stories told in this book tell the tales.

This is a MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Odd Girl\\" Lives Everywhere","review":"Odd Girl Speaks Out is a book that I can use as a reference in my position as a middle school administrator. The stories told by the teenagers in this book truly help to explain the complexities of adolescent relationships. I laughed and I cried at these bravely shared experiences that happen more often that we'd like to admit. I plan on actually reading some of the stories aloud to girls struggling to fit in with their peers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls, what about women?","review":"Quite amateur, really.The author should have also focused on women who form cliques in environments such at work etc, but sadly, this was omitted from the book. Cliques are found within adult environments too! Therefore, the book is not really aimed for adults, and yet, adults would be the main purchasers.In addition, the author did not attempt to explain why girls behave in this fashion, and could have used psychological and sociological perspectives to aid her. Instead, personal experiences were told by girls which did not really explain any real type of behaviour.Furthermore, the proof-reader did not do a very good job in finding errors, hence the poor quality of the text.I would not recommend this book, I am confident a buyer can find better elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Reading","review":"Black Church Beginnings by Henry H.Mitchell was very good reading. It was very easy to read inspite of the fact that a lot of history is used. I found the book to be insightful and inspiring.I did not care for the condition of the book which had a susbstantial amount of underline markings. Which in some cases made it difficult to identify what I thought was important as opposed to the previous owners perception.However \\"B.C.B.,\\" was intertaining and I would recommnend the book to anyone interested in knowing the history of black churches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"This book is not what I thought it would be. Instead of telling the story of black church beginnings it digresses,often times in the middle of a sentence to give you sources & a list of preacher names & churches. It lists names of people without giving a background explanation of who they are. There was not a very good flow to the book. I made it through half of it & completely lost interests. It was not what I was looking for & didn't reveal any hidden realities. This serves as more of a source book than providing history on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing but absurd","review":"I recently have become a very devoted fan of Jane Eyre, both the book and the broadway musical. I have also read Wuthering Heights a couple of years ago and think it is one of the worst books I have ever read. I picked up Crimes of CB thinking it would be interesting, and it starts out plausible enough, but then becomes increasingly ridiculuos. I cannot believe that one of the most beloved writers of all time would poison one sister and know that the man she married poisoned her other sister and her brother. This goes against every theme that Bronte wrote about in Jane Eyre. I would imagine that she would believe strongly in what she wrote. Jane is a very strong women, yet Tully makes Bronte seem so hopelessly infatuated with Nicholls that she will do anything for him. This book is also not particularly well-written, but I suppose it is kind of entertaining as a summer read. Unfortunately, I think Mr. Tully is only trying to make money off of the Bronte name."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE IS A LESSON HERE","review":"--always, yes always, read the reviews before you buy the book. I was intrigued by the title and the construct, same as \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" First, Mr. Tully never finds a voice; the lawyer Coutts is a credulous fool, and Martha has to be the maid from hell. His very shaky unsupported premise would be laughable if not so insulting to the reader. Mr. Tully should have been aware his title alone would attract some Bronte experts (I am not one), and that his gee-whiz revelations would be slashed to pieces. I felt sorry for the long-dead Brontes for having been treated so shabbily in print. Mr. Tully calls himself a \\"criminologist.\\" What a joke. I agree with another reviewer who would like to see Monty Python make a skit from the story. I see John Cleese or maybe Harvey Corman as the evil curate. Then again, Stephen King could tidy up the plot and scare us all to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish!","review":"I could somehow manage to read this book! I laughed at the too-much simple characterization of Bronte sisters: Charlotte the Evil, Emily the Good and Anne the Obscure. First of all, I was confused with the contradictory characters. Emily, who \\"loved all living creatures\\", could pass Nicholls' murder of her brother in silence. Nicholls was so ambitious that he would not marry a daughter of a mere country rector, but at last he was much satisfied to be a farmer in Ireland. This is a part of the contradictions. There are much more contradictions in this novel I do not wish to pass. This writer says that all Bronte works largely depend on Nicholls (who wrote only blunt letters in his life). What an absurd idea! I desperately wish this story could have a little more attractive ,either good or bad, characters and a little bit thrilling plot, not quite boring one! This novel taught me that one cannot make a pulling story, only with the name of famous people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Histrionic historical poppycock","review":"Having read a preview of this book and being a great Bronte fan, I looked forward to reading Mr. Tully's premises. Sorry I bothered. The only intriguing premise concerned the writing of Wuthering Heights. It is very hard to believe that Martha was so omnipotaent and that Nichols was such an ass. Patrick Bronte must have been deaf and dumb, as well as the whole township of Haworth to let this happen. A waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Crimes of Charlotte Bronte","review":"On the book jacket its says that \\"so dark and unexpected were the results of his research, he decided to tell the story in the form of a novel\\". Maybe it was because his research was shoddy and he had nothing with which to substantiate his ridiculous theories. One of his absurd theories is that had Bramwell been raised in a normal family with a mother's love it is likely that he would now have more fame and respect than his sisters. Even if the family was not normal, it certainly did not prevent his sisters from becoming famous and respected. Do I detect a little bit of old fashioned male chauvinism on Mr. Tully's part?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author\\"s story was highly improbable.","review":"The literary plan of the book made it difficult to follow; did Martha Brown really exist? The plan of the book made it difficult to know what was true or what was fiction. He started off with a bang and ended with a thud. A very highly improbable story.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe.","review":"This book was such a waste of time to read! I can't believe the library spent money buying it-but better them than me.The crimes imputed to Charlotte Bronte are nothing compared to those perpetrated by Mr. Tully in writing this book. He begins with a silly premise, and presents it badly. Granted, he is not a professional novelist. However,the absurd dialogue and plot development read like the work of a (not overly talented) high school student. If he has any derious knowledge of the Brontes' lives and work, little is betrayed in this trivial volume. According to an article in the BBC's online service, the author intended it as a work of nonfiction but the publisher would only accept it if he called it a novel.Perhaps the nonfiction approach would have been better, as Mr. Tully would have had to stick to the evidence of the alleged dirty doings at Haworth Parsonage. The book would in that case certainly have been shorter.Or beter yet, non-existant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is fine for kids.","review":"This book does not contain any useful information.

As you read it, you cannot help thinking of \\"Iraq.\\" Example: \\"This is an enemy we cannot defeat and an ally we cannot prop.\\"Adding to the tragic nature of this novel is the fact that its author, a Vietnam veteran, was convicted in 2003 of the murder of his wife and now serves a life sentence for the crime. A riveting documentary on the case \\"The Staircase\\" is available on dvd and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"Undoubtably the best I have read. Although stated fiction I feel it was a lot of his personal experiences. A sad time for America, all that lived through it will always remember it. History changes as time progresses but the honor pride and men of honor that stood and fought this war can never be forgotten.

Alison Goldfrapp delivers & builds on her dreamy & unfeasibly refined singing talents, with this, her 2000 debut \\"Felt mountain\\". More of a bittersweet, stylised theatrical concept album, within the first 2-3 minutes, the listener is whisked away to sunny pastures full of images of scenic rolling mountainsides, icy glaziers, and full green pastures.....It feels more in keeping with a cinematic \`film noir' soundtrack.....and Alison positively breathes life into every track she lays vocals down on, imbuing a sense of Elegance & refinement, rarely seen in this genre of music, and since Alison has followed up \\"Felt mountain\\" with 2003's Electro/Synth-styled \\"Black Cherry\\", this may be your only chance to sample her most successful (Artistically & Commercially) album."},{"rating":"2","title":"'I forget who I am'","review":"Alison Goldfrapp's voice is very sensual, smooth, and bold. Just like a good piece of chocolate, it just kind of melts and oozes inside of you. Her singing style is much like a 1940's lounge singer. In many of the songs she kind of whispers and drags her voice. The effect is very amorous, melancholy, and eerie.In many of the songs the music has strong pop beats mixed with violins and keyboards. The overall sound of the music reminds me at times of something that would be in a 1960's film. Though it does have some very traditional kind of 60's beats and sounds, it's still very experimental as well. It's like if Dr. Who, James Bond, Portishead, and Twin Peeks meshed the result would be this music.I love the lyrics. They're very innovative, original, and creative but not in a superficial, trendy way.My favorite tracks are Lovley Head, Pilots, and especially Utopia.

The combination of trip hop, cabaret music, electronica, pop and torch songs is captivating and makes for a pleasant listen, though it hasn\`t great memorable moments and sounds like a too linear, unsurprising record. It\`s not bad, yet it doesn\`t convince as a whole. \\"Human\\" is the best song here, as it contains the edge and energy that seems to lack in most of the moments of the album. Allison\`s voice is seductive enough, but the songs aren\`t too engaging, making for a decent if a bit flat debut. A listenable, moody record with little staying power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and a bit creepy","review":"Like most records that can fit into the mold of acts like Portishead, Lamb, Mono, etc... Goldfrapp certainly takes to those waters quite well. Fans of the mentioned bands will no doubt love this disc, but I feel it tends to take a bit too much from those other acts and thus, runs out of steam a little bit. This disc would have fared much better as a EP that featured the first half of the album.

Sometimes she can't barely be heard by the other party on the call, especially when the battery is low and the battery is ridiculously weak. With full charge and normal call numbers with normal volume settings, the battery only can last for one day!!This is definately the worst bluetooth ear peice I've ever seen.Keep away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"had to send back","review":"Not sure what to say product was defective.

It will not stay paired up to my phone which is a razr. Maybe with another phone it would but keeps disconnecting even when it is within two feet of the phone. The volume is not as loud as the Logitech that I have and the wind tunneling and background noise makes it hard for people to hear you. I drive truck and have a lot of noise around me and people have a hard time understanding me. My Logitech has no problems at all. So let's put it this way, anyone want to buy one of these let me know as I have one that I'll sell you with less than 1 hour of use on it.

The sound was very good, I had no problems with that. The battery save mode where it disconnects itself was annoying at first, but I eventually got used to it. However, less than 2 months after I bought it, the earpiece snapped and broke. If you buy this item, you better handle the adjustments with kid gloves. And if you try to fiddle with it while its on your ear, its just a matter of time before it breaks! I tried super glue... doesn't work. Therefore, I have a great headset that I can't use because the earpiece broke. The back of it says \\"made in China\\"... with that information, I guess 2 months of use should be about right ! Beware !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An ideal headset for MS Voice Command users","review":"Anyone who has a Windows Mobile device that is running Microsoft Voice Command knows that it is a great piece of software, but is very picky about the Bluetooth headsets it supports. I had previously tried and returned a Sony Ericsson HBH-610 after I found it would not run reliably in this setup. I was about to settle for the Motorola HS850 and its meager performance, until I ran across this gem.Not only does the HS-890 work well with Voice Command, it is a great little headset in its own right. The speaker volume is plenty loud, the earpiece is comfortable, and the noise cancelling processing seems to be effective in cleaning up background noise. My only wish was that it used a more standard mini-USB connector to the headset, instead of the micro-USB it comes with, but that is a minor issue. With all this, and at a decent price too, you can't go wrong with this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE HEADSET - DON'T BUY","review":"I bought this headset and discovered the exact same problem as another customer notes.

I am returning it to the store immediately. Do not buy this headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little thing","review":"I love it. Great clear sound, even if I am in a crouded place. I have a RAZR phone and this headseat works great with it. I had a Motorola HS850 and it was hard to hear when I had a lot of people talking around me, like at the airport, where I spend lot of my time so it was a good thing that I lost it and that I had to buy a new headset. This Anycom HS-890 headset is a great purchase for the price. I'm really happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfortable but only OK","review":"Honestly, I like my Anycom HS-777s better and that can be had for less than $20 these days. The sound quality is not noticeably better, though this headset is as good or slightly better than typical in this price range. It is comfortable to wear, though not as secure as headsets that put more of the bulk of the electronics between the ear and the head (like the 777 does), rather than hanging off the ear: turning one's head quickly away from the headset can leave it pointing out like an ear-flap turn indicator.The design is sleek and unobtrusive. Build quality is high. Sound quality is reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to work in TV?

At first, I was pleased with the watch. The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band. The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright. Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!). I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke. Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind). If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery. I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby. In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!! How inconvenient.

Jane Eaglen is a squally and dramatically colorless Elisabeth. She shouldn't have taken this role given the lousy vocal condition she is in. Waltraud Meier's voice shows much sign of wear and tear, probably a result of her taking on too demanding roles in the theaters. Yet, her singing of Venus still has much fire. I have almost no reservations for the men in the cast. Of Barenboim's conduction, I can only say that he is a dedicated conductor but is also one who at times fail to link up the different episodes of the music smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad blot on a fine recording","review":"Barenboim's conducting is superb, and most of the singers here are better than good. Unfortunately, the result is marred by the ungainly Elisabeth of Jane Eaglen, who is in very poor voice here. I believe an over-dosage of Wagnerian roles in recent years has taken a heavy toll on her voice and she often sounds strident and off-pitch in higher notes. Her phrasing is also less expansive than in the past. Furthermore, her interpretation lacks depth. What a bad blot on what is otherwise a fine recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egreggiooooo, Maestro!!!!","review":"Barenboim just signs a major achievement, one of the greatest recordings of this beautiful opera.

So this was the perfect solution, we can still have a trashcan and she is foiled by not being able to open the cabinet. The only thing is that the mounting did take additional workarounds as the cabinets are not thick enough for the included screws. My husband had to mount a base to the door to mount the grocery bag can. But after that little hassle, it is working wonderful! And it's great to recycle all the grocery bags!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Works as advertised! Well constructed and good looking. I mounted mine on the back of a storage closet door in my master bath and now have a hidden place to put trash.

The only concern I saw in the other reviews was about mounting. I found the smallest door you can mount it on is 16 inchs wide (my under-the-sink cabinet).

Big Lizard is much greater and more worthy of any self respecting punk rocker and Beelzebubba is more consistantly good. However, this album should not, would not, could not be ignored. Dead Milkmen are not a novelty band or a stupid generic pop punk band. They play punk, funk, psychadelic, and little bits of other strangeness picked here and there throughout the musical universe. They play music for children on lots and lots of LSD. That's what it sounds like. Its funny but usually not \\"ha ha\\" funny, just weird and goofy. For free spirits with angry punk energy. \\"Beige Sunshine\\", \\"Methodist Coloring Book\\", and \\"If You Love Somebody, Set Them On Fire\\" are three songs you can't live without unless you suck. The rest is just ok by Dead Milkmen standards but better than most albums. For people who listen to Butthole Surfers, Ramones, Ween, Devo, Circle Jerks, Dead Kennedys, and good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dead Milkmen album ever.","review":"I think that sums it up.. funny, witty, poignant, and not lacking in the social and political allegories, Metaphysical Graffiti has it all. If you are easily offended, this is not your album. If you are in search of biting punditry and probing songs, this is your album - just don't expect to hear any of these songs on your favorite \\"corporate\\" station.The last track is without a doubt the best thing the Milkmen have ever done... make sure to listen to the entire song, and you will be wondering about maggots that are 3 feet long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have loved the Dead Milkmen from the beginning and people thought I was nuts when this came out and I thought it was their best album. years later, I still think that is. I disagree with the other reviewer that thought Beige Sunshine was the worst track on the album. I think it's one of the better ones. I really like the \\"heavy metal\\" style that they're mocking here. It was cool when they did it live on this tour, too. I Hate You, I Love You is great as is Methodist Coloring Book, In Praise of Sha Na Na (even though Dean said he hates this one), and Now Everybody's Me. These are GREAT tunes and are on my all time favorite list in the DM library of tunes. Do the Brown Nose is also a classic and very humorous. This is definitely worth buying. If you haven't heard the Milkmen, this is the one to get. If you don't like this one, you probably won't like the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shadow of the real thing.","review":"If you really want to read this story then you will find a copy of \\"Thomas Wingfold\\" by George MacDonald.

Many of his works are available on line, I'm not sure about this one.

It is worth the extra effort to read the real thing instead of its shadow."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever","review":"This book is written by one of the greaters authors of all time. MacDonald spent a lot of his youger days with relatives in the country side. They owned a castle and in the castle MacDonald found the library. Beauty and the Beast style library. He would read all summer long and from this he gained a wonderful imagination which influenced his writing style. He wrote many great short fantasy stories, but this is a theological novel.

Metal Massacre X featured a host of exciting (and some less than exciting) thrash bands, plus an oddity or two. The entries from Confessor, Solitude, Nihilist and Slaughter (no, not that one) make this well worth checking out, but the female-fronted Wench track is pretty cool, and the crazy horn-dominated instrumental by Dan Collette is fun in a sideshow kind of way.No major success stories from this one, though Confessor is a very respected, if still cult, band and is still active today. If you're a fan of the late \`80s and early \`90s thrash sound, or just want to check out some lesser-known bands from that era, Metal Massacre X is well worth tracking down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Skillful by Wiersbe","review":"Want to use this study by Warren Wiersbe for his comments on Proverbs each day I read a chapter in Proverbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the point.","review":"This book is filled with easy to understand Skillful living.

The book provides a simple 144-question survey somewhat remniscent of those interest tests we all took in high school (would you prefer to play tennis or keep score in a tennis match? conduct research in a lab or sell books?). Each question gives two choices; you must choose one -- sometimes it is tough, but the forced choice leads to an answer.The book is most useful as a typing and diagnostic tool.

I also learned how Diana threatened the monarch with her behavoir, something I never understood until now and I felt differently about the whole thing, and understood both sides. I learned a lot about how royals raise their children and was shocked, but understood that it is how they are raised, and they know no other way. I also learned what the Queen does in official business and just how influential she is. She has earned my deepest respect and I have watched her intereact and must say that when she smiles it is truly captivating because it radiates from her heart. Great book!

He had the felt skin off this football in under 10 minutes, on both ends.

Most things tossed remain where they land. But toss this football and he will retrieve it and run around the yard like he's going for the touchdown. At this point, about 2 months after first purchased, it's split down the middle and barely holding together, but that makes no difference to Otis....in fact, he prefers it in this floppy condition.

A few minutes later, the squeaker part of the toy was exposed and the outer covering was fully pulled off one end of the football.

This is pretty much the opposite of what you want when you are buying a protective case. The idea is great and it looks cool. The flipstand works well and I like the fact that the clickwheel is available. If you are looking to put the iPod in the case and never (rarely) take it out, then it could be an OK solution. Just be aware that even if you are very careful (which I was) it will likely scratch your 3 to 6 hundred dollar investment.

Serving as an almost autobiographical account of Black's entire life, a certain familiarity with Black is necessary, as you must hear all the words in your head as you read them in Lewis' voice, or they lose much of their power. That said, considerable familiarity with Black's stand-up is also detrimental, because much of the book is reworkings of stories from his act. This is most true in the first third and the last two chapters of the book.All in all, I am glad I read it, and for anyone looking to not be a working professional, I give you your survival guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Intellectual Humor - most of the time.","review":"Mr. Black never fails to make me laugh. I found myself laughing right out loud on a number of pages - that can be a problem when you have a sleeping spouse next to you.The dedication of this book sums up the experience of the read completely:\\"This book is dedicated to all of my friends who helped me get to where I am today - you know who you are...and when I find you I am going to kill you.\\" Vintage Lewis Black. It's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious and poignant","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Daily Show and one of my favorite segments is Lewis Black's segment, so I ran out and bought his book when it was published. And it doesn't disappoint. It's part memoir, part satire, part rant, and very funny, but it is funny in and intelligent way. You have to have the right sense of humor for this book. If you voted for Bush, don't bother buying this. But if you like intelligent, insightful humor, then this book is definitely for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is most definitely a SNORE-FEST! First of all, if you're expecting this book to be mostly new material of Black's comic observations, it most certainly is not! The majority of the book is a pretty damn boring autobiography! And the few parts of the book that aren't boring autobiography consist mostly of Black's recycled material! For me, at least, what makes most of Black's comedy funny (or at least a lot funnier) is his comedic delivery, which of course you can't get in a book. Bottom line: ONLY read this book if you want to know about Black's pretty boring life, but I warn you--it's not very funny at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wry wit, good story teller, need more copies...","review":"Black engages this reader and makes me laugh aloud,hence I am here after the first fity pages to buymore copies for friends and relatives.What a pleasure to read on this Independence Day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version is More Expensive than the Hardcover???","review":"Really Amazon?

It's his life story, and it's really not that funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't.","review":"If you enjoy Lewis Black's stand-up routine and enjoy watching him on Comedy Central, you may be surprised to discover, he's written quite possibly the most boring book ever published. I listened to the audiobook, and it was like having Black himself telling me over and over what a bad decision I'd made.There should be a warning label. \\"Warning: Do Not File Under Humor.\\"This is NOT a humor book. This is an outrageously boring memoir of the high school, college and post-graduate years of an ordinary person who happens to be a comedian. I swear he even writes about being in student government. Student government!For those expecting a funny book, this is a serious bait-and-switch. I almost feel like it's some kind of creepy joke. I found myself wondering how many book editors tried to kill themselves while reading it.I don't know you, but I'm doing you a favor.

He's one of those people who have no problem pointing out nonsense and making fun of it. He should, however, give up reading his own books aloud and putting this rambling on cd. It's horrible. I haven't read the book, and I won't be doing so. It's just Lewis rambling on from subject to subject with no real point--and it's almost entirely boring. Maybe reading the book would have been a better choice, I'll never know. It should have been titled _A Whole Bunch of Nothing--with No Fricking Point_ . It's like Cheney trying to do stand up--except I think people would actually laugh at Cheney (you don't think you would?). Anyway, Lewis, love ya, but stick to stand up and give my money back, and give me the time spent waiting for something to come off this disc that was more than vaguely humorous or intriguing or something, anything. Ten thumbs down.

I have nature films of cranes of all types and prefer to watch those. My partner has this movie and loves it. I really did my best to keep my mind open and enjoy the movie but was met with deep disappointment. First of all it was boring! I never knew what they were getting at. It was horrible to watch them spinning chickens in the air, I presume a live tranquilized one. And the bit with the big thumbs so she could hitch hike better than anyone. Give me a break! The flock of birds flying to freedom was a nice touch. That's the reason I gave it one star. The birds outshined the movie. I know everyone likes different movies but in my opinion, save your money. Maybe you can play it the next time you have difficulty sleeping at night and catch a snooze. I'm glad I didn't have to sit through it at the theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is much better.","review":"First of all I read the book and then saw the movie. If you are planning on doing this then I'd say that you will be very disappointed. I loved the book and hated the movie. The book is about 420 pages long and the movie is like a clip show of the book. Highlighting the major parts of the book.I don't know if Gus Van Sant meant to leave out some of the (what I thought) best parts of the book because he felt that people should read the book or because the producers felt that an 140 mins. was enough. They left out my favorite parts with description of the \\"Clockpeople\\" and the and the ending in the book is great, and in the movie a couple main parts of the ending where left out. If you haven't read the book then do and don't see the movie, and if you don't like to read then just watch the movie. The only thing I enjoyed was the casting.

The confusing mess that was THE AVENGERS comes to mind (despite being a studio film with Ralph Fiennes and Sean Connery!). There was that horrific Batman movie that killed the franchise until Christopher Nolan resurrected it for Warner Brothers. I haven't even bothered more recent bombs like MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND (which I thought had a decent premise).But it doesn't really matter what grotesque misstep Uma makes next because nothing can be as head-scratchingly terrible, as mind-numblingly stupid, as frighteningly vapid as EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.If you're seeing something else, you're just looking way too hard.The acting is bad, the writing is nonsensical, the production is cheap (despite some excellent nature shots), scene after scene of Uma Thurman wearing ridiculous giant rubber thumbs makes you wonder just what kind of story could make this work. And that this ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Induced a blinding rage deep withing my soul!","review":"How could this \\"film\\" be credited with trying to capture the essence of the novel?!? Do not even attempt at THINKING of this film, let alone watching it, as it may cause you to doubt any faith you had in the human brain's capacity for creativity and artistic vision.The characters protrayed in the film are nothing like the ones you meet in the novel. Every facet of this movie is horrible. It's uncomfortable to watch. Maddening even, if you are a Tom Robbins fan.Do yourself a favour and read the book. Then read it again.

So if you like whooping cranes ALOT, you have reason to see this movie because that is about the only thing you'll get out of it. Even Keanu Reeves fans will be disappointed because he has asthma and can't speak. (He coughed out about 3 sentences.) There was potential; (a love scene between Uma and Keanu), but that wasn't implemented. Bummer.

It takes a point of view (early on anyway) that is not often done in science fiction, namely that we are alone in the universe. I was especially struck with the author's ability to make the reader *feel* what it might be like when we finally get out into the galaxy and discover that there is not only no other intelligent life but no other life of any kind--not even an amoeba. His portrayal of the effects that kind of discovery would have is as convincing as it is unsettling--which is to say very, on both counts.As to the rest of the book its a pretty good story, it certainly held my attention to the end. Well worth the time it takes to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What's up with this book? With Eternity Road, Moonfall and Ancient Shores I was so engrossed that I could hardly put them down. This book, Infinity Beach, is so slow and boring that I'm still not finished after a month or so. I've read many other novels since I started this one. I'm half way through and it still hasn't grabbed my interest. I might have to give up on it entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinity Blech","review":"Briefly, I could not get through 30% of this book; the characters were pasteboard, the settings were bland (terraformed worlds tend to be like that), and the pace dragged (as far as I read)....I peeked ahead and was dismayed that the main character was still stumbling over the same plots devices and still mumbling the same drek about longing for her long-disappeared sister. Jeez, that got old quick!How could a former Navy officer write a science-fiction chick-flick-book? Must have been really boring checking customs IDs in North Dakota.So I thought I would advise anyone potentially considering..but my hands are getting heavy..must warn readers..can't keep typing..eyelids lowering..head..sinking..ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"2","title":"good yarn but not his best","review":"I've liked every McDevitt book I've read so far including this one. In this case most of the story is enjoyable but every now and then it seems as if the characters are forced to make some astoundingly unlikely decisions in order to keep the plot following the outline the author had prepared ahead of time. For example, on two separate occasions, two otherwise intelligent characters are heard to utter virtually the same foolish statement as they lurch into harm's way with predictable results. I also found the main character somewhat unsympathetic (which is not the case in his other stories). If you like McDevitt you will like this book (but maybe not as much as some of his others)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what science fiction should be...","review":"I am a big McDevitt fan, and Infinity Beach is no disappointment. McDevitt combines his interest in science, archaeology and humans having to deal with the \\"we are not alone\\" problem into a trully fascinating story. The story captures you right from the beginning with an intriguing situation (having found something very interesting buried in the earth) and keeps you enthralled from that point on. Where did it come from? What does it mean? What do we do? To me, this is McDevitt at his best"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I want to visit Cabry beach!

When he is on, as for \\"Engines of God\\", the result is a poignant expoloration of the human condition within the context of the universe.Unfortunately, Infinity Beach falls quite short of these expectations. The beginning is wonderful, but then the execution of the idea fails. Character development is pedantic, and more time is spent on the actual footwork of solving the mystery, rather than developing the main theme of the novel.In short, the characters were un-memorable and it was a struggle to finish the book. If you want to experience the author at his best, my opinion is that you should read Engines of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's All Down Hill From Here","review":"Okay, first of all I'm a big fan of Jack's. The first book I read of his was The Engines of God. I'd give that 4.5 stars. It's still my favorite. I've read every book since and similar to Niven and Pournelle the quality of work declines the more Jack writes. This last book was down right boring. Where's the \\"ACTION\\"? The plot just rolled on and on with no action or intrigue. Even the ending left much to be desired. Based on how bad this latest effort was, I may pass on reading his next book. Jack needs to realize that it's quality not quantity. Pumping out a book every year doesn't make you a great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mystery","review":"Entertaining thriller. Nothing new here, and sometimes the characters behave in unbelievable ways, but good story with some compelling images."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"I can't agree with the other reviews. I was unimpressed with the main character, who came across wishy-washy and a slave to a plot who's mystery was no mystery whatsoever. The setting was also fairly generic, coming across more space fantasy than science fiction. All in all, I can't really recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"As usual, Jack provides you with a great read. I enjoyed the character growth of the heroine in Infinity Beach. She starts out actually comfortable in her life while she expresses that she would like to do more in her degreed profession. When push comes to shove, she doesn't want to change. So she is a reluctant heroine. Then she drags in another-who is as reluctant. I enjoyed getting to know those two characters very much.I enjoyed the tension of their relationship.The perception of clone development was interesting. The development of their personalities was similar to twins. As I raised twins, I saw the similarities. Before reading the book, I would have put clones in more of a mirror image, if I had thought about it at all.The reality of what happened was good. A bit of a surprise but one that fit right in with the characters. I do so love his character driven books. And the aliens? Well, you will just have to read it to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"I got to page 100 and gave up. It's not that bad mind you just so slow. I have read reviews that say the beginning is good and then it trails off... ouch! It's one of those books that I just did not care what was written on the next page. If you can't keep my attention after 100 pages...That being said, I will give this author another shot with another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it for the promise of the ride","review":"Jack McDevitt is one fine reason to keep reading science fiction. His future world is compelling and while short of the hard scifi I normally prefer, his tales are nevertheless, as Stephen King says in a blurb, \\"riveting.\\"This one fits the mold. It's a multiple murder mystery set in a future where starships are so common that rich people have their own starship yachts. It's an alien contact story, but I won't give away any of the other details. It drags a little at times, but you can always feel that the promise of the ride is just down the trail a ways.

I didn't read the ones in between that one and Little Miss Evil, but if they were like this one, I consider it no loss. The main plot was weak, mainly because of the topsy-turvy structure of putting the murder last. The subplots were weak and did not tie in. As a cancer survival, I was particulary put off by the insensitive way the topic was handled. It was all too clear that the author spent only enough time to read an article, pick out a few terms, and sprinkle them into the subplot. The story was a hodgepodge. The author owes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too underdone.","review":"I'm not surprised that so many of the reviews have dealt with the late positioning of the murder. I was distrated by it but only because what led up to it didn't capture and hold my attention. It started with the first chapter which was just a drawn-out string of references about cooking. Diane Mott Davison (Tough Cookie, Prime Cut)is much better with her protagonist, Goldy Schultz, at blending receipes into the narrative while serving up a good mystery. Part of the plot of Little Miss Evil dealt with the reoccurring appearance of the threatening note, YOU DESERVE TO DIE. Well, about half-way through, I was thinking the same thing about this pitiful mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"time to move on","review":"Lev Raphael's first short story that I encountered, \\"Dancing on Tish B'Av,\\" was exciting because it dealt with being gay and Jewish. From the first, I haven't liked his mystery setting, and this is the last one I will read. I am less than halfway through this one, and it is such a chore to read. I am sick of his characters and sick of their predictable behavior. He also gets way too descriptive; for example, exactly what people eat and drink (down to the brand name). It must be a technique to fill a page with words."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's murder in academia","review":"There are no dead bodies until well into Lev Raphael's latest academia mystery, but you won't miss them at all as you are taken along for a ride through backstabbing murderous university scenery. This is Raphael's best yet, in his Nick Hoffman series. Nick's partner is suffering from midlist writer's angst; the English Department at the university has been invaded by a best-selling harridan; and Nick is (horrors) finding that he's attracted to, of all things, a woman. Spicing it up is the usual cast of outrageous professorial and administrative characters that Raphael does so well. Hang on to your funnybone and enjoy LITTLE MISS EVIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sell-out","review":"Lev Raphael is suddenly so desperate to appeal to mainstream (i.e. heterosexual) readers that he makes Nick Hoffman question his homosexuality. I don't see Grafton, for example, having her protagonist struggle with lesbian urges. But it's not only what he did but how he did it. In order to develope this \\"crisis\\" he structures the story so that the murder is pretty much an appendage. The reader, in effect, is served a soap opera instead of a mystery. Ironically, this attempt to crossover is destined to fail, because regardless of the sexual orientation of mystery mavens, we expect a well-crafted story in the classic tradition of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad form, and Nick always had good!","review":"I didn't even make it past the first three chapters. The author's constant remarks about how over-weight this character was or how ugly this other one is made it a real drag. Why bring a mystery down to the level of insulting it reader's intelligence with diatribes about your stand point on what is \\"beauty.\\" It's a mystery novel.Of course from what I've read in the other reviews no real mystery happens. I know I wont purchase any further Nick novels... try Grant Michaels series about Stan Kraychik. So much better than Mr. Raphael's latest offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the drawing board","review":"The author obviously conducted an experiment when he tried to concoct a mystery without there being a murder until the end. The experiment failed miserably. I hope that the author now realizes that there are certain rules that qualify a story as a mystery and those rules are not to be breached. But as proven by able authors for generations, there is amble wiggle room within those rules to be creative, crafty, and devious, all to the delight of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misplaced priorities","review":"I bought the book months ago but recently got around to reading it. What a chore it was even though the book was short. I was annoyed at the structure (where was the mystery?). This was my first Nick Hoffman mystery but I was familiar with Lev Raphael through his essays about gay and Jewish pride. But in Little Miss Evil, Lev seemed more intent on trying to establish that gays lead \\"normal\\" lives than with presenting a real mystery. There are a number of writers who do a much better job with a gay sleuth, for example Fred Hunter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing there","review":"Mr. Raphael violated classic mystery structure by delaying the murder until near the end; yet, the book is still billed as a \\"mystery\\". It's not, however, anymore than a \\"romance\\" novel that places the meeting of the lovers at the end deserves its classification. Mystery readers are drawn to the genre BECAUSE they enjoy the properly sequenced journey from murder to uncovering the murderer. If Mr. Raphael was attempting to be innovative, he should have chosen another avenue, as do the best writers in the genre, who, nonetheless, still provide true mysteries. Mr. Raphael's reversal of structure was unsuccessful in presenting an engaging read. Not only was the build-up to the murder slugggish, there was never a doubt as to who the victim would be, or for that matter, who the kill was. The result was a non-mystery totally lacking in suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"What kind of whodunnit murder mystery plods clumsily along almost to the end before the murder is even committed? Answer: a poor excuse for one, and that's just what this book was. If that's not bad enough, the solution was woefully obvious, and that's coming from me, someone who needs a map to find his way to the bathroom. Raphael attempts to be comical and engaging in the dialogue but he doesn't have the deft ear of R.D. Zimmerman, for example. In fact, any reader looking for a great gay protagonist with creative crime-solving capabilities should forget this Nick Hoffman novel all together in favor of a master such as Zimmerman's Todd Mill series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"Raphael did a disservice to the entire genre by palming Little Miss Evil off as a mystery. By no stretch was it anything of the kind. Raphael is noted for boasting about being an escaped academic. The escape was only physical because he took with him a sophomoric tactic that college students are infamous for: padding a composition to gloss over the lack of substance. The dialogue between Nick and Stephan was more syrupy and inane than anything ever served up by Ozzie & Harriet. Predicting the direction of the plot was akin to doing the same for a mountain---you knew it wasn't going to move. How the publisher allowed itself to be part of this scam against readers is baffling. If it was part of a strategy to play out the remainder of a contract, I'm half-forgiving; provided, of course that the publisher now sends Raphael packing to peddle this padscratchings elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accuracy in Academia","review":"As academic life and the academics who live it become more bizarre with each passing craze-to wit postmodern rejections of science, administrative romances with accountability indexes, the promulgation of vision statements and mission statements ad infinitum, the seductiveness of distance learning-Lev Raphael's Nick Hoffman mysteries morph from satire to prophecy without losing a trace of their ability to make you laugh out loud. Case in point: Little Miss Evil, whose outlandish accuracy when it comes to such matters as mercenary departmental appointments, administrative fixations on fads like White Studies, and the general debasement at state universities of the liberal arts I can sadly vouch for. Since the tides of corporatism in the academy may well be irreversible, laughing along with Lev should help keep you sane.George Wolf Lincoln, NE"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT","review":"IM GERMAN SO I'M FAMILIAR WITH THIS PRODUCT .

An EXCELLENT book.","review":"Don't start this in bed like I did. From page one, I was completely taken in by the voice of Abby. It's shockingly fresh & honest.

I hope the author writes a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect book for a summer night","review":"I couldn't sleep so I decided to just take a peek at the first few pages of this book, hoping that would tire me out. Instead, I finished the last page as the sun came up. My 15-year-old daughter grabbed it as soon as she woke up and did not put it down until she had finished. We agreed that Abby's voice was perfect, the story was heart-wrenching, and the writing was excellent.

If she isnt from this background, than shes a mind reader.really an excellant book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"A book which grabs your attention immediately!

However, if I hear the word \\"weirdamundo\\" one more time, I think I will be sick. Using the slang of the teen was appropriate and did add much to the narration, but I think it was a little over-done. Enough of a good thing, already! \\"Weirdamundo\\" was used at least once, sometimes more, in every chapter. I get the point!! The over-usage of the word made me feel as if the author was trying a little too hard to convince the reader that a teenager was telling the story. I think I wasted my money! All of the reviews I had read were all in praise of this book. I was \\"fooledamundo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very solid book if you're looking to get ideas and determine your personal taste","review":"I bought this book to start getting ideas about remodeling a kitchen. I think the book is fantastic because it helped me figure out the types of things that I like and the types of things that I don't like.

I was mistaken and wish I'd spent the extram money on the Wilson rackets. Shoddy quality - the head on one of the rackets has already become loose from the handle and the netting is very loose.

These are fine for that purpose, but overpriced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris Hilton Dreams!","review":"Who would have thought Paris Hilton was sensitive enough to dream? This is the beauty of the book. It is filled with the dreams of celebrities from Madonna to Sophia Loren to Kurt Vonnegut, and yes, Paris Hilton! While the interpretations are terse and insightful it seems Lawrence is softer on the celebs than she is on stock traders in her column in Trader Monthly. She kills them ... but always with humor. All in all the book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irresistible!","review":"I received this book as a gift, and intended to glance at it before going to bed.

The films on here, for the most part, are a lot of fun to watch. My one gripe about it is this,there is no \\"play all\\" feature. With thirty films on this disc it becomes rather annoying to have to click through all of the menus and films one at a time. This could have been a five star DVD but the lack of a \\"play all\\" feature bugged me that much that I have to dock it one star.

Mauss might have been interested in Jung's concept of synchronicity as a form of sympathetic magic or even the concept of apophenia if he had lived when the word was created in the late 1950s.This book does not explain how magic works.

After a couple hours of use however, the batteries were dead. I replaced the batteries (SIX AA!!) and after using it a while I noticed some notes get stuck (some notes randomly sustain indefinitely, most likely the note-off midi message never reaches the computer.) I contacted the m-audio tech support and their solution was to power the controller with the supplied ac adaptor (making it no longer wireless.) Soon after the batteries ran out again, after only another couple hours of use, and I had the bright idea of putting in rechargable batteries. DON'T TRY THIS. The ones I tried got stuck and now one is jammed in forever. This isn't a very reliable keyboard, whether it be limitations in wireless technology or not. Expect to pay a lot for batteries. I would recommend a Keyrig 25 as a wired alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"make no mistake, this dub is first rate","review":"A fine selection of king tubby dubs.

Ms. Baer either ignored or failed to consult the more popular works on bloodhounds or the various groups that handle them. Her contention that bloodhounds do not make good family dogs is nothing less than intellectual laziness.Bloodhounds are wonderful dogs. They are very determined and curious. They need not work for a police force to be happy (as Ms. Baer would have us believe). All they need is a family that's firm and patient.If Ms. Baer was that far off the mark with bloodhounds, I could only imagine how deep her misunderstandings of other breeds must run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book on choosing a dog breed.","review":"The authors (dog trainers) seem to promote the sterotypes for several of the breeds described in the book. The primary sources of related experiences seem to be with animals with problem owners rather than animals from well adjusted owners/families. Having owned or grown up with many of the breeds described in the book, I can only say that the breed descriptions in this book are often slanted toward the ill-adjusted / ill-breed end of the breed spectrum.For a better guide look at The Right Dog for You by Daniel Tortora"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, practical guide","review":"I've read several books on dog breeds/choosing a dog, and I found this to be the most informative and practical. This book is written by professional trainers rather than breed afficionados. The descriptions of what kind of owner and home each breed needs are excellent. I also like the authors' plain talk about breeds such as Rottweilers and Pit Bulls and the damage done by careless breeders and irresponsible owners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"In a sentence: THIS BOOK IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! If you plan on buying a dog, please turn to a different source for information on breeds. The ideas contained in this book are so far off, so wrong, so ridiculous, that it is absolutely offensive!

Cancer hits with the power of a nine year old bully. Their album reminds me a lot of >INSERT TERRIBLE METAL BAND HERE< without all the biting originality. Cancer's lyrics touch on topics important to all Americans such as decomposing corpses, burning flesh, zombies, amputation, decapitation, pus, sores, scabs, and stagflation in developing economies. All in all, if you've got enough money to buy Cancer albums, do everyone a favor, and donate your hard earned buck to cancer research instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely simple book.","review":"I bought this book a few months ago for my 4 year old.

This is a book that helps me convey to my son the way I feel about him - in story form.The illustrations are also very nice and match the tone of the story perfectly. We like to read this at bedtime since it's such a calming little book. I look forward to reading this with my almost 2 year old as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raggedy Ann not in the story","review":"I wish i had known before buying this that this is NOT really a book of Raggedy Ann stories. It is a collection of quaint fairy tale-type stories written and illustrated by Johnny Gruelle in the 1920s, and so for the collector it may be interesting, but if you want stories with Ann and Andy, you would be disappointed. Also, it should be noted that this same book also appears under the title \\"Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy's Very Own Fairy Stories\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Good Music, Poor Sound Quality","review":"Here is another disc that has been mastered poorly, most tracks have mastering induced clipping and distortion as well as a severely limited dynamic range: in short, they sound like a loudness war victim. I don't know if the tracks were all mastered by one one guy, or if the remixers gave the finished tracks to Domino. It wouldn't surprise me if it was the artists themselves mastering these things so badly, as volume is king and most artists are terrified of having a quiet track--even if it means making it sound bad. Sound quality is not something most artists think of, it is almost always them telling the mastering guy to make it as loud as possible. They all want to have the same levels as the latest Miley Cyrus album despite the damage done to the music. Sometimes I wonder if they even care how their art (or should I say product) sounds.Look up 'loudness war' for more info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Fit A 40 Gigabyte iPod","review":"I really liked the design of this product, but it does not fit my 40 gig photo iPod at all. It gapes around all the openings, and is stretched to more of an oval around the circular click will.

It was a little difficult to put on at first, but anything brand new isn't going to fit perfectly the first time you put it on. I've taken it out since, and it slips back in without a problem. And because it is supposed to be a protective skin you can expect things to be a little tight.One thing that I noticed from a friend's case though: he has an iTrip, and had to cut out little notches in the top opening so that the iTrip would fit. I don't plan on using mine in my car for right now, but when I do, I think I might want to go with another case. However, if you are not one for keeping things as new as possible (like me) then you might not mind the small amount of damaged to the case. It isn't that noticable unless you are looking for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this product if you want real protection","review":"I purchased the Speck skin for my mother's brand new 4G iPod. I have one just like it, (by a different manufacturer) but it has a clear plastic membrane to cover the iPod's screen and prevent scratching. This brand, does NOT have a screen protector, rendering this pricey little number useless for the average consumer.If you want screen protection, DO NOT BUY this product, unless you want your scratched within hours. Unfortunately due to the way this is packaged, and marketed, this deficiency is not apparent to the average consumer. If you want a good case, make sure it protects the most sensitive parts of your iPod: THE OUTSIDE. Avoid cheap knockoffs like this brand, which advertise protection but provide none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok, but not the big thing","review":"The material is really good, but the design is awful, it does not take care of all sides of the IPod and it soon will break because of its poor design.

I was laughing so hard from the time it began until I had to shut it off to catch my breath. Just a candid, script-free sequence in which Moby walks around with a camcorder....it's funny! I haven't even made it to the rest of the DVD because of this portion! Buy this now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you all mad?!?","review":"This is the worst collection of videos that highlight exactly what a geek Moby is - nobody in these videos does anything, leaving the viewer wondering why they were made at all...The only good thing about it, and why I gave it 2 stars, is the remix section, which has some interesting visuals...don't waste your money on this ridiculous DVD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A long anticipated news","review":"Im a fan of this incredible, talented and multytasking artist, im waited for a long time to get a inteligent shorts of music, im called shorts because there are away to be Videoclips, MOBY has a great talent to make music and images, the compilation of his outsanding CD PLAY must be inteligent from the shorts, the menu and the package.Shorts from Porcelain to another hits show me that i dont have to wait no more, well a few weeks to have it in may hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"The incredible blurbs on the back cover of the book promise a book of great hilarity and insight. The bleak truth is that it contains very little of either. An obsessive self interest and self absorbtion drowns out any sympathy that you might want to give to Oliver Walzer. The star table tennis player schtick (borrowed from Forrest Gump) is extraordinarily tiring --you wanted to clout both central character and author with a racquet or something and have them wake up and talk about something else.This is a shame because I thought the current hype around his latest book was genuine discovery of a new voice.

Not knowing what to expect, I played it and was completely blown away by an original and unique mix of prog rock, experimental noise, 60's garage rock and punk. David Thomas' wild bellowing fit perfectly. During a year when disco dominated the airwaves, prog rock bands were truly terrible (remember Yes' Tormato?!), and the tidal wave of punk bands were often formulaic and predictable, Pere Ubu was completely fresh and different.I've listened to this album continually over the past 25 years.

Before I point out its flaws, I should point out that it's not a total waste... a few tracks are keepers. Under the Influence, Safety Pin, and Long Walk Home are all good... Better Days is ok until you've heard it for the gajillionth time, and The Milky Way is really keen but it's only 45 seconds long. The rest, unfortunately, blends together in one grey and uninspired blob. Basement Show, Smokescreen, Salt Bag Spill (what kind of title is THAT! ), and Billhilly are EXCEPTIONALLY bad. Adding to the disappointment factor of the bad songs on the album is the fact that the songs sound like a collection of Beck outtakes... it's really uncanny how much these guys rip Beck's style off. If you want weird (but good) music, I'd suggest you just buy Beck's Odelay, a far superior album to Mobile Estates. Steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a jalopy style cd","review":"I just bought this cd thinking all the tracks would be like \\"Better Days\\" but they aren't at all.

Hoping that this band had some more good vibes, I brought home Moblie Estates. The album is off and running with Under The Influence, and of course, Better Days. What follows is a disappointment. The next 4 tracks seem to be re-hashed remixes of the first two songs, and start off with energy, but soon fall flat. The album then hits a song that has promise, \\"The Milky Way\\" Unfortuantly, its cut at 45 secs, and is followed by the moronic Salt Bag Spill and Billhilly. In the end, in hopes of salavging the rest, we are treated to \\"Checkout Line\\" a song with good flow. The only problem is, we had to wade through nine songs to get there. In the end, I rather be \\"Wastin' away in the checkout line/losin' time\\" than losin' time listening to Moblie Estates."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET","review":"This CD is good if you're not into typical mainstream music.

Everything from the the writing itself to the hero that didn't believe the baby was his - even though he didn't take any precautions or a paternity test. I love reading about unrequited love from the heroine's POV and hard to get heroes, but only when the book is written well. This one wasn't. The heroine was like a love sick fool over a hero that didn't seem to want her and did everything to prove it to her. One minute he was declaring his love for her at 34 percent in, and then at about 37 percent he was kicking her to the curb and cheating out of nowhere. If I could sum this book up with one word, it would be depth-less. I've read a few books by Diana Palmer that was quite enjoyable but this one must have been one of her first ones because it screams amateur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loveplay review","review":"The book I ordered was delivered very fast after I ordered it.

Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction & Loud","review":"I have had this product for over 2 years now and decided to come back and review it. The blade is very very loud and get extremely hot when edging my beard and hair. The shell of the unit is made of plastic and the motor inside gets extremely hot to the touch. The 2 blades are separated by a thin plastic or cardboardish material that broke within the first 5 months of personal use. This causes the blades to not align very well at the point of the actual cut. Think of where the teeth from both sides of the blade meet. Since the material is so flimsy made, the teeth don't always align very well, and consequently don't cut a sharp line around the hair or beard line. This will be the last Andis I ever purchase. Poor construction, loud and hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this item six months ago and it worked well for five months and then it stopped working. Low power.

These are the best trimmers I've owned. I have been good at giving myself a cut, but had some old cheap Andis home set and adjusted my clippers to be nice and sharp, so it did both jobs pretty decent, but after 4 years, I decided to skip replacing the blade again, and go for a trimmer and clipper combo. I got the speedmaster 2 and the t-outliner.The blade is sharp alone, and can be used for cutting beards lining up, and shaving to a 5 o clock shadow. I decided I was serious about getting a real shave like experience, so I bought the primate blades and it really makes sharp lines. I don't get pull, and the motor I smooth and quiet. I promise this will do what I say.STOP BUYING TRIMMERS FROM WALMART, AND GET THE REAL DEAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"Provides a close shave. I can't use a straight blade razor anymore because it gives me razor bumbs as do some other electric razors but this one is good. Others have complained of it being noise but it is very quite. My fiance can't even hear it runniing when she is 20 feet away. My older recharable razor was much louder. This razor is also powerfull. It clips hair with little effort. You will need to adjust the blade to get a very close cut. Look on YouTube for a video to see how this is done.

No clippers / trimmers will get you as clean shaven as a razor, but the Andis Trimmer works great.Pros:Great product, Near razor close shaving.Cons:No storage bag. The blade was blemished.

To that I told him. maybe you should shave faster,(lol) and he said regardless, it shoudn't get so hot, that he has to put it down, let it cool off and the start again. He did some research online and saw that there was a cooling oil you can purchase for it , to help with the inconvenience...I think it should have recommended that during the purchase.

I jumped on it and (while scared to death of cutting my throat the first time using it..) followed the tutorial. After that, this trimmer cuts super close. On my neck it's equivalent to using a razor. On my cheeks it doesn't get as close but it is still clean. They do get hot but I haven't had to stop in the middle of a shave to let it cool down.

It is very sharp so don't press too hard against your skin. If I were purchasing again I would probably not get the 'T' blade.

Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Starstruck","review":"I bought the album when it first came out so I was amazed to find it on CD. I bought it at my first opportunity and I am not disappointed. It is a product of the '80s to be sure. I can tell especially from the cuts produced by Narada Michael Walden: Rhythm of the Street, Hot! In The Flames of Love and Starstruck. I like the urgency of \\"Rhythm of the Street\\". \\"Hot!\\" sounds like a retread but \\"Starstruck\\" really gets to me with those finger snaps before the downbeat. It brings up good memeories. \\"It's Gonna Be Special\\" is pure pop to me, but Patti makes it count. The other cuts don't impress me as much, but they are all eminently hummable. This is a solid representation of Patti Austin as pop diva."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ive heard in ages!","review":"I only have one fault with it though, on some tracks the guitar, bass and drums drown out the vocals, which is dissapointing because Christina's voice is excellent. I think the best song on the album is 'swamped' due to the fact that both the vocals and the music is great. I could listen to this album every day. Lacuna coil has enspired me to start my own band so hopefully someone will be writing a review on my music one day in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Group!!!!","review":"Lacuna Coil is a highly underrated group. They aren't given the credit they deserve. This album is a must-have for any fan of Evanescence. The sound is very similar, but Cristina has her own vocal quality different from Amy Lee's of Evanescence. If you're looking for the sound of Evanescence with a touch of a stronger grunge sound, this is the album to purchase! This album contains a great variety of music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap","review":"Boy, this band is overrated. Just because they have a pretty lead singer, they get to be on Ozzfest and in every rock/metal magazine? I bought this cd out of curiosity-Big Mistake!! The band sounds like they just learned how to play their instruments last month. There are absolutely no riffs, just bar chords chugging along very uninspiredly, backed up by Casio-sounding keyboards. Kinda sounds like Europe (remember \\"The Final Countdown\\"?) with a (more) female singer. Don't waste your time. Makes a great coaster, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Comalies a Few Spins to Fully Appreciate Its Beauty","review":"I must admit that being this was my first Lacuna Coil CD, I wasn't that impressed with it when I bought it about a year ago. I gave it just one play and I didn't like it very much. Recently I went on Amazon.com and read all the great reviews and thought that I must have missed something big time. The reviews here are right...thanks guys! I wiped the dust off Comalies and gave it a couple more spins. This disc really grows on you with each listen. I don't think many will be blown away the first time you hear it (I wasn't), but now that I have played it in my car for two weeks straight I absolutely love it. Comalies features great atmospheric songs and a very good female singer with a haunting voice. I can't think of one below average song out of the 13 and that is a feat in itself. This is a very good album and I will be looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacuna Rules!","review":"This is the greatest CD that I have ever bought.

I think that Lacuna is way better than evanescence.This band needs 10 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Female vocals drowned out by bad mix","review":"I had high hopes for this album, but the mix is not very good. The female vocals often come out as vague vowel sounds and the male vocals are lackluster. The songs have simple setups and melodies and is, overall, uninventive. The only song which shows promise is \\"Aeon\\" and they chop that one short. Sorry, this band is mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Colossal Waste of Money","review":"Maybe I've been listening to too much Nightwish. But after carefully listening to Lacuna Coil's Comalies a few times, I still didn't like it! I found the melodies repetitive and the lyrics meaningless.Yet it was the singing which disappointed me most. While not as bad as some other reviewers suggested, it was still worse than I had expected. Christina Scabbia may very well be a \\"good\\" (or even a \\"great\\") singer but I didn't hear it here.Her voice did not \\"stand out\\" in any way for me like Tarja Turunen's or even Mariah Carey's!Too bad my online speakers aren't working. Otherwise, I could've saved myself some money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMFG...this music is crap!","review":"For some reason, I've heard that Lacuna Coil is similar the band Evanescence. And I've even heard that the female singer for Lacuna Coil has a better voice than Evanescence's Amy Lee. Out of curiousity, I decided to buy this CD and listen to it. I listened thouroughly through each and every single song. And guess what? It was an absoulte waste of my time and money. The male singer's voice sounds like it's dying in excruciating pain. However, the female singer sounded ok. But I must say that her voice sounds very typical and ordinary, unlike Amy Lee who has an amazing and unique voice.I don't understand why people would like Lacuna Coil over Evanescence. Evanescence is obviously A LOT MORE BETTER (not to mention a lot more succesful). But your opinion is your opinon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plegh!","review":"Hmm...How boring does it get. Well if you put a track on repeat you probably wont notice when it starts or finishes as there are no defining moments on this entire cd. Cristina is slighlty flat but brilliant compared to the male singer. Listen guys, sing in your own language! When rammstein sing in german they sound great, in english? Well try not to laugh. Itallian is such a sexy language, it would be 10 times better in Italian. I speak from experiance. I live in spain and when my freinds sing in english, no matter how good they are in spanish, it sounds bad, if the pronounciation is slightly off or if they are struggeling and concentrating too much, which leads to sounding robotic. This is the problem here. Chow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot hold a candle to Evanescence","review":"This band has potential if they could record better songs. We need a few more female singers in Rock 'n Roll but there's no way in Hell that this girl or this band is even close to the talent of the band \\"Evanescence.\\" The song Heaven is a Lie is about as close to a good song as these guys can get. The recording has that Janet Jackson Mish Mash where there is a lot of ground noise.....not a lot of differentiation of the instruments. The used CD stores should have a bunch of these CDs for less than $4.99 I hope this band will get rid of the male singer's influence and concentrate on writing good rock and roll and featuring the female voice in the band a lot more.10/21/11 - additional comments. LOL@the Coil lovers....this band makes albums with one good song and the rest are really hurtin'. I stand by my comments....Coil needs to ditch the guy singer, write better songs and lay down cleaner tracks. \\\\nn/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame.....

I have also got all CD's of Nightwish and yes it's also great but male vocals are horrible :(All songs on this CD are very catchy and you easily sing to it :)Do yourself a pleasure and buy Comalies couse it's really good album better than this crappy Fallen from Evanescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!","review":"The band seems to finally live up to its potential and promise. Gothic Metal giants Lacuna Coil have hit the jack pot with yet another smash hit of an album. The vocals continue to definitely be the featured instrument--both in talent, and also in production. Evanescence may have got the popularity, but Lacuna Coil surpasses them in many ways. The steady and mesmerizing \\"Swamped\\" opens the project, while a good chorus marks \\"Heaven's a Lie\\". \\"Humane\\" is liquid and moving, \\"Tight Rope\\" is good, and the title track features some really nice bass work. This is one of the best Gothic Metal CDs of all time, but for the best in Gothic Metal check out Virgin Black."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH","review":"This is the best new music I've heard in 10 years. Every track is well worth listening to (many times). I compare them to no none because they are in a league of their own. I have listened to everything on all of their CD's and cannot recommend them high enough. If you want a real treat try ComaLies or Unleashed Memories, you will be glad you did.I have seen Lacuna Coil live (twice), they are a true force with REAL talent! ROCK OUT LOUD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GET RID OF THE MALE VOCALIST!!","review":"This band has some good music, but the male vocalist has simply got to go. He contributes absolutely nothing to this album (except making my head hurt) and ruins almost every song on the disc. And after you get rid of him, turn up the volume for the female vocalist! If you just had her singing, even though she doesn't appear to have the vocal range of Amy Lee (Evanescence), at least LC's music is much less Top 40-ish and the guitar work is better. Without the male vocalist, this band could be much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely unbeatable","review":"From the chilling beauty of \\"Aeon\\" to the agressive passion of \\"Angel's Punishment\\", Lacuna Coil's \\"Comalies\\" is nothing short of a masterpiece. Thier style is something similar to Paradise Lost in that they combine the sweeping romanticism of Goth with the heavy guitar riffs of metal, but really their sound is all their own. The vocals of both the female and male singer are outstanding as well, not to mention the deep lyrical content. All in all this is a band you can't afford to miss. Skip over the joke that is Evanescence and listen to the group they wish they could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta wuv it!","review":"I bought this CD in my favorite store, Hot Topic, although my caretakers told me not to, but I had to. I just can't put down the CD! I'm giving 5 stars cuz it's Lacuna Coil is much better than Black Eyed Peas (Cristina Scabbia is the dramatically Gothic version of Ferge; Andrea Ferro is a deliciously creepy yet rockin' version of Will.I.Am.) And plus, Cristina and Andrea never talk about drugs, money or sex like most rappers do (Kelis is a stupid cow). So, I'll gladly have Cristina and Andrea show those rappin' stupid cows what it's like to stop talking about sex, drugs or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I found Lacuna Coil's \\"Comalies\\" to be bland, generic, uncreative, and most of all - boring. I'll agre that Cristina has a decent enough voice, but the band regulates her towards the eye candy role; she should sing more and they should dump that use twit that thinks he can sing. Never showing a hint of creativeness or agressiveness, this CD is pure generic \\"goth\\" rock that is depressing, and not in the sense that the lyrics and music are conveying a sense of depression. It is truely depressing to listen to for it's lack of creativeness and expression. Recommend for the MTV cum faux goth wrist slitting crowd that is so 'depressed' because their lives 'suck' so much. Yeah, whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"I bought this album because I heard that it's good and similar to Evanescence. I was not disappointed. Every song had melodic metal in it, which are the type of songs I really like. Cristina Scabbia also has a melodic voice, and Andrea also sings good. The only problem with this album is the lyrics are too repetitive and they should spend more time adding more lyrics instead of constantly repeating the chorus. My favorite song on this album is The Ghost Woman and the Hunter. It's a sad and melodic song. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough","review":"this is quite a good album and cristina does have really quite a good voice. th album is sorta let down in parts by the guy backing her, in some cases its not THAT bad.i orignaly bought this album cuz i had heard their song \\"swamped\\" and couldnt get it outa my head... so i got this home and stuck it in my cd player and i have to say that i was sort of dissappointed at first but i thought that it was probably one of those cds that you have to listen to a few times to totaly get into them, so thats what i did and it did grow on me. i havent listened to it since the summer there so maybe ive forgotten parts of it but id still recommend it to ne one, they are nothing like evanescence btw! but, yeh, id recomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-buy","review":"this is an awesome cd. the male and female vocals intertwine perfectly. I can honestly say there's no horrible tracks on here; one or two seem a big long in parts, but that's it. \\"Angel's Punishment\\" and \\"Heaven's A Lie\\" are my two favourite songs, but the rest are pretty awesome too. they are able to blend melody and heaviness in a way that's so catchy. what else is there to say? it's an awesome band, and I'm glad to hear they're Italian too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!","review":"I am a predominately hip hop/r&b/Alternative listener and I overheard the song \\"swamped\\" and I loved it. I borrowed the album and I have yet to stop listening to it. I went and bought a copy and I've been to 2 shows. They are Awesome!!!

However, after receiving the actual CD's, I was grossly disappointed...The male singer absolutely, unequivocally ruins every song he joins in on (which is 90% of the time). This in turn just makes the music seem clown-like, pathetic and campy at best. Very sad - I really wanted to like this band. They should eject the male singer and let Scabbia take the lead entirely to herself. Pathetic...Just wish I'd known this before I wasted my cash on not one, but two of their CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"I got it on time and I'm more than happy with the condition it was in.

In fact they are my top three favorite bands at the moment.However, I am a bigger fan of Evanescence, which I bought first. There is no need to bash Ev. So big deal they are not as metal as LC? Evanescence is still a popular and talented rock band, and Amy Lee has an amazing voice as well. I think one can find some similarities between both bands. I think people can like both bands and appreciate all their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"Comalies is a great album, with tight harmonies between male and female vocals that give it a distinctive sound over an unfalteringly solid progression of powerful music. This band has a lot of energy, even when they slow the tempo down. They have been compared far too many times to Evanescence, due to Evanescence's hit single \\"Bring Me To Life\\" which also features a male and female pair of singers. However, Lacuna Coil's music stands up to repeated listening more successfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE OF THIS PLEASE!!!","review":"This album is perfect every song is perfect.Get This truly a masterpiece for any rock or metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Join the Spiral","review":"The Italian band Lacuna Coil (meaning Empty Spiral) is one of those missed musical gems.

Really. Cristina's vocals are hauntingly beautiful (yes. I know that that's all you've been hearing in all of the past reviews. But there really is no other way to describe it.) It may have been better if she had sung all of the vocals instead of Andrea, since she has a better voice (... that's just my opinion.) but it's okay. She does get her own song in \\"Ghost Woman\\". Er, my favorites are \\"Swamped\\", \\"Aeon\\", and \\"Ghost Woman and the Hunter.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"Comalies is one of the best albums I had heard during 2004. I played it on repeat, learning the lyrics and melodies by heart. Cristina, has a beautiful voice that captures so many emotions and the songs are so lush and captivating. It is probably one of the most unique CDs I have ever heard.The best tracks on here have to Heaven's A Lie, Daylight Dancer, Ghost Hunter and The Woman and Unspoken. The lyrics are deeply complex and the music is deeply beautiful. But overall, this album is nothing short of astonishing.As far as Evanescence comparisons, not necessary, because Lacuna Coil is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!","review":"I bought this CD based on the first two songs that I heard at the mall. On the soundscan. Love it. Can't wait to get the other 4 albumns. The only thing I can't stand is that guys voice. Andrea whatever? Christina is awesome!! If you have bought all the Lacuna Coil Cd's Check out The Gathering. There great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a few words","review":"I got this as a Christmas present after asking for Comalies (it was accompanied with all their other releases that I hadn't asked for, too). It's been in my car for the past few days. From what I've seen I must be a misfit of sorts because I think AEON is a great, beautiful song. I don't know what everyone's gripe is about. (Probably that it's not your standard heavy song... so what.) Christina's voice is stand out throughout the CD. Heaven's a Lie is of course their radio single which is what got me interested in them in the first place. Overall, a very good release... cool CD insert too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence WHO?","review":"Lacuna Coil is one of the most beautiful melodramatic bands I have heard. I don't see the comparison between Lacuna Coil and Evanescence. Lacuna Coil sounds different and by-far better. They have something called talent. Cristina Scabbia has wonderful vocals and they are awesome to be seen live. Listen to Lost Lullaby and Stars if you think they aren't good. Evanescence is one-hit-wonder pop rock and has nothing on Lacuna Coil."},{"rating":"1","title":"....What the hell","review":"My friend made me a mix cd a few months ago of her favorite songs. One of the songs \\"heavens a lie.\\" I loved that song. And I seen it was compared to many of the other bands I liked so I dieced to check them out. I knew I like the \\"heavens a lie\\" song was good so I thought the other songs would be just as good or better. But man was I wrong. The other songs just sound the same. You wouldn't know if the changed the beat of the song because you feel so exhausted from hearing it. The male vocals screws up the material completle. The band sound like a new garage band. The only part of the band is that it makes me laugh =). And P.S this band isn't in the catorgory of \\"gothic\\". I know what gothic music sounds like and this isn't even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, save your time and money!!!","review":"I have been a true Lacuna Coil fan for the past 4-5 years. However I was awating this CD to come out and I decided to listen to it first, and boy am I glad i saved my money. lyrics by far not as passionate, male vocals suck. Female vocals are not frequent enough as in there previous albums. I really think that Lacuna Coil should of broken up if they were going to do something so horrible.

We tried one as a frozen drink using our Cuisinart ice cream maker and it was done in about three minutes without any ice. That gave us the idea to let it go longer and make mocha ice cream. WOW. THIS STUFF MAKES FANTASTIC ICE CREAM!!! We used three packs, mixed with the right amounts of milk and added to our Cuisinart ice cream maker. When it was the consistency of a very thick milkshake we added crushed oreos to it before popping in the freezer. This was so good that my husband and I agreed it was store-bought, best-ice-cream-parlor-in-town good. We will probably use this on a regular basis now as an ice cream base because it comes out as a creamy ice cream without eggs or heavy cream or any of the cooking you have to do for making ice cream.

His descriptions of color, shape, and form are reflective of his artistic background, and quite entertaining (if you like rambly 19th Century prose, of course). I like the book; I have a first edition of it, in fact. I bought the Kindle edition so that I could peruse at will, in bed, without crumpling up said lovely first edition. I was dismayed to find that the digital formatting in this illustrated edition is such that every few paragraphs are interrupted by five lines of textual image captions without associated images. The images are elsewhere in the digital copy. The constant interruption is incredibly annoying and ruins the flow of the text. I'd recommend that you read the book, but stick with the paper copy until a better Kindle version comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Truths Rule","review":"This book points out the limits we set up for ourselve and provides a more informed perspective on how we see ourselves and operate in today's fast paces world.

At first I could not believe that I had found a system that has gotten such positive reviews. By chance, it was offered on sale at Circuit City for $159. I have never hooked up a system like this by myself and thought it would turn out to be such a hassle. However, it only took me abut 90 minutes to connect and mount all of the speakers and have the system ready to go. The system delivers crisp, clear sound even with the coax cable. It picks up the smallest backround sounds that regular television speakers just can not pick up. For its price and quality, it was one of the best investments in home entertainment that I have made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a small room","review":"I don't have much experience with home theater sound systems.

This inexpensive Sony (HT-DDW670) unit got good reviews here so I decided to try it.Setting it up was not difficult. It worked the first time I turned it on, and it works very well indeed.

It doesn't take long before I am completely stunned by the simplicity and overwhelming sorrow and seeming transcendence filling my ears. It's as if I am being exposed to the most utter sadness buried beneath the most inspiring melodies ever created by the human voice. I am compelled to imagine a group of men and women standing inside a dimly lit, distant and drafty church eight hundred years ago. The wind is cold while the fire is warm, and the calm of night is broken by these collective echos of loneliness and strife being sent out into their brutal and disconnected world.The musical form stems from an inspiration that one finds rare in this age not so much because of its origin but because of its sheer force. The entire enterprise is haunting, uplifting, and calming, and the effect is to show that although humanity has become smarter, stronger, and perhaps even more just, it certainly has not become more beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"X- Loc is wreckin yall niggaz","review":"i listened to \\"HOLE\\" for like 3 months st8 on repeat... this cd is off the chain... buy all the x-raided cds to see his lyrical skill mature into the siccest flow in tha us... props ta BLH & SICX....

This Walkman is durable (I have dropped it a few times, and the CD didn't even skip when dropped, and the unit still works wonderfully!). It is also relatively simple to operate. However, I do not like the buttons or display window much. The buttons are hard to press one-handed, and the display is hard to read most of the time. The buttons and display are located on the edge/circumference of the Walkman rather than on the nice, broad top, making it difficult to access them. NEVERTHELESS, if you want a quality Sony product at a good price and you aren't terribly bothered by button or display ergonomics (I am not), this is a Walkman for you.

Although the characters look great, I have to agree with another reviewer that the darker side of Stephan Pastis' writing is very prevalent in this DVD. The \\"meaness\\" of the characters toward Linus was terrible. Linus' withdrawal and feelings were almost painful to watch. I know that in Peanuts, the characters do not always treat each other well but this time, I cringed watching it. My twelve year old daughter and I both felt it was very dark.

We were all pretty disappointed though. It seemed to be so mean spirited. Lucy was just over the top in tormenting Linus about him having to give up his blanket when their grandma finally arrived. Snoopy was also downright mean instead of playfully mischievous. The feel of the 60's was there but I didn't think it was necessary to keep the lines about calling each other \\"idiots\\" was still needed. I won't spoil the ending but it does sort of eventually redeem itself. The whole duration though was kinda \\"meh\\" and we felt the characters were mean instead of playful.

This is painfully obvious in this latest offering, and if it's any indication of where the Peanuts franchise is going, this will be my last purchase. The music used to be the best thing about Peanuts, but \\"Blanket\\" offers a bland, featureless score with nothing of the childlike quality Vince Guaraldi's work ensured. The humor... well, there isn't any. It's got none of the humor that was the lynchpin of Schultz's comic strip -- \\"COMIC\\" being the key word here. It's not funny. The old ones at least tried to remain faithful to the original strips, but not in this one. I respect the, \\"trying to make it your own\\" spirit of the director, but your version is bleak and dull, much like other offerings by younger directors who are missing some vital sense-of-humor and musical style chromosome. Don't buy this one, folks. And steer clear of the other Warner Bros Peanut offerings.

The other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up, or headshots only, so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine, you can't even learn it, because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet. Also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming, picking up on a different beat to where it left off. All in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $4.86 paid.

It is about a lonely white blood cell named Osmosis Jones (played by kid rock) who is on a body wide search of a suspect virus that no one believes he has seen. Drex (David Hyde Pierce) is the fast talking, proper cold aid who, after seeing the commitment Jones has, joins him in the search for Thrax (Lawrence Fishburn). Bill Murry plays the host body, along with Chris Elliot as his best friend.This movie has plenty of twists and turns, and the thrills of a live action police movie. It is relatively medically acruate too. The reason that it is PG-13 is due to some of the semi-violence, near to bad language, and the inuendos. Overall, a very funny movie, and if you watch this with a 9-10 year old and explain all of the puns, should be enjoyable for them too, but not really for anyone younger than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I bought this video for my classroom and I was disappointed that when I put it into the DVD player I got an error saying that there was a region error.

It's about Hitler. It's about Wagner's The Ring. It's about incest. If that doesn't get you in, nothing will. But beware, the book is long, detailed and eccentric in style. It tells you a great deal about the rise and fall of Hitler. It is very knowledgable about the operas, and the main characters are a pair of non-identical twins who are lovers.

But as a Dutchman I can tell you there is nothing 'cheesy' about this album. Patricia Kaas has sold over 1,5 million albums in Europe, and this is sure to be another succes. Produced in part by Phil Ramone, it contains aching ballads and swinging uptempo popsongs. Personal favourite: 'J'ai tout quitee pour toi' track #4. All songs in French except 'Don't let me be lonely tonight', a duet with James Taylor. GREAT ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool, sexy, soothing, emotionally engaging, among others!","review":"Wonderful CD of Patricia Kaas. I have \\"Scene de vie\\" and \\"Tour de charme\\" and her very latest, \\"Le mot de passe.\\" This is her best so far!

Very sophisticated sound from Kaas and collaborators. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully diverse melodious CD","review":"Kaas' best CD that I've heard yet, although I only have 2 others, \\"Scene de Vie\\" and \\"Le Mot de Passe.\\" You're completely captivated from the first cut to the last, and there is quite a range of musical styles on this one--Kaas is at times a pop balladeer, and others, almost a torch singer, and then there's Kaas, la chanteuse. This CD possesses many lovely melodies, musical arrangements that cajole and surprise, and, of course, Kaas' sultry voice with its touch of vulnerability and toughness all at once, that goes directly to the soul. It also makes for wonderful driving music. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaas for Us","review":"Patricia's voice simply cannot be forgotten once heard. Not only because of its intrinsic qualities (that hot, sultry sound that reaches your deepest sensations), but for the marvellous tunes that she interprets.This is one of her finest albums, you cannot loose if you buy it.And on top of this all, she's got one of the most beautiful pair of eyes ever in show biz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"If I had to sell all my cd's and could keep only one, this would be my choice.

It was a movie trailer we'd watched and gotten worked up for and we were excited for this activity. The movie was terrible. I couldn't sit through it. It was corny -- the plot was bad and had a terrible arc, the colorful characters a messy blur, the acting was so lame and cliche. There is not good lesson to take away from this movie except if you call nonstop fighting between every possible historical hero a good lesson.

There isn't a lot of character development, the new heroine, a famous aviator, seems a little too hot-to-trot, the new villain, played by Hank Azaria, one of the best voice artists has an odd, lispy accent and there are a few other things I could mention. In spite of all these little things, the movie ends up being fairly entertaining. It's a pretty decent mix of contemporary gags mixed with historical references. Some of the historical jokes might be even better than the original, but the storyline isn't quite as good. It almost seems as though they were inventing things to fill a sequel. However, if you liked the original, you will probably like this movie. The first movie was a pleasant surprise. This one is just an acceptable sequel, but that's OK. It's still worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Family Fun!!!","review":"This was a really good sequel, and makes a perfect Christmas gift! After two years, Larry Daley creates a Glow-in-the-Dark Flashlight for his new company. He soon finds out that the exhibits are being moved to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C. Larry gets a call from Jedediah, saying that Dexter stole the tablet and Ahkmenrah's older brother, Kahmunrah tries to use the tablet to take over the world. Kahmunrah builds an evil army by using Al Capone, Ivan The Terrible, and Napoleon Bonaparte to stop Larry. Larry receives help from smokin' hot Amelia Earhart played by the beautiful Amy Adams. Together, they try to stop Kahmunrah from bringing back his 3,000 year old army.

It blows my mind that Hollywood continues to churn out these incredibly stupid movies and pass them off as entertainment. I am able to engage a suspension of disbelief in order to be entertained, but I find movies like this, an insult to adult intelligence. In exchange for the current crude humour, we get dialogue that sounds like it was written by 2 12 year olds. And Hollywood wonders why the attendance levels keep nosediving.

The quality of the Blu-Ray is great, and technically, it's fine. The plot is fairly elementary, however, if you can call it a plot. And much of the writing is unsophisticated and somewhat contrived.

It could of been so good if they would of cut 90% of these scenes out as they were not necessary to the story.

Very uninpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is awful.","review":"Hip Hop has come a really, really, really long way since the Native Tongues Family. Anyone who has truly cared for and followed the genre over the years knows this.This particular album is a thin imitation of the late 80's innovators. The beats are old (read: played out). The lyrics go nowhere (and sometimes even sort of stupid).For those who follow, love, and believe in the genre of Hip Hop, I recommend that you skip this album.But for those of you who think the Tribe Called Qwest's \\"Low End Theory\\" is the greatest album ever made (yeesh), then maybe you will enjoy this wack piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give It A Chance","review":"This album is one of the most refreshingly different albums I have heard in a long time. It shows that there is more to hip hop than talking about the clich��d themes that are in so much rap heard today. Don't get me wrong I listen to all sorts of music from Stevie Wonder and N.E.R.D to Ben Folds/Five and The Pixies, so I'm not saying that other rap artists aren't good, U.D are just a funny intelligent alternative. Finally, to 'a music fan from Harlem' a Tribe Called Qwest's \\"Low End Theory\\" is not the greatest album of all time but it is one of the best. If you were a true music fan you would respect U.D and A.T.C.Q for daring to do something different even if you didn't like it. Their music is not an imitation they are just influenced by other artists that they respect. You can appreciate good music with out loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be True to HipHop by buying the dopest record this year","review":"Einstein is the best producer in hip hop right now, using real samples and beats, unlike that fake keyboard wackness. Though many question the complexity of the lyrics, the emcees specifically made their lyrics easy to understand so the masses could feel it...trust me, I have all their demos and it is way to complex to even try and understand. You know they come off dope, so don't front, spend the measly $8 and sit back and remind yourself what real hip hop used to mean...

If you ever visited there on Labor Day you would see where Clay got his talented back ground. Now I live outside Richmond, VA and we would like to see Clay in our area soon.

I haven't seen anyone else try to explain horse linguistics before ~ not explicitly, at least. For that chapter alone, the book is very worthwhile. Otherwise, it is a little light on the theory. However, appreciating the horse's understanding of us will (hopefully) make the rider much more respectful, careful, and ultimately more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding!","review":"Having listened to a few recordings of this very great composer of the20th. century--Shostakovich--I could humbly say this collection is the very best.

This has that plus some interesting character development, captivating plot, and sub-plots that all hang together. That coupled with the near-future time frame in which the story takes place all combine to make this a \\"very good read\\". Who doesn't love a race, and when the race involves getting to Mars and back coupled with characters in closed environments that have to deal with life threatening situations it all combines to make this a real page turner!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Mars Book,Futile binding job","review":"I, too had my copy fall apart in my hands as I read the book, which I thought was excellent. The story grabed my attention like no other since Rendezvous with Rama, 25 years ago. I finished the book in 3 days as I couldn't put it down ( maybe for fear of loosing some pages!!). It was an entirely realistic story and I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't really happening, that it was fiction.

A hard glossy finish. I am not sure what kind of edition this was but it was not what I was looking for. In the description it did not mention anything of the sort. I went to a dealer here locally and purchased a signed first edition hardcover with dust jacket for under $30! I donated the copy I recieved from Amazon to a public library. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Binding Falls Apart","review":"An excellent story ruined by the WORST binding effort I have ever seen. The book literally fell to pieces in my hand after only a few pages. I guess it says something about the story that I even bothered to fight to the end of it. No chance of a re-read. Unless you're willing to deal with loose 25 page sections, I would just look for a copy at the library. It will not survive to become part of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-paced, interesting Mars novel","review":"This is near-future, hard (no \\"warp drive\\", ESP, or even nanotech) SF. Benford doesn't really milk the tension of the race to return from Mars, which is probably a good thing. Instead he mixes that drama with character development, the story of exploring Mars, and trying to survive on Mars. All in all, it's a fairly well-paced book. It never really elevates itself to a gripping, \\"just one more chapter before I go to bed\\" level. But it never really drags either, so I never really found myself bored and wanting to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Alternative to the Classical Big Guns","review":"Franz Xaver Dussek shouldn't be confused with the younger and more familiar (or less unfamiliar) Jan Ladislav Dussek. This Dussek was a contemporary of Haydn and enjoyed a successful careers as a pianist and keyboard teacher. He entertained Mozart at least a couple times at his home, and Dussek's wife sang in some of Mozart's early opera's. These three sinfonias are in the Early Classical style, and in my estimation they rise above the great mass of other compositions of this type and era. And there are some moments, such as the first movement of the E flat major Sinfonia, where the level of invention deserves repeated listening. If you're looking to take a break from early Mozart and Haydn but still demand quality and personality in the music, this disc should provide some satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"euro synth club a la Anything Box","review":"This album is a great collection of depeche-mode sounding songs. Kind of like Anything Box or Camouflage, as well. The rhythm is very clean and sounds nice on a good system with lots of bass and treble. The mood is pretty sorrowfull and mellowdramatic, and the beat is late 80s euro club. This group is from San Diego. I remember as a kid in the late 80s going to see this band perform at a small underground club in Tijuana called \\"Paladium.\\" There is a song on this CD called Russian Radio that everyone here in San Diego knew the lyrics to and would sing at the clubs in Tijuana on Revolution whenever the DJ played it. Sort of like how people all knew the lyrics to Bizarre Love Triangle or something. This group has come out with a few albums locally over the last few years. They are still making 80s euro disco. It's kind of erie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry Halloween","review":"This is the genre of music that I call: 'Machinery.' It's a synth-techno replete with machine-like sound effects. Red Flag is one of the few groups that employs this type of element into their works. But, they are very talented, and do it effectively. I have yet to listen to Red Flag's other albums, but this one is really cool. The remixes of these songs (I can't remember the name of the album, though, that contained the remixes) were done by Red Flag, and aided by Info Society's Paul Robb and other noteworthy musicians. They're really 'bitchin' as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depeche Mode Lite","review":"The later half of the 80's saw more than a few bands trying to capture some of that Depeche Mode magic, most notably Camouflage and Red Flag. Imitation is the highest form of flattery, but it also leads to questions of originality. If you're a big Depeche Mode/synth-pop fan, and you can stand to be insulted by this sort of flattery, pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best synth-pop albums ever!","review":"I am so glad this album is available as a reissue for those who missed it the first time around. Unlike many of the more recent synth bands that sound kind of amateur, the production quality of this album is on par with any major release. This album is like a cross between early 80's Depeche Mode and early Anything Box (a band that actually came later, but serves as a good comparison). More bubble-gum than Depeche Mode, but essential for any fan of dancey euro-synth style music (although Red Flag are American). My favorite song is actually the ballad \\"Rain\\" which to me is Red Flag's equivalent of the classic Depeche Mode ballad \\"Somebody\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as Depeche Mode.","review":"This has to be one of the best albums I have ever heard. Techno/Synth pop just like Depeche Mode. I remember seeing them in concert (sitting front row) in Jan. '90'. I own all of they're other releases after this one.

Although the phone is very sleek and stylish, the battery life and reception on are the worse. I have had so many problems with this phone when placing calls and using Nextel's Direct Connect service that it is not even funny. In addition, the phone is always redialing, especially during off-peak hours. Although Nextel is most popular for their Direct Connect Service and Free Incoming price plans, they are also known for their poor reception. Truth be told, if you go Nextel, buy one of their older model cellphones such as the i95, i90, or i88. A large number of my friends have those models and they never had any trouble out of them. Before this phone, I had both the i530 and i730 in less than a year, and they were a mess as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go buy it!","review":"I paid $150 extra plus tax to get a cool looking phone and it was not worth it. I went to the Nextel Support Center near my work to check if there was anything they could do -- nope -- the guy showed me a wall with the discontinued phones and this was the first one displayed. He said that was probably the worst cell phone ever released and everyone is having problems. I bought the service plan and he advised me to call and explain the problems I am having in an attempt to get a new cell phone. Common problems include: call gets dropped, from full bar to no service, and no service in key locations such as my work, my drive to work, and home.

It's a cute phone -- I loved the bronze color and the lightweight feel -- but for God's sake, if I wanted to take a week to get a text message through, I'd write a letter.I really don't know whose bright idea it was to add the unnecessary step of signing on to the 'net to send a message, but it made the whole process about 82 steps longer than it needed to be.

I was hoping GaoGaiGar would be similar to Godannar, a recent, terrific robot fighting anime that has similar-looking people (due to having the same character designer). But the two shows are completely different. The directing for GaoGaiGar is awful, the music ranges from bad to downright annoying, and the show has no plot. It's just a 50-episode long \\"working\\" show where the same repetitive thing happens over and over with every episode.GaoGaiGar feels like a cheesy robot anime that might have been made in the mid 70's. However it was actually produced in 1997, so it's recent enough that no excuses can be given for the poor way in which it was made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Super Robot Anime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The people that have been complaining about GaoGaiGar are idoits and all they want to see is Robot Anime with no plot and episodes dedicated to fanservice and ridiculously giant boobs!!!

I'm told the series picks up later on, but that's a terrible disclaimer and I'd advise anyone against wasting an hour and a half of mediocrity in order to possibly reach something worthwhile. The first 2 episodes end literally the exact same way and the 3rd is only slightly different, so much time is wasted with recycled animation, the characters are 2-D, the designs are rather stock, and the sound editing is terrible; non-dynamic with start/stop music.Even if this is meant for little kids, they deserve much better. If you're looking for a melodramatic, exciting, super robot anime nostalgia, the values this series has been attributed, buy Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann; Don't waste your time and money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seizure Causing Robot Show","review":"GaoGaiGar was advertised as a giant robot show made by fans of giant robot shows. If that were true it should have been more like Godannar, Gravion, New Getter Robo, Dai-Guard or Kirameki Project.

The songs range from slow-burning to fireworks with some serious guitar work throughout. Along with the bar-busting tracks there are a couple of rock ballads that showcase Dyanna's sultry vocals and a bluesy offering with some guitar riffs that are reminiscent of the old masters. There are also two cover songs that successfully pump new life into old standards. The end result is clean sounding rock-n-roll without all the distorted racket that many artists use to make their work seem creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad item description","review":"I thought I was buying the main grille insert, but it was the bumper insert.

He covers all the bases that anyone who wants to market themselves and build a consulting brand should cover. His points about establishing separate brands or positionings for each area you work in is an excellent one. Too many consultants think that they have only one brand and this book convinces you that you can have several. Alan also talks about his marketing gravity concept, which every consultant should employ. Everyone who consults should read this book as well as the entire series he is creating. If you are successful as a consultant, or want to be successful, or want to continue to be successful, follow Alan's advice.

I doubt the negative review is based on actual reading of the book. For consultants who are rushing from \\"fire to fire,\\" this is a great resource to slow us down and tackle the longer-term marketing which will result in business pursuing us rather than the other way around. There is nothing revolutionary here, just solid, pragmatic advice to use tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authoritative and Informative","review":"Dr. Lee earns his praise in this genuine examination of these pertinent and riveting cases.

Don't get me wrong, that's not to say that there aren't a couple good points to this book, but in this novel they are few and far between. Which, is rather disappointing considering the great things Hickman was able to do in the Dragonlance world.I really wish I could say something positive about this book, but in the end I just can't do it.

It takes some getting used to, but once you've adjusted he's very pleasant. Listen to the samples for an idea of what I mean.

This book is for EVERYONE - not only for parents of children with disabilities - but for their families, the therapists and the neighbors - it should be used by universities in training social workers and counselors - it should be found in the waiting room of pediatricians offices- I hate to think that there would be anyone would would miss out on reading this book - it is certainly eye opening not matter your situation in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth of it All","review":"An excellent read that shows what people can overcome even in a time of continuous challenges.

Dawn Atkinson showed the emotional turmoil she was going through and the strength she found to fight back. I have gained a deeper understanding of what it's like for anyone involved in the life of a special needs child, or anyone fighting to show they are somebody and not just a number. I learned that we can disagree and sometimes we know what's best for ourselves or our loved ones. This is a very touching story and I recommend it to everyone.

However, most of the families have at least something positive to say about their child and sometimes even about the people they never would have met except for the tragedy that occurred. Although this book does demonstrate how important it is to be an advocate for your child, I am reluctant to share this book with parents of children with disabilities because it is so negative. I would hate for a new parent of a child with a disability to feel that they only have continual struggles ahead of them with no hope of joyous moments.

Still, I highly recommend this book to anyone intrested in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great account of an interesting battle","review":"This is really a great read.

We had a terrible time putting the framing together, and it was impossible to attach the plastic tarp to the frame, without figuring out our own way to secure it. Once secured, the framework bows in several places, and it looks terrible. We had such a terrible experience assembling this (although we've put one up each summer for the past 8 years), that we were not going to return it, and go through having to erect another.

The author introduces us to an artificially constructed man, and can't seem to make up her mind whether he has no human emotions, some of them, or all of them. McHugh also confuses us with the idea of jessing, where one is biochemically and emotionally linked to another, then treats such a supposedly strong bond as if it were weak and easily breakable. Also, the romantic story here is forced for the sake of the plot. I put it down before too long, unwilling to suspend my disbelief. Sadly, this story needed another revision before publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick read but where was it going?","review":"Ok I picked up this book because of the Amazon list suggested it to me.

Fifteen? Twenty? Nekropolis doesn't really have a plot. It is made up of 5 sections, each written by a different character. Unfortunately, the character selected for the main focal point is a miserable creature of victimhood. See if you can follow this logic: Our heroine's brother is caught having an affair, therefore she decides she is unclean and must sell herself into chemical slavery. And yet, her sister seems to have no trouble finding a husband and starting a family. Several characters make enormous risk/sacrfices for the miserable heroine, but her gratitude, or even her awareness of these sacrifices, is remote.

Not just because of the issues that are found underlying within the story, but the way it is presented. Gregor's transition from being able to support the family financially, to becoming unable to support himself is both comic and tragic. I've only read it twice, and still don't understand some of the social undertones in the story, which is why I plan on reading it more in the future. It's not exactly a free flowing river like \\"On the Road\\" by Kerouac; it is one of the things in life that needs to be examined over and over again to fully understand what's really happening. I'll bet some of the blatant responses dribbling from other \\"readers\\" about how slow and boring it is, haven't even bothered to give the book a second chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A statement for Social Reform","review":"Kafka's Metamorphosis is one of the most powerful books ever written. Kafka's profound story of the external transfiguration of Gregor Samsa not only puts forth questions of humanity's oscillatory behaviour, it also tells of Kafka's frustration of his industrialised world. Gregor Samsa is already a cockroach inside before his physical metamorphosis; it takes his devolution into barbaric simplicity for him to learn to become a man. Inversely, his family's former love and humanity is torn asunder when they find themselves cast into the commercial world. Kafka's statements on the conditions of his world make this book a must read. Yet what truly makes this a masterpiece is that so many messages are interwoven into Kafka's grotesquely comic tale of a man's mental metamorphosis; Kafka's writing was so far ahead of time that it surpasses ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kafka humorously and sadly plays with the surreal.","review":"Although Gregor is a vermin, he shares with all of us the experience of absurdity in the face of seemingly mundane daily activities. Because of Gregor's metamorphosis, he is no longer able to be productive in a world that places value on the usefulness of its people. Soon Gregor learns that his formerly held expectations of both society and his family are not what they seemed. Ironically, he is only able to discern this after becoming a vermin. Kafka shows us through absurdity that truth is stranger than fiction. Although somewhat disgusting, \\"The Metamorphosis\\" is unusually entertaining and unfortunately, holds grains of truth. This is a great book for exploring symbolism, metaphors, and deeper meanings. One gets the feeling that Kafka had fun writing this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfufilling","review":"After all the hype, yes hype, surrounding this supposed classic, after trying to read it, I had to stop after only 1/3 of the way through due to the rambling diatribe I found myself engulfed in. I think that most of the praise for this story is unfounded and ill-placed; mostly due to academics who try to justify their own meager ramblings. The Metamorphosis is boring, superficial, and trite. Do not waste your time if you value it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Kafka's Metamorphosis is not for me, the story too surreal, the alienation too alien and the plot too far-fetched and depressing without any space for redemption. While recognising Kafka's genius, this story only confirms that Kafka is indeed not for me.Stories should have wonderment, should transport, sweep away, allow the reader to identify. For me personally a story that doesn't evoke any kind of emotive reaction or involvement is quite wasted.

Though it is a great theme. I really hated how he tried to illustrate it. I understand why people say he is a classic author.

He describes our humanity so well.Marilyn Grandi, Rosario, Argentinia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd and Agreeable","review":"Most of my reading time is consummed in the world of non-fiction, but I picked this book up on advice of a friend, and found it to be most enjoyable. A reading group or a college instructor would have been helpful to ellucidate upon the symbols in this novella, but I believe it fits well with other books, works of art, and ballets produced during this time that grapple with the modern world, and its dehumanizing qualities.Indeed, the discomfort of Gregor's transformation seems indicative of the discomfort felt when the human heart is wedged into a world of machines, numbers, and efficiency standards. However, apart from this symbolism, I most enjoyed the lucidity of Kafka's prose and the structure and design of his story. Metamorphosis is the perfect form of a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than meets the eye","review":"I just recently read this book (it's actually a novella) for English class and I was pleasantly surprised. This book dwells deep down into the psychological effects of negativity, insecurities, and isolationism. This novel is very surreal, in that not everything necessarily has to make sense. As a warning to those who are used to novels that are very literal and not very deep in the levels of symbolism and figurative language, you may not enjoy this story. This is a very good story which may require a level up on your analytical skills. Also, if you are a fan of the film maker David Lynch, you will definitly enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"One of the most accessible works ever written by Kafka, and certainly a good place to start if you haven't read anything by him before.

No one is 100% sure what Kafka meant to say with this book, which is annoying and exciting at the same time. I think it will be great for my high school students to read and discuss.About this edition - it could use a bit more editing. It was certainly comprehensible and an enjoyable read, but the typos were glaring and frequent. For example, one sentence reads \\"he did it with a with a growing pleasure.\\" A sentence farther down the page is missing the word \\"by.\\" I can tell what the translation is supposed to say, but such mistakes are distracting to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"Absolutely wonderful. . . i love all the symbolism in this story and how much analysis can occur from a novella. The whole story was stunning and the fact that it all started at the climax was most entertaining. This whole novella was about the decline of the Samsa family. . . wow. Can't imagine how much of a genius this man was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking.","review":"There are no better words for it. The literary equivalent to the life of the elephant man. The tightrope Kafka walks is to tug both at our sympathy for humanity and the animalistic world. The story is about so many things -- sacrifice, fate, lust, pain, the meaning of life, the meaning of soul -- that to sum it up here is hard.There are certain sorts that will be put off by the subject matter of a big bug. Read past it. This is the portrait of failure, shame and despair beyond any other portrait. There is little that could ever be worse, than to be as sweet as you ever could be, as human as you ever were, and yet completely inhuman."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTICALLY MINDBOGGLING BOOK!","review":"This book really expresses the feelings of one who is trapped both by his physical and mental state.

This book has made an impact on my life; I was going through a very hard period and becoming a cockroach did not feel that unimaginable. In any case it brought a perspective into my life, I needed desperately at that time.

Kafka's writing style, grammar, ability to portray the characters. etc. is excellent, but nothing ever really happened.

I am still not clear about his lower half of his body, could it be that he had broken his leg and that is why he can not move them. I am not conveinced that he had turned into an animal. It is ironic that all the time he was trying to support his family (even if he was not that good at his job) did not want to support him when he became sick.

The contributions are a sketch of the officers' careers up to the war and of their contributions to the war (and subsequent), of their commands and their command style, and of their relationships with Winston Churchill. It's a good brief summary (it covers 20 generals in 17 chapters and approximately 350 pages), written by, I believe sixteen, British military historians, and serves as a good introduction to the various commanders, not as a rigorous study of any of the men. I thought it all balanced and frank, if brief, but was frustrated by the chapter on Alanbrooke, which I felt was principally about Churchill and not Alanbrooke. On the other hand, it was informative to see how much of a role Churchill played in the comings and goings of his generals, as well as the planning and conduct of the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Hal Hartley films","review":"Amateur is one of the best Hartley films.

Unfortunately, none of them are as good as Amateur. It is Hartley's most insightful and thought-provoking film. It made me laugh in a way that most films don't. I kept thinking about the film several days after my initial viewing, which definitely signifies the mark of a great film. Amateur has everything a movie needs. It has a smart screenplay, comedy, tragedy, and is beautifully shot. If you haven't seen it, rent it. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"This is the first Ramones CD I bought. The first 10 songs are good, but the live versions aren't that good. And that's a shame considering that their best songs, including Blitzkrieg Bop, Sheena is a Punk Rocker, and Teenage Lobotomy are only in Live version on this CD.You'd be much better off getting \\"Loud fast Ramones: Their toughest hits.\\" That's a great compilation for any Ramones fan, and it contains better songs. This compilation is very passable."},{"rating":"1","title":"mangal pandey dvd seems to be incomplete","review":"Aamir Khan's Mangal Pandey is an interesting film version of the 1857 rising in India. However, this DVD is advertised as having two discs, the movie and a disc of extras on the movie and The Rising. I ordered the movie twice from Amazon and twice received copies with only one disc in DVD cases that held only one disc, event though the price ($29.99) was for two. The problem may be with the supplier, but the problem was never resolved. So check your order carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissatisfied.","review":"I received the order, but found the case broken. Although I ordered a new one, I have a feeling I received a used one. However, I have decided to keep it because it is not worth returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Resident's best stage act on CD","review":"You can think what you want of the Residents, but they do give a unique perspective of music in this modern, MTV - crazed era.This musical piece is actually in three parts. The first part, based allegedly on cowboy poems the Residents read, is their most accessible musical tomes to date.The second, called \\"Black Berry\\" is based on the Resident's visualization of the rise of black music as a popular musical genre. It isn't quite as successful as the first piece, but still stands well on its own.The third piece, based on the life of Elvis, won't gel with you if you are an Elvis fanatic. But it is powerful stuff, ending with the Elvis figure being killed off by the English Invasion.If you like the Residents, this is an essential recording. If you are just looking into the Residents, try \\"Duck Stab\\" for starters."},{"rating":"2","title":"from the plains...","review":"Well, nothing is like a Residents' show. Have you ever seen one? Well if the answer is NO, never mind, nobody is perfect, you can listen to a live CD- and believe me Cube-E is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"good and bad","review":"I thought that the sections on RFK and JFK would be a good read for the novice reader. There is little new evidence, but Smith covers the main issues in a readable way, without the difficulty of proving each assertion (as they have been proven by previous authors).However, the chapters covering Ted Kennedy/Chappaquiddick were disjointed at best. Smith offers no theory of what happened to Mary Jo, and it is difficult to understand the movements of all the players.The section on Tippit's murder was interesting, but it is difficult to understand that \\"they\\" would send someone unreliable to drive Oswald to the airport, but at the same time have a gunman ready to kill Tippit if he didnt follow the script. Why not find a reliable driver instead?Those two portions of the book make me suspect of the Marilyn Monroe information. I am not as familiar with the circumstances of her death, and Smith's telling is not convincing.My conclusion is that there is too much speculation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, Insightful, Harrowing","review":"This is one of the best books I've read on Afghanistan since the attacks on New York.

This one is slowly growing on me, but the lyrics seem forced and lacking the passion of the three previous releases. Still a few really strong songs here, just not as many as on the other releases.

Perhaps it isn't a brand new sound or refined style, but it is on par with Faithful Departed. Similar to the Smashing Pumpkins transition from Melon Colie to Adore; sort of a shift from conventional sounds (guitars/keyboards) to unconventional (samples, and I don't know what else). Desperate Andy must be heard, as it is quite enjoyable. There are a few I like more than others; Delilah isn't that great; Dolores' lyrics sound kind of simplistic (moreso) on it: \\"I'll rearrange her face\\" (?). Oh well. Too bad they decided not to include Sorry Sons with the US release..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Cranberries CD","review":"Why The Cranberries are one of my favorite bands, I must say that this cd qualifies as their weakest. The new cd \\"Wake Up and Smell the Coffee\\" is much better. While this cd is still good, it is nothing like their first 2 albums, which are certainly their best. Most of the songs are good, like You and Me and Promises. But some are not all that great, like Copycat and Desperate Andy. If you do buy this CD, I reccommend getting Bury The Hatchet: The Complete Sessions, which has a bonus disc of b-sides and live songs that are very good, in addition to \\"Sorry Son\\" on the first cd. Overall, a good CD that deserves 4 stars, but just not as good as other cran cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best album they ever made.","review":"This album \\"Bury the Hatchet\\" was definitely the best work by the Cranberries. I had bought all of the other albums without listening to them first, and I was really dissappointed, but this album was a whole lot better than the rest, Delores O'Riordan's voice also sounds nice too, usually she sounded really loud and annoying, but I truly believe that in this album you could call her voice RELAXING.All of the songs on this album are magnificent, especially \\"Shattered\\" and \\"Dying in the sun\\" If you are into slower relaxing music. So Go out and buy yourself a copy today, you will not be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bury the hatchet - the worst in the world","review":"I think this is the worst album Cranberries ever released.

Mind you, I am a big Cranberries fan, and have seen them in concert a number of times over the years. When I bought this album and listened to it, I couldn't quite believe what I heard. Save perhaps for \\"Promises\\", there really isn't quite a memorable tune that I really enjoyed after listening to it. Whatever happened to Dolores' muse? OK, she's a happy mom now, but I linger for the strength of songs found on, say, \\"No Need to Argue\\". Don't buy this CD. Cranberries have a lot to offer, but it sure doesn't show on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bury the hatchet?? not just yet...","review":"this is definately the worst cranberries album to date. i am a huge fan and the only positive thing this album brought was a tour that consisted of their older songs. this album is boring and lacks just about everything that made the band so good on their older stuff. lyrics and vocals .... but its good to see them together still, maybe the next one will do better but if your just getting into them, pick up everybody else and no need to agrgue first. you will enjoy this album if you like boring rock they play on radio every day like cardigans etc etc but if your getting it to hear dolores hit another one like yeats grave or not sorry... forget it! it aint here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not","review":"Big disappointment. Most of the tracks here sound like something that the band splited out of their heads while sitting around a bonfire on the beach. It seems that the decision to bury their hatchet also included burying their talent, or else I can't explain such songs as 'Just My Imagination', which sounds disturbingly familiar to Madness' 'Our House'. The only great song here, 'Promises', can't seem to save this album from drowning into boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic Continues","review":"The Cranberries often have a way of combining the edgy and the mellow on their albums. This one is no exception. It's more of a return to their earlier days, before the overproduced recent works. For those unaware, the group was close to breaking up on the tour for To The Faithful Departed, their previous album.Thankfully, they toughed it out and did things the way they wanted. The result is a beautiful conglomeration from the rock edge of Promises to the mellow piano of Dying In The Sun. O'Riordan's voice is balanced by the band, shining as they never have before -- the musical talent clearly comes through on this album.There's no doubt this is a must-have for Cranberries fans. It's also a good entry point for new folks, possibly their best since their debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Step Up From Others...","review":"This CD was defintely better than the last three albums The Cranberries put out. Some of the songs are a far stretch from good, but for the most part, this album kicks! They got in touch with their roots in \\"Dying in the Sun\\". Also with powerful songs like \\"Promises\\" and up-beat tunes like \\"Just My Imagination\\". To appreciate the music more, read the lyrics. I think that in no time you will find yourself singing along with these catchy beats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL THE BEST! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!","review":"I must admit, I didn't expect this album to be as good as \\"No Need To Argue\\" or the others...boy, was I mistaken!!!

I have No Need to Argue and Everyone else is doing it... which are FANTASTIC albums, however the band should have left it there as their last two albums, this included, are AWFUL. I would advise buyers to keep their money in their pockets, with lyrics like- \\"And when he goes he goes with a smile\\" or \\"All the kids are going back to school, The summers over its the golden rule\\"- its really difficult gagging down the rest of the album. This is the WORST album I have heard in a long time. I'm 100% Irish and albums like this give the excellent music that is being written and produced in Ireland a seriously bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus One Star for a total of Zero","review":"The Cranberries might want you to believe that everything's OK now they're acclimated to success. Rather this secure and predictable move is a desperation play to return to some imaginary, womb-like safe haven among their fans. Apologizing to the world as if to say, \\"Um, did you prefer \\"Dreams\\" over \\"Zombie\\"? We can fix that.\\" The solution is to trod out a batch of re-hashed ideas and melodies from their more profitable past to simulate the experience of a band \\"still in their prime\\". Unfortunately not an uncommon occurance in music. The Cranberries are the Pink Floyd of the 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"No wonder they don't have as many fans as before. The new album is absolutly horrible! It seems they are trying to change their music style with little quirky tunes that are stupid and make no sense.

If you liked their earlier stuff, you're likely to be quite disappointed. Their 3 year hiatus doesn't seem to have done them any bit of good, as this is, IMHO, a total display of utter lack of creativity. It's akin to U2's Zooropa: utter junk. Musically and lyrically, The Cranberries have seen much better days.

When I heard the first strums of the guitar in \\"Animal Instinct\\" I knew I wouldnt be dissapointed and I wasnt.

Now the band is at the lofty heights of fame and success. As always at such altitude comes the unrelenting stressors of maniacial producers and record label executives who make unreal demands on the creative process. For many artists this can kill one's creativity. This has happened to Dolores.On top of that Dolores is now married. She seems to be happier. Happiness has a flip side for disturbed artists: it also kills their creativity!Hence, you have \\"Bury The Hatchet\\", a watered down album that is lacking in originality, added is a feeble attempt to cover up this lack of originality with the song \\"Copy Cat\\", which actually sums up the compilation of songs on this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Gold","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect with this CD after reading a number of reviews that varied from great to poor. But once I placed this in my player I was taken back by the shear brilliance of the 13 musical compositions that make up this CD.The songs on this CD sizzle and rock. Try listening to Loud and Clear, Just my Imagination, Desparte Andy, Delilah and of course Animal Instinct and see if you can keep your feet still. The music is fluid, flowing from one song to the next and truly is a work of art.While I agree this CD differs greatly from the prior ones, I consider this to be a cut well above the others and well worth buying. I just hope their next CD follow the same musical path.By the way, Doloris sounds as hot as ever. Go Cranberries!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still going good","review":"Don't bother listening to the previous review..sure, this isn't as good as their 1st cd, but does it have to be?? I still think this is a good effort. The semi-radio \\"Promises\\" rocks, which is 1 of the only ones that do, but the slow tracks mixed with strings & other orchestral instruments are good, especially #4 \\"You & me\\", a personal favorite of mine. I really like the opener \\"Animal Instinct\\" too, & other highlights are \\"Saving Grace\\" & the last one \\"Dying in the Sun\\".

The creativity, beauty, and unrehearsed awkwardness that made the first two albums such a simple perfection has been replaced by a nightmare of thousands of track overlays... There is no sense of purity or simplicity in this new album. Noel's meditative guitar and Dolores' vocal are drowned out by what you might call an overdose of electronica and grunge. As a devoted fan, I expected a rebound from the poor quality of \\"To The Faithful Departed,\\" but as it goes, \\"Bury The Hatchet\\" only leaves more to be desired... those days of Linger and Ode to my family may not ever return at this rate. For all those who prefer those songs from the early 90's... you may very well be dissapointed by this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD really sucked","review":"I think that the music is bad and the words do not make sense.

I really like The Craberries, but I was surprisingly disappointed to find that the only somewhat impressive songs are Animal Instinct and Copycat, a little bit.

A Landmark Album in every Respect.","review":"Vivid, powerful, emotional, intelligent, poignant rock n' roll. I could on and on about this gift from the gods called \\"Bury the Hatchet\\", by far The Cranberries finest album yet. But I won't. Words, simple words cannot decribe in detail the impact of the incredible music on this album. Apparently I'm the only person on earth who absolutely loved \\"To the Faithfull Departed\\", and the important messages it tries to deliver, and I never thought they would top that one. Wrong. \\"Bury the Hatchet\\" is remarkable. The crisp, jangely guitars on \\"Animal Instinct\\", the magnificent vocal harmonies on \\"Loud and Clear\\", the ripping and tearing riffs of \\"Promises\\", this album is an absolute blue print for perfect rock music. God bless Dolores O'Riorden, whose voice gets better every album.

And, I consider \\"Bury the Hatchet\\" to be their best effort after \\"Everybody Else...\\". What bothered me about their last album and not so much their second album was the rather gloomy songs and lyrics. \\"Bury The Hatchet\\" is a lot more upbeat, lyrically, and a lot of fun to listen to.

This CD is pure watered-down, repetitive, unoriginal dreck! It is almost inconceivable that it was created by the same musicians who made the beautiful and enchanting EEIDISWCW.

Of The Smiths and The Sundays and All About Eve...three bands with far far more interesting songs than the dreck on display here. And it isn't that the album is awful. O'Riordan has a distinctive style, the music can be melodic and often quite pretty and so what?

Helen isn't even her real name as she chose to drop her given name of Orpha Myrtle. She was the first wife of my grandfather, Clyde L DeVOL. They were married 30 July 1914 in Pueblo Co CO and divorced 7 September 1925 in Cook Co IL. They had lived apart apart since 1918.

I thought I needed a sub, but with this power strip added into my system I don't need a sub. Befor I could barly tell if my speakers were in or out of phase. Now it's obvious that I'm in phase throughout the spectrum. The imaging improved, the bass response is much lower and smoother. No boom, just so much better all the way around. Best bang for my buck yet! I have 3 rooms with gear so I bought 3 HTS PowerCenters; 1000, 1000MKII, and 2000. I noticed the huge improvement with all of them, but if I had too choose one I'd go with the MKII. I wonder if the other more expensive models could be that much better.

With all the settings equal and the only change being the Monster HTS 1000 MKII, it was immediately apparent that the subwoofer was much more substantial and the surround speakers had more impact. Since I was sceptical about the whole thing, I had to attribute the improvement to the HTS 1000. I have not hooked up HD to it yet, so I can't confirm or deny the issues others are having with the video connection. Also, since the TV is new, there is no before and after comparison. However, I can say this much, even a TV this size, without an HD feed, has an excellent picture while plugged in to the Monster HTS 1000."},{"rating":"1","title":"works but spike fried it","review":"first spike my house ever had fried this product . i have know idea if this product helped or not . the spike fried an xbox that was not hooked up to a surge protector . but it should have some sort of a reset if ther is a spike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Start to produce loud humming noise after 5th years","review":"I stopped using the HTS 1000 after 5th years.

When I saw it was released on VHS and then DVD I thought it would sound as good as it was in the theater, but sadly the sound isn't up to par. Even though it is a piece of rock history and any collector should own it. Also a little trivia for you.

Alice is drunk and I can't stand his singing in this. Also, the bass is too high in the mix and the guitars are too low. The stage show is kinda cool, but Alice ruins it. Buy GTSYA Alice Cooper,Trashes the World,Brutally Live, or Live at Montreux 2005(I haven't seen Nightmare Returns). All of those shows are better than this one.

Alice Cooper at the top of his form in this beautifuly remastered DVD. The picture, although a little dark and fuzzy in certain ares is otherwise crisp and vibrant. But it's the sound that truely blew me away. Remixed in Dolby Digital 5.1, this audio format takes full advantage of everything multi-channel sound can do. No matter where in the room I moved I felt I was at a live show. Thundering bass, screaming guitars, and howling vocals filled the room. To bad you can't buy all music and concert videos like this.

Sure, he was a little drunk, but so what? He still put on one hell of a show- this is pure sick and twisted theater. Accept no substitutes. This production and concept changed the face of live rock and roll performance. So many bands and performers have copied, and been directly influenced by Alice Cooper. Even U2 used his \\"movie screen\\" idea in one of their stage shows.The whole \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" album is performed, along side original Cooper band classics, like \\"I'm Eighteen\\", and \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\". Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not be any better","review":"Alice Cooper's \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" is one of the must purchases for any Alice's fan.

Jack the lion has a good begining and is good the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new band and a great new CD","review":"Although a bit overplayed on the radio, Flagpole sitta is an intense song which gets the adrenalyn pumping. Harvey Danger is a very cool new band and this is a very cool CD. I look forward to their next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have always loved the song \\"Flagpole Sitta\\" and had heard great things about this CD, so I finally bought it. I have to say that I don't understand what all the fuss is about. I didn't really like any of the songs beyond \\"Flagpole Sitta\\". Some of them drone on and on.I'm new to Harvey Danger other than the couple of singles that have been on the radio over the years (\\"Flagpole\\" and the remake of English Beat's \\"Sooner of Later\\", which I like better than the origianl), so I had no other context to consider Harvey Danger's music. Needless to say, I didn't find anything that made me want to delve into it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CD destined to leave you humming it's one good song.","review":"Harvey Danger's Where have all the Merrymakers Gone is not a fantastic CD, but it does not suck either, I personally found only one song \\"fFagpole Situp\\" to be of my liking, but the rest of the United States does not see it my way. If you are looking for a cd with many great songs, skip this, and instead, buy the cd single, Flagpole Situp, also by Harvey Danger. The mediocre cd will leave you humming for hours, yet does not show any musical genius"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"You know what? Generally, I like most kinds of music. And I can handle some fairly crappy cds, but I listen to them anyway. But there is not a single song on this cd that is at least mildly average, with the exception of Flagpole Sitta...However, even that get's annoying and boring after a few listenings. I read a review of the cd, I forget where, and the reviewer said \\"Because it's hard to believe how this garbage was recorded in the first place.\\" That pretty much sums it up...spend your 15 bucks on like, FISH, or ANYTHING except this sorry excuse for a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this music?","review":"This is the worst CD that I have ever bought and I have bought a lot of CD's. I got it because I liked Flagpolesitta' and what I got was trash. I like the sound of an old man coughing more than this album. The only good songs on this album are Flagpolesitta and private helicopter. There are other songs that could pass for ok. I tried to listen to this album many times thinking that it would get better. It did not. Do Not Buy This Album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one of the worst CDs I bought","review":"I bought this CD thinking all the songs would be as good as Flagpole Sitta, but I was completly wrong. This was a huge waist of money. The other songs didn't have catchy lyrics or especialy good music; I hated almost all of them. I know why they didn't put the song on the Disturbing Behavor sound track; no one would buy this CD if they could get Flagpole Sitta somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawd Awfull Garbage...","review":"The contents of this CD is grossly disappointing (imho). Wait til you hear \\"Save It For Later\\" due out soon. I made my purchase thinking this CD would be as dynamite as \\"Save It For Later\\"; you'd never think it was the same group or whatever they are. Heck, I am out good money.

Harvey Danger opened for somebody, I can't remember whom. I had never heard of Harvey Danger, but wondered how they had hundreds of kids going berserk for them. It just sounded like your usual alternative garbage, some sort of fingernails-on-a-chalkboard combination of Green Day and Morrissey. I wanted to run screaming from the room, but in deference to my friend who knew the singer, I endured the hell that constituted their set. I never, ever, ever thought this lousy band would ever become big. But I forgot that lots of lousy bands become stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flagpole Sitta and.... not much else","review":"Flagpole Sitta is such a catchy tune, But it's really the only song worth hearing on this disc. All the lyrics are funny and witty, yes, but only the lyrics. the songs themselves are irritating. You'd be Much better off with Harvey Danger's superb and entertaining \\"Little By Little\\" and then just buy the Flagpole Sitta single.This disc leaves a lot to be desired"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the one CD you need for rock and alternative lovers!","review":"I've heard Flagpole Sitta a million times and it's still the coolest song, but song's like Private Helicopter are also awesome songs.

You will like this!!","review":"I like this CD because the songs are something that you can really get into. Even the shy people at parties would want to get up to sing and dance with the people.

It is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD won't leave your CD player!","review":"I mainly bought \\"Where have all the merrymakers gone?\\" for the track \\"Flagpole Sitta\\", hoping that the rest of the album wouldn't suck.

I definitely reccommend that you buy this CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i thought it would be a lot better","review":"i was surprised, i loved flagpole sitta, i listened to it all the time, but i found the rest of the cd to be not as exciting and not as fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This CD is amazing. Though many will look at the CD for the infectious hit \\"Flagpole sitta\\", but there is much more to the CD than that one hit. The CD starts with the uptempo, fast pased, and catchy \\"Caralotta Valdez\\", and then proceeds into the smash hit. The next tracks, though they begin slowly, pick up incredibly. Skip the first 30 seconds of \\"wolley muffler\\" and get to the awsome chorus. \\"Jack the Lion\\" is a song where you actually can feel the emotion seep through the stereo. \\"Terminal velocity\\" is amazing as well, and the whole CD is made with such heart and soul. Do yourselves a favour, and buy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel misled","review":"When I saw a new release by Bryn Terfel, I was very excited. He is the brightest new male voice I have heard in many years. But when this CD arrived, I found that I was listening to Bryn Terfel at twenty--not Bryn Terfel at 35. While Bryn Terfel at twenty was a pleasant voice, he had not developed the depth of tone or the control of dynamics that mark his work today. Had I known that the recording was fifteen years old, I probably would not have bought it. I will continue to search for more recordings by this great singer, but I hope not to be misled again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine singing from a very young Bryn","review":"This is a charming collection. The opening duet with Bryn's tenor friend is enchanting. There are more duets to savor. These two voices blend beautifully, and each singer is considerate of the other resulting in a lovely stream of blended sounds. Many years ago (the 70s?), there was an American male duet (\\"Joe and Eddie\\") singing gospel/folk/jazz that was just superb. These two voices sound and blend in much the same way...a real pleasure.Bryn's solo efforts on the CD are also excellent...every bit of his voice and persona as we now know it is there in these 1984 to 1990 recordings. The songs themselves are delightful. The only complaint I have is that the lyrics are not given either in Welsh or English (or anything else for that matter) -- only song synopses are offered.This CD is a treat..a personal intimate outing in lovely music with a wonderful artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand Welsh!","review":"If I had known the entire disc was all in WElsh, I wouldn't have ordered it as I do not understand one word of it.

I found myself \\"seeing\\" the next scene and the movie's conclusion before each occurred. A real yawner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy listening","review":"The Minnesota Orchestra under its director Eije Oue has a marvelous set of musicians, but in my opinion they made too many records in the last years. Although none of the pieces on this record is really bad, with the exceptance of Otto Klemperer's Merry Waltz, the common denominator is popularity, the wellknown showpieces that lack the element of surprise. Liszt's Les Pr��ludes is played adequately, but lacks the intensity of The Philadelphia Orchestra under Wolfgang Sawallisch (Water Lily Acoustics) and the Bol��ro by Ravel misses the jazz-influences Ravel intended.The sound quality of this Reference Recording is outstanding, as usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cash me out!","review":"Save your money! The camera work is awful,you can't realy see the table much less what is happening there. The picture is very grainy, like some cheap movie. The advice offered is the same you can get for free at the major casinos beginers tables. All in all this video is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frozen Solid","review":"\\"Five Card Stud\\" is a good police procedural. It features Jake Hines, a Minnesota detective, and a huge snowstorm. In the background are Jake's girlfriend Trudy; a whole cast of unsavory midwestern characters who have nothing to do but shovel snow, play the lottery, and dream up nasty things to do to each other; and a bunch of snowplows working day and night to dig everybody out of the storm so they can get on with hurting each other.The result is a grotesque assortment of frozen corpses, and a logic-defying puzzle. It's an entertaining book to read from the standpoint of plot and action, and the local color is realistic and fascinating.A good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy-reading was never more tedious!","review":"Shouldn't a good series include books that stand alone? Admittedly this is the first book I've read in the series, but I feel like I'm left hanging to figure out who these people are, and more importantly, WHY I should care. Not only do I find the characters flat and unmemorable, but the writing is downright juvenile, filled with not-so-witty cliches and forced one-liners. I didn't even know what Jake Hines looked like until the 57th page! Oh, and the plot development is painfully slow, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best biography for this age group","review":"This book was not \\"readable\\" enough for its target audience.

I'm unaware of another biography on Amy Carmichael for this age group (besides the series on heroes of the faith), so I was disappointed that it did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll stop watching after five minutes.","review":"This movie really succked. I saw it on HBO once and I thought, \\"Man, this movie sucks!\\" The acting was dry. It was a lot like \\"See spot. See spot run. See Spot make a spot. Bad Spot!\\" I think the \\"colorful\\" creatures mentioned earlier are just rehashed muppets. I also think \\"colorful\\" is just a nice way of saying cheesey. Please avoid this movie and maybe then we can work toward world peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!!","review":"I went and saw La Nouba in Orlando it was so cool.

At the core of their world class, and breath taking performances, beats the heart of their original and finely crafted musical compositions. All of their musical numbers have a unique identity with subtle influences that paint lavish images of a place, a time, and a mood. La Nouba's soundtrack is clearly the most urban, post-modern of all of their works, and sets the mood for some high energy, stimulating yet soothing reflections. This is truly World Class."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a hard to understand book","review":"This book was hard to understand because some things did not make much sense. It had very wonderful illistrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better productions","review":"This production basically takes a look at van Eyck's Ghent Altar which is Belgium's most prized relic. During the Second World War, this piece changed hands numerous times, and was moved from place to place. The story of this art treasure's startling journey is presented in a rather disjointed fashion here. The focus is not merely on Ghent's Altar as underlying it is Hitler's great quest to gather all of Europe's great art in a museum in his hometown of Linz, Austria. It also addresses Stalin's plunder of of German art collections. It is worth a look but there are better books and production on the theme of looted artwork during WW II and their fate:The Rape of EuropaThe Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in HistoryRescuing Da Vinci: Hitler and the Nazis Stole Europe's Great Art - America and Her Allies Recovered ItThe Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitler's Museum","review":"Overall disapointing documentary.

The second builds on the first, but includes some of the same material already covered in the first, so if you are watching both it is tedious.The format did not cover the material as coherently as I had hoped for; the presentation jumped around a good bit, so at times the order things happened in wasn't as clear as it could have been.I was also disappointed in the lack of depth in the material. While it did cover the Ghent Altarpiece, that was not what most of the time was spent on; it was almost a second thought. Overall the lack of cohesion was a serious problem.

What am I doing here you may ask? Well I listen to music for the melodies and this man was the master of sublime uplifting music. But this requiem differs from the masters usual light happy arrangements . Angels hovered over the bed of the great man as he breathed his last while dictating his final piece to his student. ( so the story goes ) Full of darkness and seriousness and strength , Mozart was understandably nervous about his impending doom and the requiem represents this . After breathing his last, the piece was apparently finished by Mozart's student Sussmayer and while perfection is left to the man 's own parts, his friend and student did stay true to Mozart's intentions as well as he possibly could . A fitting and sometimes even scary farewell from ( in my opinion )the most ingenious composer of all time . Mozart took a peak at the heavenly realms and translated the beauty into his music . The voice of God ? Oh yes absolutely ."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an inspiration!","review":"It is a shame that this book is out of print.

After reading some really critical reviews of this, I was worried about how this would work for us. But I've now discovered there was nothing to worry about at all.*Great storage -- this has TONS of storage room. And frankly, it could be used as a dresser with the converted crib through pre-teens. I was pleasantly surprised to find some very deep drawers.*Very sturdy*Well packed -- there is so much foam cushioning this all theway around. It came out perfect, as if it'd been made in our home.

We loved the looks of the furniture, but the quality is quite poor. The finish on the changing table / dresser is already coming off. Where we change our baby (who is only 3 months old), the whole front of the dresser is chipping!! I can't believe it! I contacted the manufacturer, and they said the finish is not warrantied. They're not standing by their furniture. Also, the drawers, as several people have already said, are not quality made. They are difficult to open, and they shift when closing. The tracks are poorly constructed. The one good thing I have to say is the looks of the furniture is absolutely beautiful.....UNTIL YOU USE IT! It wears quickly! We expected to keep this furniture nice for a while, considering how much we paid for the set. I would never go Jardine again after dealing with them directly, and having no luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Yes, it looks beautiful in the pictures.

This production is really five-star, but I have to take off a star because I am hearing-impaired and missed about 20% of the dialog. As far as I know, Amazon does not offer closed captions on any of its Instant Videos, even though the original production for cable TV may have had them. Hearing impairments are going to become far more common as the US population ages (not to mention those induced by MP3 players!). I would probably triple my purchases of Insyant Videos if they included closed captions. Incidentally, closed captions can also be useful to American viewers who are not accustomed to British, Australian or Indian accents."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!","review":"If you haven't seen this show, you really need too!

I really hope there is a season 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Series Takes a New Slant with CDC, Terrorism, etc.,","review":"This was a radical departure from anything this show has done to date. What looks like a date rape drug related murder instead heralds a rash of hospital admissions of patients frothing blood from the mouth who quickly die. There is nothing these patients have in common other than being the first victims of what looks like a massively contagious and fatal virus. Then a terrorist steps forth taking credit for the outbreak but Megan notices that his eyes show the same tell tale signs as the other victims and predicts he too will soon be dead. All of this brings in the CDC and FBI so that all three are trying to figure out what is going on together. This involves petty squabbles of course over turf. They have made some discoveries at the close of this first episode but have a long way to go to solve the case in the next episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Bracelet!","review":"This is a beautiful sterling silver bracelet.

While not a technical masterpiece, the emotion captured here is captivating.

And what does she do? She shares her good fortune not only with her younger sister but also with the boys nad girls with whom she sang in the streets of Wellington, New Zealand.

She has the purest voice imaginable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haley Westenra - Live From New Zealand","review":"Those who want to listen to an angel sing this a must buy. I was completely blown by the wonderful renditions of songs in this DVD. Her voice is perfect even considering the different range of songs sung.

She has the style of classic Far East super stars. I can only compare her voice to Sarah Brightman's voice. She is totaly opposite to Brittney Spears who has to drop her uderwear to be attractive. Too bad for Brittney, Hayley just so happen to be very pretty too. 32 4-5 stars review, which other item on Amazon gets so much wonderful responses. The guy with 2 star is crazy by himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent and beauty shine through this great DVD!","review":"Hayley is definitely a great singer. Her amazing talent is shown on this well filmed DVD. There is a wide selection of music, some from \\"Pure\\" and some from \\"Odyssey\\", while others aren't on any released albums. Her rendition of \\"Across the Universe of Time\\" is great - later on in the song her sister, Sophie, joins her in harmony. \\"Down to the River\\" is beautifully sung with the Island Boys - I just wish she sang more of the song! It sort of cuts/flows into \\"Amazing Grace\\".There are still things Hayley can work on to make her forthcoming performances better, but this is a great beginning. In the bonus features is a music video of \\"Pokarekare Ana\\" which is exquisite. It is a little different from the CD version - she adds a great vocal line and then a guitar solos for a while.So... why wait? Get this great DVD as a gift for yourself or for a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"An excellent singer in the same league as Sara Brightman.

There is distortion on her voice in some of the tracks. I wrote email after email to her record label and agent with no reply. It is such a pitty that such a beautiful taleneted young lady is only as good as the useless people who represent her. Don't buy this disc if you REALLY want to listen. It is wonderfull if it's on to fill a room though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelical voice","review":"Hayley has an amazing angelical voice and has achieved success.

This is a real treat, as it offers you not only a live performance spotlighting the young beauty and her smooth and alluringly pure voice, but also cameos of her wonderful family and a delicious taste of her rich New Zealand culture. We even get a glimpse of her younger sister Sophie as the two girls sing together on one song. When Hayley Westenra performs, the heavenly angels' jaws drop, and you will see precisely why when you view this DVD. Such simple, natural elegance and complete professionalism are rare for one of such tender years, and it is sheer joy to behold. Your life will be enriched by this performance. Buy this DVD---you will NEVER regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitle isn't accurate.","review":"Simply put, this book is not for birth parents, it's for the birth mother. The subtitle should be changed. The \\"voice\\" of the book is talking to the birth mother as the only interested birth parent, and even though some brief paragraphs refer to the birth father, he is treated not as a reader of the book, but in the third person, for example, \\"What if the adoptee asks about the birth father? What should you say?\\" Well, how about \\"I'm him.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay cold","review":"Just didn't work for me. I need my meds to stay colder.

I was quite pleased with the results; I used the wallet for our trip to the Sturgis motorcycle rally last year, and my pens stayed cool for the entire 2 weeks of camping and motorcycling. The temperature one day was 103 degrees, and the pens were still cool to the touch! I used a mesh belt-pack to keep the wallet in, and rode every day, so perhaps I had the benefit of faster evaporation than other folks? I needed to recharge the gel every day, which I did in ice water.I'm sold on this product. I have just ordered a second wallet to keep spare pens in for this year's trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhappy with the high temp performance","review":"Used as directed and lost 3 pens when the temperature hit 100 degrees. Foolish me, I kept thinking that the error was mine because of all the supposed reviews about how great this item is in hot weather. We had a small and a large pack. The small pack was essentially worthless, the larger pack seemed to be large enough to keep for for last for a few hours. Works great as long as the temp doesn't go much over the recommended maximum temperature for your insulin and/or you keep it cool by adding some kind of ice pack. If you're expecting the answer to having to carry around all the stuff in the heat...this isn't going to be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Doo-Dad for Keeping Insulin Cool !!","review":"This wallet has made my life a lot better.

I strongly recommend against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I bought a Frio wallet and followed all of the instructions (there aren't many instructions).

I think the opposite is true. This book is basically an enormous sob from a tragically damaged author. And he has every right to be damaged -- his personal story is horrific(sexual abuse by both parents from a young age, etc.). But the semi-autobiographical main character of this book wanders through the world like a zombie, having no meaningful interactions and learning nothing. The book has plenty of sex, but none of it is remotely erotic. The book has plenty of bizarre events, but none of them is entertaining or insightful. The author needs therapy -- not a book deal. Hopefully, the next generation of gay writers will write from a stronger emotional place than this -- and produce more rewarding work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of the Year","review":"As a \\"pro\\" book reviewer, the stack of comp copies piled up beside my desk is-- Well at the moment I must confess it's not as daunting as it used to be, as I've learned the wisdom of immediately listing for online sale anything that comes in the mail -- for $2. Thankfully, Matt Sycamore's novel somehow managed to catch my eye before I could \\"push the button.\\" Thankfully -- for my own selfish interests. PULLING TAFFY is the best novel by a living author I have read in at least five years. More probably 10 or 15. Why?

There was no redeeming value in it, and most of it wasn't even coherent. It seems he was going for a stream of consciousness theme, and missed badly.

I am a big fan of Mr. Morgan's previous books, but this one topped them all. Mr. Morgan did an excellent job of researching this fact-filled story of Wilbur Underhill's life and crimes. You are taken inside the mind of one of the most feared outlaws of the 1920s and 30s. Mr. Morgan uncovered many letters written by Underhill himself, some were written just before his famous Kansas prison escape; which gives the reader a perspective that has never before been available.

The book tells about the creation of the idea by Jerome Robbins and the subsequent collaboration with Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Laurents, and Stephen Sondheim. It tells of deep research into gang warfare, of grueling rehearsals with the oft-cold Robbins (in constrast to the gentler Bernstein), and of startled reactions to this unusual musical. It gives great insights into the motivations of the characters, the construction of the plot, and the choices of the lyrics and tunes.My only complaint is that this book gives no proper respect to the excellent movie version; it refuses to allow for the differences between the stage and the screen. (Note: I did see the 1979 Broadway revival, as well as high school productions, and have enjoyed the movie umpteen times.) Otherwise, The Making of West Side Story is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful backstage story","review":"As I was writing a term paper about Broadway musicals a few years ago, I found The Making of West Side Story very helpful to my research.

What makes it even more special are the descriptions of each place or person by lewis himself, taken from his letters and books. It is the best gift a Lewis fan could receive, too, so look for a friend!If you are buying the reprint instead of the original, you should know that, unlike the original, many of the full page photos are split between two pages, which can be a little annoying.

Some of the exercises have so many moves attached it's hard to follow along as well. I am young and workout 4-5 times a week and I couldn't catch up. By the time I got into position, she was on the third or fourth rep. I didn't find the ab workout to be of any help at all. I found myself doing my own exercises while she did hers.

I believe it does have a diuretic and possibly laxative effect, and it is supposedly good for the liver. Again, those claims may be dubious, but I could see this as a good coffee substitute if you had to cut down for some reason (caffeine, acid). It tasted terrible to me at first, but after about 4 cups I really started to like it. I brew it with two teabags and steep for 15 minutes.

Granted, I did not read the book(s?) that came before this one, but I feel like this author has no concept of the term \\"romance.\\"There is very little relationship development between the lead characters. There are no intimate scenes other than a few kisses, so do not expect any lovemaking. I never really felt like I wanted these two characters to be together for the rest of their lives.I kept getting confused with all the rules of the different magical systems and why I should care. It also took forever for the action of the story to get going. I felt like I was stuck in a rut for 50+ pages for the hero to decide to accept his magic. The Fates were amusing, if sometimes annoying. I did like the son and his psychic abilities. That was probably the only bright (and humorous) spot. If you feel compelled to read this one, don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough romance","review":"For a romance novel, this sure lacked a lot of romance! I think the leads kissed 2, maybe 3 times throughout the book. They didn't really get to know each other very well - seems their \\"love\\" was based on the Fates prophesy and that's about it. It was kind of interesting to find out the Fates' fate in this book, but the plot just never seemed to really GO anywhere. It plodded along until it just came to an end.

I've heard it compared to Napoleon Dynamite...not even close. I found absolutely nothing enjoyable in this and would sue the makers for the time back if I could. It really is that awful. I think I softly chuckled at maybe two or three little bits, but those are quickly forgotten under the deluge of lame attempts at humor everywhere else in the film.Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. Please...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"It's supposed to be about a group of roleplayers setting a new record for hours spent on a single campaign, but it's actually a painful pseudo-documentary about crude, pathetic losers who don't even like each other.

The budget seems to be pretty good, which is a shame, because the movie turns out to be so awful. It's not really even ABOUT the game, but rather about the real lives of the gamers ... who are all caricatures and stereotypes. Compared with \\"The Gamers\\", which you can find in about five parts on YouTube, this is pretty abysmal. It really is sad, because \\"The Gamers\\" obviously had a budget of about $20, and manages to poke fun at \\"that guy\\" in the gaming hobby while still treating the hobby as a whole with affection. When my buddy and I realized that the movie was halfway over and we had still only seen bits and pieces of the actual game (and had only given up some token \\"pity-laughs\\"), we put in a different movie. I really wish I could say that I liked this film more than I did, because I love RPGs, and the guys who made this probably do too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't make it through.","review":"I am not sure if I can call this an actual review. Why? Well, I only made it about 10-15 minutes in and shut it off. As another review mentioned; this is not a film made by a gamer, it is a film that mocks gamers. If that is what you're into? Go for it. Otherwise, don't bother. Thankfully there are other films about RPGers that are much better at both mocking (to a limited and non-stereotypical extent) and capturing the essence of RPGs like \\"Fellowship of the Dice\\" and \\"The Gamers\\" and its semi-sequel \\"The Gamers: Dorkness Rising\\" as a few vastly superior examples.

Unfortunately, with rare exception, each of these books is little more than an expanded excerpt from \\"Million Dollar Consulting.\\" My advice?

Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Help You Acquire Clients Tomorrow","review":"It has always seemed to me that when quite a few 5-star reviews are accompanied by a couple of one and two-star reviews, something is worth reading. I found this book to be exceptional in that it: addresses finding new targets of opportunity; discusses a variety of ways to get to the buyer; examines behavioral predispositions; provides sample objections and rebuttals; teaches how to deal with committees; and a great deal more. The 5-star reviews are based on this kind of pragmatic detail and the one-stars on clear resentment of Dr. Weiss's success, apparently.

Usually conditioners are life savers, they create a manageable soft head of hair rather than a tangled mess. This conditioner, however, did not deliver. After using it, my hair was still tangled and felt like it had nothing on it. Yes, it smells nice, but like another reviewer mentioned, I prefer a product that does what it says. My hair is not fine but I do use color and used this because it was supposed to be good for treated hair. No thanks. I got better results from John Frieda....at a much lower price.

I have used the shampoo and conditioner together on and off months now, so I'm leaving this review for both products.Sure, it thickens my hair--turning it into a completely unmanageable knot of ratty, tangly hair. There is NO way to comb through my hair after using these products (without ripping it all out) unless I use yet another twenty dollar Bumble and Bumble product (the Prep spray).

Miss Ross is in peak vocal form here and is joined by the great Zoot Sims on saxophone and much of the same band featured on the Lambert, Hendricks & Ross classic \\"The Swingers\\". Don't expect any of the vocal acrobatics of the Lambert, Hendricks & Ross recordings however. This is straight-ahead jazz singing by one of the great singers in her prime.

The science was definitely paper-thin and the acting was not nearly at the same quality as the special effects. The short falls really are a shame, because they were such mundane matters as writing, research and acting. Despite this, it was entertaining, and the \\"Making Of\\" documentary was key to dispelling any thought that this was \\"real\\". This movie, with the accompanying documentary, was instead a vehicle for explaining a bit about some interesting animals that really do exist. But most of all, I found it to be a great tool for showing a child how you can't take all science \\"journalism\\" at face value, how a little critical thinking can find flaws in the \\"omnipotent\\" TV, and how special effects can make anything seem real. Use this movie the right way, and you can inspire both real science studies and loosen the hold TV has on a child's mind while still having a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aired on British Television","review":"This ficumentory has just been aired on UK television.The blend of documentary and background detailed fiction, along with amazing effects and just the right level of intrigue and mystery, make this as good, if not better than the Walking With Dinosaurs series.This production ads credibility to the fantasy, making myth as good as real.Well worth buying. Now I've seen it, I'm more likely to buy than just by reading the reviews. Fantastic experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate","review":"This film is evidence that the Discovery Channel is concerned primarily with entertaining, rather than informing, the public. It's impossible to have a film that is both scientific documentary and science fiction, because the second any fictional element is incorporated, it is no longer scientific.The blurring of the lines between science and science fiction on a Discovery Channel program encourages a very non-scientific mindset. To watch \\"scientists\\" in interviews eagerly spouting unsupported speculations makes me sick.I would have no problem with this film if it aired on the Sci-Fi channel. Sure, it's entertaining, and it's fun to imagine, but it's irresponsible of the Discovery Channel to show a program like this. It's completely out of place, considering the rest of its shows are meant to be educational. For myself personally, it has ruined the credibility of the entire channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody Move is no King Yellowman, but it's still nice!","review":"Yellowman has a tendancy to heavily recycle his hits on his later albums.

I tried other waxes and pastes that I dismissed due to very bad, unmanly smells and stickiness to the hair. This wax washes off easily with water and the smell is manageable. I give it four stars because it is hard to spread on your hands to apply it, but you can address this problem by using a hair dryer to soften the wax before applying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds a lot better than you'd think!","review":"I am a female and have hair that's usually between 2 and 4 inches long. This stuff works great by itself when my hair is short to give that messed up, spiky, bed-head look. As my hair grows a bit longer, it keeps its hold pretty well but sometimes I have to mix it with some styling gel.But the pluses to this stuff is that, when used by itself, it won't leave your hair feeling sticky, just a bit waxy. You only need to use a little bit! Use too much and it actually weighs your hair down and then it won't stand up well at all. So less is usually better.Just warm the wax with your hair drier for maybe 30 seconds, then get a little bit on your fingers and apply to your hair. The bottle may seem small but it really goes a long way. It usually takes me around 6 months to go through a whole container, maybe even longer.It's worth a try. Highly recommend. And definitely buy on Amazon. It's a lot cheaper than going to the salon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on my hair","review":"Sorry, but this product does not work on my coarse, straight hair. Yes, the product starts off stiff--so stiff that you almost can barely apply and run it through your hair. It is so freakishly shiny I have Darth Vader helmet head. Not strong enough to slick my hair back, and falls apart in no time flat, and I can't even restyle it. My hair isn't even that long--the longest parts fall right at my earlobes. I tried using a small amount, I've tried using generous amounts, doesn't work for me. A waste of money.

I've got thick straight hair. The biggest nightmare you can imagine to tame after a hot shower. The only two things that I have found which can even come close to reigning in this beast is lots of hair gel or the combination of Sumo Wax and Aqua Net hair spray.

There is so much complexity to this band, yet understanding is simple bacause all you really have to do is listen. Euroboy's thunderous riffs are sublime, and Hank's hysterical lyrics give the music added legitamacy. Don't pay too much attention to those homophobics (Ken B.) who fear Turbonegro because of their homoerotic lyrics. This theme was created because it was the only thing that would \\"strike fear\\" into the hearts of the hardcore Norwegian death punk kids. In addition, the theme was adopted long before the great american media acceptance of homosexuals. So put aside your preconceptions and give Turbonegro a chance. What you'll find inside is heavy hitting, body moving, head pounding rock n' roll. Punk isn't dead, but Turbonegro isn't exactly punk. They do put on the greatest live show around."},{"rating":"1","title":"punk is still very dead","review":"Turbonegro is the music equivalent of \\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\\". What this means is that this band tries to be hip and cool by being gay. Homosexuality is not a trend, and straight men should not listen to this music. And what of the music, the same punk rock thats been hashed out from coast to coast for 20 years and still is crap. Just because it's Norweigan doesn't make it better. This isn't irony, this is stupidity. \\"Oh dude! a haha, turbonegro pretend to be gay\\", so I don't care, Elton John actually is gay, and his music is ten times better (Elton John, as we all know, isn't that great either). Man, punk is so dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best band of our time","review":"This is a great introduction to the best band of our time. Turbonegro combines the classic punk style of the clash and the sex pistols with amazing guitar solos by euroboy who could be called the modern day hendrix.

I've been waiting for this book to come out for years. The pictures in here are very well drawn. Jane is as I pictured her to be. She's plain and proper. She might look a little to old to be 18, though. Rochester looks like a dark, brooding Master. He might be a bit too handsome, however. Mrs. Reed looks like a creepy old witch. Adele has really short hair which I think should be long and curly. The cover art does not match the pictures inside. Jane does not have curly hair. One of the pictures is in the wrong place, and a few are inaccurate. For example, when Rochester is at Ferndean, he should have a hand missing, but they show him with both hands. Overall, the pictures are very well done. The rewritten story is close enough to the book. It's a little abrupt at times, but still a good read for a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Bonanza - Great Read!","review":"If you're a fan of the Bonanza TV series, you'll love this book. If you're not a fan, this story will make you one. I couldn't wait to get this book and when I did I couldn't put it down. For those of us who enjoyed watching Bonanza on television, this story is the quintessential episode in print.The author captures every voice and every nuance of all those colorful Ponderosa characters and took me back to a time and place that was such a pleasure to relive.Who would have thought that Ben's faithful cook, Hop Sing, and his most gentle son, Hoss, were so much fun? This story is filled with wit and humor at every turn. A heartfelt, beautifully written story that you'll enjoy from beginning to end.Congratulations Monette, this is a very engaging read and you've managed to keep the old Bonanza TV series alive and kicking with such a memorable novel.I look forward to \\"Mystic Fire\\".Alberto"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner!

Adam, Hoss, Little Joe, Ben and Hop Sing are all absolutely true to the original characters and are lovingly painted by an author who really knows her stuff!If you love Bonanza, BUY THIS BOOK - You will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe This Book is Getting All These Good Reviews!","review":"Personally, I think this book is a HUGE waste of money. It's slow moving, the characterizations just don't fit and I find myself forcing myself to pick it up to read another chapter. The premise it is centered around is interesting, but the characters just don't fit the Cartwrights. Some characteristics are just plain stupid. Like people of Virginia City wouldn't recognize Hoss because he changes his clothes, rides a different horse and uses a ridiculous fake accent to avoid detection by an enemy.I will say the author did some research of the area and of Indian language and customs, but the cudos end there. This novel isn't as bad as those written by Calder in the 1990's. I doubt he even saw a Bonanza episode. But that's not saying very much.

Flying a helo and a plane are completely different, as his character quickly discovers.

It always reminds me of the 'Masterpiece Theatre' theme with great pomp and circumstance, but weak on musical value. That is, until the arias! They are still no match for the great German or Italian arias, and they are just a bit tinny, like so much English music (except the works of the German Handel), but this is still good stuff.The plot is almost entirely inconsequential, as it is pure fantasy. The work's greatest value to the casual listener is that it is a great exemplar of English Restoration musical theatre, which seemed to have a lot more in common with American musical theatre than the operas by continental composers.A facinating piece from a neglected corner of musical history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an authorized paperback","review":"This book is NOT a paperback of the hardcover version. It's a \\"bound galley,\\" meaning that it's a pre-publication version before the author had the opportunity to revise it.

Do not buy it in the belief that you will receive an inexpensive of the hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Quality is awful","review":"The books begins with an introduction, then many images from the Tres Riches Heures, and at the end there is a commentary of the pictures.The big problem is that the pictures were made in the sixties, they are fuzzy, unsharp, the colors are not vivid and bright, such a very low quality of photocomposition is no more acceptable at the end of the 20th century. It is high time that a newer edition be made available in English, as is already the case in French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rougher, more authentic sound than Hills of Erin","review":"Although Karen prefers her new album, The Hills of Erin, Knock on the Door remains my favourite. This album has a firey intensity to Karen's hammered dulcimer playing, a knock-em-down and drag-them-up style of whamdiddling that has you snapping your fingers and dancing on your feet. Fast scales and throbbing basenotes - all played on the same dulcimer, make this a treat to the ears. It's even better when heard - and seen - live.

The Pathetique is the most interesting, but even then loses its momentum with the extremely liberal interpretation of tempo in places. The C Major is nearly unlistenable. Tempo and dynamic changes seem unrelated to the overall concept of the piece. The first movement in particular seems to lack an overall sense of wholeness. And the sparkling final movement isn't. Well recorded and proficiently played but where's the music? To boot, the liner notes are \\"new age\\" blather without real content.

I loved the first seven books; it was my favorite series at the time. Book 8 let me down a little bit but this one was just awful. None of the characters are anywhere nearly as interesting as the initial characters. Thorn is much less interesting than Michaels. Fiorella adds a subplot while Lowe adds nothing. Fernandez is now a guest star. Kent is an extremely subpar substitution for John Howard. The new Gridley is a joke compared to the old hotshot. The antagonists have no depth. Michaels needs to get back in the picture and save the series from sticking itself farther down the tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spring-bored","review":"Are they kidding? This series has turned into Net Farce. In no particular order we get a Chinese computer geek who breaks into mega secure US government systems as well as some heavy duty commercial systems with consumate ease, a lecture on religion, or lack thereof, our hero, Jay Gridley, getting a new pair of VR glasses which may or may not let him catch the Chinese computer geek, several lectures on parenthood and is it more important than the job, Abe Kent stalking and killing the bad guy from the last book (or was it two books ago) after the bad guy first steals Abe's socks without taking his shoes off, a Chinese general who hatched the whole plot (plot? plot? don't ask!) and bites the big one (really!) while in Net Force custody, and oh what a lovely romp.

I think it's picked up a virus and needs to get its hard drive wiped and reformated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this book is absolutely horrible","review":"Admittedly, I haven't read anything else in the Net Force series, but this book was just disgraceful. I bought it on an impulse by at the gas station, and started reading it. What a horrible mistake.There is no semblance of a plot or cohesion, and forget about character development. Mostly, all of the characters sit around 'grinning' at each other. This is one of the maybe 1 book in 200 that made me want to put it down and throw it away. That is not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion Reigns","review":"I am a Tom Clancy addict, I've read them all. This is absoultly the worst book ever put out under his name. Actually it may be the worst book of its type I have ever tried to read. I put it down after about 100 pages. There is no plot, the characters are one dimentional, and the story drags, with many pages that have nothing to do with the story. Grindly keeps going off into virtual reality and these little excursions make absolutly no sense.

It's just not the same as a real Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A point to make","review":"I have agree that this is the worst book of the series so far, but if you'll examine the credits a bit more, you'll see that Clancy isn't responsible for this farce. He had the basic concept and then handed it over to Perry. And I ahve to say quite honestly that Perry generally isn't that great an author, he seems to generate most of his sales by hanging onto the coattails of better authors and series i.e. Clancy, Star Wars, etc... But don't blame Clancy for this one, unless you think he should have proofread it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid book","review":"The Net Force haven't always been up to par with Clancy' other books and with the other ongoing serirs, Op-center.

I've read all Clancy's own works and this is something else entirely. I can honestly say, one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.The story although somewhat basic was more or less a passable effort for about three quarters, excusing the cliches, stereotypes, meandering story lines, building up we think to some climactic event? Wrong. What happened towards the end left me truly stunned and feeling quite cheated.It felt almost as if it was thrown together over a coffee in a single sitting, no thought, no plan.We're left to believe that the whole book was somehow a plan of misdirection for the events in the final couple of chapters, though why or even how these would be linked, god knows. Just complete random rubbish"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is clancy?","review":"Not necessary to repeat the prior reviews--I gagged and tossed this disjointed book mid-way through, wondering if Clancy, HIMSELF , will write again. Hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is a flop","review":"This is easily the worst entry into the series. The plot took the team into an arena that is not their forte. Probably 7/8 of the book is a buildup to a conflict that lasts maybe a dozen pages. It reads like something that was thrown together at the last minute to meet a publisher's deadline. There was so little plot impetus, a secondary plot from an earlier entry was needed to pad the number of pages. The bad thing is that it was more interesting than the primary plot line and over, also in an unsatisfactory manner, half way through the book. Not much right with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have found previous Net Force novels fairly entertaining, but this one is terrible. It tries to make up for poor plot and lack of good VR sequences by including sexual escapades of various characters in almost every other chapter, descriptions of nudity in some of the VR's, and even the art hanging in some of the homes described. I can't believe Clancy has stooped this low.

The songs deal with such issues as responsibility, AIDS, and with human nature. Oliver sings about universal themes of manhood--the things that unite and separate us. The dance numbers were popular at world music dance joints and clubs a few years back. They still make you wanna shake your booty. Pure fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumbs Up","review":"This CD is absolutely fabulous...I can't stop listening to it!

So, when I saw Oliver's \\"Tuku Music,\\" I thought I'd give it a listen. That was over a year ago and, to this day, I still constantly listen to this album! (I am listening to it as I write...) It's an incredible piece of music. The album's songs are simply enthralling: well-played, subtle, enchanting, beautiful, with tasty rhythmic nuances and Oliver's smooth voice accompanied by great backup singers. Words cannot do this album justice--it's incredible. If you are at all interested in this genre of music, you MUST get this album--you will not regret your choice! I just can't wait until I see Oliver later this year in NJ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you listen, the more you like","review":"At first, I thought that the songs on this record were pleasant, but overlong and repetitive.

Tuku is a great modern artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD!","review":"I've been delving into African music for the past few years, and Mtukudzi is one of the best African artists I've ever come across.

I did watch five minutes of \\"A woman is a woman\\" and after that I just coulnd't take it anymore so I did throw the thing out in the window. This DVD is absolute c**p. The image is blurry and finally unwatchable but I think that the worst part is actually the sound: you can't hear a thing. I'm actually french and I don't understand Belmondo and Karina, but they're speaking the same language as me. I think that pretty much every aspect of this DVD makes it not worth buying. That is not the first time Fox Lorber make a good movie unwatchable, they also screwed big time with Padre Padrone and Ulysse's gaze.P.S.: Next time you make a DVD, make sure that the subtitles are optional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky, but boring!","review":"Une Femme est Une Femme is more of an experiment than anything else, a prelude to Godard's better works, and I sort of regret renting it. Anna Karina is lovable as always, but she isn't given much to do with a pointless plot (\\"I want a baby! Who cares why?\\"). It's pretty forgettable, and a bit hard to finish.If you haven't seen any of Godard's works, I recommend starting with Pierrot Le Fou or Breathless. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman is a Woman","review":"Half musical, half madcap New Wave romantic comedy, Godard's highbrow take on a beloved Hollywood tradition remains dazzling not because of the musical sequences, which are jokey and deliberately amateurish, but because of Karina's refreshingly impetuous presence. Brialy and Belmondo play well against her chippy airs, coming off as adorably hip, chain-smoking straight men. With visual and sound gags galore, Godard's playfulness is at its peak in this French valentine to Bob Fosse, Cyd Charisse, and all those fickle, mercurial femmes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull movie, shabby DVD","review":"Not a musical, not a comedy, hardly a tribute to Hollywood movies -- not much of anything, really. Aside from \\"Breathless\\", isn't it time to admit Godard is among the world's most overrated auteurs? But even if you love this movie, the Fox-Lorber DVD will disappoint you; the subtitles on this print must have beeen hard to read in theatres, let alone in a less-than-state-of-the-art video transfer. Maybe a nice Criterion edition with commentary might change my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman is a Woman (1961) - Jean-Luc Godard","review":"A Woman is a Woman is Jean-Luc Godard's non-linear take on the American musical. The film is visually bold, the music is whimsical, but the story is more neo-realistic, which makes A Woman is a Woman a very different type of film. It's interesting because it's really all one big contradiction, and the narrative is often broken by irregular sound and music exits, and characters who acknowledge the audience. The cinemascope photography is nice, and the performances by all are pleasent. At this stage of his career, Godard wasn't ready to make a \\"regular\\" film, yet he still wanted to nod his head to film genres which inspired him. Ultimately, A Woman is a Woman is Godard's musical film, and yet it isn't a musical at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste time or money.","review":"Only if you are the most die hard movie buff should you get this movie. It is interesting to see another version of the Wizard of Oz, especially with a Oliver Hardy appearence in it. But the production of the DVD is amaturish. The music switches back and forth from appropriate old piano music to a digital score that sounds like it was produced from \\"baby's first keyboard\\". Even more bizzare and annoying is the fact that the producers saw fit to have someone read the dialouge out loud every time a card pops up. It boggles my mind why anyone would think these are good ideas. The movie is easier to take if you watch it with one push of the fast forward. Its too bad that an old silent on dvd has to be ruined by idiotic \\"improvements\\". Hopefully this company won't have any more silents at their disposal to trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"For anyone who loves silent movies, this version of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is not worth your time.

A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"a curiousity piece to be sure","review":"This particular version of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was too heavy on the slapstick. I expect such things out of Mack Sennett, and I was waiting for the Keystone Kops to appear. It's hard to believe that only 14 years later, in 1939, a version would appear that would eclipse all others, past & previous. The \\"music\\" for this version was akin to nails on a blackboard, and I ended up turning the volume off to make this more viewable.

This story is only loosely connected to the L. Frank Baum books or the 1939 film that is the definite version. Basically, this is a cornball slapstick-happy tale about 1920s comic Larry Semon fighting for Dorothy's hand in marriage. Filled with bad puns and corny gags (an African-American character is billed as \\"G. Howe Black\\"-a real knee slapper ain't it)? The only reason anyone would have to watch this (Baum himself died by this time and had nothing to do with the story) is because of the early appearance of Oliver Hardy as the tin man (and this is not one of his better roles). Nah, see it just for curiousity and read the Baum books or the Judy Garland film for the real deal. Early in the film, a little girl who is having this tale read to her (she must have been really naughty to deserve such punishment) says, \\"Oh Grampy, I don't like that!\\" Trust me, you'll say the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"...for the record...","review":"...silent films were never silent, there was always live music, be it a lone piano, a small ensemble, a theater organ, or a full orchestra at the biggest theaters, so the question of accompaniment is not merely academic. That said, no score could possibly help this tedious mess of a film. I saw it once for free at a local library and was able to laugh at, not with, the film, but now I can only find it painful. Only for silent film completists - if it did go out of print it would be no real loss, and that's from a diehard silent film enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree","review":"Other than catching an early Ollie Hardy and the few bits of the tale that do adhere to the Wizard of Oz, much of this is a showcase for Semon, who not only must have had an ego the size of Saturn, but who's a virtually unknown silent comediam today for an excellent reason -- he wasn't funny.

Fast show off licks don't compensate.

And oh brother, have they succeeded--with Dennis Chambers no less!The best fusion is rock for adults with few suprises and lots of musical skill. But these songs--if that's what they are--are just excercises in unnecessary complexity--like Microsoft software.I notice an interesting parallel with Scott Henderson who is, of course, brilliant but he seems to feel the need to venture further and further into the incomprehensible. (Compare albums like Spears and Dr. Hee vs. the latest from Tribal Tech and you'll see what I mean).BTW, you can download some great Brett Garsed tracks at mp3.com and his instructional video also displays how great he sounds, playing over recongizable chord changes and tempos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morbidly Brilliant","review":"Loved this book so much!

If you use a lot of silicone-based smoothing/detangling products (conditioners, leave ins, shine balms/sprays) your hair will feel really bad until you stuff moisture back in. Think of it like stripping old varnish off your coffee table -- the wood underneath wasn't getting natural oils and moisture because the varnish blocked it, so it will feel really dry until you perk it back up again.I use this before I cassia-dye my hair (it's like henna), because the iron build up in my tap water can make the color go from the intended pale gold to off-green!

The printed wrapping on each ream is plastic, and there was not enough to keep the reams from bouncing around in the slightly oversized box, so the plastic was a little torn on each ream (although it was largely intact), the only reason I did not rate this five stars.

If you want to get to the bottom of all the lies and hoopla the media has thrown around John's fame and success, read this book. It makes his fans and those who admired him from afar feel like they truly get to know him as a person instead of a character or celebrity. Also, if you have lost someone close to you, this book is helpful in learning how to carry on and knowing that you're not alone. Extremely touching and emotional story. Ms. Jacklin, if you read this, thank you so much for giving your story to John's fans.

Then, marriages often were arranged, the king's orders were obeyed, and life was difficult. No, I was not absorbed by the homosexual aspects of the story, but that particular section is brief. I DID feel sorry for John Tradescant as he dealt with the aftermath of that interlude.Please note that I am an avid gardener and, as such, can empathize with the character's interest in plants. It was quite interesting to me to learn more about the man who did so much for British horticulture, and as a resident of Virginia, I am looking forward to reading the sequel (VIRGIN EARTH) to see what his son found in the New World."},{"rating":"2","title":"earthly Joys","review":"Philippa Gregory seems to have kept quite close to historical facts in accuracy, when comparing her fiction to a factual book on Tradescant's life.It is a pacy read with emotional and erotic scenes;good descriptions of the finding of rarities and plants, modes of travel, social,religious,political feelings of the time.The story brings history to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting perspective","review":"This is a fascinating story of the political turmoil surrounding King Charles I from a wonderful perspective. It was very clever how it entwined gardening with the turbulent times of the era, how the great men found a type of release in the garden away from the real world.However I found it the tiniest bit bland after the 'Wise Woman'. Maybe I just didn't agree with his personal heirarchy, where a woman barely rates a mention after God and King and the Lords? A sign of the times! I have the sequel on my shelf and look forward to losing myself in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I love most of what I have read by this author and so was surprised that I did not like this book. It was pretty good for the first three quarters of the story and then degenerated into a graphic homosexual love affair that not only made me uncomfortable but seemed completely unrealistic and false. Up until that time I had enjoyed the way the characters had been written and the way the story was developing and then it suddenly veered off and seemed as if I was reading an entirely different book half way through. It was less a book written about a historical period in time and more about the relationship between the main character and his employer (his Lord). Honestly it was a little weird and I was disappointed. What a shame her books are usually a really good read. If this was the first time I had read Phillipa Gregory I wouldn't have read any thing else she had written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, disappointing rubbish.","review":"As an avid fan of all other novels by Philippa Gregory, I was terribly let down by this one. Unless you are a gardener or botanist interested in the origins of English gardening, there is nothing remotely interesting about this story. And even the historical facts, which are usually so masterfully intertwined with the plot in Gregory's other books, are given very little attention. The main focus is on the characters, but the characters never change or grow or learn from past experience. One theme is established at the outset of the book, and it just continues in the same dull vein until the end. Stuck with it because of how much I loved her other work, but I'm sorry that I wasted weeks of reading on this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird","review":"Have enjoyed her other books. this book proves that \\"company men\\" live in all ages.

I was very disappointed in this stilted, boring book...I can only imagine that it is enjoyable to garden enthusiasts. Unlike Gregory's other novels, which have unexpected twists and enough action to keep one interested, 'Joys' drags on, with pages and pages devouted solely to plant descriptions. Gregory's attempt at some sort of 'love connection' between the gardener and his master is completely unromantic. I encourage anyone who likes this genre to read Phillip Gregory's work-just don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earthly Joys","review":"I love Philappa Gregory but was disappointed with this book.

I was certain I would love it--as I have Gregory's other books.

Small amount of the talks give very dramatic effects for Sylvester Stallone. The plot is kind of boring. But, viewing Sylvester Stallone is always a treat. Sharon Stone was not acting. No one really acted, but the entire setting was acted. It created an impression that the movie story is a part of the long stories that are told together for an epic of the '90's till 2005.

The producers wished that the appeal of putting Sly and Stone together would be sufficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE BEST!","review":"After ROCKY and COPLAND, this is Stallone's best film. Eric Roberts and james woods steal this film with brilliant performances, and rod steiger is an added bonus. There has never been a more interesting concept for a big hollywood action film.

These are three very good actors. You have Sharon Stone looking incredibly hot and at her peak of sexiness. And then you have... STALLONE. This peice of wood is the only person I know that can make a nude sex scene with Sharon Stone boring. He is so gassed up and that his lack of body fat has his face looking like a skeleton. The guy is a horrible actor. He was good in the first Rocky and man... he sucks in everything he is in (and don't tell me about Copland.

I have to wonder why?? Personally, I like his style and he's very VERY easy on the eyes as well. I read that Stone had a crush on Stallone and was anxious to work with him. (another beautiful actress, Madeline Stowe, said the same thing about her screen time with him). Perhaps some folks think that by trashing Stallone's acting, they can somehow feel superior? Trust me, it aint working. The man is hawt, the chemistry sizzles, and you get one guess who I fantasize about...the action scenes are good too, but I expect that in a Stallone film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sexy action packed thriller!","review":"I cannot believe the bad reviews for this movie!

It takes place in colorful, sunny, hot Miami Beach. The chemistry between the two of them is just hot & the shower sex scene was steamy as hell! Stallone is confident, masculine & convincing in his role as an explosives expert. James Woods was great to watch. He's a terrific actor! Eric Roberts is always convincing as the bad guy.

The interplay between Victor and Steve is nothing short of a marriage of style and sound from two masters.

This album is not just another slap fest or \\"lets see who can rip the fastest lines\\" but is quite melodic even with some of the complex timing. Dennis Chambers as usual rules on drums but isn't overpowering. I highly recommend this to all musicians who have the privilege of carrying the bottom and causing the groove to flow. It amazes me to think just what Victor will sound like ten years from now as he continues to progress and experiment.

From reading the pages of this book I sense a deep, consistent and mature faith that has originated not from the dusty halls of academia but from experience.Not to say that this work is somehow a \\"Revelations for Dummies\\". Quite the opposite it respects the complexities of the final book of the bible yet outlines them in a succinct way in which the reader will be able to recall the outline or main points of the book.If I were to fault this book it would be in the writing style.

I just couldn't sympathize or empathize with most of the characters. They seemed curiously flat. I had a feeling about the way the book was going to end, and was disappointed to be right. Couldn't tell if I just didn't \\"get it\\" or if it was really not that great of a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the watch.... Awakens the adventurer!","review":"Great series. Strong in storyline and plot, and talks about interesting flying skills as well. It also wakes up your sense of adventure and appreciation for their craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the books that I reach for the most","review":"I collect baking cookbooks and I have many. This book is one I reach for often. There are a few of my favorite recipes in here. The White Birthday Cake Frosting is the BEST! I make it all the time and always get raves about it. There is also a Raspberry Cheesecake Bar Recipe that is to die for! I give this book only 4 stars because there are recipes in this book that I think are not that great. I bake frequently (a least a few times a week) and therefore I'm pretty familiar with recipes that work and ingredients that work. The recipes that are not that great are few though. No matter what cookbook you buy, you can always expect to like only so many of the recipes either due to personal opinion or the fact that it just might not be a good recipe. I recommend this book if you like good old fashioned baking. Lots of easy recipes and classic recipes. It's inexpensive and has tons of recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Delicious baking","review":"I checked out this book from the library and was inspired to buy it, I had to have my own copy! My favorite recipe is the blueberry muffins with the crumb topping, so easy to whip up. My 14 yr. old daughter loves to use the book often and surprises us with delicious treats. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to bake, specially with such easy, delicious recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!

The cord seems to be of good quality too.I think it would be ideal with three outlets and a voltage display (or some led type indicator - so you know it is doing something).For the price here, I would most likely buy it again - in part because I know it will last a long time and I hope it would protect the tv in the event of a power surge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster HTFS 500 Power Center","review":"I wanted a power filter to use behind my new 46 inch Z series Sony HDTV and this product fit the bill.

It's flatter, and smaller than others. It is perfectly mounted on my wall directly behind my TV, you cannot see it at all unless you are looking behind the TV.

I also love that the main characters are female and the hero in the end (the queen- female) is described as very smart.

She was uncertain as to whether she was a size 9 or 10, but I checked through the reviews and read that the sandals tend to run large. So I got the size 9.This proved to be a wise move. They fit well, and she loves them!Before I purchased the sandals, I noticed that a woman at my church was wearing a pair that looked just like the Chaco Z/2. When I asked her, she said that they were her favorite footwear. The tread looked different on hers, and she said it was because after about 6 years of regular wear, she had to get them resoled. So, that's cool - you can get new soles on these sandals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!","review":"Great sandals, fast service and one happy customer! :) I love the design and fit the colors also work great together! Happy happy happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chacos Rule!","review":"Chacos are rugged yet good looking sandals for hiking or running around town. Begin by wearing them a little at a time as the footbed is patterned and may feel rough at first, once your foot is acclimated you won't want to wear any other shoe! Best to try on if a half size to see where your arch lines up on the shoe. I love the fact that these can be re-soled or re-strapped if needed...and they last a LONG time!

The only bad parts about this toy is that I have to argue with the 10 & 11 year olders about being too big to ride on the car and cannot get the 6 children ranging in age from 3 - 5 years to take turns riding the jeep. We actually have to time each child's useage . My neighbor is now going to purchase one for his son who is turning 3 next month. The jeep comes with seat belts and is well balanced so actually safe for everyone. It has some pep and 2 speeds forward (also reverse), so adjustments can be made.

I had especially wanted \\"At the Ceili\\" and \\"Spanish Lady\\", two of the bonus songs. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the front insert had all of the words to all the songs. That may not be important to everyone, but it definitely matters to me. The charm is nice, and it comes with an explanation of the claddagh, but it's nothing impressive. If you want the extra songs, it's a great buy. If you don't care either way, get the regular CD - it much cheaper. For me, despite its being way more expensive than the basic A New Journey CD, I think it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best production I've seen","review":"They have a sound and production better than any I have seen.

If you are a fan of and own the Lion King CD you will love this CD.

I was looking forward to this music since I heard one song on PBS. Should have investigated more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"The CD did not include many of the best songs that were on the DVD, such as Orinco Flow, Sing Out, and Spanish Lady, as well as others.Turns out there is a deluxe version that is supposed to include them, but apparently is very hard to find.Accordingly, this definitely is a classic example of bait and switch marketing. The producers obviously intended to mislead customers, by using a cover on the CD similar to that on the DVD.In any event, I will not order the deluxe version. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.Amazon needs to put a disclaimer on this advertisement warning customers that the content of the CD is not the same as the DVD.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.....","review":"This CD is a disappointment. The artists are wonderful, but this recording does nothing to showcase their skills. The mix is low-end heavy, vocals are buried and the over-use of reverb is almost laughable. This may have been the result of mixing on overly-bright monitors, but the result is a messy, in-articulate smear of sound that masks the beauty of the performances. The audio on the DVD or the PBS broadcast is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic Woman - Go for the Deluxe set with the DVD","review":"The recordings are great on the cd. Having purchased the deluxe cd package with 4 extra songs and the locket was a good idea. However - I would have really enjoyed the Complete DVD-CD set as there are even more songs on the DVD that didn't make the cd cut. But which ever you choose, you will not be disappointed.

This group of Irish lasses are beautiful as the beautiful renditions they sing. Cute and breezy little Mairead is a fiddler of such great soul, you'd think she learned the instrument from her crib.

They weren't satirizing the average parade-goer's ignorance either; they were just as clue-less. If you are not interested in authenticity, and are nostalgic for 50s doo-wop, this a cappella group is very agreeable elevator music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voices to die for","review":"I first saw these ladies on a PBS special and fell in love with their voices. The blending of their voices sends chills down my spine.The music choices, for the most part, is excellent. I have always disliked the song 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' until I heard these ladies sing it.The songs in Gaelic are fun - and though I can now sing along with most of it, I have no clue what I am singing.If I had a voice like one of these women, I could quit my day job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Journey for Celtic Woman","review":"Once Again the Celtic Woman explode on the stage with their talant.

Each artist can be heard performing individually as well as together in adaptations of tradition folk music such as \\"Dulaman\\", \\"Scarborough Fair\\", and\\" Spanish Lady\\", adult contemporary which include \\"Beyond the Sea\\", the classical pieces of \\"Lascua Ch'io Pianga, and newer composition in the Celtic style which include \\"The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun\\", \\"At the Ceili, and \\"Caledonia. Maireasd's solo performances in\\"Grasssnuaile's Dance\\", and \\"Shenandoah-The Pacific Shore\\" are just as enjoyable as seeing her perform. Listing to her on the CD provides an appreciation of her great talent as a violinist. The music touches the spirit and takes the individual on a journey beyond the senses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Harmonies","review":"I bought this as a gift for my mother, and we listened to it together this summer while driving in the car.

This is a must ifyou are a fan of Celtic music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating is for the CD, not the music","review":"So, I love Celtic Woman and was so excited to add this one to my collection. I get the CD, pop it in my laptop and try to burn it to my computer. After several frustrating tries, I finally give up. That's when I noticed the freakin sticker on the front CD cover that says it's a protected CD. So I look it up and basically it means I can't play it on my computer and I can't make it into mp3's and add to my zune. I use my zune for everything, work, car, docking station at home.

It'll make you laugh, cry, and just feel good about yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough, unintentionally funny, and inteeresting","review":"In the pre-Public Enemy days when I was in college, my friends and I would buy used Last Poets albums and laugh ourselves sick at the wild, ranting, lyrics that would probably get censored on this review. At the time, we considered them too outrageous to take seriously and dismissed it as shock theater, whereas the Original Last Poets (Kain, Felipe, and David Nelson) were a bit more profound with their material (compare this album with the Original Last Poets' \\"Right On\\" and you'll see what I mean). However, this is far more meaningful that the cartoon militancy of the gangster rap of 20 years later. Either way, there is never a dull moment on this one. They do get redundant on the later albums, though. Listen and think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a gourmet Kenya coffee, but very satisfactory","review":"I've been roasting my own coffee for over eight years now and usually buy small amounts of gourmet green beans. I've been impressed with coffees from Kenya lately and decided to try this Kenya AA. It has a mild flavor when roasted to a medium roast. The price of coffee is going to rise because of fungus problems in Central and South America. So I've been trying more African coffees and have found some excellent Ethiopian, Rwandan and Burundi coffees. Kenya has good infrastructure and Kenya coffees have a better quality than others. I don't think one can go wrong purchasing Kenyan coffee. Of course if you roast it yourself you have more control over the freshness and can avoid the overly dark, oily coffee that has become the norm found in branded coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING IN EVERY ASPECT, THEY EARNED MY BUSINESS FOR EVER.","review":"THE COFFEE IS HIGH QUALITY, THE SHIPMENT IS PROMPT, PACKAGE CLEAN...GENEROUS OWNERS, IT WEIGHED MORE THAN WHAT I PAID FOR.THEY EARNED MY BUSINESS FOR EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chintzy, not worth the price","review":"This flag is the lowest-quality garden flag we've ever had.The fabric is very thin (I can see through it) and has a paper-y feel to it.

Turning tricks in the studio is deception, no matter who is working that street corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaotic mess...","review":"In the booklet that accompanies this accompanies this CD Bomp! records explains how this Cd came about. After reading about Stiv Bators not singing in the mic on purpose(only later to go back and over dub the vocals - in which he did a horrible job) and the spliced guitar parts this album is a chaotic mess. Bomp! wrote a whole lot about Stiv's performance in the booklet trying to make it sound better than it was... I'm sorry but when you're introducing Sonic Reducer as your newest song (in an unsarcastic manner mind you) in a Los Angeles studio overdub booth 3 years after the fact it comes off as pure crud. And one more thing where's \\"High Tension Wire\\" at?"},{"rating":"2","title":"No better instructional video available","review":"Henry Tamburin should receive great credit for creating an instructional video that introduces a beginner to the exciting game of craps. This video will answer all the questions you may have about craps. He acknowledges that this can be an intimidating game for a novice, but his teaching style in a real casino with real casino personnel is very effective in allowing a novice to feel comfortable playing craps for the first time. He also covers all bets possible, and explains the etiquette that is usually not taught. In addition, towards the end of the video, he role-plays and goes through a complete round of craps until he legitimately \\"craps out.\\" This video is easy to follow, informative, and entertaining to watch. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype:","review":"Despite the overall rating, don't get sucked in. I admire what Glenn has done over his illustrious career, but this album comes off sounding sophmoric at best. To be truthful, the keyboards are sub-par to match the chords. This album sounds like an ameteur tooling around with various string patterns on a low-end Yamaha keyboard. There is a theme, but it's washy and redundant. The album is short, non-direct and basically pointless. If you're looking for dark, ambient and professional non-lyrical digital work, check out Delerium.Black Aria isn't horrible; it just isn't memorable.Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soundtrack to Last War On Earth?","review":"This is Glenn's first stab at something like this.SOme call it classical to me it's not technical enough forthat. Instead it serves as hypnotic mood music. Meditativeand perhaps trance inducing. It sounds like at points itshould be the soundtrack to the movie THE Prophecy.(Glennmade a cameo in the sequel)I always wondered why they didn'tconsider him to do the scores after hearing this but whatever.I find this to be pretty relaxing. Soundwise it has a littleof that DIY feel to it. Which to me adds to the charm of thisshort disc. How short is it? Well it clocks in a half hour roughly. For those who want to hear something different by Danzigare encouraged to check this out.

Party Track","review":"What a great party track, I heard this for the first time at a holiday camp in Devon last summer. It's based around the Benny Hill Theme tune you know the one with the sax, well what a laugh when this came on in the disco everyone started doing a modern day version of the Conga round and round the dance floor but probably a bit faster which made it very interesting for those of us that had been drinking most of the night! As well as the sax parts theirs some catchy vocals and dance routine that goes along with the lyrics a bit like Ketchup song but much better. We requested this track all week and \\"Benny\\" brings back such good memories of our holiday, I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves a PARTY!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't give negative stars...","review":"Because you can't give negative stars, I'll give this product one star.

I've been useing it for a few months, and all its done is make me feel akward.Don't buy this product if your plus size.

I'm sure there are better available, but this one is pretty spectacular for the price vs size. Konka is relatively unknown in the US, but from articles and research, it appears they are number two in the Chinese market. The TV looks phenomenal mounted on my wall. HD channels are bright and vibrant. My only complaint is that the corners appear like a faded white over black screens, if you turn the TV off to its soft power off/sleep state. When you hard power off (via the master power switch) overnight, the whiteness goes away. Obviously no comparison to a 4000:1 contrast ratio monitor, but who cares when it's this cheap?

So I had the pleasure of rediscovering it a few years ago when my kids were the right age for it. It's a wonderful \\"reading aloud\\" book (as are \\"We didn't mean to go to sea\\" and \\"Great Northern\\"), with a strong female character -- unusual in children's books from 65 years ago! -- and terrific storytelling and pacing.(Some of) the Chinese in this book come off as crafty, selfish, barbaric, etc. That's quite intentional -- their characters are supposed to be crafty, selfish, or barbaric. Because we see them only through the eyes of the English, they tend to be a bit one-dimensional as well. Probably some people out there is saying that this book is politically incorrect; if so, I urge them to tell their children not to read it.

Our only teacher taught all grades (1st-6th),a total of about 20 children at any one time! She had amassed a small library, housed in orange crates; many of the status of Arthur Ransome's series. This book swept me away from post-war shortages, and into the China Sea. Pirates, sailing ships, rocky coasts covered with paths, caves, monkeys, smells of cloves and curry - children being valued for their clever ideas, adventures around every corner, intrigue and mystery! I dreamt about this story and sailing between the rocky islands, tidal bores and the Great Dragon of China - the Yangtze River. I am still fascinated with China to this day!

Strange though that according to recent surveys Netscape 4 (which fails miserably with the examples presented) has about 7 times the number of installations than Netscape 6.Also, chapter 21 covers SVG, which some say will make an impact, others say it won't, however there is no use to cover this very exotic topic in a \\"Teach Yourself\\" series book.There are also a lot of other topics that are important but missing.

If the number is less than zero, then its modulus is the negation of the number - that is, the modulus of -5 is 5.

It smells like the other Kerastase products, but I could barely read the instructions on the jar (which is an inconvenient container in any case). The mask sat on my hair forever (you have to leave on for 10-15 min.) in the shower and felt worse and worse -- it may not be apparent but this product is not for those with sensitive skin.

Stupid beyond belief, the powers that be missed the chance to turn a great action story into a great action movie. Dumb. What should have been a stirring space epic with bold knights in armour, treachery and villainous aliens becomes a tedious - and cringingly bad at times - waste of time. One day, perhaps, someone will have the guts to make a proper film version of Anderson's great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"Sorry, but this is a dismal movie. It starts badly when the credit blurb on the packaging says Paul, not Poul Anderson. Not only is it completely unlike the book but the attempted humour almost entirely misses the mark.

It's including elements of jazz, rock, latin rythms, house and more, and all in a gentle-softness-smoothy style, that catchs you from the first moment, like your favorite perfum and suite. This product is something unique, clean, calm, European, a fine contrast to the rap, [word] and all trash on the MTV and so.

I noticed as soon as I received it that the name had changed to Thickening HAIRspray. Well, they seem to have added a styling element to it that makes it sticky, and I am forced to return it. The old formula did just that: it was a thickening spray, and made blowouts easier and with better results. The volumizing element was unparalleled! But the new formula adds a stickiness, like a non-aerosol hairspray would, and I can't get past it. Oh well, time to find a new volumizing spray..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula changed, not the same product!","review":"So disappointed - I used to use the old formula called 'Thickening Spray' - this new version is called 'Thickening Hairspray' and contains Denatured Alcohol as the third ingredient - yuck!

Of course, in 40 years there have been significant advances in the technical approach to TV filming, and some visual aspects of this original version are a little dated e.g. wigs, costuming and set design.

It has a wealth of drum rhythms to add to any drum circle. I learn best by watching, and the techniques used on the DVD are very helpful. Each rhythm is shown for long enough amount to allow you to pick up the rhythm and play along. I am very pleased with the versatility of the drum rhythms.

This DVD has been a great tool for me and it is well worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"not easy for beginners","review":"This DVD has a large collection of nice rhythms with clear views of hand pattern and should be nice to drum along with after one learns the rhythm. Unfortunately it is not easy for beginners to pick up the rhythms, which is a shame. If he would start each rhythm in slow motion (say, half speed) for a few rounds before going into normal speed, that would make life so much easier for learning. It would also help to \\"sing\\" the rhythms in the beginning (e.g. ga-da-gung-dung or base-slap-tone type of thing). These are all simple techniques used in most drum videos. I hope he would adopt them in a future release. It would also be nice to have these rhythms written down in a simple notation for quick reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Expectations","review":"I am a beginner and as such have several issues with this DVD. All with the way it was put together. There is only one view,frontal. An over the shoulder viewing angle would be easier to follow. Also, there is just one speed. So getting the hand movements is a challenge. Did use the DVD player controls to slow it down but can't hear the rhythm. The one thing I can't get the DVD player to do is to go to a particular selection. Its either watch each rhythm sequentially or hit fast forward and skip 5 at a time. The GO TO on the player doesn't get a response from the DVD. Was generous with a 2 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"Dorian Hawkmoon is the Eternal Champion.

The eccentric genius, Eric Von Stroheim supposedly had a hand in writing the script of this very strange movie and one could believe it; the film has a bizarre edge to it which only someone like him could conceive. This really bizarre Tod Browning production has Barrymore wrongly accused as a convicted prisoner who escapes Devil's Island. Henry B. Walthall (who achieved film immortality as the Little Colonel in BIRTH OF A NATION) is a mad scientist whose miraculous invention is a serum which will shrink living things. Once in Barrymore's hands, the old man seeks revenge on those who framed him... One of Browning's most arresting films, the oversized sets and props are expertly done and the movie is genuinely creepy in a perversely absurd way. Leonard Smith's photography is appropriately eerie with its long shadows & the special effects here are infinitely superior to those used for DR.

It's obvious that Carcass and Dismember were big influences on Impaled. Are those bad influences? No. They are 2 of the best. When all metal has been offering lately are clones of In Flames it is refreshing to see/hear a band that reminds me of the good old days back in the early '90s. Fast shredding riffs, precise drum rolls, a double vocal onslaught, and a knack for writing intriguing songs. There's no cookie-cutter ... here.On the first song, 'F(a)eces Of Death' there is the best roar that I have ever heard. It sounds like a demon-possessed bear. Crazy stuff. 'F(a)ecal Rites' also has a great sound-byte before the song kicks in, as well as 'Back To The Grave', which is probably my favorite song on the album besides 'All That Rots' and 'F(a)eces Of Death.' Each song on 'The Dead Shall Dead Remain' twist and turn and lead you on a pathological-grind killing-spree. Sit back, and watch the carnage ensue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gore/Grind release","review":"Along with Haemmorhage, Impaled are the kings of Carcass-worship. \\"The Dead Shall Dead Remain\\", while lacking a bit on the aesthetics (the production here does not do them justice at all), is one of my favorite releases from last year, and quite honestly, they surpass Exhumed by eons.

I am still trying to add to my collection, but many books on the subject are out of print and very expensive, As far as my order was concerned, it was expedited quickly and I got a brand new edition.

Very pleased with my purchase and the many purchased I have made over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but very long winded","review":"This is a good book for people who want to learn more about the great Italian luthier, but it definitely has its flaws. The book was written around the turn of the 20th century and its style is very stilted and convuluted.

This is the least user-friendly or professional friendly recorder I have ever purchased. The instructions are terribly translated, and very hard to follow, even for the seasoned recording user.

Sprinkled throughout is pertinent background information about the recruits, their instructors and military leaders of our time.

And then the book turned my emotions around (although not necessarily my decision on becoming a Marine) when the Marines who went through Parris Island together as Platoon 3086 gave their reviews of the Marine life. I give one friggin empathatic thank-you to the author for his unbiased accounts of the recruits and later Marines.

I particulary appreciate the look at boot camp through an adult perspective and interviews with DI's as to reason and motivation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reports From the Front","review":"This is like getting real-time reports from the front, before the fronts are developed.I originally got this because I know someone who will probably be going to boot camp this year. I was interested in what it's like, although I'd heard bits and pieces from previous recruits.The detail of the tasks and day-to-day and week-to-week was really good. I felt like it was my personal diary in the making. The chapters are divided along the various stages, which almost is a week-to-week thing.There's some historical information thrown in, which adds spice without making it into a history lesson. The later edition did add some new information. More geared toward the state of the Corps than any real changes in the boot camp portion.Definitely recommended for any recruit trying to get into the Corps, highly recommended for anyone that knows someone attempting the feat, and still recommended for others wondering what boot camp is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongly recommended for anyone looking to join the few","review":"I'd call this a must read for any potentials looking to join the few and the proud. I've been serving since '04 and plan on doing so until I retire or die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Like the Book","review":"Before our son left for boot camp in 2004, the whole family read this book. In his first letter home, he said, \\"Mom, the first 24 hours were exactly like the book said it would be.\\" I would say that's a great endorsement. Just a little outdated because it was written before the Crucible was added, but the rest is a great primer for recruits and their families. Very highly recommended by our Marine (now a Sergeant) son."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent documentary on basic Marine Corps training.","review":"I found Mr. Ricks book to be enlightening and excellent. As a recently commissioned second lieutenant in the Corps, I empathized with the recruits from Platoon 3086. Although I went through Officer Candidates School instead of Parris Island, the regimen of training is essentially the same, with the noted difference being that OCS adds extensive leadership evaluation to the mix. I would also have to agree with Mr. Ricks evaluation of the beliefs held by many in the officer corps with regard to social and political issues. Maybe Mr. Ricks will next take on a platoon at Officer Candidates School."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun at Parris Island","review":"This book follows a band of recruits through their experience at Parris Island, and beyond. It gives good historical background on the Marine Corps in an interesting narrative. The author is objective and doesn't gloss over the scars that still linger from Vietnam, and how they affect the Corps today.The book also provides a well rounded perspective on military life. Making the Corps is well written by someone who obviously has a great deal of insight on the subject.The book is most interesting as it tracks the individual recruits through their 11 weeks of training and their first year of service. I recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn more about the Marine Corps and wants to understand and appreciate the fierce allegiance that most Marines have for the Corps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is about USMC boot camp, and I enjoyed that part of the book. However the reason to read the book is Ricks' insight into the military's relationship with society at large. As an incoming Midshipman to the United States Naval Academy its been hard to explain to my parents why I want to join the military, but this book synthesized my feelings into an understandible idea. When I was done with the book I told my parents that if they wanted to understand my motivation for going to the Academy they would have to read it. If you are going to join the military, especially The Corps, or if you care about the military or society at all read this book.GO NAVY BEAT ARMY!!![.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"This explains alot....","review":"As someone who has entertained an interest in military culture her entire life, I picked up this book expecting a day to day account of the rigors of boot camp. What I got was a well-written explanatory account of Marine culture. As someone who knows many, many Marines, I always attributed their fierce loyalty to a family environment, but never knew that it was born out of basic training. Thinking about comments I have heard in the past (\\"Don't go into the corps if you aren't planning on taking care of my Marines\\"-a police officer who hasn't been in the Corps in 20 years to his son who wants to be an officer) this book not only reenforces where they came from, but also corroborates them. I recommend this book to anyone who is curious, anyone thinking about joining, anyone with close friends or family in the Marines."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Thank you very much, this was a great purchase for my son project this year. thank you again Kayla P."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" Return to the Old Corps , for the sake of our Country!","review":"It's time to return to the Old Corps! The heart and soul of a Marine is his discipline, unquestionable following of orders and respect. In this book it's very apparent young men and women need the Old Corps Ways. Without the Marine Corps they will be the lost generation of loveless parents. No one gives a Damn , except the Marine Corps. Yes I was and am a Old Marine graduating in 1967 serving in Viet nam in 1968. Boot camp was very physcial and hard . I can't explain to Non Marines, but the Old Marines will smile and agree with me .

It is not soft to touch, and if you like spending time on the floor it is not the rug for you. The colors are more muted and not nearly as bright as the photo online shows, but to me this is a good thing. Just be aware it will look more faded than the photo when you receive it. It is shedding like crazy and fills my vacuum quickly, so we will have to see how that goes, but I think it is pretty much normal for a new rug. Based on appearances I think the quality of this rug is excellent and I expect it to last a long time. Be aware that the size is 8 x 11, not 8 x 10 as described on Amazon. You need a pad with this rug also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the current V Cast Phones.","review":"I tried out the 3 new Verizon V Cast phones, and this one was the best of the 3.

These have a much better fit for the hand grips and the large underarm support doesn't slip out when I'm wearing my backpack like the others.If you're a larger person, like me, be prepared to replace the bolts for the handles. They way they setup them up with the washers between the crutches and handle put too much strain on the bolt and for me it broke after about 3 weeks.They are also louder than normal crutches. The spring shocks are good when you're moving out in the open, like crossing parking lots, but are a little annoying around the house at first.I haven't used the folding part too much, so I don't have a useful opinion on that.Overall the pluses outweigh the minuses by a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"the tarpeez is the worst item I ever bough.In 5 hours of driving at 65 miles per hour the tarp flapped it'sself to shreds.Almost as bad as the cheap blue tarps..I was very disapointed in it..Maybe at slower speeds it would have been fine.As far as putting in on the truck,it was easy...I would not recommend to anyone.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Failed","review":"I liked the basic design.

There are three prompts per genre and it doesn't include drama. I love the balance between the fiction, nonfiction, poetry and experimental writing. There is also a section of writing on writing. My students of Intro to Creative Writing love it. My only problem with the book is that it doesn't have any craft information. I have to provide all craft information to my students through lecture.

From a data perspective the phone is a decent device, but as a phone it is poorly designed. Problems include no easy way to turn on speakerphone, poor notification of missed calls / voicemails. The battery life is also pretty poor (expect to charge once a day if you use it at all). Keyboard is also very poor and difficult to use since the buttons are basically flat. The battery is also prone to pop out and lose also all your data. Restoring data to phone is also very difficult and potentially dangerous (I lost all my data one time when the phone sychronized with Outlook and deleted all my data in Outlook). Phone has a very cheap feel, unlike the Treo which had a very solid feeling.

However, I found his list of games, their descriptions, and the sample hands to very clearly define and describe each game. Also, many of Wolpin's anecdotes are very funny.I have to take issue with him in his derisive description of Texas Hold'em.

The lines are delivered with all the life of a plank. The constant sloppy eating is hard to watch as are all the cast, with the cinematographer showing them in the most unattractive way possible. The score is entirely forgettable. 104 minutes of my life I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed","review":"This was one of the most boring and tedious videos I have ever seen. I agree with Leonard Maltin that the film \\"demands patience.\\" The two lovers showed very little passion. Root had almost the same expression on her face throughout the whole story. The actors spent more time eating than talking. And there was an overall feeling of heaviness. The book is far better than the movie. The only good thing about the movie was the scenery, and so I give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I already had this on VHS tape but I really love this movie and who knew when VHS tape player is going to die. If my DVD player dies I don't care I will just watch it on my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuasion","review":"Just loved it !! Its better then the oldest and newer version of Persuasion. I say \\" buy this one.. you won't be sorry\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it","review":"I thought this was a very good movie. Well acted, loved the scenery and costumes. I felt like I was Bath again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch with a tissue handy","review":"Perfect casting, costuming and sets. Looks expensive. Ciaran Hinds is so good in this. He looks like the perfect sea captain that the ladies would love. No overly handsome \\"pretty boy\\" could play this role. Amanda Root looks a little wild-eyed most of the movie but she plays her role with tenderness. I love that the star crossed lovers get another chance and the ending is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous, but subtle.....","review":"I loved this, and I won't repeat the gist of other rave reviews. It is very quiet, and slow-moving. It will appeal to those who like subtle nuances- you have to watch people's faces closely. Root was fabulous- what a face! But mainly I wanted to counter another reviewer who thought Ciaran Hinds wrong for the part. I thought he was PERFECT- glorious, masculine, not predictable. He was awkward in the beginning because he was knocked for a loop because... well, I won't give it away but you find out later why he was off kilter. I thought Ciaran simply marvelous- loved him in Jane Eyre too. I don't know that this film will appeal to many men as slow-moving as it is, but women I know loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Amanda Root's performance is superb and the attention to deatail given to the cinematography is exquisite, while remainning faithful to Jane Austen's original masterpiece. I vow, this film would make any romantic heart sigh with contentment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I absolutely loved this version of Persuasion. I wouild have loved for it to be longer, but I will keep it as one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuasion Review","review":"This movie is exactly the version my mom loves. I ordered it for her birthday and she loved it! Thanks!! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A film that improves with repeated viewings","review":"The first time I watched this film, I had trouble following the story and catching the words that were so often mumbled. However, when I reached the end, I immediately rewound the tape and watched the first half a second time in order to better appreciate the fine production and story that this is. Each time I watch it, it improves.This movie lead me to read the book. I am delighted that the movie contains so many direct quotes, and depicts the book's characters so well.This movie also lead me to become a Jane Austen fan. I have read nearly all of her published writings, read a few of her biographies, and watched all of the films. This one remains one of my favorite Jane Austen movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb adaptation of a beautiful novel","review":"After seeing the movie \\"Persuasion,\\" I was impelled to do two things at once:(a) buy a copy of the novel; and (b) learn more about the works of the lead actors, Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. Jane Austen's story-telling is incomparable, but this adaptation, with its excellent cast, screenplay, and direction, is nearly as good as the real thing. (P.S. If anyone needs help writing a love letter, be sure to read Captain Wentworth's note to Anne Elliott toward the end of the novel/film. It is probably one of the most heartfelt and passionate declarations of love in English literature.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards","review":"While I absolutely love the book (I am a huge Jane Austen fan), and I love watching other movies based on her books, this book was just not up to standards. The acting is rather weak, as is the production, and it tends to be rather boring... I've watched it a total of 3 times, twice i didn't watch it all the way through. The characters are not well portrayed at all, and through the movie they seem way too weak and whimpy... I was rather disappointed with this as I don't believe there are any good productions of Persuasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best version!","review":"This is the best version of Persuasion that I have seen, and I would recommend it to anybody with one warning: There are a few issues with foul language. Beyond that, it was wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to watch...the actors were very homely","review":"Did anyone else find the movie hard to watch because the actors and actresses were exceedingly homely in this movie? A little bit of make-up would of been nice. Amanda Root is okay, but definitely needs some fine tuning for the big screen. For me personally, the unattractive actors detracted from the story.Also, hard to detect any feelings or chemistry between the two main characters. Besides looking at each other occasionally, and Amanda's character looking like a deer in headlights almost the whole time...very annoying..there was no chemistry on screen between the two. No established chemistry = bad, dull movie.Anyway, not worth buying as I did, rent it, because at least then you won't be stuck with it. Sorry to be so harsh, but there it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK!","review":"I love Jane Austen... read her books over and over. Appreciate almost every attempt to portray her genius on film. But this dark, wimpy, portrayal is an insult. The perfect Anne Elliott of the novel smiles only twice in this entire film, the rest of the time walks around with a 'deer-in-the-headlights'-with- depression look- this is not the admired, strong, smart, persevering Anne it should have been... the novel makes you want to copy Anne- this film makes you want to run! Yuk! The old BBC version is so much closer to the real story, and the characters perfect. This version is not worth borrowing for free from a friend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely bad casting","review":"I was anticipating watching this movie ... and i was really disappointed by the fact that the casting was completely horrible. Anne was cast badly, Captain Wentworth was cast badly...in fact the whole cast just seemed out of place. There was no good music in the background, not a significant, good amount of development about Anne and Wentworth's feelings. Lady Russell was cast badly as well. This isn't just a biased opnion, i'm sure many people would agree if they saw this movie just how badly it was cast and that the actors just ruined the beautiful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I watched the earlier version of this movie and was not too pleased with it. Now I have watched this version on DVD and find the actors and progression of the movie to be even duller. Anne looks all the way through as though she were a bewildered child who had just left an orphanage. I loved Emma and Sense & Sensibility and was sorely disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austin Romance","review":"I'm unable to rate this movie because it came as a DVD showing only the last part of the movie. The seller could not get me the entire movie since it is a charitable place where products are donated. I will have to buy it from another from another seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow moving but highly effective!","review":"This version is very slow, but highly effective. The directing is spot on in transferring Austen's novel to screen. Modern day version's are compelled to change history in having actor's physically act out their emotions. In that era, a look, a sigh, a hesitation spoke volumes.Spoilery - Ciarin Hind's Captain Wentworths' look over a wineglass, his controlled but pained look after touching her when helping her down off the carriage and then his look when dropping off the letter, screamed that he still loved her! I think Jane Austen would be proud to have this in her movie viewing collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeous film","review":"Even though I've read all of Austen's novels and knew what was going to happen, this film kept me engrossed. The actors truly became the characters of Austen's facinating novel. I found myself actually disliking Anne's family and rooting for Ann and Wentworth to overcome all the obstacles to their romance. This film is well worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get into.","review":"I love Jane Austen's works, and Persuasion, for me, comes next in line after Pride and Prejudice. I think the story is more gentle and you really see a transformation in Anne. The movie, however, I just didn't like. The characters weren't portrayed well and I thought the movie was boring. Anne in the movie had pretty much the same look on her face the whole movie which drove me nuts. The guy who played Capt. Wentworth i thought was too angry most of the time. I really couldn't enjoy this film because I couldn't get over the bad acting. I'd love to see Persuasion redone with hopefully a better result. My advice: read the book and skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, wait for the next version!","review":"I thought the lead woman did a terrible, wooden portrayal of Anne and was mis-cast for this part. It was the only time I really didn't want the hero to \\"get the girl\\", she wasnt' worth getting. Her young sailor was wonderful, but there was no evident love or sensual tension between them. It made the ending abrupt and unbelievable. It was also filmed very darkly, literally, not figuratively. But rather than being moody and setting period ambiance, many of the scenes were just dark - making the characters hard to see. This was annoying.I hope someone attempts this script again, only with a new lead woman, better lighting and with more visible tension between the leads to make their love story believable. This copy went to the Good Will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally NOT worth the time","review":"Based on all the excellent reviews I bought this film... I love a good love story but this one is the worst I've ever seen. For one, the camera work is at times odd (jumping about, unsteady), the story is very slow to unfold, at first hard to follow and at times exceedingly boring, and honestly.. there isn't a single pleasant-to-look-at person in the whole cast! I hate to say such a thing, but it's sooo true! Don't waste your money and time on this film. If you happen to REALLY want to see it, borrow it from your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I love to read Jane Austin books and watch movies based upon her novels. I found this adaptation of Persuasion to be extremely tedious. The acting and the directing was extremely poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg to differ","review":"Having enjoyed all of the other Jane Austen films on DVD I was surprised to find that this turns out to be a true dud. The director displays so little creative fire that he must have been selected by a BBC committee. The lead actors are supposed to convey the romantic tension of the book, yet they couldn't have been less inspiring in their roles. The odd thing is that Siskel & Ebert gave it two thumbs up, and they are usually reliable film critics. While the book is brilliant, I do not recommend this film production of Persuasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I recieved it in a reasonable amount of time and it was in good condition, but the movie itself was a bit of a drag. The characters dont show much passion and intensity in ther acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired and artless film","review":"I rented this movie because I thought hey, Jane Austen, a fine author. Well, she is still a fine author, but the creators of this film weren't so fine. I found the actress who portrayed Anne Elliot to be sadly lacking in emotional feeling. Wentworth was too much, and Mr. Elliot was, shall we say, a little, well, you know. If you want good J. Austin, check out movies like Emma or Sense and Sensibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring!","review":"Not only were the characters ugly, they were boring, unrealistic, and not romantic at all!! This movie is definitely going into permanent storage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"this is the second worst movie that I have ever watched. I never saw anything as boring as this is. What a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull!","review":"I love A&E movies, but this one is just so darn boring. I've actually tried to watch it four or five times in the month that I've had it, but I'm never able to get more than 45 minutes in because it simply puts me to sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissuasion","review":"This is the only Jane Austen adaptation that I have seen which fails. The characters never engage one's interest, and the influence of Anne's friend is underplayed so much as to leave the viewer wondering why Austen titled her book \\"Persuasion\\". Primarily missing is the tension between characters and subtle interplay that make Austen's novels such page-turners. Austen is a master at showing the social complexity and background of the early 1800s which this movie mainly misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"Unfortunately, though the story itself has potential, this movie was not done so as to keeps ones attention; I lost interest long before the end had neared. I found the characters boring, and Amanda Root looked like a deer in headlights throughout- I found it rather irritating, especially as you have almost no idea why she is so distressed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Jane Austen's Master Piece.","review":"Jane Austen doesn't need any introduction, and this film has beautiful details of her history \\"Persuassion\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuasion","review":"Very good 1995 film adaptation of Jane Austen's last novel Persuasion, finally available on DVD. Ciaran Hind \\"is\\" Captain Wentworth and the film manages to capture the nostalgic, almost tragic quality of this semi-autobiographical novel which fortunately has a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"An atmospheric and true adaptation","review":"Persuasion is perhaps Austen's most atmospheric novel. Her last completed novel, it is pervaded by melancholy. This film expertly captures the moods of the novel, by means of powerful performances from the leads, perfect detail and a pointed yet simple script.The heroine, Anne Elliot, is an intelligent and gentle woman, whose sense and generous spirit are slighted by her vain and vacuous family. We see that, in spite of having been persuaded not to marry a poor sailor eight years previously, her steadfast nature eventually convinces the hurt and stubborn Wentworth, now a naval officer, to rekindle the romance after many obstacles have been overcome.The production values are not lavish, but seem very real. Bath, Kellynch, Lyme and Uppercross Cottage are just as the audience can imagine Austen to have envisioned them. This film is a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama without a cause","review":"Am a huge Jan Austen fan but find this films leads don't have the chemistry to really sustain what is a great story love story. The BBC do it so much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Austen's story","review":"This version of Persuasion follows Jane Austen's story and dialogue closely. Two sweethearts parted 8 years ago unexpectedly cross paths again. Ann has pined for Captain Wentworth, but he has hardened his heart against her. How will they find their happy ending? The answer is subtle, so think England, not Hollywood. A very beautiful and enjoyable love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie made of this book","review":"I am a big Jane Austen fan. I have read all of books and whenever a movie comes out based on one of her books I will watch it. Even though it doesn't follow the book exactly it didn't bother me because it is so well done you don't notice until you read the book again. Which I have numerous time. I have seen this movie over a dozen times and each time I still feel the saddest and joy of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"Here's a lovely, gentle movie about love lost and found, a Cinderella story with a happy ending. Amanda Root is perfect as the wistful, sensible, quietly romantic Anne Elliot. Ciaran Hinds captures attention as the dashing Captain Wentworth, her disappointed suitor from long ago. And the supporting cast of nuts and flakes doesn't disappoint: they're hilarious and frustrating. It's enormously satisfying to watch Anne and Wentworth create their own separate peace away from the madness and petty grievances of their associates. I rooted for both characters from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply THE BEST Version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION","review":"In my opinion, this film is the very best version of film adaptations of Jane Austen's PERSUASION. The casting seems perfect and the subtle physical transformation of Amanda Root (Anne Elliot) is incredible. Having recently seen the new PBS/Masterpiece Theater version (didn't like the casting on that one), I think that the only place that it excelled over this version was in making the relationship between Mrs. Clay and cousin Elliot clearer--that the cousin wanted not only to marry Anne so he could inherit the estate, but to also have Mrs. Clay as his mistress on the side to prevent her from marrying Sir Walter Elliot and possibly producing a male heir to beat him out of the property. That flaw was probably due to some footage ending up on the cutting room floor. Overall, however, this earlier version is vastly superior and may be my favorite adaptation of all the Austen novels to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuasion","review":"One of the best love movies I have ever seen. If you like romance movies you'll love Persuasion. It goes along well with the book, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Version","review":"Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen story and I am very thankful that at least this book got a great adaptation on film.Amanda Root was just so perfect for the role. Anytime I read Persausion, I see her as Anne Elliot. As Anne changes before the viewer's eyes, Root changes somehow that is noticeable to the audience and makes it seem flawless and real. Ciaran Hinds as Wentworth cannot be matched either. The two acted very well together and did the Austen classic justice. The supporting cast also portrayed the supporting charcters true to the book.This version is the best one out there, thus far. Any fan of the book Persuasion should at least give this one a try and see for yourself. Coming from someone whose favorite Austen book is Persuasion, I was not disappointed one bit. It actually made me love the book even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuaded to view....","review":"....And it was a fantastic rendition of the novel. As true and close as you can possibly get to Jane Austen's vision with the time restrictions of being a movie. I felt sorry for Ann in the beginning, angry with her in the middle, and cried tears of joy at the end. To unwillingly deny the love of her life and still deal with a family who under-appreciates her is proof of her character and strength. In so many ways you can connect to Anne Elliot and her sad life. I bought the film on DVD and it's always a favourite choice of mine on those rainy weekend mornings when I curl up on the couch in my pajamas with a hot cup of tea. It's an emotional rollercoaster as only Ms. Austen can create. If you loved the book, you will enjoy this movie immensly. I know I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austen's Persuasion","review":"If you love Jane Austen then this version of Persuasion should be in your DVD library. It stays true to the book and is just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unsurpassed love story","review":"Of all of Jane Austen's adaptations, Persuasion seems to me to be the best. The story of a long-simmering love that was lost and ultimately found again is told in such a subtle manner as to tug at one's heartstrings, and draw us into the enduring love story between Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. The two leads are impeccable in their performances...Amanda Root plays a lovelorn Anne who tries to 'speak' her true feelings in gestures rather than words, and Ciaran Hinds makes a dashing Captain Wentworth, who still smarting from Anne's rejection of his proposal years ago, nevertheless still loves her. The rest of the cast do an equally amazing job of playing out their respective parts, and the scenes of the English countryside, and the coastal city of Bath are purely enchanting. A poignant, and well-told love story that will endure through time, and definitely worth multiple viewings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"understated","review":"Typically I am not a big fan of understated and subtle, but this was both and I loved it. Amanda Root is not you typical \\"movie star\\" but was wonderful. This is one I will watch over and over and find something new every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Look\\" can say so much more than words!","review":"And these two leading characters with their heart touching eye contact truly related paragraphs! I just wish there had been a sequel to this wonderful movie. I was never really a Jane Austen fan, but I am now!! My hat's off to all those responsible for the chose of actors, the music, scenery and costumes...especially the navy uniforms that Mr. Hinds wore. But then he would look great in a burlap sack! Even though this movie takes place in another century and country, the message transcends right into the here and now... follow your heart, because life is much too short entirely, and others can not decree your happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is too much praise!","review":"Oh lordy do I love this movie! Don't be fooled by it's length- the novel isn't very long either. This is one of the best Austen adaptations I have ever seen. I was particularly taken with Ciaran Hinds's performance. Amanda Root was marvelous as well. You could see her character, Anne, change through subtle actions and expressions.My only concern was that I had to crank the volume a bit to hear everything. If you aren't an avid Austen reader/ fan, then you may not catch onto everything all at once. Other than that, I was incredibly pleased with this movie, and DVD. It's a favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"I enjoyed the movie, however, at times I found the movie could use more intense scenes between the two stars during the movie instead at the end. The starring actress was plain yet such a sweet person, her beauty came from within.

I HAVE ENJOYED WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND WILL LOVE THE REST VERY MUCH."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best screen kiss ever","review":"Yes, there is a kiss at the end. That, needless to say, is taking a huge liberty with the manners and customs of the time of the story (PDA would simply NEVER occur in Austen's time), but what the hey, it's a fantastic kiss. Although it's brief and chaste by today's standards, it's one of the sexiest scenes I've ever seen. Anne's face and body language are transformed by that kiss, and she takes Wentworth's arm with a sensual touch that does away with those nagging doubts we all have--\\"were they really sexy in those days?\\"--oh yes, they were. A couple of minor changes were made in the plot, but nothing that causes any consternation. This is a first-rate production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austen on the Big Screen","review":"This movie is a wonderful adaption of Jane Austen's classic novel.

How disappointing! I have no quarrel with the casting or the costumes or the sets or the scenery; BUT it seems to me that anyone who hasn't read the book will have little or no idea where the title comes from. Lady Russell's persuasions eight years before the novel opens are only alluded to in passing, and those during the course of the movie itself seem more like intimidations.Rather they should have titled this particular film \\"Family From Hell, after an idea of Jane Austen's\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirated copy?","review":"I bought a copy of this excellent movie from Amazon and was very disappointed with the quality.
