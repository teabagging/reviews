I will use the brush axe still, but only for limited applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Fiskars writing all of these reviews?","review":"I bought one of these based on all of the positive reviews, and it does not impress. First, it is poorly engineered--the blade extends into the handle only as far as the wide part of the black section, perhaps an inch. The rest of the handle is hollow. This is simply not how you make a tool, esp. a sharp one. It is obvious why some have reported the blade separating from the handle. Second, there is simply no edge on the blade as shipped.I sharpened it up a bit and attempted to use it on the ~1/4\\" green, fibrous, canes of a multiflora rose bush. The canes bounced off the tool when I left them hanging loose. When I held the canes tight, the blade bounced off of them. It worked kind of OK in a few specific cases, but I have no need of yet another tool that I need to trade out in lots of situations.

In the years following its publication, almost all of the current information regarding Elvish has been released after that date (always excepting LOTR and The Hobbit). The Silmarillion, the History of Middle Earth (All 12 Volumes), and most of Tolkien's letters were published in the years following the publication of LoTME. Thus whatever value this book possessed with regards to Elvish at publication is virtually voided now. There is a small degree of merit in the categories of Dwarvish and Hobbit-tongue, but it is almost solely in the area of names and not linguistics.There are no comprehensive books on the Eldalambe (Tongues of the Elves) in publication..."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better books for both topics this book covers","review":"It's a pretty good dictionary if you want to find out what somthing is in the lord of the rings books or somthing similar, but if you want to find out about the language and how to write it or speak it, you might as well pick up the Return of The King Appendix E and look at that.

All in All, this is not a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outdated, yes, but so?","review":"Yes this book is outdated due to the publication of Christopher Tolkien's mammoth History of Middle Earth. But when I purchased the book back in 1980, this was pretty much it, and it was fascinating. It spoke of Tolkien the linguist, introduced me to things I didn't know, and remember fondly sharing it with my parents, bubbling with excitement that I could share with them such a remarkable work. SO MANY LANGUAGES! They were mystified and amazed that this little work of fantasy I read actually had depth. For me, that was quite satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly Inacurate","review":"Again, this book is very inacurate. For a primer, it is much too disordered, and much too small for a definative book. Jim Allen's Introduction to Elvish is a good place to start, if you can find it. Try Nancy Martsch's Basic Quenya.

The text is so incoherent and vague I can hardy understand what the author is trying to say. One minute, she is talking about some so-called \\"similarity\\" between an ancient Greek or Roman god and something from Tolkien, and the next she states there is nothing the same about them except for there appearance.

As a newcomer to Elvish and the Middle Earth languages, I found this boook to be very helpful and informative. It has extensive dictionaries and studies of the languages of the Hobbits, Rohirrim, and Rhovannion. I especially liked the chapter \\"Using Elvish.\\" The author admits that these rules are ascertained from the various texts and are not necessarily exact. What I wanted was not just a listing of Elvish words, but to know how to write in Elvish myself. This chapter sets you in that direction.As a novice to Tolkein and Elvish, I can't vouch for the timeliness of the work, but it addressed what I was looking for. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Languages of Tolkien's Middle-Earth","review":"This author tried, but I'm afraid the book is now somewhat obsolete with the publication of new linguistic information in Christopher Tolkien's editions.I faithfully copied down the tengwar (in my rather bad handwriting) and the Quenya conjugations, though I have no conception if the latter are really right. I noticed that mutation (the change of an initial letter, as Balrog -- i Malrog) isn't ever mentioned, that I could find. In addition, of Elvish languages, only Quenya and Sindarin really get mentioned -- again, some of the more obscure languages were unknown to the public until the History of Middle-Earth was published. Interesting issues, such as the existence of Exilic Noldorin (I'm a believer in this!) weren't available yet for the author to discuss.I was interested to find that the language of Rohan is really Anglo-Saxon letter for letter.Because it's dated, this is hard to recommend, though one has to appreciate the work the author did."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"Sure it's cheap, but is that the only reason for buying a book? Noel's work was already inaccurate when it was first published (in 1974!) -- now it's almost 25 years out-of-date as well.If you're truly interested in learning something reliable about Professor Tolkien's invented languages then spend an extra $5 to $7 and get yourself something reliable that you won't be embarassed to have on your shelf, namely Jim Allen's \\"Introduction to Elvish\\". (There's usually several second-hand copies available here at Amazon at any given time.) Yes, this book is also twenty years old. But unlike Ruth Noel's silly little offering it remains a substantive and scholarly work, and still provides a strong foundation on which you can build."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preciousssss and Glorious","review":"This is the real thing: a study of languages of Middle Earth by an author was is philologically knowledgable and widely read in Tolkein and also in the great works in which his great works are deeply rooted. Highly readable, yes. Cutesy, not. Many helpful features including fine comparisons of different Eleven languages, runes, and the linguistic tree of all the languages in Tolkein's stories----fascinating to see for example the relations between Dwarfish and Sindar.This book rewards the slow reader, one who tries the words aloud, who works on the phrasing and word order, and who has ideally some passion for languages and learning them from the skeletons out.

I tested LeadCheck several times on another mug made in China by Westfields also sold by Treasured Designs, and the results were consistently negative. I have asked Treasured Designs to test this Burton & Burton teapot for lead using an authoritative source, since all I was able to use was a home lead check test.It is unsafe to use products made with lead for eating and drinking, so I thought I would pass this on.

The book was incoherent, and the score by Kander and Ebb was nowhere near the level of their earlier shows like CABARET and CHICAGO. Fortunately they had a star who could sell tickets even with inferior material. Liza does indeed sell every number but apart from \\"The Money Tree\\" and \\"City Lights\\" there is nothing for her to work with.DRG's cast album tries hard to hide the fact that this was a Broadway show at all: There is no synopsis or background information on the musical. It's troubled road to Broadway could make a novel with all the backstage battles, changes of directors and changes of title. Once it opened to less than glowing reviews and Miss Minnelli began missing performances it slowly ground to a halt after 8 months.

It earned Miss Minnelli a Tony Award, though quickly began to flounder when she became ill and started missing performances.THE ACT was built for Liza, so we're not going to see a revival of this show. The score is second-rate when you compare it to other Kander-Ebb scores like CABARET, CHICAGO and even THE RINK.Liza Minnelli is the only reason to buy this cast album, where she belts out numbers like \\"Shine It On\\", \\"There When I Need Him\\", \\"Walking Papers\\" and the gorgeous ballad \\"It's the Strangest Thing\\".A fine testament to Miss Minnelli's talents.

But, despite a modest hit with the heartbreaking \\"I Don't Mind At All,\\" the band broke up, for personal reasons.Brent left us some worthwhile songs, vocals and keys; Larry laid down a rockin' bass; Lyle's guitar is exactly right; and Mike, with Larry's bass, gives the whole thing a solid rhythm on the drums.In sum, it's a worthwhile memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro to programming book","review":"I recently bought this book while looking for books for my younger brother to learn programming with. I bought this book as a bridge between him knowing nothing and him starting in on \\"Thinking in Java\\" by Eckel. It is aimed towards someone new to programming who needs to get basic concepts common to any language (loops, I/O, variables, breaking a problem into pieces, etc.) and covers up throught the beginnings of O.O. It is a well thought out book and has exercises that range from relatively easy to challenging. It will be most helpful (like any intro book) combined with an experienced programmer to ask questions of. This book will not teach you all of the cool new features of Java, but if you have little to no prior programming experience, this will help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I'm sorry, but I've never had a worse textbook for a programming class. I actually took this class at Syracuse University with Professor Hansen, but it didn't help much. My advice for most readers out there would definitely be not to buy this book. It gives little to no explanation for any action keywords that are used in java, and in order to use the book, you have to get his own special text program to use the classes he calls for. The one redeeming factor is the examples in the book, which are not plentiful, but are well thought out and insightful. But on the overall, don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrific","review":"I purchased this as I have other volumes from this set which I love, but this volume was disappointing.

If so, it had me fooled. Based on the '87 Cropredy live songs on the \\"It All Comes 'Round Again\\" video, this is a good representation of how Fairport sounded live at the time. At latest count, I have 7 live versions of \\"Matty Groves\\" and this is easily the best, with a revised arrangement that suggests the violence of the lyrics. After Fairport reunited in the mid-80s, Simon Nicol was the only lead singer for a decade -- this album captures his odd re-birth as a romantic ballad singer, with \\"Close to the Wind\\" and the lovely \\"The Hiring Fair.\\" There are also strong versions of old Fairport songs \\"Crazy Man Michael\\" and \\"The Widow of Westmorland's Daughter\\". The album ends with an unnecessary studio remake of \\"Meet on the Ledge.\\"(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misconception","review":"There is a common misconception regarding this album. That is that it wasn't actually recorded live. It was live but some parts were re-recorded in the studio. Mostly what was fixed were things like not being close enough to the mic for the vocals to be picked up, etc. There is nothing wrong with the remake of Meet on the Ledge but it seems a bit unnecessary. If you can find the 12\\" single version of it , it has an extra live song not on the album, although it should have been. If you want a live album that isn't actually live check out the Black sabbath live where they started fixing parts until there was nothing left of the live album but the applase"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice songs, horrible mix","review":"I really enjoy the modern approach to antique sounding British folk music represented by this album. The musicianship seems high but for one problem. The vocals are distant, often muddled and indistinct, and the vocalist is fairly lackluster. He is no Richard Thompson, (band member from a long time ago) that's for sure. If it's true that this is an artifically \\"lived\\" version of studio recordings, as is rumored in another review - well you think they could have gotten the mix right. I can't imagine a band allowing this to happen, what a bizarre idea. Good band, lousy album. However the songs Hiring Fair and Close to the Wind are worth having - maybe they exist elsewhere in better recorded sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger for beauty","review":"This lovely little gem is written in the simple, almost childlike language of so many Chinese translations from other languages to English.

At times, I recalled Fahrenheit 451!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly overpraised","review":"I'm sorry to disagree with the majority of the reviewers, but the truth is that I don't think this book merits any of the praise and publicity it has received. I found the narrative style precarious, to say the least, and the underlying story is, in my opinion, poor and hardly engaging or believable. The purported simplicity that conveys such great truths in this so-called \\"little fable\\" seems to me to be nothing more than lack of elaboration, both in terms of plot and literary craft. There is no fable at all, just an overpraised book that seems to have been marketed to the skies."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word-- boring","review":"I only have so much time to read and was excited to be able to curl up with this book. The characters were dull and underdeveloped. I can't say I cared much, and almost nothing happened.

Just another minor irritation but the whole book was BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many translations","review":"The story itself has merit. However, the author, born in China, then moved to France. Where he learned to read, speak and write French. The book was originally written in French and then translated into English by another individual. The English version lacks continuity, grammar, spelling to name a few flaws.

Two city boys are sent to a mountain village to be educated, and there, amidst many hardships, they find two treasures: some books that are literary classics, and a beautiful young seamstress.The books enrich their deprived world, and in reading them to the seamstress they develop a close relationship with her. Unfortunately the books also help bring about a personal disaster for them.The novel provides a fascinating look at life in rural China, and also tells us that Chairman Mao's power reaches deep into the most remote villages.It's a fluffy little short novel that tells an essentially humorous story taking place during a dreadful time. You can read it in just a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Read","review":"This book was just a delight to read. The story was charming, the characters were interesting.

His story follows the mini-adventures of two sons of the bourgoisie who are sent into the farm country of the peasants to learn what it truly means to be Chinese. What we as readers are shown is how the effects of the story, any story, in bringing out the humanity in all of us.This is a book about narration, books, the love of literature, and the power of the written word to entice and liberate.While I enjoyed this novel for its fable-like quality, the charm of its characters, and even the slow jealousy that boils between the two protaganists, my favorite aspect of it is probably the book's design. Rarely have I wanted to look at a book more than read it. Its typesetting, cover, and paper are superb. This is a book to read, but also one to keep in a paperback library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic","review":"This translation of Dai Sijie's novel can be poetic at times but, as is common with translated works, it can leave the reader questioning the cultural context of some passages or even sentences.The information about re-education was fascinating but left me wanting more.

Coming of age story? Romance? Political or social commentary? Historical fiction? It was all of those, but just enough to get you intrigued, and then the author would jump ship and move onto something else. There really was no fluid storyline that felt cohesive here, so I can't say I really enjoyed it. The setting and plot were there, but just not as well-developed as I would have liked. I knew what the author was going for, but it just didn't get there for me.Wish I would have liked it more, as it's been on my \\"to read\\" list for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature and life","review":"The characters in this little book are ripped from their families and their familiar environment. In this situation, fine literature becomes their guide. The characters seem realistic about their current situations. Balzac and Dumas are the only available sources of information about other cultures. Due to their youth and lack of other reliable guidance, it is doubtful whether they were able to process that information appropriately in order to be realistic about their future choices and hopes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balzac in a cultural vacuum","review":"Dai Sijie's memoire is an informative and satisfying description of China in the shadow of the Cultural Revolution. The works as a powerful indictment of Mao's destructive legacy. At the same time, Sijie paints a beautiful and affectionate picture of his land and its people.I was puzzled at first by conclusion of the romantic subplot involving the seamstress. From a western perspective, she places altogether too much importance on the popular French literature with which she is wooed by her intellectual suitors. My conclusion is that the author is using this storyline to emphasize how China's cultural vacuum actually left the country susceptible to the Western influences that Mao most wanted to suppress."},{"rating":"2","title":"There and back, a NYC commute","review":"Read this for the inside view to Mao's re-education of China..................from a personal almost voyeuristic account.First page in N.J..................Re-visit for a brief moment at lunch.....Open again at Penn station.......Close it on the way back home............A real Good reason to go to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem of a Book","review":"I bought this little volume in the airport of 9/11/2003 -- it seemed about the right size to read for my three hour flight.

I found it poignant, well written and thought provoking. Unlike other reviewers on this site, I felt that the ending was the best part of this book. Great literature can trigger uncomfortable thoughts and actions.

In addition, I wished he had delved deeper into the literary exchanges between the two main characters and the seamstress.If you are considering reading this book, I would say go ahead.

While it started out OK, and the author seems to have a lot of knowledge, the book was a disappointment. It is so poorly edited it looks like several articles, pieces of articles, and even sentence fragments were swept off of someone's desk and into a book jacket, given a cursory spell check, and published. There are misspelled words, sentences that appear to mean one thing and say the opposite, and some phrases are repeated 3-4 times verbatim in different parts of the book. The photos do not have reference numbers (e.g. figure 1, 2, etc.) which would really help to be sure which one the author is talking about. And the author seems to assume that the reader already knows what a 'drift rig' is. It's a shame that between the author and Amato publishing that the editorial process got such short shrift.

I also think it's worth mentioning that author Robert Milner's training program can be accomplished without an electric collar which too many hunters think is a cure all for what ails them.

There is a couple of stories of celebrity stories in this book. I have not read the full version because of a review on the full version that said the quick book was just as good.

The \\"everything you need to know to boost your score\\" like the front cover touts couldn't have been more than 40 pages of a 200+ page book. It lacked substance.

The book tells more than show whats going on - almost like a newspaper. All the important,romantic intimate details about Tiara's love life is skipped over completely. We get that she's conceited but how are we going to care about the main character when there aren't any detatils about her scheming desire for anything not even school? I'm more than halfway through the book and feel like I WANT A REFUND! I am so ashamed to have bought this book! I don't even let my friends see it and when people catch me reading it I admit it sucks and am just reading so at least I could say I read it. (Especially since I can't get my money back.)

This disc kicks off with a psychedelic funk explosion and only loses intensity when you turn down the volume (which I wouldn't recommend - Funkadelic is best when cranked). Fantastic writing and musicianship coupled with clever lyrics is something we've come to expect from George Clinton, and this album is one of his best. \\"Jollies\\" is a very much guitar-driven affair, with no real horns and minimal keyboard presence, and Funkadelic's guitarists are more than qualified to be your sonic tourguides on this funkalogical safari.

I've actually now started re-reading the books in order. It has taken me this long to finally obtain the whole series. My only question regarding Best Kept Secrets is the time frame. Why is there such a large gap (almost 50yrs) between this book and the first Hideaway book characters. I just did not understand how children were born in the 1940's and then the first book of the series picks up in 1998. I did email the author this question but as of yet received an response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and very long","review":"Good Grief this book was awful. Now I love Rochelle Alers so I was so happy to discover this novel. I thought it was a hidden gem, and then I got it.. good grief... I wish I had NEVER discovered this book! First of all, its really long, so each page was excruciating, and the characters were so pathetic... I didn't like or admire a single character in this novel... not ONE person. *sigh*And worse yet, the ending was so open-ended. We have NO idea what really happens to the characters. NOTHING is resolved. *sigh*This was a horrible attempt at a novel where politics,race and romance were attempting to come together... it failed.. MISERABLY.God help ANYONE who has to purchase this awful, dreadful and pitiful book. AND for goodness sakes, DO NOT buy it, borrow it from your local library.

This is the story of how it all began. Before there was a Martin or David Cole, or a Joshua Kirkland. There was Samuel Cole and Marguerite- Josefina Diaz.If you have read the complete series then I'm sure somewhere in the back of your mind you have wondered how did Sammy and M.J. get together. Well now the truth is unvieled in Best Kept Secrets.This is story starting with how Samuel Cole started the company that would become ColeDiz, that would be the familys legacy. It details how Sammy wooed and married M.J. But the best part is knowing the how and why of Samuel's relationship with Joshua Kirkland's mother.When I found out this book was coming out I wondered if it could possibly measure up to the powerful series Ms. Alers has created. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. I bow down before you this book is just as incrediable if not more so than anything you have written."},{"rating":"2","title":"DYNASTY AT ITS BEST","review":"Nothing compares to this. I was so mesmerized by this book that it took me days to pick up another book. I kept going back and picking this one up to go over scenes that kept me drawn to the dynasty. I now understand MJ's hardness as a wife and mother. Because she was a mother-in-law from hell I thought. I also understood Sammy and his apparent protectiveness of his dynasty. When I heard that there would be a beginning to the Hideaway Series I checked every week to see if it would come earlier. To see the characters and there personalities come to life. If I could have given this book 10 stars I would give it gladly. Ms Alers my hat is off to you, consider your self blessed with a skill of words.

This album is The Pogues at their absolute apex. Not one throwaway track here. Some of the most emotional and poetic 'popular' music I've ever heard. I saw them on tour with this album in the Roseland Ballroom @ NYC in the summer of 1988. One of the very best concerts I have ever seen. Shane is a poet and drinker of mythic proportions. The flavor is Punk/Alternative/Celtic/Country/Pub/Rock.Do yourself a favor and buy this CD, it will become a part of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What it is to be human.","review":"1. The Pogues live on St. Patricks Day was the most spiritual musical experience i've ever had. 2. \\"Fairytale of New York\\" is the most real and brilliant Christmas song ever conceived, and now i live in NY, i long to hear the boys in the NYPD choir singing \\"Galway Bay\\" . This album is the best of The Pogues, from the late-night ballads to the raucous drinking songs, Shane and the boys show here, as they always do, what it is to truly live the human experience. If you've finally come to realise that it's not like it is on the WB, then this is the soundtrack for your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else can be said?","review":"About all that can be said about this album has been said in the reviews that have appeared before this one. All I can do is confirm the almost-unanimous 5-star rating and concur with the several people--and indeed Pogues fans the world over--who claim this is the best Pogues album of all. The breadth of topics, the range of moods, and the marvelous arrangments and lyrical poetry of the otherwise brain-dead frontman Shane MacGowan culminates with this album (and unfortunately, goes downhill thereafter). If you have any Pogues album and like it, you MUST have this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to marry a moody, toothless, drunk....","review":"Innocence is lost once a Pogues song is played. You either hate it or love it, but you'll never be the same again. The duet between Kirsty Macall and Shane Macgowan makes you want disfunction. You want to hear New York's finest singing Galway Bay just to live through the poetry of disfunction that Macgowan has created. Thanks to this Cd my other cds must be ignored -- they just don't capture the essence of drunken confusion..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a Religious Experience","review":"I was first turned on to The Pogues by a co-worker and quickly became a devoted fan. I think it was Fairytale of New York that first caught my attention... it was Shane MacGowan's voice that punched me in the mouth and made me sit back and listen to what he was saying... in contrast with the incredible voice of Kirsty MacColl (daughter of Folk Great Ewan MacColl (Dirty Old Town, First Time ever I saw His Face)) I couldn't help but be drawn in. If I Should Fall from Grace with God is an incredible and eclectic mix that can be all things to everyone. Don't think about it.. buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam and Eve","review":"I was first introduced to the Pogues by an alternative radio station, reporting on Margaret Thatcher's censorship of the Pogues--presumably because the band was supporting the Irish who were allegedly (wrongly) accused of terrorist acts against England. The song of the Birmingham 6 is really beautiful. It really stands alone. And it's so different from the rest of the album which is so upbeat, wash-buckle rock! The lyrics are all nonetheless thoughtful and socially reflective.Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irish Punk explosion","review":"What a fun, strong LP. They love their Irish roots, but they love their rock n roll too. Great lyrics and story telling along with full powered music. I listened to this for months when it first came out and now my ipod keeps reminding me how great this music is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Although some reveiws will paint this album as a sort of nationalistic, English-hating diatribe, it would be best to take those reveiws with a grain of salt. After all, half of the band was English. However, political interpretations aside, this album is just plain phenomonal. With tracks like 'Fiesta' and 'Turkish Song of the Damned', The Pogues showed that they were most definitely NOT just a punk version of The Chieftains. Although both of their 'Best of' albums may have an overall better selection of songs, no Pogues album in existence is as cohesive, or exhibits the over quality that '...Grace With God' does. Basically, for all of you who are familiar with The Pogues and do not own this album, you should know by now that this is their most essential album of all. And for those of you who are not familiar with their music: if you want to try/buy something new, then I would vehemently suggest this album here. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"runaway train","review":"I've listened to this many times over 13 years, but something recently connected with me in the song Medley. It is the pinnacle of the album, quietly hiding late in the mix and devoid of the big hooks in the better known songs. Its the heart of the album, and doesn't doesn't stroll, walk, or run but runs screaming with arms flailing. Its unassuming and stealthy but will knock you over. If you're up to the task of hanging on, its among the best musical rides you'll find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the original release...","review":"I reviewed the original CD years ago, but this expanded edition not only has a few great additions, the booklet also has lyrics, which are a great help. To me, this is famous partly because it is the only album allegedly sung in English on which I can't make out most of the words, yet I still love it. Normally, I am the kind of guy who says \\"If a song has lyrics, enunciate each word clearly please, or record it as an instrumental instead.\\" The Pogues break my rule, but their enthusiasm and musicianship are so addictive, I forgive them. They sing most things really really really fast, and sound drunk, and yet have created magic. Also good is a live album \\"Shane Magowan and the Popes\\" from more than ten years later in this lead singer's career. Try to own both, if you like the Celtic rock sound at all. Call them folk, rock or punk, the Pogues defy your labels and just give you a darn good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Awesome, from start to finish. Highlights include If I should fall from grace with god, thousands are sailing, broad majestic shannon, irish rover and Turkish song of the damned. More than just those songs this album is a beautiful fusion of traditional irish folk and punk. In my opinion, the best of Shane MacGowan, and the best of The Pogues."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Never Hear the Like of It Again","review":"The album that got me into Irish and folk many years ago deserves to be encrusted in gold and hung in Times Square.Poetic, mythical, anarchic.

Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"pogues at their best","review":"this is a record you fall in love with. i love that unique celtic-punk (as some describe it) sound. i love shane's lyrics, here are his most touching love songs (\\"fairytale of new york\\", a bittersweet ballad he sings with kirsty maccoll, and a similar in theme and tone, but far more optimistic \\"the broad majestic shannon\\") , the lovely \\"lullaby of london\\" you just wish to whisper in a loved one's ear (it makes me want to have a child in a craddle i could sing it to(although i'm not a motherly type)), the funny and cheerful songs like \\"if i should fall...\\" , \\"bottle of smoke\\", \\"fiesta\\", and the protest \\"birmingham 6\\", and there's even more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great damn CD and remastering!","review":"I've loved this CD since I bought the original relase around 1990, and decided to pay some more money for the remastered version. Wow, what a job the studio did remastering it! A lot of care seems to have gone into the process, and the sound is almost three dimensional: the clarity of each instrument, the separation, the pounding bass... The highpoint for me on this CD is \\"Thousands are Sailing,\\" and it's an absolute pleasure to hear it remastered.If you love the Pogues, but already own the original release of this CD, consider repurchasing the remastered version; you'll be very pleased you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I Should Fall From Grace With God","review":"This album was first shown to me by my high school band teacher, and thank god he did. He opened my eyes to a totally cool band with probably one of the most revolutionary sounds to ever hit the earth. Traditional sounds with pounding energy and extremely poetic lyrics, MacGowan and the rest of the Pogues deliver a sensational album. I just warn about not playing it in front of little kids, as some of the songs are a little suggestive for their age group.

I like the nod it gives to the celto/pagan elements of the tale. The armour, while not probably what Arthur and his men may have worn, assuming they existed, and they may have, it is still in keeping with the traditional vision of what a knight looked like. There is an interesting mix of romantic knighthood vs the bully-thug with the sword. The behavior was, perhaps somewhere in the middle. The sound effects and special effects are a little dated, but, well, it is about twenty years old. The Green Knight's axe looks sharp and deadly, but the effect is ruined by the jetcraft sounding noise which whirrs as Connery swings it about. I strongly recommend this for any language arts instructor teaching the Arthuriad or mythology.Gilbert Sarabia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Camp","review":"This is so camp its funny.

What I learned, even from just the trailer, was that good actors can't make up for a low budget, other not-so-good actors, dreadful costumes, or lousy cinematography. That said, I did enjoy watching it, because it was so bad in such obvious ways. It was almost like watching a Monty Python skit. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hadn't seen it before, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sword of the Valiant","review":"Very poor. With a star like Sean Connery, I expected more.

I have the old VHS release, with huge yellow bands in the opening titles indicating how wide the image is supposed to be. I imagine the DVD is identical. While it's nice this hard to see film is available, MGM was an irresponsible Procrustes, much like with their Remo Williams DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astounding","review":"I am somewhat ambivalent about my rating - as an example of truly bad film, it is worthy of many, many stars. While there are still some vestiges of the original story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, it is a preposterous mish-mash of every medieval movie cliche imaginable. Dreadful dialogue, atrocious acting, and a confusing, if not schizophrenic story line. Watch it only if drunk, high, or with friends who enjoy the worst in film.

If you have any knowledge in the Arthaurian Legend, DO NOT buy this movie. Aside from the extremely cheesy special effects and the unexusably sad portrayl of Gawain, this movie brings shame to not only the Legend of King Arthur but also to one of the best stories of the romantic period in terms of literature. It was very hard to watch this movie because it was so bad. I actually had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the cheese","review":"This was possibly the cheesiest film I've ever suffered through. My wife and I were literally howling in disbelief at the stupidity. The costumes were absurd, especially Sean Connery's get-up as the green night and Miles O'Keefes \\"squire\\" wig. Where did they get the wardrobe?? Dollar Store? Utterly awful no matter how you slice this one; Costumes, scenery, script...terrible...and the music/soundtrack (if you can call it that) sounded a recording of a 12-year old fiddling around with an old Casio keyboard, then dropped in a tub of water for a few weeks of warping before being added to the sound reels.......Connery must have been drinking heavily when he accepted this script....I'm sure after seeing the finished product, he regretted doing this film. This movie was so awful, I turned it off before it ended. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stinker","review":"This movie stank so bad that I felt the urge break out the air freshener after watching it. Sean Connery is wonderful as usual but the Green Knight actually has a more of a cameo rather than starring role and bless his heart, Sean often has lousy judgemetn about script quality. Miles O'Keefe as Sir Gawain was terrible. The plot was weak, the special effects were'nt special and the scenery looked more like suburban North Carolina than Arthurian England. Avoid this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Connery Goes Straight to Video","review":"Do not be misled by the cover art. Sean Connery has a relatively small role in this dreadful 1984 adaptation of \\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\\" Nevertheless, Connery displays far more charisma in his limited footage than the film's wooden star, Miles O'Keeffe. The legendary actor earned a cool $1 million for six days' work on this cheesy Golan-Globus production. Despite Connery's presence, \\"Sword of the Valiant\\" never warranted a U.S. theatrical release and made its unceremonious home-video debut in 1985."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Knight","review":"This movie is best enjoyed with small children or drunks. The premise: A slightly homo-erotic-tailored Sean Connery as the green knight (think armored Zardoz) decides to challenge the nearby king's court to a game of wits and bravery. The challenge is answered by Sir Gawain, Miles O'Keeffe, whose ridiculous 80's hair stretches credulity more than the unicorns and witches.

Not even a pretty good movie.","review":"Basically, several people outta be shot for their sins on this film. Sir Gawain's horrible Veronica Lake blond wig is just awful. Even worse is the synthesizer sound track. Sounds like it was pulled out of any number of cheesy shows. There's low-budget porn with better music than this.Aside from that, the film is at times engaging, and Sean Connery is as always fine to see.But in the rather large group of Arthurian films, this is one certainly to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate entertainment","review":"The only real draw here is Sean Connery, but he's on screen relatively little, and not in his greatest role. Most of the time, it's a badly-bewigged Gawain running around in white tights.It's adequate entertainment, if there's nothing else to watch. And if you like King Arthur and his cohort.

The script, the acting, the cinematography are all dazzling. Why this isn't mentioned in the same breath as \\"The Third Man\\" is unforgivable. Even the score is wonderful. Also, the film demands a second viewing because there is far to much to take in. Watching it I was reminded of \\"Citizen Kane,\\" \\"Sunset Boulevard,\\" \\"The Third Man,\\" and maybe a little Godard (maybe the look of \\"Alphaville\\"?). The film really feels like it exists in a time and place, oozing atmosphere. The only downside to the film and dvd is that some of the scenes were not restored quite as well as others, but this is an excusable oversight, considering the shimmering quality of the rest of the film and one can only hope for a special edition or criterion release in the future with commentary by a film critic or two.

In my humble opinion, it's one of the best Hollywood scripts ever written, with some of the most biting dialogue in cinema. I suppose this should really come as no surprise given that both Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman were responsible for the screenplay. In addition to the highly original story - I mean, a film about a powerful Walter Winchell-like columnist? How many of those are out there? - there is also the character of Sidney Falco. It is amazing that the filmmakers, given such an immoral weasel of a character, somehow manage to make Falco somewhat likable, even a person we can sympathize with. Perhaps it should be chalked up to Curtis's charm; I'm not sure. No matter how you slice it though, it's an accomplishment.

First of all, the plot does not develop at all throughout the game, & seems rather static until near the very end. And then even around the end of the game, where usually the story takes a huge turn for the worse through some sort of a shocking revelation (apparent throughout most of the FF series), this situation is just dumb, & the plan for resolution seems to be pulled out of nowhere at the end. As for the materia system, this system is [poo]& requires you to play through many redundant battles just to try to get some spells to use on the higher creatures. The push-button critical attack is also frustrating, taking some near hours to master a certain characters timing correctly. If you want a good FF game, go get FFVIII, or play through the Anthology series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overrated","review":"Graphically speaking, the game stands out with its beautiful pre-rendered backgrounds. I also enjoyed the game's amazing soundtrack. The story, however, is poorly written and character development is almost non existent. Was I given a reason to care about Aeris enough to be sad when she died? Materia is a broken system that allows you duplicate itself as many times as you want as long as you master it, essentially giving you the ability to make all of your trivial characters the same person, sans their unique limit breaks. This game most certainly doesn't deserve to be heralded as one of the best RPGs ever. As far as I can discern, the people that praise it as such must be philistines."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to buy!","review":"This is the game of the year.The game of last year.The game of every year.No one should be deprived of not knowing or playing this game.There about 20 diffrent ways to play this so you can never get bored.The characters are so cool and cool looking.The story line of the game is the best in its class.You will have the most fun fighting and building up your characters,or going to the Golden Saucer and playing the games there and watching the shows and battling in the battling zone.All I know is you have to buy this game.Find it buy it and play it.Don't stop hesitate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i hate RPGs except FF7 and kingdom hearts","review":"good game but since it is a PS1 game it is a little out dated but i still play it all of the time. for some reason I like as i said earlier i hate RPGs but his one has a very entertaining story to it.

Though I can not say out of all of them, though I have played eight and nine as well. The graphics on eight and nine are better, but the graphics on seven are still excellent. Seven has a beautiful and well planned plot to keep the player into the game and come back for more until the game is finally beat, for those who haven't played it yet and you are a big Final Fantasy lover, I suggest you play this one as well! Most people are thrown off because the graphics aren't excellent, but compared to eight and nine, the game plot is wayy better then the newer versions which take most people some time to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest videogame ever made","review":"I originally purchased this game in 1997, but my memory card erased when I got to the end. I have since defeated every FF game since then and I must say that none of them even compare to this one. Sure the graphics may be 100x better, but the gameplay in general is unsurpassed. Also, the main villain Sephiroth, is perhaps the greatest gaming villain of all time.This was the beginning of the new era of RPG's. I was relatively new at RPGs before this and this is still one of the more difficult games.The WEAPONS are grueling and the storyline is amazing. Cloud Strife's constant struggle to find himself during the game keeps you guessing on the plot. Squall, Tidus, and all of the other main characters of the recent FFs seem to be mere shadows of him in some way shape or form.If you feel like neglecting your family for 85+ hours, then this is the way to do it. Also, make sure you get your Golden Chocobo in order to get the best summon of any RPG ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edward is a 14 year old","review":"...Dont pay attention to him...he seems to be a member of the \\"elitist RPGer\\" group.Which is in other words a group of 14 year old kids who sit around playing elitist-styled computer RPGs all day.

Other than that it is a pretty fun game with a good story. It is an old game, so it doesn't feel right to rag on it for its aesthetic quality.

Yes, the minigames can get boring. Yes, the sounds are a little frustrating to deal with sometimes. Yes, the battle system is a little hard to get along with. However! This game is my favorite of all time along with Final Fantasy VIII. The storyline completely blew me away, so complex and filled with real emotion that i sometimes forgot i was sitting at home in a room playing a game. Truly this is a masterpiece of Square. Just typing this review brings back the great times i had playing the game. Trying to ponder what would happen next only to have it shattered and something i was completely off guard for. I know it sounds a little nerdy but hey, Final Fantasy VII has to be the greatest RPG, or game, to have ever been created.

I was too young to understand much of it when I watched him play but I got the chance to try it myself when he put it on his laptop a couple of years ago. And yes, the graphics were laughably bad but the game still hooked me right from the beginning.It was the first rpg I'd ever played and still the best one I've ever played. The storyline drew me in and I've never cared for any characters the way I did for these ones, especially the main characters, Cloud and Aeris. I must've spent a hundred hours grinding everyone, getting all the weapons, materia, limit breaks, and just exploring every little thing along the way. My brother raved about it back when he first played it and now, I'm raving about it.

This is a game that should have been trashed over and over again. Most parts of the plot are still confusing but when I played FF 8 I thought it was extremly dramatic, charaters well developed and music poetic. What I've noticed is people are either a huge fan of FF VIII and not of FF VII, or a fan of FF X and not of FF VII.I hate FF VII for different reasons, YET FF VII is still by far the best WORST and the story line of FF VII does not even touch FF VIII's story line.Lame music (not CD/symphony quality)Lame CharactersSorry VilliansStupid Story lineWorst graphics (no where near FF 10)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Ugly game.","review":"the most Ugliest game ever made,, seriously folks, very ugly game. the graphix sucks. and cloud looks like a doll.

Number one: There's too many battles in the first place. You take three steps you get in a battle. You walk two steps to get somewhere and you end up in a battle. You take one step, most likely you'll get in a battle. Also, let me point out that once you're in a battle, you can't move around. And plus summoning whatever it is you're trying to summon, like Thunder or something, you have to press eighty buttons just to summon it at once. It's hard to do. However, I think that the game was engaging and never let ya go. It was entertaining, and it is undoubtedly worth the twenty bucks$...but...the battle system could of been a lot better, I'm sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is truly a classic video game. The Characters are interesting, funny, serious, kind, loving and they'll touch your heart. The music changes throughout the game, so you don't get tired of the same old stuff.

The story is the greatest one I've read/played in years.You'd truly be satisfied with yourself if you bought this game. Although you might not want to stop playing this game and your family/friends might feel lonely and neglected. But who really cares it's not like the world is all fun-filled joy.

Aeris, who people loved for some reason, and everyone knows what happened to her.The story is flawless, not as in depth as some other games, but it's simple and that's whats so great about it. It's the ultimate evil against the ultimate good, with twists all around.The materia system is the best system out of the games 7-10, and could be the best system out of all the Final Fantasy games.The graphics for it's time were unthinkable.To pinpoint the one thing that makes a game so great, I personally don't even know.

All 3 disks were filled with surpirses and every moment of the game was fun. Whoever says that the characters are bad and the stroyline is bad, needs help.

Oh, sure, it *looked* cool, but I was left feeling that's all it did -- the storyline was rather weak, and the characterization was substandard. By the time I made it to the second disc, it was dragging so bad that I quit for a while -- I eventually dredged through the third disc, which was just sheer boredom, to reach an extended but disappointing ending. I play a game to get lost in the plot, and found it lacking here. Square's Final Fantasy: Tactics (see my review there) provided all of this, and more, so it's not like they've lost their touch; FF7 just seemed either rushed, or as if they were simply aiming to sell games rather than leave their players with a good feeling afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"everyone loved this game","review":"everyone did love this game I just didn't like it I'm not a huge turn base RPG fan if I where though this would be a fun game it was enjoyable but very long"},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad game, not to mention very lame","review":"very bad hero, cloud is a real zero. they all have pumpkin heads, and dress in terrible unfashionable threads.

There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV. Where this game really lacks is in its replay value. Its a onetimer. I don't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again. There were too many things that were too tedious in the game, namely the materia and chocobo development (which they drastically improve with IX). Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff, ie. master materia, just isn't worth it. As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest.

With the technological advances since the original Nintendo, they made this game look prettier (sort of - the polygons are obnoxious as heck). Only thing they forgot was to make it fun. Boring gameplay. The fight sequences are the worst. You just push a button over and over until your character gets good and ready to fight. Woopie. If you're in the mood to watch a movie, buy this game. Otherwise, it's just a waste of your time. Go buy Metal Gear Solid - that's a nice blend of gameplay and cinematics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game EVER","review":"If you ever want to play a great RPG then you need to buy this game.

Because of this the best part of the game didn't make sence. Also the fact that the game played the wrong videos at some point. It will probably not be a problem for you, but I just don't think they should have left holes in it like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"best final fantasy game, best of rpg games!","review":"ok if ur a final fantasy fan, or rpg fan i highly recomend this game to anyone of these games. im not going to write anything about this game besause if i did it would take all day to read. so therefore ff7 is the best of ff games period and of all rpgs. i highly recomend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this game, you won't be dissapointed","review":"From wht'd i think of this game, is that it's pretty much the best games squaresoft ever made. Sure, the graphics may be off a little, but if you start to get into the game, you'll enjoy it more. The thing I hear about thtat's bad, is the materia lowering your strength stats. But i'd say it's woth it, because materia is usually better then your attack/limit break. If you start to think that all the enemies are easy in the beginning, wait till you get to disc 2. Even though i beat the game 4 times already, i still like to play it to see what i missed or the secrets Ididn't get."},{"rating":"2","title":"best game ever","review":"...it is. from beginning to end it engrosses you into the epic storyline.

I definetly would not reccomend this to anyone who is less than halfway intelligent, or has no time to play(I played for months doing extras before finishing it, which in itself was no where near easy.) the characters in this game are what keeps it alive. they each have there own personalities and way of doing things. I found the \\"bad guy\\"(i dont think hes that bad, but thats a different story...)to be the most interesting. the story unfolds as you go and you find that everything happened for a reason. o.k. now i'm done ranting about my favorite game."},{"rating":"1","title":"toast for knotting","review":"wow, all i can say is i like how cloud eats his ear wax and stuff. i reallly liked when aerith has tifas babies cuz tifa cant have them. the chocobos are really cool cuz they kill aeris, shes allways complaining about her feet. vincent is super cool cuz he wears his pants backwards, its so funny! well, i dont want to give the ending away but sephiroth is really clouds daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is the blast!","review":"i had so much bombing in this game. basically cloud is a little boy who is looking for his dog Sniffles. his friends help him but they kill aeris, clouds sister, when she tries to steal clouds nuts. clouds likes nuts because he so nutty ^.^ well, when they find out that sefiroth want to start a night club, well, thats when the whole party begins. my favortie part is when sephirtoh spits out his chocobo from his hair. i also cried when bahamut zero drank the alka selter and exploded a turnip. so many cookies are here too.

Also the evil guy (Sephirot) want to destroy and again the heroes want to stop him. Well Overall it's one of the best rpg ever created but not the best (my personal favorite one Final Fantasy 6)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great , Excellent","review":"This was such a great game when I first played it.

The first of the Final Fantasy series I ever played. No doubt, over time, better games have come out since this, but this is STILL a GREAT game. You grow to love (and hate!) characters. You get INVOLVED with the storyline. The music is fitting, and fantastic. Giving players the ability to summon characters such as Ifrit, Odin & Bahamut, this game is TRULY going to take your breath away. The ending it FANTASTIC (but I'm not gonna spoil anything) This will truly earn it's keep in your favorite's section of your gaming shelf. ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best rpg in its time","review":"yes they have made better graphics thab this, but NO ONE CAN BEAT THE STORY.

I conclude my review to say is game is AWESOME,GET IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best RPG in existence....'nuff said","review":"This is THE RPG to get if you're looking for one. This game beats all the other Role-Playing games out there: Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy 8, etc. FF7 specializes in an awsome battle system using Materia: magical \\"stones\\" with various abilities for attcks. The storyline is fresh and the music is just amazing! You take on the role of Cloud Strife, a mercanary with a mysterious past. You meet many interesing people(as well as animals and talking stuffed toys) along the way. The graphics in this game aren't as good as Final Fantasy 8 or 9's but the visuals and the CGI cinemas are still VERY impressive. If you're looking for an awsome and extremely fun game that will keep you glued to the TV screen for at least 30 hours than this is the game to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game will LIVE ON FOREVER!!!","review":"This Final Fantasy 7 is one of the most influenced games of all time. The fan bases for this one game blows out all FF fan base out of the water. Never has any other FF game seen such an influenced with multiple related games/story characters found in different games. Multiple Movies. Toys, cards, etc based on this game. Why was that all necessary for this one game?It's just that DAMN AWESOME! This game has everything! Story, characters, battle system, music, humor and more! If it didn't why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after? Because it was just damn awesome!You can play this game over and over before getting tried of it, but you will keep it in your hearts forever. The amazing game play, the amazing characters, and amazing graphics. (Back in those days.)They just can't make anything that even comes close to what they did back then. I wish they did, but they can't! It was just too well done! lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far the Greatest Game Ever","review":"Just nothing else to say. The plot is fantastic, the movie sequences incredible, every little battle entertaining. Good lord, 95% of the crap that Hollywood produces each year stands up nowhere to this gaming masterpiece. The story is what really makes this a great game. You'll become engrossed in the plot and the characters will consistently grow on you from the second you meet them. The only trully depressing part of this game is when you beat it and realize it's all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I've Noticed","review":"Is the people that typically hate on Final Fantasy 7 typically rat on it because FF6 was better. The same ones who love Final Fantasy 7 say that was better. Really its just the age old battle between steampunk and cyberpunk.

Personally I love both.:3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Question","review":"Why am I seeing this game for hundreds of dollars? Has it become a collectors item?

Its story far beyond any other game on any other console including FFX. The love triangle Between Cloud, Tifa and Aeris is just one of many great things about this game. There has never been a more original storyline for a game. Sephiroth is the ultimate video game villian.

You should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest RPGs ever.","review":"This is the rpg that defined all rpgs. The game features graphics that surpassed anything else at the time of its release. The big thing about this game is story. So if your not willing to spend a lot of time (and I mean a lot of time), then this might not be the game for you. But it pays off if you play through the whole thing, leaving you wanting more. Overall, there's really only one small complaint that I have about this game, and that's its super-deformed characters. Let me explain, whenever you are not in a battle or a full-motion-video (FMV), your character appears as a small, stocky semblance of a human being. Minor gripe, I know, but it needed to be said. Newcomers to the RPG genre will find it easy to pick up (it teaches you everything) and old-school RPers won't be disappointed either. Basically I'm telliing you that if you've got some time and want a story that's gonna make you laugh and cry, then buy this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games ever!!!","review":"I've been a Final Fantasy fan ever since I first played a demo for Final Fantasy 7. Final Fantasy 7 is, in my opinion, the second best out of the series (Final Fantasy 8 is the best, get it). This game takes you into the life of a young man named Cloud Strife, an ex-SOLIDER who is willing to save his planet from the forces of evil. This game delivered amazing battle technique, incredible CGI sequences, and rememerable characters to the world when Playstation first came out.Of course if you look at the game today, you would say that the graphics are horrible. But back then, the graphics were amazing, people have never seen animated sequences like this before. I would highly recommend this game for all of the RPG gamers and Final Fantasy beginners.

It's the first FF game I've ever owned or played and I've absolutely fallen in love with it.

The storyline, characters, graphics, and all bugs and glitches (that aren't there) make this the best Final Fantasy game yet. In my opinion, this is still better than FF9. A must for any gamer, especially if you're into RPGs, you will play for HOURS (seriously, no one will be able to tear you away). I wouldn't reccomend this game for anyone under the age of 11, unless they are mature, and can understand that the fighting and violence is not real. You grow very attached to characters and it is almost heartwrenching when they die. I can't say anything bad about this game. You just have to try it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"i thought it was good????","review":"I REALLY gave this game a chance, but it failed to live up to all the talk i heard.

Odin looks like a elf with horns, titan looks like a giant mad man, and they had to make 3........YES......3 forms of bahamut, those are just some examples of how desperately lacked originallity. the summons in final fantasy 8 are so much original and better.

However, too expensive currently (as of August 2006). I bought the PC version and the Playstation version years back and still have them. The PC version does look better especially during fight scenes. Unfortunately, for use on Windows XP you have to get a software patch for later in the game (chocobo race). Great great game.

This is about to be a spoiler so don't read any further if you care.Aries dies in the middle of the game and from that point on, everything leads you to believe that you could bring her back to life at some point in the game but this isn't true, actually, it's half true, you can bring her back with a game shark, the reason being is that they had planned from the beginning to allow her to be brought back but funding/time ran short and they pushed the game out the door unfinished. This is a major disapointment to me and as soon as I found out you couldn't bring her back it burned me out to the point that I quit playing the game..."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!!","review":"If you like RPG's, this game is a must have.

The graphics are TERRIBLE, the story is long and boring, and the music (aside from the battle theme) is nothing special. I know it is often considered to be the best FF, but I just cannot see why other than it being the first FF for Playstation and thus the first one most FF fans played.

Materia, holy, meteor, limit breaks, and everything else that has never been done before makes ff7 the best rpg ever.

The graphics suck and the plot development is so slow. I played it all the way through when I was a kid. I recently picked it up again and began to remember how aganizing the pain was from the first time. I got through the first disk then stopped playing and broke all three of the disks so I would never stumble on it again. The only reason that this game has such a cult following is because it was the first Final Fantasy on the PSX. There are much better Final Fantasy's out there Like 6, 8, 10, and tactics.In my dorm building I asked all of the gamers what the worst Final Fantasy was and they all said 7. Trust me, if you play this game you will become emo just like Cloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST RPG IN THE HISTORY OF RPG'S","review":"This game is by far the best FF game out there seriously these nut jobs think that ff8 sold more copies i do not think so within the first 3 days of FF7 release in japan it sold 2.3 million copies 2.3 million copies the games debut in the states it sold 330,000 copies and reached 500,000 within 3 weeks so here is the cold hard facts since up to DEC 2005 FF7 has sold 9.8 million copies world wide FF8 8.15 million copies so yes FF7 has sold more people have to realize that FF7 opened the doors to the American gamers on the greatest RPG franchise ever but in the end FF7 is wayyyy better than FF8 most of them haters are prolly kids who were not even born or were still crapping there paints when the game first came out talking about graphics there is soooo much more to a VG than graphics lol!!!

For all games, you are forced to level up by repeatedly going up against foes. Anyway i liked this game, especially the part where you have to dress cloud up like a girl. Favorite part of the game. I did get to the end to fight Sephiroth, but I could never beat him. Anyway this was actually the second Final Fantasy game I played. I got Final Fantasy 8 and got close to beating it, but didn't.

They are excellent when compared to other games of its time, and are still good compared to today's games. While the character animations are sloppy and unrealistic, the FMV's and pre-rendered backgrounds are superb. Also, the materia system is great. It is very interactive and offers a vast variety of spells, commands, summons, independant, and support materia. With so much variety, choosing materia can be very strategic. The music is some of the best I've ever heard in any game, with music perfectly suited to every situation. Much depth is added by the mini games and sidequests, such as the Gold Saucer, Bone Village, the sunken airplane, and chocobo breeding, which is so much fun, it could be a full game of its own, if expanded a bit. All said, this is a superb game that I recommend to anyone, and it is much better than FF8, no matter how much better the graphics are."},{"rating":"2","title":"final fantasy showdown","review":"final fantasy is my favorite final fantasy game it's and very sad story with a good ending. and sehpoth ( i can't spell his name) the main villian is perfict you can feel the pain he couses to cloud ( the main character ) it's has lots of miny games that are good to even tho the ghapics aren't as good as X ans X-2 it still is the best final fantasy game i know of"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is amazing","review":"For all you kids who think game with graphics are better your wrong.

I expected this game to be so much more than it is. The graphics (even considering the time period) are blocky looking. Thanks to all the beautiful backgrounds, you often cannot tell where your character can/should walk. And the whole Aeris thing (those of you who have played will understand) leaves you feeling as though there should have been more to it that the game designers forgot to put in. I spent most of the game thinking she would be able to come back to life. Sad to say, it seems that Square sacrificed story line and plot to make this game. Given a choice, I'd rather play Final Fantasy 2 or 3 for the SNES."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Any Gamer with a Playstation!","review":"I hope every person who has a playstation has this game. If you dont then get it. This is the best RPG ever. Even though it is 2 years old it is still great. This game provides challenges and lots of fun. You can be amused by it for 70 + hours at least. The graphics are stunning. When you summon a creature from the vast aray of them you will be in awe.

It has a multi twisting story line that many people can't figure out the first time they play, and the battle system and setup is much easier then ff8.

That's when I started to play FF since I had seen my friends playing them. I have to say that FF7 is one of the greatest RPGs I have played.

I know people may say I'm a little old for this series, (I'm fourteen)but I love Animorphs and this book is the best one I've read so far. I couldn't put it down. If you love Animorphs, I know you'll love The Change. And if you haven't read any Animorphs book yet, start reading and be sure not to skip this story. It's terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This is one of Tobias's best books. He was always a great character .In this book Tobias is given a wish by the Elemist. He thought the Elimist would make him human again. Instead the Elimist gave him his morphing power back, making him a full member of the team once more. By the end Tobias finally accepts that the Elimist did indeed give him what he wanted. Accepts what he has become and admits how much he loves it, that he doesn't want to be human again. He can morph his human body when he wants to be human for a little while, and he still gets to spend most of his time as a Hawk. He lives free of society and at one with nature.Also this book shows what the Hork Bajir really are. How without the Yeerks they are harmless and lovable. Also it furthers the Elimist as a Character. Both are powerful allies for the Animorphs in later books."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the person from Maryland who gave it a 7.","review":"The Ellimist never said he was going to give Tobias back his human form. He did say that he was going to give him what he wanted though. I guess the Ellimist thought that Tobias would be happy with just the morphing powers back. If you had the life Tobias had, wouldn't you have wanted it changed? If I have offended you don't take it personaly. I was just stating a fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this book!!!!

Also, another point off for the fact that the Ellimist is A BIG FAT CHEATING LIAR!!!!!! HE SAID HE WOULD CHANGE TOBIAS BACK TO HUMAN!!!!!!! (he did change Tobias back, but he can only become human in morphs. Plus, poor Tobias still has THE TWO-HOUR MORPHING LIMIT!!) I can't wait until Megamorphs #2.

This book offers plenty of suspense through its well-constructed characters and engaging plot, at the same time providing an unexpected level of depth and subtlety in its exploration of human nature.This is the book that will either ruin or reinvent the thriller genre because it will entirely transform the expectations of readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"This book will always be for me the ultimate thriller. Flawlessly executed on every level, the story grabbed me by the lapels and smashed my spine against the wall until I'd read the very last word. Unbelievably good in every way possible -- from procedural to character to dialogue, pacing and originality -- the book is the best in the genre. In a somewhat unprecedented move, Harris is being awarded a Lifetime Achievement award from the Horror Writers Association. I can understand why. He's a master storyteller who has penetrated our culture and consciousness like no other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Youngster's Synopsis","review":"I picked up the book after hearing great reviews. I was looking forward to a 'good, fun read' in a hot summer. I was very wrong. From the start, I got wound up in the terrifying prospects of the immense criminal genius of Hannibal Lecter, the steadfast yet young Clarice Starling, and the horrific ideals of 'Buffalo Bill', or Jame Gumb. A killer is on the loose, kidnapping girls and leaving their bodies sans skin for the authorities to discover. FBI trainee Clarice Starling is sent to ask dangerous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter to fill in a questionnaire, and is reluctantly sent on a 'treasure hunt' for the serial killer by Hannibal Lecter, who knows of him. It rides like a rollercoaster, and highlights include the phenomenal escape of Hannibal Lecter from the authorities and the shootout in the dark at the end. Througholy twisted, terribly enjoyable, I loved it, despit my age."},{"rating":"2","title":"SERIOUSLY TWISTED!","review":"Well, being 11- reading this book really don\`t help sleeping at night. I read this book over 2 months and it totally scared me. I read it at night before I went to bed and I used to dream about it. I saw the film in December and found it not like the book at all. The author must have a ummmmm \\"Vived\\" imagination! But this book is brilliant- go on and read it! I can\`t wait to read the new book- if my parents will let me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Thriller","review":"Great writing, great characters and great dialogue (the head games between Hannibal and Clarice are extremely entertaining)! A brilliant psychological thriller of the highest order. Much better than the movie--not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite suspense and coherent story...","review":"Thomas Harris did a tremendous work in this story. I read the book before I saw the movie, so after reading such a brilliant book, I was excited when I was watching Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster developing the main characteristics that had been described in an intense way in the book. Clarice Starling hadn't faced a case like Lecter's case. So it was a tough challenge for her. Lecter has a very intriguing personality. It's scary and has lots of enigmas around him. So a good reader will enjoy the style of Thomas Harris's Silence of The Lambs. Nice Work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Harris is a talented writer!","review":"Silence of the Lambs takes on a vivid imagination as he details the account of a serial killer. It is fantastic as was his other book Red Dragon!! I keep looking for his next book. He writes dramatically and sensitively. I keep looking for his next one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Terrifying!!","review":"I read this book prior to watching the movie version and it prepared me for a gruesome ride.While the writing is basic at best, the horror and mystery is spellbinding. Hannibal Lecter will send chills up your spine for days and many nights! But amazingly he grows on you as a sickeningly likable character. Clarice Starling, the tough yet fragile FBI agent, pursues a murderer and with the help of Hannibal Lecter faces her true fears. Somehow they develop a relationship that makes sense....But how does madness make sense? That must be Thomas Harris's secret!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannibal Lecter chilled my blood!","review":"What's more scary than a human monster, a man that lives to literally feed off the weak and the vulnerable? A man that eats people's livers with fava beans and a nice chiante? Not much. But Hannibal Lecter's I.Q. of 160 certainly doesn't help!From the moment I started reading this novel, I was captivated. The characters are well-developed and each performs the function he or she was intended for. Clarice Starling is the universal symbol of youth searching for a way to better the world, and because of this, many of us can identify with her. We root for her. Buffalo Bill is chilling in his crazed, unreachable way. And Hannibal Lecter chilled my blood with his odd physical appearence (crimson eyes, small neat teeth, polydactylism) and metallic rasp of a voice. This tale is a classic, and for good reason!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book or Movie","review":"I go back and forth over which treatment of this story I like better, the book or the movie. I have decided finally that though I love Foster's and Hopkin's performances, the book tops the film by a nose. Harris' writing is both beautiful and horrifying, and one can feel the clock ticking as one races to the end of this very scary book that is as much about a recruit coming of age in law enforcement as it is about her catching a killer. In both instances, Starling learns to face her greatest fears and stops the lambs from screaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thriller novel!","review":"Impressed with the storyline after watching the movie (of the same name) adapted from this novel, I found this book quite intriguing and captivating. And I got this paperback version for ~$5, which was a great bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gruesome but Well-written Thriller","review":"Usually I don't read books with such horrific themes as this one. However, it is a good page-turner and very well-written.It is about a sociopathic psychiatrist, Hannibal Lector, who is a mass murderer. A newbie tothe FBI is assigned to his case in order to draw him out. Meanwhile, there is another sadistand mass murderer on the loose - - a moth collector. It is the FBI's job to hun him down.Will Lector help them? I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Red Dragon, but still brilliant","review":"The Silence of the Lambs is a classic for serial killer fanatics like myself, Harris went to the trials of real life serial killers like Ted Bundy as research for the book and it shows. Buffalo Bill is more disgusting than the tooth fairy and Lector's role in the book is greatly improved. I read this after watching the movie, so I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen, but that didn't stop it from being one of the more interesting books I've read in the past year. If your considering reading this I'd recommend picking up Red Dragon first because the ending of the last book is spoiled about ten pages into this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the movie. . .","review":"Don't take this wrong, the movie was excellent. But the book has so much more riveting detail that wasn't incorporated into the film. Thomas Harris is in a league of his own, the master of creating suspense. Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb are two of the sickest fictional sociopaths ever created. The Silence of the Lambs is one of my all-time favorite books. If you haven't read this book yet, now is the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone- chilling!","review":"phew! what a knockout! unrelenting tension, stomach-churning drama, a precocious yet very human protagonist, a disgustingly psychopathic antagonist, and, of course, Dr. Lecter. this is some book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope.","review":"This story has a nominally interesting detective adventure which could have done all right as a stand alone.It also has an incredible bunch of dialogue and interaction with Hannibal.But that's it the author should have realized this is not a story, but two stories crammed into one book like mixing oil and water. No-can-do!There is almost no suspense because the action lies with Hannibal who really has nothing to do with the story.The author obviously loves his character Hannibal too much, so he gave him a major portion for an insignificant roll.Which makes for monstrous boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a roar, ends with a bust","review":"Because of all its loose ends the book doesn't convey a sense of high craftsmanship. This makes its pandering to gore all the more unpleasant. Harris is playing all the ropes of a bestseller as they are these days but we miss the music.

Unfortunately, the story and charatcers are a complete wash. Clarice Starling is a pasty, uninteresting heroine, devoid of distinctiveness. Basically, for all the attention bestowed upon her, she comes off as nothing more than a young woman who can't get over her haunting childhood. And Buffalo Bill makes for a ridiculous serial killer; there's no insight or alluring texture to this particular killer -- he's simply a sensationalistic boogy man. In RED DRAGON, author Harris brilliantly conceived a fascinating hero and a just-as-fascinating villian for his nerve-jangling tale. Here, we have a generic plot and characters who just aren't worth engaging in. A bust"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Page Turner","review":"This was a fascinating, masterful work of suspense. If you've got a strong stomach, don't hesistate to read it. Harris expertly twines suspense, drama, and action into a gripping page turner.

Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a superlative masterpiece.","review":"this was the first thomas harris book that i've read, but if his others are half as good, they will still stand out. this book was filled with many deeper messages, (i.e. the title), visceral descriptions, impressive and original narritive, and the best and most intruiging literary character to date, dr. hannibal lector. harris has written a masterpeice that should be read by all who can take it's theme and sensitive subject matter. and even if they can't, they should at least try. this is the kind of book that should be forced on highschoolers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of the 90's!!

Very good book.","review":"Silence of the Lambs is ten times better than Hannibal, but not quite as good as The Triumph and the Glory, or Memoirs of a Geisha. If you can keep all of that straight you win ten dollars. Seriously, Thomas Harris was at his peak when he wrote this chilling mega-hit and hasn't come close since. I don't know why, but it is a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Depth Whatsoever","review":"I can't say that I had high expectations for this book, which turned out to be a good thing. I felt like I was reading an episode of Law & Order. There was zero in the way of character development. Sure, I knew what school the protagonist was going to and basic information about her room mate and a flashback here and there to her childhood. But overall, I didn't really get to know or care about the characters.I kept waiting for it to get scary but it really didn't do it for me. The tension wasn't built quite well enough for me, nor was the writing particularly interesting. In fact, I noted that there were 3 pages in a row where every single paragraph started with, \\"Starling...\\" (which is the main character's name). \\"Starling went to the bank..\\" \\"Starling thought long and hard, \\" Starling woke up and then walked around for awhile.\\"Everyone was either good or bad, there was just basically no depth at all.Overall, I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every minute","review":"Sometimes I worry that I might be wasting my time reading a thriller after seeing the film version. After all, if I know what's going to happen, how can there be much suspense, right? On reading The Silence of the Lambs I discovered my fears were completely unjustified.Thomas Harris is an excellent writer. I just sat for ten minutes trying to think of how to review his writing without sounding over-the-top gushy with praise...sorry, can't do it. Within the pages of the novel, his characters ARE alive, even those that appear in only one scene. The plot is intricate, compelling and it blasts forward like a rocket. Harris' descriptive ability is outstanding. He leads the reader right up to the point where the reader's own imagination takes over and almost makes the world of the novel an immediate concrete reality.This book will take you to some dark and scary places, but don't worry - Clarice Starling is there with you and she's got a gun and fast reflexes."},{"rating":"2","title":"a young FBI trainee who must deal with one to stop the other","review":"Hey! My name is angy. I come from Austria (Europe). I've to write this review because of school. I like the book very much. I can definitely recommand it. Although I know the movie, it was very hard to understand and it took me a long time. One reason why I've chosen this book was the film 'Hannibal'. After watching this movie I thought of reading the book of the first film. I specially like the character of Hannibal Lector. He is a mystic person. Only the describtion of his eyes and his look made me afraid. In general I think that this book is one of the best thrillers I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm! Liver!","review":"Thomas Harris proves his ever growing reputation as a writer of supreme talents with this intriguing mix of suspense and horror. The infamous Dr Lector is shown to be both a character of fear and subtle mystique. Harris introduces a female heroin (Clarice Starling) who is worthy of so much attention she recieves in the novel. The one true masterstroke that this book has, is that Lector is only really a bit part in the plot. Thus, when he does make appearances, he is all the more frightening. If anyone is ever turned off by Harris' frightening attention to detail, once they become absorbed in this fine novel, they will learn that fear is a good thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4.7 stars","review":"What can I add to this novel that hasn't already been added? This book was just absolutely chilling and you wish the world would stop so you could read this book in one sitting. Lecter is one cold, intelligent monster and Starling is a brilliant Freshman. This book is a true classic and a definate read for anyone who loves this genre AND anyone who loves great literature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This book made me want to be an FBI agent (which i'm not and never will be for reasons that shall go unexplained, but whatever). It was hard not to picture the actors from the excellent film as I read along, but that almost made it better anyway. I've always wondered about what turns people into serial killers. It's a hobby fascination of mine. The book hints at this, but doesn't spell it out. I like that. It gives you a clue, a direction, then lets you fill in the blanks however your own brain sees fit. Can't you just picture Buffalo Bill's childhood. Yeeeesh! A hot mess I am sure. Anyway, a great story. Unparalleled in the genre in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silence of the Lambs","review":"If you enjoy a mystery and horror, then you will enjoy the book Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. Harris puts every growsome detail into this book. If you can handle it read it. The Book is mainly about the FBI trying to hunt down a killer named Buffalo Bill. The only way to hunt him down is if they are helped by another killer. I highly recommend this book, read on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of the movie","review":"Perhaps I've watched the movie too many times. I found the book itself dull.

It is a masterpiece of crime fiction. You have to wonder if Harris was in law enforcement himself. Or maybe psychology. Abnormal psychology. He just knows too much (as shown by his stories) to be just who he claims to be (a \\"reporter\\"?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. Thomas Harris does have an extensive vocabulary, so reading it on Kindle is very helpful since the dictionary is as close as the word to define.

I didn't know what to expect, but it turned out to be a very interesting book, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing the movie only adds to the book","review":"Saw the movie well before reading this book. Usually when a movie follows very close to the book, I don't enjoy the read. This was different, and I can only make a few guesses as to why. One is that I could enjoy the style and intelligence of the author without having to be visually and audibly pummeled by scenes of depravity and torture. In contrast, the movie provided such strong characters--especially Hannibal Lector by Anthony Hopkins and Clarice Starling by Jodie Foster--that they were right there for me to favorably draw on while gaining the extra insight and better pacing that books usually provide. Whatever the reasons, the book is most enjoyable, and well worth read, after seeing the movie or (I suppose) prior to as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"Well first off, it is obvious that anyone that has seen the movie (and who hasn't?) will not be as captivated by the gripping suspenseful plot, as a first time read is. That being said, the book is a must read. . FBI trainee, Clarice Starling matches wits with notorious serial killer Hanibal \\"the Cannibal\\" Lecter, picking his brains (get it) to try to catch another serial killer, Buffalo Bill. Very engaging plot and excellent characters keep Silence of the Lambs moving along at break-neck speed. A great book for anyone that enjoys a nail biting suspense with a little blood and guts mixed in."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best thrillers ever written","review":"I mean, what can I say? This is the book where Hannibal Lecter first took center stage, and it's a doozy. Harris handles the relationship between the genius serial killer and the newbie FBI agent with a sure and nuanced hand. It's not fair to call this a great genre novel; it's a great novel, period. Harris started the serial-killer trend in fiction, and despite the slew of successful imitators, he's still the grand master. While I like his RED DRAGON just slightly more, SILENCE is still a must read. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpeice.","review":"Thomas Harris has provided an excellently well written horror/mystery. The details were excellent, and he was able to get inside of the characters. My only problem with it is that the movie men of Hollywood couldn't make a movie nearly as good as the book. Read the book, it makes much more sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the scariest books ever!","review":"Thomas Harris is a bit of a creepy man himself, and I was a touch uneasy about reading his books which are basically textbooks on how to kill people.

The \\"Live and Work...\\" book is the worst. It is mainly aimed at UK residents moving to France.

However, his clear dislike for most things French (especially the people) made the book read more like a prejudiced, bigoted, diatribe. A bit of fun-poking would have certainly been acceptable and lightened a bare facts book, but Mr. Hampshire went on for, literally, pages and at every opportunity to criticize and ridicule. One wonders, if he were corect in his assessments, how a country so filled with stupid, unwashed, crude and lazy people could possibly be responsible for the creation and ongoing care of some of the world's greatest works of artistic expression. Shame on you Mr. Hampshire. Perhaps in your next revision, you'll omit the vitriolic rhetoric.

Unfortunately the authors, to entertain, look for off beat sources that are funny but simply false. For example, the portion on the 1940-41 campaign in the Balkans is based exclusively on the works of an aide de camp to the thoroughly incompetent British General who lost the campaign. This unworthy chooses to blame Britain's ally -- Greece -- for a disaster that he largely caused. This episode is typical of the book.

In this instance I am using the term engineering loosely!* The price charged for this item is out of line with the quality of the materials and quality of the manufacturing. This item is more along the lines of a HF unit selling for $29.99.To my fellow rater, \\"No it isn't you.

The large swivel caster has a lever on it but it is not designed to be foot activated. This style lock on a power tool is a bit out dated. The absurd comes when you look at the locks on the other two wheels. What you get are a thumb screws that get tightened against the tread of the tire.

I have a large shop and tend to work in different locations depending on the project so the ability to move the saw to where it's needed is a real plus.

When I was taking it out of the packaging, the receiver fell on my leg- and it was heavy, just like the reviews said it was! (OW!!! :-) ). I made a couple of calls with it, and had one person call me back- we could all hear each other well, and I really like the actual bell ringer this phone has!

The first phone that I ever used was identical to this Crosley except without the rotary dial. I would pick up the receiver and ask the operator, by speaking into the mouth piece, to connect me to a phone number. This Candlestick phone is a \\"blast from the past\\" but with call-waiting and redial.

It is heavy, both and unit and receiver. It has a brushed plastic look like the original Bakelite(?). It operates well as a normal touch tone phone and the sound is loud enough. I like the cloth covering on both cables and the hook switch appears to be solid metal. Steel? I notice that the column twists a little on the base but nothing serious. Another concern is that the tilting mouthpiece might get a little loose but one can tighten in up by the clamp screw at its tilt joint. I've accidentally dropped the receiver on my desk twice and it is still working fine. Also, some real brass accents would be great but overall, I'm very satisfied with it.

Then he is encouraged to participate in drugs and orgies. An innocent gay is raped and commits sucide because he is gay. Every conceivable negative stereotype of gays and gay life finds its way into this novel. It is propaganda for the religious right, confirming their worst fears.

The main characters of this book, Summer and Lance, are just totally unbelievable and not developed at all. Even during parts that should have been really hard on her I never felt any established connection. And talk about a cry baby! The smallest thing would send Summer into sobs.

There is no spiritual inpriration or any benefit for any good catholic viewer who may know what a real value of a consecrated person should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I wish I had known the film was about the triumph of selfishness and pride before purchasing it.

This is a story about a nun and her temptations about her calling. Well, in the end she fails and gives up her vocation. What a let down of a movie. As if it is the most impossable thing to persevere in one's vocation as a nun. Nice one hollywood, another blow to the religious. I felt it my duty to warn those who wish to obtain this dvd, thats why I gave away the story. audrey hepburn does a disservice to our religious by playing the role of an apostate nun, shame on her!

Based on Kathryn Hulme's autobiographical novel, \\"Story\\" is an affecting, heartfelt epic of inner struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Audrey's Best","review":"The only reason I didn't give this movie five stars is because the beginning of it DRAGS so badly.

I'm not Catholic but after seeing this movie I often wondered if I would ever have the fortitude and be worthy enough to become one.

Please use a tether chord that is long enough for the size of your pet, but yet not so long that it can get tangled and entrap your pet. Always restain your pet in an area where you can supervise their time on the tether to avoid any chance of harm. NEVER leave your pet tethered overnight or in any harsh weather conditions.

I don't like Indian music at all. The only reason I bought this album was because this was guitar virtuoso Shawn Lane's last album. I didn't particularly care for his musical direction in the end, but I will say this: he was truly one of the most amazing guitar players I have ever heard and will probably ever hear. The reason I gave this album two stars was because Lane simply played an incredible guitar solo on the second song \\"Mirror.\\" His tone and delievery were astounding on this song.

This album is simply brutal, leaving no room to breathe. When Breath Escapes is a gut wrenching mosh of pimal fury.

Firstly, this strap will be too long, even at its shortest adjustment, for many players, especially for those on the smaller side such as I. Shortening it by cutting it is not an option because of the one good thing about it above; but the worst thing about this strap is that the shoulder pad is slippery, providing no stabilizing support. I can't get my banjo to sit still with this strap, even when I'm sitting down with it. I know I could add something on my own to fix this, but why should I have to?Bad deal, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for everybody","review":"Had to buy another strap. Would not recommend to anyone who plays above their belt. There is not much room for adjustment.I am 6 ft 190 and like to play chest high. I tied a knot in the strap to get it high enough.

The straps are easy to hook and unhook, I have two sets on my banjo, one set for the Neo and another for the harness I use when the back needs a rest. It's easy to uphook one and hook the other.

I added a fuzzy velcro sheath around the contact points where the nylon loops met wood,just to avoid abrasion.The pad is a little wide so I wear a shirt with a stand up collar if I'm going to play for any length of time.I am well pleased with the way it feels,though,weight wise and will recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY DURABLE","review":"I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT STILL LOOKS BRAND NEW.

After getting the instrument, I picked up an adjustable nylon strap from one of the most popular makers at my local music store. Clipping it was a pain in the neck, the clips rubbed on the resonator, and the strap slid around on my shoulder. The Neotech strap solves all of those problems. The banjo does feel a lot lighter with this strap.

Granted, I wondered why the retail price would be so high ($50?!) but I was lucky enough to buy it second-hand, for just about $12 after s+h. When it arrived, I noticed that it was skinnier than I thought it'd be. And every picture in it, I had already seen before in various places. So there was not much newness there. I haven't sat down to fully read it yet, tho I always enjoy learning how they make such masterpieces, but so far I do like gazing thru the pages, having only seen most of the pics thru a computer screen previously, and now that I can see them like this, they are just lovely.

The depth of his empathy for enslaved Africans and for struggling English laborers is difficult to discern, yet he does suffer physical hardship and severe injury for his beliefs. Life for this novel's sailors, fisher folk and kelpers is, indeed, \\"nasty, brutish and short.\\" Aymer talks the good fight and does as much as he easily can to alleviate their distress -- how many of us do better than that?

I've heard it said that if there is a common theme in Crace's writing, it's that he sets his stage during times of social change. Here, Crace brings us to a town about to lose its economic basis to technological innovation. The author takes us into its Christian racism and its moral quandaries, even as the town lives in denial of its own doom. Denial seems to operate the mind of the protagonist as well, and his own high-minded timidity hangs over the age as its defining quality.

I find most people who give negative reviews never even take the time to read up on the subject. It's the only way you will ever be satisfied with the results. I find this film riveting. It confirms everything I've read and more. Too bad the average person doesn't realize that even our government has fed us garbage throughout the centuries and have their own agenda.

I already own a copy and saw the film during its brief theatrical run. There were many, many evidential flaws in the film, and these have been explained satisfactorily by Hammott's confession. If anyone is still looking to purchase this title, they should be aware of the fact that many of the claims are fraudulent and much of the evidence faked.

But some great sounds and melodies come out of this album. They cover almost every style of music that is out their, so whatever your taste is, there is at least one track you'll enjoy from this album. I rate this 3 1/2 (4), because although it is an EXCELLENT album, it's not one of the absolute best I have heard.

A must for anyone who is interested in animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the book that drove to start with my travels","review":"I first read this book in 1979 and was so captured by it that in 1980 I pack up and went to Corfu. I spent two weeks following the places described in the book. I kept on reading G. Durrell and I have to credit him for my travels and my occupation (dog behaviorist). I highly recommend his writings to every person with a sense of humor and a feel for nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"\\"My Family and Other Animals\\" is one of the best books I have read in a long time (and I read a lot of books). Not only is it entertaining and very funny, but it is also incredibly well written, with impeccable use of adjectives on every page. It is a fairly quick read, but also one of those books that you can open up and read just a few pages if you need a smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Entertaining","review":"Gerald Durrell originally intended this book to be primarily about the flora and fauna of Corfu, the island off the northwestern Greece mainland to which his family moved from England when he was a child. As it turned out, however, this delightfully entertaining series of mishaps includes a great deal of local color, including rather interesting (read \\"wacky\\") Corfian characters and experiences. A great believer in \\"You Are There\\" reading, I timed my own to coincide with a trip to Corfu in late May, where I finished the book at a villa set among olive trees above a stunning little bay overlooking the Ionian Sea on Corfu. Absolutely delightful! By the way, this is a wonderful book to share by reading aloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerald Durell is wonderful!","review":"All of Gerald Durell's writings are terrific, but the ones about his family are truly laugh-out-loud wonderful! This is a book I have enjoyed over and over, and have given as a gift many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeleton of a Plot embellished with tonnes of vocab","review":"My Family and Other Animals is a bare-bones story in terms of plot. The Durrell family goes to Corfu, lives through what could be termed as a soap opera, and leaves. It's humourous, but not particularly challenging.However, the older Gerald Durrell utilises vivid vocabulary over and over when describing the setting and people of Corfu. Fifteen-letter words that paint a crystalline picture are used frequently, relieving the never-ending roller coaster that is the life of the Durrells.Overall, this is a highly entertaining book that will keep you engaged for the week or so that you will spend reading it every spare second you have."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality of book is poor","review":"I bought a new paperback and am very disappointed by the quality of the product.

All thanks to durrels simple yet so imaginative writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to live on Corfu - this book is responsible!","review":"I can trace the fact that I've always been drawn to the Greek islands directly to this book. I first read it as a child, and the careful and playful descriptions of people, places, flora, and fauna made me long to live on Corfu. I must admit that the author's descriptions of the misadventures of his eccentric family (including his brother, author Lawrence Durell) were my favorite parts of the book. I'm buying a fresh copy for my 18-year old daughter, who is lucky enough to be headed for Greece for 3 months. I want her to see Greece through the eyes of the person who most strongly influenced my vision of the country - Gerry Durell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for the whole family that you can read over and over.","review":"I first read this book when I was 8 (I am 12 now in 1998) and after that I was engulfed by the magic of Gerald Durrel and his writings. My greatest regret was that I never got to meet him , for he died before I was born , and now I would like to follow in his footsteps and become a zoologist for I too share his passion with animals.I have read almost all of his books including Catch Me a Collabus, Rosy is My Relative and many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-read\\" for natural history & clean humor enthusiasts","review":"Being a natural history enthusiast and also one to appreciate good, clean humor, this book recieved my undivided attention. Furthermore, it got me interested in Gerald Durrel's style of writing and prompted me to read similar books (Filets of Plaice, A Zoo in my Luggage, etc). The book humorously sketches the simple lives of the inhabitants of Corfu, the Durrel family (including their gradually acquired arsenal of pets), and the diverse Mediterranean fauna."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read in my life!!!!","review":"I am not the kind of person who reads a book twice. I enjoy reading a good book and then moving on to another good book. But, I have to say I read My Family and Other Animals at least fifteen times. Every time is better than the next.Gerald Durrell never fails to make me laugh, no matter how many times I read his book. I laugh so loud that my parents come into the room to check if I am alright.This is a great copy of what has to be my favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting tale of a living experience unlike most others","review":"This description and recollection of the author's (a brother of Lawrence Durrell) moving as a boy from England to the island of Corfu is an fascinating glimpse into a slice of life that is very different from what most of us are accustomed to (and may be a glimpse of a Corfu that no longer exists - I've not been there to see). Anyway, an interesting take on a very different life."},{"rating":"1","title":"the print was too tiny","review":"I loved this book as a child so I purchased it for my son. However, he can not read it since the print is tiny. It must be a 5font or close to that.

It was very upsetting to see such a great book in such a cover--it looked as if it was a rebound old book in bright red cover with no title, no author, no illustration. The quality of paper is very low--it will probably fall apart in 5 years and the font is so small that you have to read the book with a magnifying glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not like learning Greek, but helpful anyway","review":"As our family anticipated a trip to Greece, we came across this book, \\"My Family and Other Animals,\\" which is set on the western Greek island of Corfu. Gerald and his eccentric family move to the island from England, where all manner of strange and hilarious events are staged. A minor cult following of the book has developed, where people travel to Corfu to walk in the footsteps of young Gerald as he sought out all the local fauna, picnicked with his family, and learned Greek and local lore from his neighbors.There have been several movies made of this book, but the most recent with Imelda Stanton as the mother is just wonderfully done. Do yourself the favor of savoring this book first. Fortunately, the book has recently been republished; when I went on the hunt I had to buy an old copy on eBay from Australia! Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written wonderment of nature and animals","review":"Read this one for book group.

The color is so intense it almost obliterates the artwork in some panels, and the black line and letters are fuzzy. The stories are great, the Spirit is a treasure, but dig up some of the Warren or Kitchen Sink magazines instead. Even the old Harvey comic reprints were better than these. I haven't seen the DC Spirit Archives, but I sure wouldn't order them sight unseen after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy !","review":"The quality of the Box Set is outstanding, the Bonus Material provided is great.

This is probably my favorite season of Highlander and all 22 of the episodes on 8 discs are entertaining and exciting. This is a definite must have for any Highlander fan or anyone who really enjoys martial arts and intriguing storylines. The bonus features alone are incredible and a definite must have.

Jones sticks to mellow-toned flugelhorn and is in fine form on one of his final high-quality small-group sessions. Harris is also at his boppish best here on tenor, and Parlan seems inspired by the company. The quintet performs two of Parlan's originals, a couple of obscurities, John Lewis' \\"Afternoon In Paris\\" and Bud Powell's \\"Oblivion.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I received this book as a gift. I like feng shui as good as the next person but I got lost with the application of how feng shui and its use of univeral principles (which is a term used loosly throughout) is demonstrated by the text. Sure, clean out your garage, yada, yada but in the end there aren't enough real world examples on real world outcomes to make a \\"rich\\" life. The title is refreshing but there's nothing new here. No offense, but I have to rank this one among the other 31 flavors of self help books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about ego","review":"This book is a parody of a lot of feng shui books. It is very confusing and you don't have concrete or real examples, except about the author. The constant play on the word rich which is also the author's name is cheesy and annoying. If you want to learn about ego you could buy this book. This book is a perfect example of bad feng shui. Looking at the cover it is better to have the mountain in the back than on the front cover. And if you want your fortune to go down the toilet, be sure to put this book in your fame and reputation quadrant. Stick with the feng shui masters like Lilian Too. If you are seriously interested in exploring true eastern philosophy and the principles of feng shui this book is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent self-teaching guide","review":"This book is laid out in a logical, accessible fashion.

But don't sell him short -- his versatile voice and danceable music are most pleasing to the ear, especially when he's trading riffs with talented fiddler Gina Forsyth (who adds just a dash of modernism to offset all the rich tradition in Bruce's style). Looking for a soulful ballad with a plaintive vocal? A beautiful waltz with haunting, soul-stirring lyrics? A little swamp pop (with homage to John Fogherty)? A rousing two-step with playful, almost giddy fiddle? Bruce and Gina cover all the bases like the virtuosos they are. If you like Cajun music and dance, this album won't fail to please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Because of the actors in this movie, I expected more than what the movie gave. Tracey Gold's character was not believable to me. Though she certainly was evil, it seemed to me that she was acting. I wasn't really drawn into the character.

There really aren't words to describe what a phenomenal performer Nick is. He now hosts a radio show on influential Chicago radio station, WXRT 93.1 FM, \\"The Eclectic Company,\\" Tuesdays at 10 p.m. (CT).

It also features a lock button and a lock set button that both work well. However, this tape measure style leash is very thin. I only had it 5 days before the cord snapped.

I'm not sure how am i going to return it now! I'm very very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Monopod","review":"This is a great Monopod. I almost did not buy it as someone else complained it would not hold the weight of a DSLR. I have had zero problems with either my Canon 7D and 70-200 2.8 IS or my Mamiya RZ67 medium format tank of a camera (about 10 pounds). Out of the box it was a little stiff, but was much smoother after a few hours of shooting. I think my only legitimate concern is losing the rubber foot. Makes shooting quickly with a traditional monopod a joke.I coupled the 685B Neotec with thisManfrotto 496RC2 Ball Head with Quick Release Replaces Manfrotto 486RC2and am extremely happy with the way the whole rig works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent locking despite weight","review":"Regardless of the weight on this monopod, it hasn't worked properly from day one. Even without a camera attached sometimes you can't get it to lock at all and sometimes you extend it, it locks, and then you can't get it to collapse again. Manfrotto used to be a trusted name in photography and film equipment, but no longer, I'm sad to say. We can't continue to pay top dollar for products that make us look like fools on location, struggling with the one thing that's supposed to keep us steady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monopod","review":"The monopod is very easy to use. You step on the rubber foot pedal and open the monopod to higher position without any effort and it stays where it is. Push down with the grab is not hard either. The pedal gives some extra support for stability too. The product is built solid and looks nice. Since someone mentioned the rubber foot could be lost because it is not attached permanently, I put something (hook and loop tape) between the foot and the main body of monopod, just in case though the rubber foot wouldn't be lost easily. Love the monopod and worth the money I spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for added stability","review":"This is a great accessory to stabilize those images for excursions out. Using a compact ball head with quick release offers quick mounting and dismounting.I must admit the first time I mounted my camera with my 100-400mm lens I was a bit anxious but that soon dissipated.Raising and lowering my equipment took some effort but that added to my own security that camera with lens would NOT simply drop with the weight. Applying pressure to the foot and squeezing the trigger works with some effort. The added safety release for lowering is a great feature to alleviate accidental lowering because the trigger is pressed.The foot cup can be turned so a pointed end is revealed to allow stability when shooting on the earth and of course, extended to add stability for floor use. Only draw back I have enountered is no full length strap for carrying thus I can't simply throw it over my shoulder and move on to the next shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, very poorly made","review":"I've had 2 of these monopods in my possession now and neither one of them ever worked properly. The bottom segment either fails to lock or won't retract. Not after many uses mind you, we're talking right out of the box! The bottom line is that this is a very cheaply made product that would be over priced at half of what they charge for it. What good is \\"special aeronautical grade aluminum alloy\\" if the internal components are made up of plastic tinker toys?? This monopod is like a Ferrari with a Pinto engine.

There is precious little information about players, composers, repertoire, etc.This book is for people interested in the construction of guitars and it's not really a \\"History of the Classical Guitar\\" as I understand the expression.It's all very well for Amazon to say we can have a refund.

I have read other books in the past like \\"Body for Life\\" and found them very informative and short and to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good info in a readable format","review":"Nutrition seems to be one of those topics where everyone has an opinion and almost everyone has written a book. A lot of those opinions differ, and a lot of the books out there espouse some pretty wacky theories in order to try to create some buzz and sell a few extra copies.Chris Carmichael has solid cred in bicycling, of course, but also in other sporting areas like running, and even motorsports. So he doesn't need outlandish theories and \\"lose 20 pounds in 2 days\\" come-ons to get people to buy his book.So if you're looking for major revelations, or a meal-by-meal recount of Lance's training diet, this isn't the book for you.

I've had no problems with it so far and don't expect to. The charm is about an inch long, maybe longer when it starts to come to a point. It's heavy enough that you can feel it but not so much that it's a burden or a bother. It has lovely detail, and you can make you the individual petals on the marigold flower perfectly. It's double-sided, though one side does have the company name etched into it along with the design. The chain is a longer one, with the style of chain like those that typically come with dog tags. I know from experience that those kinds of chains are durable and, from the feel of the charm, I sincerely doubt anything is going to mess my necklace up anytime soon. Unless you use it for target practice (and you're a good shot), I'd say this it a very strong and lasting necklace and I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to show some Gin pride!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangs funny","review":"Even if you have the body of a goddess, it's gonna hang funny.

I really detest novels where the hero is all knowing and wise to the ways of the world, and the heroine is a silly, completely innocent youngster who has to be rescued over and over again.Elizabeth actually fit much better with Lord Dearborne's ward Kit. He was her age and developed a friendship with Elizabeth. Lord Dearborne could have been her father and frankly seemed only interested in two things: Elizabeth's physical beauty and laughing at her expense!I also dislike books where the hero never tells the heroine what's really going on, so she keeps falling into trouble. As far as the mystery goes, you could see from the very first time he entered the book that the villain was up to no good.A much better book is \\"Poetic Justice\\" by Alicia Rasley.

The author tends to group non-violent/patriotic groups with racists and extremists. This is nothing new. Angry liberals have always linked their foes with criminals. This is the process of vilification.It is a shame that people who don't know much about this subject must read this book because they are getting a very biased view of the topic. For example, there are many militia groups out there which are non-violent and defensive in nature. The author fails to mention this.In conclusion, this book is NOT fair and balenced, but very bias toward the far left. My advice to someone looking at this book is don't waste your time and money.

The seam down the middle prevents them from clanking together, which is clearly important. I'm not sure if there is a bigger version, but if you had a larger or more oddly-shaped bottle, it might not fit (or would stretch the tote too far). Most standard bottles will probably fit, though.

It turns out that he awarded himself the medals that I earned for the missions I carried out under his command, while he sat safe and secure back in Phuoc Vinh Divison headquarters. His rationale was that he was \\"career\\" and I was exiting the Army, so he didn't think it mattered to me. It obviously helped his then faltering career as he retired a full Colonel, but I cannot imagine spending the next 20 years in uniform wearing another man's awards on my chest.So much for Duty, Honor, Country.

The Metabo is well designed, comfortable to use, and was recommended by my trusty, local repair shop. That said, my sander is now in that repair shop, after very little use. The problem is with the dual sanding control. This sander is capable of sanding in either a finer and gentler mode, or in a faster but rougher mode. Switching from one to the other is simple. You just depress a button on the side of the tool and revolve the disc in reverse direction until it \\"clicks\\". Then you're ready to go. Unless the little button sticks in the depressed position, which will lock up the tool rendering it useless. That is what happened to me, after very few hours and with careful use. Maybe this is just a fluke, but I'll be more reluctant to buy other Metabo tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Cadillac\\" of sanders","review":"After using 5\\" sanders for years, this 6\\" is a dream. I researched them quite a bit, the Metabo is solid, hooks up to my vacuum easily, has comfortable handles and the detachable front handle is easy to change. The variable speed dial is tough to adjust, and the rubber dust hood above the base pad sometimes comes loose and rubs against the orbiting base. Stop immediately if that happens, take off base, press/snap down the dust hood. The dust bag works as well as any of them, but this one is stronger and easier to empty than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's worth investing in something better","review":"The biggest problem with this cart is that the front two wheels do not swivel.

Oliver Stone is no dummy however. He knows that no one would pay to see a movie that revealed that Lee Harvey Oswald actually WAS the guilty person who shot and killed President Kennedy. Sadly, this movie runs fast and free with the historical facts. Virtually every \\"mysterious\\" detail Stone brings up has a very simple and logical explanation. Has Stone pricked the national conscience with this movie? Perhaps, but more importantly he has used his artistic liscence to put a twist (Oliver's Twist) on what really happened that tragic day in Dallas. Those who haven't read a great deal about the Kennedy assassination will swallow his conspiracy nonsense hook, line, and sinker.

Unfortunately, there were some central casting characters as well: Diana is straight out of a 1930's MGM movie. But many of the scenes Pilcher writes (especially Judith's reunions with Jess and Gus) seem true to life and that's what you'll remember.

Many people believe the aforementioned book is Pilcher's finest and indeed it's very well done; however, this book goes into such detail (I love it) that it actually brings the reader into the feel of the times (1935-45). The heroine, Judith Dunbar, is such a good person that you'd love to meet her (or at least I would). She's honest, caring, beautiful (although I don't overly done), is a good friend and she loves her family. This book is not without sorrows - I don't want to write about them as to give them away but they feel \\"right\\" for the story.

Why should she? She is mistress of her own estate, and needs no man to support her. She has passionate, intellectual pursuits that a man would only mock. Let the handsome and gallant Lord Nicholas Daventry find his perfect match in the dazzling Countess Lavinia Welham. Caro would not dream of trying to best such a bewitching creatures -- until she finds the voice of reason drowned out by the longings of her heart...What distinguishes Richardson from most Regency authors (and indeed from most romance authors) is the development of the relationship between the two main characters. In this case, Caro and Nicholas are both interesting, well-educated, intelligent people, and the development of their friendship and love is well-written and thoughtful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjusting clock on KDC-135","review":"I now understand why they gave you the ability to turn the clock off. It's because it can not be adjusted. I have done everything the owner's manual says (STDY mode, push toward AM or FM....) and the CLCK is never displayed.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Buy","review":"I was not happy with this purchase at all, From day one of this cd player in my car, it would skip everytime you turn the car or hit a little bump. It was actually embarrasing when you are blasting music and everytime you turn, people stare at you because of how it skips. I learned now and got rid of it right away and purchased a much better buy that does not skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desparately Need Updating","review":"I traveled to Italy in October of 2002 and spent one month there, relying on Bed and Blessings for accurate information on where to stay inexpensively. I was truly dissapointed. I ended up finding fellow travellers to be a more reliable source of information than \\"Bed and Blessings.\\"This book has not been updated since 1999 and over half the places I called did not have correct phone numbers in the book. Others were out of business or converted to hotels. Also, Italy now uses the Euro which is not listed in the book. One place listed in the book where I stayed, had fleas and they sufficiently dined on me. I fled the place the next morning to a local hotel.Julia needs to get busy updating the information in the book if she wants to continue to sell it as a useful reference.

Keb' is a truly gifted man. This is an excellent CD--the music is soothing and at the same time, uplifting. A wonderful resource for anyone who is interested in expanding their musical horizens. By the way, if you ever get a chance you must see Keb' Mo' live. You will be up on your feet, dancing and singing along to every song. I hope you enjoy his music as much as we have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should listen to this album","review":"Keb' Mo' mixes traditional blues and modern ballads with rare style. Non blues buffs can enjoy it as well as the more obsessed blues cats such as myself. The slick slide work is a pleasure to listen to and takes you along a southern journey with each beat. I have been singing \\"Lullabye baby blues\\" to my 9 years old daughter ever since I learned the song and each time brings a smile in her eyes that makes me want to call Keb and thank him for it. A definite 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good feel music","review":"Keb'Mo' his music touches your heart and your soul.

A must for those nostalgic for past cartoons. Chronological glimpse of history through humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrah! They used PDF!","review":"The book itself is beautiful, and nice articles to accompany the cartoons.And I'm very pleased that they used the cross-platform Adobe Acrobat format! I was afraid that some little proprietary crashy app would put a tiny 640x480 window in the middle of my screen, and was relieved to find that my existing Acrobat viewer would display it all just fine. (I remember how disappointed I was in the complete Mad Magazine on CD-ROM which required its own funny little viewer app.)They could have used a little better resolution in the scans, but I guess they didn't want to compete with the cartoon bank business. It's certianly \\"good enough\\" but don't try printing the cartoons too large"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker","review":"I love the book.

Obviously a computer which reads CDs would be necesssary but nowhere in the advertising or the book and its packaging is mention made of the software (operating system and reader) necessary to view the CDs. You have to make a purchase and open the package and try the CDs before you learn that. I work with CDs on my preferred computer but had to borrow another in order to view these CDs...and then, like one of the other reviewers, was disappointed in the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker","review":"As a youngster in grade school more than sixty years ago, I discovered The New Yorker. My parents permitted/encouraged reading of almost anything, so I rather grew up with the magazine (we were not affluent, so I don't know what my source was, but I had frequent access to the magazine). I learned from the articles and reviews, but I loved the cartoons. Still do. Now I have them all. Delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Yorker --- heavy book!","review":"This is a heavy book. I tried to read this book while I was lying in bed. I held the book above my face, but after several minutes my arms became enfeebled and weak, and I had to put it down. I was unable to use my arms to full capacity for the new few days, and it was arduous even to raise an arm to put my key in the lock. Once I regained full strength, I attempted to again read this book while prostrate -- positioning it above my head -- but my left arm gave out in a spasm and I dropped the book onto my face.

As I was wrapping it, I stopped to read a few cartoons. 45 minutes later I was still reading it and chuckling away. What a treasure! So now I have two, one gift-wrapped for Mom, and the other for me and my family. The first week we had it, me, my wife and our two teenage daughters spent time huddled together around the big coffee table size volume (an amazing event, if you know teenagers),laughing at the hilarious yet sophisticated-in-a-not snooty-way drawings. This book will delight anyone who loves to laugh and who enjoys great wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's partly the cd","review":"that brings my rating down to 2 stars.i have a very advanced, nearly state of the art cpu and monitor. i can't read the captions on the most of the cartoons. they're pertectly legible if i print them out, but that's hardly a sensible solution.the other part of the low rating is the size of the book. obviously, the book industry has become infatuated with huge tomes lately. i would have preferred two, or even three, volumes of a size that could be read comfortably in a chair or in bed. unless i buy an actual lectern, i have nowhere in my house to put this book where i can read it casually or easily.as most reviewers do, i love the new yorker cartoons. i'm glad to have the collection, but i wish i could enjoy it more easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a MAJOR disappointment!","review":"I should have read more of the reviews here. I wanted this book since the day I spotted it in the bookstore, but held off because of the price. I was particularly anxious to see the 2 CDs. But the cartoons are all LOW RESOLUTION--what a disappointment. I can understand why--they don't want people to be able to print high-res versions...to still have to go to their website if they want to do that. But they should have announced that on the cover. Really--it is almost sinful. What a RIP-OFF. Read the other comments here about how unreadable some of the cartoons are because of the LOW-RESOLUTION. Really disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product should not be on the market","review":"The book is outstanding (hence one star) but the New Yorker is engaging in a form of fraud for claiming that the CDs contain all the cartoons ever published. In actual fact the CDs are of such low resolution that MANY of the cartoons cannot be interpreted because the caption or even the entire drawing is illegible. If a drawing is too illegible to interpret it is the same as not being included. I love the cartoons of the New Yorker and it was incredibly frustrating browsing the CDs and repeatedly finding cartoons that simply cannot be read. Enlarging them doesn't help. You WILL get a headache. The publisher should retract their claim and remove the illegible cartoons from the CDs. And shame on them for foisting this on those of us who truly love their cartoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is excellent; the CD, dismal","review":"I bought this for the promise of \\"Every cartoon ever published in The New Yorker.\\" But the resolution of 96 pixels/inch is so bad that the point of subtle cartoons is completely lost. If the joke is in the caption, fine. But if the humor is in, for example, the wording of a sign in the cartoon, forget it. You can see there's a sign but there's no way to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pace yourself - lots of laughs ahead!","review":"What a great book. I've always thought there was a doctoral dissertation lurking in cartoons on the pages of the New Yorker, and now I'm sure of it. Look at the difference in style and content across the decades, look at the cartoons that were funny in 1950 and see what is still funny now and what has become outdated, look at the vast changes in cartooning!But most of all, just look at all of these thousands, no, tens of thousands of cartoons and have a good time. The book is gold, with its 2,004 cartoons, and the essays about the decades and the artists are very well done, but if the book is gold, then there's platinum in the CDs.One thing - if you're a Mac user, as I am, be aware that you really need OSX to make this work (a detail some purchase sites don't mention)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of Graphics unacceptable","review":"This would have been a great idea, to have all of the cartoons from the New Yorker. But the resolution on the disks is so poor that they are useless. Certainly, the cost of a few more disks (so that the resolution could be adequate) wouldn't have put this book out of the price range for those interested in buying it. It looks as though someone just decided to do the minimum, so that they could claim that all the cartoons are there, with little or no concern about the quality of the images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great enjoyment of old memories","review":"While living in the USA (1955-'61), I regularly bought the New Yorker every week - and one day in 1955, in a pile of trash, I found the first volume of collection of its cartoons some fool had thrown away. It remained one of the most treasured items in my library until it mysteriously disappeared (it surely wasn't me to throw it away again...). So, I've welcomed this book with open arms: to see again the production of Peter Arno, Charles Addams, George Price, Steinweg, and so many others... I've taken off one star from the full complement of 5 because I can't understand why they made the CD-Rom's readable with Windows '95 or '98 and not with XP, which makes me have to use a very old PC. Couldn't they come out with a Windows XP-compatible version of the CD-Rom's? or is it just me who's not familiar enough with PC's? Anyway, all I have to do is to use my old relic. The enjoyment is well worth the price of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL of the best","review":"The book is BIG and wonderful. It not only sits on my coffee table, but with a few legs, it could be my coffee table. The best part however are the two CDs. No way could one volume hold all the cartoons ever in the New Yorker. The CDs are great because they can be sorted, searched and you can even print out any cartoon you really like. Do you have any idea how many cartoons Charles Addams drew for this magazine?(715 in the 1929-64 CD alone) You can look at them, and anyone else, and sort in many many ways. I got 2017 hits in the same CD by typing \\"war\\" into the search field. What a resource! Just the thing for a winter's evening. The book will even keep your lap warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker","review":"The book was in exactly the condition advertised and arrived in a timely manner.

True to Janet Dailey's reputation, the story was well researched and accurate.A great read for readers of the Calder series, a good read for new readers-references to past characters/books may leave the new reader with unanswered questions.The story was well crafted and suspenseful. I was truly shocked and saddened to loose a main character. But it leaves the door wide open for a sequel.Janet--when will it be released?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the plagerizing continue?","review":"Janet Dailey has admitted to taking ideas for her stories from Nora Roberts. When the main character dies in this book, which is very unusal for romances, I had to wonder if she took that idea from the book, \\"Message in a Bottle.\\" I will never again be able to read her books without wondering where the ideas and content came from."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"When I finished this book with its depressing ending, I couldn't help but think that the sole purpose of this novel was to set up the scenario for Dailey's next Calder installment. As a reader, I felt used.Most people read romance novels because they enjoy seeing relationships develop and they like happy endings (something we frequently don't get in real life). This novel was devoid of both these elements.Forewarned is forearmed: The tale is interesting enough, because Dailey is an accomplished wordsmith, but the conclusion will not put a sigh on your lips or a smile on your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Romance novel","review":"IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING, DON'T READ ANY FURTHER... While I think there were some romantic themes to this story, my definition of a romance novel includes a happy ending, not one where the love interest dies a tragic death at the end, leaving his family (including two young children) in turmoil. The book is incorrectly labeled as a contemporary romance. I buy romance novels because of the happy ending... I won't purchase any more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!!!","review":"Maggie and Chase's story was one of the first Janet Dailey books I ever read and I loved it so much!!! When Janet Daily killed off Maggie in Stands a Calder Man I swore I would never read her books again. Then Calder Pride came out and instead of buying it I got it at the library and read it and was pleasantly suprised. I was so excited when Green Calder Grass came out that I bought it as soon as it was on the shelf. Well, Ms. Dailey, you suckered me again. I can not believe that Ty died in this book. Talk about no romance! This time I'm sticking to my guns. I will never read/buy another Janet Dailey book again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and Depressing","review":"This was my first Janet Dailey book and I was so disappointed!

I was awake for hours angry at what you did. The Calder series introduced me to romance books, never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read the entire Calder Series and this was a real dispointment to me. In the beginning I hardly wanted to put it down. But when Ty died, I had to force myself to finish the book just for the sake of it. I kept waiting for the punch line and there wasn't one. I guess it's because I'm a big sucker for a happy ending. I'm not sure I want to read the next installment in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caler Grass Not so Green","review":"Story was lack luster. Dailey made Ty seem wishy-washy. There were no strong signs of feelings that you usually get from Dailey. I was disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"This book was a major disappointment to a fan of most all of Janet Daily's novels. I generally like for there to be a little fire between the central characters. There seemed to be more chemistry between Chase and Buck than Ty and Jessy.Also, I know this is just fiction but I think I hate Tara. She annoys me and just seems to detract from the story of two people who are very in love and trying to start a family while running a huge ranch. Having Ty die at the end of the story made me wish she had just quit with Calder Pride. I am sure I will probably read the next books, but I might wait until they come out in paperback next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I was really enjoying Green Calder Grass until the death of Ty.I have read and loved all the Calder books, that is why I was so disapointed in the killing of the main character.The surprise ending was not worth killing off Jessy's husband, Chase's son and the twins father.This is a fictional story, I wish Janet Dailey would have made it end better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Songwriting and Vocals...","review":"IF you dont already have this cd, its definately one worth buying... All of the songs are great, and this album really shows the bands talent.... The song lyrics are incredible, and the vocals are awesome..."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've done it again","review":"Wow, another killer album by Slowvein. I thought that their first album could not be outdone but this band never fails to astonish me. With cool lyrics and rockin music these guys have taken hold of the music scene with a vengeance. With rocking tunes like Visionaries and Window shopping to soothing ballads like Push and Right Mind, this album keeps you listening from beginning to end. I would suggest this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment!","review":"Don't let the picture they show fool you. It's one of the only decent pictures in the whole book! The rest of the pictures were really disappointing compared to that!Other problems I had with this book... there are false deities or mythological figures in it, which some may not exactly appreciate. Secondly, while it LOOKS like one of the many coloring books out there aimed at adults, it's got big-print words in it like it's for kids. I would never give a kid that needs words that size, pictures that would require this much detailed coloring. The kid would go nuts trying to do it. And adults will probably find it disappointing after seeing the picture they show here.Maybe it's just me but, I really did not care for this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frozen or maybe not","review":"We bought this soft serve ice cream/frozen yogurt maker for my cousin for her birthday, and When we tried it the first time we thought maybe we just put too much liquid in the first time, so we tried a different recipe. That one also did not freeze. It does not seem to get cold enough for ice cream. But instead you get to eat some ice cream soup. Personally I like ice cream soup at the end of my ice cream (reminds me of childhood sitting at the table with my brother and us stiring our ice cream till it was soup), but do not like to start with it. I would definitely not buy this product ever again. In fact we are planning on sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not exactly what it advertises","review":"Well, I found this at a thrift store for about $9 so I don't have any hard feelings about it not working that well. I also made some really great ice cream with it though not quite as easily as it advertises. I found that after following all the directions I had to pour out the ice cream soup into another container and refreeze it. Then, after it hardened up enough it was great, albeit not soft serve. Sadly the freezer container fell out of the freezer and craked and all the chemical inside melted out while I mixed the last batch. At the prices they want for a new one I wouldn't recommend it at all. But I wouldn't hesitate to buy another for $9!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle version good for those with eyes of an eagle","review":"The book is great. The only thing is that the images in kindle version of the book are so small it is impossible to see anything. And there is no way to enlarge them ! The same happens to tables -looks like they are poor quality photos of a printed book. Cannot enlarge them either. If I had a printed book I would rate it as five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid and Pathetic","review":"An unengaging, unendearing tale about five privelidged girls and their \\"trials\\" at an East Coast boarding school. Taking place in the early 60s, it's supposed to paint a picture of these pampered young women and the dilemma of a changing society--one where polished social graces and charm are no longer required or respected. Tragic, huh?It's actually the story of spoiled, self-absorbed teenagers. I didn't care about any of them; I was just glad to be finished with them.It really deserves no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disjointed, disappointing read","review":"I began reading this book and was halfway thru it when I began to feel let-down and thought maybe I had missed something. The characters were interesting and many subjects were touched on (such as anorexia, bulimia, being overweight), but somehow these problems were solved without any explanation. One character is described as having bulimia, but in the next chapter she is back to \\"normal\\", and it is never explained or mentioned again! The entire book is like this. Many interesting stories and situations are begun, but just as soon they are brought to an end and I was left frustrated wondering what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish","review":"I thought that this novel would consist of more than the day-to-day rituals of an all girls' exclusive school. Based on the rear cover, I expected more on the 1960s and the relative events that would shape the lives of the main characters. In addition to the lack of events, none of the girls are really likable, and come across \\"cardboard-Like\\". What they are is overindulgent and boring!There was no way of knowing through the content of the novel that it was supposed to take place in the sixties. I felt that too much time was spent describing the rules and dress code of the school. These things were mentioned on almost every page! I kept hoping as the book went on that things would turn around, but it never did. Finally, I had to give up and put it down unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of Gutcheon","review":"Beth Gutcheon knows how to write and she also knows the world of an all-girls private school, where this novel is set. But there are so many characters in this book, and so much happens in approximately 350 pages that it's hard to remain engaged with the action and the characters. I had to fight the temptation to skip ahead in several parts, because I was bored with whatever was going on with some minor character I could barely remember. Like most authors, Gutcheon has gotten better in time and her later books are much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Based on the reviews I read I decided to buy this book, it was a waste of money. This book has five main characters and it's hard to tell what's going on with whom based on how it's written. There is a lot of profanity and detailed sexual themes in this novel, which I thought were farfetched and unnecessary. The most interesting part of this novel is the end, which describes what happens to the five main characters later in their lives. If you're searching for a good school girl book to read, this is not the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Book!!!!","review":"An interesting insight, (fiction though,) on prep schools, wealth, and women in the early 1960's. This book was wonderful! It is a must for any women of any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly engrossing portrait of privelaged adolescence","review":"Gutcheon's stunning prose and beatiful imagery, as well as her keen sense of humor and drama, make this a really enjoyable book. One of my favorites from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"How connected you feel to these girls","review":"I took a chance on this book, not being familiar with the author and was very pleased with my choice. Ms. Gutcheon told the story not only from each girl's persepective, but as each would have told it; glossing over parts they found unattractive or not as important. It was as if each girl were remembering her past. And as it is with remembering we don't always remember every detail or what exactly happened next. I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early effort","review":"After being intensely moved by this author's novel More Than You Know, I was gleeful. Aha, a new writer to enjoy! I decided to work my way through her earlier books and started with this one. I think it is her first novel. It feels like one, semi-autobiographical and ridden with remembered angst. Incidents are brought up and then dropped, leaving the reader with a sense of frustration. If I had read this book first, I don't think I would have guessed what a truly fine writer she later turned out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! This book was absolutely terrible.....","review":"No, no...worse than terrible, it was lazy. This \\"coming-of-age\\" novel amounted to little more than a few stick figures plodding (clunky Abercrombies on, of course) through some weary story lines. For an entire weekend, I fought my way through this slough, trying to find something -- anything -- that might make me give a hoot about a single one of these characters. My herculean efforts were thwarted, however, by Ms. Gutcheon. With her painfully stilted writing and penchant for orphaning her characters and their development, Ms. Gutcheon nearly drove me to commit literary hara-kiri. While I sincerly hope that The New Girls is an anomaly and that Ms. Gutcheon really is a talented writer of engrossing novels, Lucifer and his impish pals will be winning Olympic gold in Siberia before I pick up another one of her works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gino on a mission!!","review":"This movie is definately action packed with it's share of violence. Steven Seagal is wonderful as a \\"Brooklin born\\" cop willing to go the extra mile to catch a killer.

Fantastic movie. Loved it. Love all of his movies. Just a good action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Steven Segal Movie!!","review":"Like I said, this was my favorite Steven Segal movie! I also like Jerry Orbach, he appears briefly in this movie. This is great, Steven Segal chasing Richie all over Brooklyn, for gunning down Segal's partner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Quotable Movie of ALL TIME!!!","review":"The Portrayal of Steven Seagal as Law enforcement officer, Gino Felino is nothing short of Brilliant. I do not believe anyone could have played the part better. Steven Seagal plays the Brooklyn accent perfectly and to top it all off this movie takes place in the neighborhood I call home.

Not aterrible movie but not great either. I liked it better on TV last night than I id when I saw it at the theatres when it originally came out.

During the last ten years his writing skills declined due to poor health and opium addiction; some of his later novels are really bad (semi-theatrical melodramas). Surprisingly 'The Haunted Hotel', one of the last works by Wilkie Collins, is a rather nice, compact ghost story. Fans of Wilkie Collins will be pleased.The story is about, um.., a haunted hotel. Several characters, mostly squabbling aristocrats, return to the Venetian home (now hotel) of a deceased colleague (..a rather nasty fellow). The past comes to haunt these guests in rather metaphysical ways. It's all a bit silly, of course. But the decent prose and characterizations save 'The Haunted Hotel' from being some camp ghost story.Bottom line: certainly not a classic but enjoyable nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Tedious","review":"I usually like a book like this, but found this one very boring.There was no \\"hotel\\" until over half way through the book and there was no 'haunting' untilalmost 75% of the way through.Just bored me to tears.."},{"rating":"1","title":"the haunted hotel","review":"i found myself having to resist the urge to put it down before finishing a chapter. the plot is unclear in the beginning.

It's kind of refreshing that while other self-help gurus seem to be veering off into weird and obscure spiritualism (Okay! My opinion only!) Robbins sticks to the same stuff that has always worked: goal setting, discipline, learning, and relationships. I repeat: this is not magic.

Why? Because his dream was to get rich by selling nothing. And that is what he's done, mooched of the idea's and theories of others that took them a lifetime to perfect, and he's packaged it and now he's selling it.

The information is based on sound research, yet very little is credited to the researchers. Just one of numerous examples is the concept of NAC.

The only question is whether the author offers insights and strategies that you can use to improve your life. The answer to this question is a resounding yes. While you won't agree with everything in the book or find everything relevant, I think there's no question that you will find many useful ideas.

If you just read casually, it will be interesting stuff, just not life-changing. Tony Robbins is truly a gift to our generation and I only wish he would write some more books to see what he's been up to all these last 10 years for those of us who don't get to seminars much. I did attend one of his 4-day Firewalk Seminars in 2000 and still use some of the \\"distinctions\\" I learned there.

It's so bad it's almost a parody of itself. This guy is repetitive and psuedo-modest. Every chapter felt the same. It never felt like he was getting anywhere.Don't bother!

Change is a process.","review":"\\"As a man thinketh, so is he.\\" For many years, I studied self-improvement books. I like \\"Awaken the Giant within\\" for a number of reasons: 1) Concepts are clearly described 2) Assignments to apply the concepts take place immediate 3) Feed back on the results can be examined and quantified. The book is not a passive discussion of philosophy, but basic day to day paradims which apply directly, into your life. Here some of the valueable concepts I've learned: increase your net worth begins by increasing the value you offer daily. Increase the payout you provide increases your hourly wage. Second, change is a matter of focusing on pleasure and deterence from old behavior patterns is the result of pain. Third, creating 10 totally positive days. I haven't yet accomplished this assignment, but just three days or one day in a month is amazing. I will be happy to share other insights, but reading the book is really the key, to begin your self-improvement journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Resist the Temptation","review":"All these power people pushing their own agendas has left little respect for others. These are the people who drive 95 miles an hour and run you off the road, the people who care about nothing but materialism, the people who are setup for shallow relationships and failed marriages. I don't want to meet power people, I want human beings who care about others, value something other than money and success, can deal with conflict in ways other than trouncing weaker people, who live by morals and ethics and respect others' boundaries, who think about something larger than themselves, and who build intimate lasting friendships instead of hollow feel-good encounters devoid of meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"commercial for other products","review":"Let's face it, NOT EVERYBODY HAS A GIANT WITHIN!

And I don't think he goes in depth enough in the topics. Like for example the first chapter is about making decisions. He says that decisions can change your life in an instant and gives examples of people who have made important decisions and concludes that decisions can change your life. He gives no strategy for improving your decision-making skills besides \\"make more decisions\\". He does seem to have a lot of energy, which can be motivational. I'm going to guess that the motivational component is what is getting his high ratings, but I don't think the strategies he gives are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good.","review":"This book will appeal mostly to the the infantile/gullible.

Tony has achieved enormous personal wealth by selling gullible souls on the American dream. If you can convince people that you have some special insight on how to achieve personal fortune, and then sell them a bunch of books and tapes on the subject then you too can become wealthy like Tony. That is exactly how Mr. Robbins achieved his success...by convincing millions of people through hyperbolic infomercials that his books and tapes would somehow miraculously set them on the path to personal success. But outside of that what exactly has Mr. Robbins done? What of lasting value has he created ? What new art has he created or science has he uncovered ? How many people can honestly say that his tapes and books have helped to create LASTING change in their lives ? I suspect very few if any. Robbins disco therapy is good only for a few moments of motivation."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can do it.","review":"If you don't read any other self help book in your life, read this one.

There is so much advice here, and its pragmatic and practical. Aswell as energizing.He has a conversational style, which fleshes out the book. But he gets to the point - getting the reader to take action.The point is - this guy, this book ... incredible tools for personal growth. To be incredible, they must be used, consistently, over time.

So the miracle is how he managed to keep it secret for all those years...2) He teaches about relationships but he is getting divorced (!).3) He makes huge money on people's misery.4) He was sued 4 times since 1984 for lying to the public (e.g., for years, he used to claim that firewalking was a \\"mind-over-body\\" experience that people could only achieve through years of experience or through his seminars)5) His techniques don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tony's \\"seminar trap\\"","review":"This book clearly lacks content and it's sole purpose is to make more people want to go to Tony's seminars and to buy more books and tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book is the author's poor attempt to make a fast buck riding from his previous bestseller, \\"Unlimited Power\\".

The first part of the book was easily accepted and when it came to creating a future in mind I paused, contemplated and wondered how to take this new appraoch to life on on.

This book was a simple story which illustrated a simple point about customer service. That's it. I purchased it thinking I would have \\"Raving Fans\\" but the book is far too simple and effective service is more complex. If you're hungry for growth and knowledge don't read it or feel influenced to purchase it. It's something I would imagine a very low level customer service worker reading for a little inspiration. If you're starving for just a little inspiration and 2nd grade storytelling, then purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are SOOOOO many better books out there","review":"This book is dumbed down to an elementary level. There are sooooo many better sales books out there. This is a silly story about customer service that no company would ever really do. All companies want to make \\"raving fans\\", but the reality most companies just use the concept and this book as a silly attempt to think they want to attain \\"raving fans\\", but in the end, they are out for a profit 1st and then hopefully some fans 2nd. I'm ok with that, but don't say you want raving fans, when you surround yourself with meaningless slogans, such as \\"Raving Fans\\" and \\"Yes\\" men.

Customer Service is mediocre at best these days and just by going a little above and beyond can make a difference with your customers and turn them into ambassadors for your business. I just wish Mr Blanchard[author: Ken Blanchard] stuck with the points of the book and developed real world examples around them and how to do the work in a more informational format. The attempt at building a story around the points and even how it's attempt at relating to the reader was more of a distraction than it was a reinforcement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting ideas and a quick easy read.","review":"This is a quick and easy book to read. The concepts presented in this book to improving Customer Service is very possible. The ideas presented is interesting and really makes me aware how I have been \\"just satisfied\\" with all the bad customer service all around us. Ken gets his points across by using short events and dialogs between the characters. However, the short events, products, etc... seems to be too fantasy and very fictional.

This business novelette points out an important lesson for anyone interested in keeping their customers. Unless your customers rave about your service, they are likely to be poached by an aggressive competitor. If you are willing to ask yourself the hard questions posed by Blanchard, you will likely find your services falling short of the mark.

The margins are so wide that this could have been printed at 3\\"x4\\" to fill a page rather than 6x9. Even if it included some useful facts, it wouldn't be worth $20. Then you read it and realize its nothing but a bunch of filler positioned as a line extension book from a well known author who has tarnished his \\"brand equity\\" with this poor excuse of a book.

Since that wouldn't be a very long book, the author adds in a string of totally-unrelated references to golf, since we all know all business people must pretend to be avid golfers.Save your time, and save your money. This is common sense packaged in a shiny wrapper."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing revolutionary in this book","review":"This book is a waste of money and time (even though it only takes 1-2 hours to read this book). It is amazing to me that Ken Blanchard could charge $ for a book that is based on common sense and could be summarized in one page without losing any content. The premise of the book is that there are three \\"secrets\\" to customer services which are decide what you want, find out what your customers want and deliver the vision plus one percent. All the book is saying is that a business should have a vision of what it wants to accomplish, talk to its customers to ensure that this vision is aligned to customer expectations, and then deliver the vision consistently while always looking to improve (plus one). There are a few fictional examples of businesses that have excellent customer service but definitely not much depth at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will loose an IQ point with every page you read.","review":"I read this book at the request of our manager and I feel as if I have been intellectually molested. Regurgitating trite catch phrases against the backdrop of every managers wetdream of mindlessly devoted automaton employees who seem content with their minimum wage jobs is not the best way to further motivate your own employees.

Of course, in today's society, customer service has been flushed down the drain and I know many companies who need to have these basic principles shoved down their throat. However, the storyline in this book completely takes away from these principles. I understand the authors were attempting to make it more interesting, and I could even deal with the \\"Fairy Godmother\\" part of the story, but the companies used to illustrate \\"raving fan service\\" are completely illogical, and I feel that this really took away from the basic customer service principles that the book conveys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully poor writing about an important topic.","review":"Beware. The thesis is excellent, but the \\"Readers Digest\\"-style writing is extremely lightweight and annoying. This is a fluffy, motivational \\"parable\\" about becoming customer focused. It offers imaginary examples of how to please customers without any actual advice on how to implement these types of ideas in real-world situations.If you're interested in improving your customer service and customer focus, look for something more substantial than this little book. If you're just looking to feel good about improving customer service and don't have a long attention span, this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very high fluff to content ratio","review":"The useful pieces of this book (there is a tiny bit of good content in there) fit into ten bullet points or less.This is 130 pages of pure fluff - a story about a fairy god mother, playing golf, and time travel (I am not making any of that up, those truly are significant elements of the book).Even the 130 pages is a stretch with the font so large and the margins so massive I felt like I was reading a book written for children (the fairy god mother bit didn't help either).Business books often are pretty fluffy, this one is exceptionally so.Is creating raving fans important? Absolutely, but you do not need this book - just make a guess at what a raving fan is and you will have saved yourself 40 minutes of reading and be just as informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they Raving Fans or an Escaping Stampede?","review":"This book was a gigantic disappointment. The whole \\"male fairy godmother\\" thing just insulted my intelligence from the beginning. What could have been an insightful book about real customer service impacts really \\"lost it on the dismount.\\" The examples of customer strategy seemed forced and stretched beyond plausibility. The key character did not really seem to wrestle or grapple with many of the concepts. A business fable should inspire action, and this book simply did nothing. It wasn't a bad \\"read\\" per se. There were some entertaining facets, but it you are really looking to wow your customers and turn your business around, this is not the book for you. No matter how time-constrained you might be for a read on the topic, this will not be a good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting is a good word for this book","review":"My management demanded that all of us read this book (not that long after they laid off people because they said they weren't making money). Since they were enthusiastic about this book, it's little wonder they couldn't make any money in running a business. Blanchard writes in a ridiculous style -- about sixth grade level -- with inane characters and \\"plot,\\" and the examples he uses to illustrate his points fail the test of simple logic.As noted by an earlier reviewer, you don't make money in labor-intensive businesses having people perform unnecessary jobs. I'll bypass the related fact that no one with ambition or intelligence would want to stay at any of these jobs for any length of time or work for anyone so clueless.I've been forced to read Blanchard on at least two occasions by management in companies where I have worked. That Mr. Blanchard continues to sell books validates my opinion of most of the managers I have encountered of late in American business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional Management","review":"The book starts off on a positive note. The author notes the modern generalization that good service in any business is no longer expected. Then, it takes a turn for the worse. The rediculous examples are insulting to anyone with an IQ above 100.The pervasive concepts contradict the work of Michael Porter on generic business strategies. You simply cannot be the service and quality leader and also be the cost leader. The worst example is the gas station where they will clean your windows, check your fluids, and generate small talk. All of this while maintaining a lower labor cost than the self serve station down the street. I know one of them actually owned service stations with a similar model in Canada, but I suspect other factors were in force.I don't think it's worth the time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Customer Care message","review":"I used this in coordination with a canned Attitude training and got great results from my Customer Service group. It really made them think before they reacted to any call or inquiry from internal and external customers.

However, the ideas are solid and the examples very interesting. I was able to take some notes and actually use them in our recent staff meeting. It was worth the price, we actually got some good ideas out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for a broad audience","review":"This book was a pretty simplistic read, but contained some good ideas that encourage you to think about your own situation. We gave this book to our Building Permit and Citizen Complaints staff (who aren't the shiniest pennys in the well). It sparked them to think of ways to handle customers in a more positive manner and move service from 'OK' to 'Raving Fans'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Concept... Not My Style.","review":"I like the idea - focusing on good customer service. I don't like the way the book is written. Other books, like \\"Fish\\" (Stephen Lundin) do a better job of presenting a \\"moral through a story.\\" They are teaching something new or inventive. Good 'customer service' is not a new concept. Conveying its importance through a simplistic story is, in my opinion, rather elementary my dear Blanchard.If these fictional characters were real people, and some good facts were thrown in, this could be a very good book. As it is, I think there are better ways - and books - to promote good customer service in an organization.The only redeeming quality is it is a quick read and therefore if you want to line Ken Blanchard's pockets... you can buy copies for your entire team and perhaps inspire some thought and get everyone on the same page. Unless you have team-building in mind though... seek wisdom elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best little books on Customer Service","review":"'Raving Fans: A Revolutionary Approach to Customer Service' is a book that I discovered referenced in several other books that I've been reading. In each other book, little was said other than a quote here or there. But noticing the book's presence, I purchased it and am glad I did.The book is written like a goofy fairy-tale--but you understand the gimmick and it helps you read the book quickly, makes memorable the lessons, and enables you to easily reference the points it is making.In a couple weeks, I will be leading a retreat on church membership assimilation as part of my doctoral dissertation and plan to use this book as a catalyst in discussing quality customer service from a guest's perspective.I whole-heartedly recommend this book. It says what other books take hundreds of pages to say in just a few pages, and you can pick up this book for just a penny from a host of used book sellers (although it is definitely worth its retail price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is dated more than lindsey lohan","review":"This book is extremely outdated. I was forced to read it for a class, and similar to other people I was offended by the simplicity of ideas presented. This book by no means encompasses the reality of improving your business.

C.J. has the gift of relating things that are deep in a very pragmatic, easy-to-read and understand kind of way. I read this book immediately when it came out and have returned to my notes on the book several times for a refresher. I especially loved the chapters on how he teaches his son about humility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Helpful","review":"Not exactly a revolutionary piece, but one that I think is important for Christians to read. Mahaney starts of by discussing why humility is important--including a little info from a survey that showed meekness and hard work were prevalent in successful business leaders.This is a short and easy read. Mahaney not only discusses Humility but also gives pointers on cultivating it (e.g. playing golf ;P)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure to Share","review":"As a pastor, I am always on the lookout for books that help not only myself, but others. This was the first book by Mahaney that I ever read and I loved it. The book reads like a sermon from a caring pastor, who himself is more than willing to be vulnerable.It contains not only sufficient biblical discussion of Humility to edify, but it aims for practical applications also.What comes through the loudest is Mahaney's reliance on the grace of God for all things, including walking in humility. I have given this book to many. I recommend to all Christians and probably need to read it again and again myself. So, don't just buy one copy! Get one to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is a short and insightful look at Biblical humility. Highly recommended. As the Bible speaks of humility very often as a mark of a Christ follower, this book is a great study on a deeper level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book With Limited Scope","review":"Destined to become a minor classic (\\"minor\\" because of its limited scope), Mahaney's little book on humility has become the go-to book for a simple-but-profound study of the topic of humility. It's structured topically, as opposed to a more biblical theology approach, and is especially excellent to read with a small group.This was the second time I had read it, and this time was with my pastor and two young men we're mentoring. The discussion based on the book was very good and I could see accountability groups, small groups, and Sunday classes using it for a study."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book on my read often list","review":"Most books I will only read once, but there are a few books that are worth reading once every year or every couple of years - Humility: True Greatness is one of those books that I need to reread often.- It focuses on one of the key character traits of a Christ follower- It is biblical- It focuses on the cross- It is practical- It is an easy read, even though some of what is written is hard to hear- It is a quick readEven if you have read Andrew Murray's Humility, this book is still worth purchasing.

He covers a broad spectrum of Biblical subjects, and treats them in a relatively thorough, albeit limited manner.

Actually, my copy of the Institutes was looking ragged, so now I use an electronic copy. Still, for a good understanding of Reformed theology, you should have both of these. It is nice, in the new compilation, to have both the \\"Introduction\\" and \\"Systematic Theology\\". I agree that you need both publications and having them in one volume is handy.I agree about the binding. It is sturdy enough (5 stars), but it is not \\"user friendly\\" (3 stars). The text nearly runs into the binding and its smaller size makes it hard to hold without it closing on itself. This makes it tough to read, holding it in hand while eating lunch. Still, the theological presentation is more important, so I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Star Content; 2 Star Publishing","review":"Berkhof was the sine qua non of Reformed systematics texts for generations of American seminary students, pastors and theologians.

They really work well together. Alot of the tracks are from the Swanky Modes, I believe a ficticious group from the movie that sound like James Brown. Those are real good. But the Devo and King Kotton songs are hysterical. Again, seeing the movie makes this 5 times better. Fishbone adds a funky track from their \\"Truth And Soul\\" album too. My only complaint is nothing from \\"The Blender Children\\". Now if you gotta have \\"Mr. MX7\\" you'll have to hunt down the \\"Lords Prayers II\\" collection, by Lords Of The New Church.

The item and bag were then placed in a box with my other items and shipped to me. Two ounces of this product leaked out and onto my other items in the box.The proper way to package this item for shipment is to remove the spray head and replace it with a seal and a screw-on cap.

The Metabo quick-change is less cumbersome and quicker than that of the Bosch. Metabo's electronic variable speed is much more user-friendly and far more adjustable than the trigger adjustment others use. Though Amazon does not show it, this model does come with a case, an anti-splitering insert, and a blade. It takes a the t-style quick change blades (so you won't have to hunt for special blades).

One example of the careless scholarship in Fest's book is his reference to Wilhelm Mohnke as SS Gruppenfuhrer (Major General) on page 45, and as SS Brigadefuhrer (Brigadier General)on page 66. Mohnke was indeed a Brigadefuhrer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brief, Dry and Disappointing","review":"Mr. Fest is a competent writer, but his account here is dry, brief and for those with prior knowledge of the facts, this book is very disappointing.For a period with such plots and subplots this book is surprisingly colorless.For an excellent book on a decisive turning point in Third Reich history, I most warmly recommended \`Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943'By Antony Beevor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely short.... more like an essay...","review":"This book will never make you feel the sensation of impending doom that you testify while watching the recent German movie based in this book. The book is very short, it's has no intention of going deep into every character's psyche. It's not a bad book at all, but it's uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book didn't need to written.","review":"James O'Donnell's \\"Bunker\\" is the authoritative history of the Fuhrerbunker. Even Mr. Fest acknowledges that in his Bibliography notes. \\"Inside Hitler's Bunker\\" is cursory, superficial and unoriginal and it escapes me that there can be any reason this book was written except to make a quick buck off of unwary readers. It's a joke. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Please do not waste your time nor your money on this book. There are far better ones available if you wish to learn about Hitler's last days in the bunker. There is no new information here. And it is rather \\"skimpy\\" at that. Check out James P. O'Donnell's \\"The Bunker\\" or the \\"The Last Days of Hitler\\" by Anton Joachimsthaler. Both are rather extensive and far more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinforcement","review":"I had explored much of the material in this work in other sources but found it helpful.It clearly delineates that Hitler to the end was hell bent on total destruction of his own as well as the enemy.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking crazy!!!","review":"This band was the opening act at a Cannibal Corpse/Dying Fetus show I saw. They were freaking incredible! The speed of the drums and the frantic energy of the guitars blow my mind. The style of the vocals is pretty interesting too. The vocals don't always come in where you would expect. The vocals sound very sharp and intense. It's stuff like this that makes death metal so freaking cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fox & The Faith","review":"This is a very good 4 book series by Dan Parkinson. Read this book first and it will help the reader follow the story. A bit hard to follow the nautical terms, but still an excellent read about late 18th century sailing ships."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!!","review":"This book kept me intrigued from cover to cover! It's got a little bit of everything, from adventure to romance. I wish I'd never read it, just so I could read it again for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful advice for the uninitiated and marketing-challenged","review":"It's unfortunate Bly's book is out of print because it's one every small business owner could benefit from. I have a home-based business as a Freelance Marketing Writer and one of the most popular services I offer clients is Targeted Public Relations.

It's for anyone who practices no particular \\"religion\\". The prayers are simple, in every day language, easily understood like God is speaking right to me. I find it inspiring every day and look forward to reading one prayer per day. None are more than a few paragraphs and all speak straight to the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift","review":"This book is simple, yet meaningful and worthy of contemplation or meditation. I have given this book as a gift to about 20 people and every person has called me to tell me how much they love the book and the thoughtfulness to give something that is a little different than flowers or chocolate to someone going through another phase in their life.There is also something I think about when I hit a spiritual roadblock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful way of getting divine inspiration","review":"I absolutely adore this gem!

This is an interesting scholarly look at Shakespeare's sonnets, as the title makes clear. I found this book while reading an article that cited it. What led me to the text was a claim that some sonnet passages were in some plays, and I wanted to find out where these passages were. Unfortunately, that bit was pretty speculative and not well supported. There were a lot of \\"this reads the way passage X in Romeo and Juliet reads\\" and that sort of thing. I expected verbatim, or near verbatim passages. Guess I showed my ignorance on that on, but that's the only gripe. If you want a way to learn more about the sonnets and make better sense of them, this book will do you well."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is funny and sweet","review":"I bought this on a whim because it was on sale and it's earned its place on the shelf.

Hmm, it's a great set even if you're a general film fan! SCARFACE (arguably Al's best film performance) and CARLITO'S WAY will take you into the Latino crime scene. Al's Oscar-winning performance in SCENT OF A WOMAN will leave you screaming \\"hoo-ah!\\" for a week. Unfortunately, though, they included SEA OF LOVE rather than one of Al's better films such as Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. And when's The Godfather coming out! All in all, though, this is a great starter set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's Your Daddie?","review":"I bought this album, yes the vinyl stuff we used to listen to in the olden days, back in 1988. I never shared it with anyone because it wasn't cool to like anything that sounded like roots rock or dare I say country. However, Cut Me Off and Statue of Jesus were just too good to ignore. The hilarious Drank So Much (Just Feel Stupid) got played the most. Blues Mary still gets a lot on play on my iPod. I had to record from the vinyl version onto my computer to get it but it was worth the hassle.The closest comparison I have is to the great band the Bottle Rockets. You will enjoy their music, just get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Zebra Hunter","review":"\\"The Zebra Hunter\\" is an easy to follow story that will arouse all of your emotions and touch the very depths of your heart.

I got thrown into an XML/SOAP project and had to get up to speed in short order. After struggling on my own for a while I bought this book hoping it would have lots of meat on actually using SOAP::Lite, but it had pretty thin coverage.I did like the big-picture overview of the various technologies, but it was not very helpful in writing an actual SOAP client to talk to a third party's SOAP server. Considering that the author of SOAP::Lite also wrote this book, it seems to me that there could have been a whole chapter on SOAP::Lite from the client view.This will stay on my shelf as a reference, but for getting up to speed rapidly on actually writing a SOAP client, it was a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot believe this an O'Reilly Title.......","review":"I usually give preference to O'Reilly's books when looking to purchase a book on a certain programming technology. O'Reilly is generally ahead of the pack in terms of writing style, author's reputation, and knowledge of the subject. Unfortunately, I have little to no confidence in the knowledge of the authors in this book just from reading and trying out the introductory examples on SOAP::Lite in PERL. It starts off with the trivial \\"Hello World\\" example of writing a SOAP server and a client. The authors didn't even get this one right! Already threre are errata submitted for this example on the oreilly.com site. I couldn't believe it! I mean, if you cannot get the \\"Hello World\\" example right, then what confidence do I have in the authors of presenting something more complex?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This book is a good candidate for the city dump. This, in my experience, the book is one of the worst O'Reilly books and should have never been published! Sloppy examples riddled with errors. Why, the eratta page on the O'Reilly web site appears to be written by a reader. The ony correction I found in the \\"Official\\" errata was a mis-spelled author name. I'm setting fire to my copy as soon as I submit this review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have focused on SOAP.","review":"Hi I'm the one who wants to learn how to build cool apps with SOAP. To be honest, this book is not that practical. It certainly explains the overview, but in terms of developing a real application, I don't think this is useful.It should have focused on only 1.) what is SOAP, 2.) how it works 3.) how to write code.It tries to cover more broad, vague topic Web Services, which is more or less overview, as it is not ready for prime time.How to use SOAP API should be not that difficult to understand, but what each SOAP envelope's xml tag syntax means are most important to me. It's so complex and this book doesn't explain clearly, which makes this book less valuable.Looking forward to next improved edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"What can I say, not worth of buying.Too short samples that were written in too many languages.Architectual overview for Web Services was too short too.Waiting for better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for the hits and got much more","review":"I purchased this collection primarily so I would have high quality remasters of her U.S. hits \\"Kids in America\\" and \\"Keep Me Hangin' On\\".

It's not all political riot grrl angst here. This 5 foot spit fire delivers prose like a emerson on benzedrine. Her Alternate tunings on her guitar change from song to song and give each one a distinctive feel that connects with each word that pours from her mouth. Her Songs move from theme to theme and genre to genre, never lulling in expectation. \\"Queen of Quiet\\" breaks it down in an almost contradictory spoken word speech. I've never heard a hop-along country song like \\"little cowboy\\" mosey along as if Roy Rogers and Jack kerouac collaborated On The \\"dusty\\" Road. Watch this one. She's gonna have more tricks up her sleeve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait For A Collecion of Covers","review":"Erin McKeown has a beautiful voice, amongst the best that I have ever heard. I saw her live and her voice reminded me of Billy Holiday's. She plays great music on a variety of instruments. Unfortunately, she's a terrible lyricist.Consider the following (from her song \\"Softly, Moses\\"):\\"Lonely in the dark/Images creep past/Bright pink, purple, green /Blue and black/Despair oh holy day/We cross down sorrow's Way\\"Angst-ridden 14-year-old girls write better stuff than this. It's a shame, because the songs are impeccable acoustically. If McKeown did an album of other people's songs, I would probably buy it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so fun","review":"I did not buy this miniatures to play Dreamblade but to play D&D.

It is bound to become a new family holiday classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the quality","review":"I'm a huge fan of Mary Engelbreit and her book \\"The Night Before Christmas\\", but I was really disappointed in this DVD. Most of the charm of her artwork is lost in the translation to computer graphics. The computer animation is stiff and robotic, the \\"expanded\\" story is cliche, the songs schmaltzy and unmemorable. I'm sure young children will still like it, but I would suggest instead buying the book and reading it to your kids. It'll be much more meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"The only thing this video has in common with Mary Engelbreit's wonderful illustration style is the cover. The characters are mostly generic computer animation- quite a disappointment if, like me, you think you're getting an animated version of her style (Actually Santa's not bad but his style is at odds with the rest of the video). On the plus side, 'The Night Before Christmas' is only 26 minutes long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not going to help","review":"This could not help parents or police in the least.

Apparently the author just made up most of these terms, so buying this book will in fact not let parents in on their kids' terms for drug activity, and misleads parents into a false sense of security.It's hard enough to be a parent in today's world without getting fake information, and all people involved with the publication of this disgrace of a book should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait just a second","review":"The cure has a pretty long career and have released two greatest hits collections before this, Galore and Staring at the Sea. This new greatest hits collection is really taking a few songs from the previous two greatest hits album and packing it as something new. This is not really a good way to get a good overview of the cure's career. Buy Galor and Staring at the Sea.

Additionally, \\"Closedown\\", another masterpiece from \\"Disintegration\\" is missing while \\"Lullaby\\" a bad song from the same album is included. \\"The Last Day of Summer\\" from their last album \\"Bloodflowers\\" is also missing.

Hits, you won't be so taken aback. As in \\"intro\\" to the cure, it contains a number of songs whose choice is slightly dubious, but it's not supposed to be the Cure's NIFTYEST Hits, just singles that have charted. Make an interesting gift, but the real gem is if you get the version with the acoustic renditions of all the songs on the album.

The Cure, are without question, one of the most influential \\"well-known\\" bands of our time and I'm certainly not disputing their talent. In fact, I may own every Cure album produced. Which is exactly the problem with another 'greatest hits' offering. Staring At The Sea was a remarkable piece of work in every respect. Galore was a less-than-comparable followup but did include songs that needed to be released in greatest hits form.But we're not reviewing those albums, or The Cure's indisputable talent. We're reviewing a greatest hits compilation that has been played out (with the exception of the two, yes, count 'em, TWO, new tracks).If you're a fan of The Cure, you already own every song on this CD (ok...all but two). If you're just discovering The Cure, there are several more pertinent releases to acquaint you with this band's immeasureable gift to the world of music.Then again...I could be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but...","review":"I find this collection a little unnecessary when there are \\"Galore\\" and \\"Staring at the Sea\\" already. I hate to say it but I'm not the biggest fan of \\"Greatest Hits\\". Who's to say what the best songs are from a band who's repertoire spands over two decades? Then the record companies release the same songs over and over again giving the collections differet names (Greatest hits, best of.., essential ect. ect.) I always thought The Cure was a better album band than a singles band anyway. I can understand using this as an introduction to The Cure and it's not a bad one by any means but I'd rather show someone a copy of \\"Pornography\\" or \\"Disintigration\\" and say \\"Now THIS is The Cure\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow they are good","review":"Too many music critics credit Nirvana with influencing all of the new modern rock artists out today. I have to disagree and say that the credit deserves to go to The Cure. Their songs define love in the dreary 80s and still are wonderful to listen to today.

This one is worth passing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: disaster!","review":"What is the point of this greatest-hits CD? Pre-holiday cash-in? Contract fulfillment?

And where's \\"Killing an Arab\\" and \\"Jumping Someone Else's Train?\\" I realize that some compilations will have to omit a favorite or two for space reasons, but this CD is an incomplete collection that's supposed to chronicle the 20-plus year history of one of pop's most enduring bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Greatest Hits","review":"This really isn't worth much unless you can find the double-disc version that has a whole second cd with acoustic versions of all the songs on the greatest hits disc.

If you're looking for a greatest hits to start off with to get to know the Cure go for Staring At the Sea, it's loaded with great old songs from Boys Don't Cry up to Head On the Door (pre-Disintegration unfortunately).

I was a little confused at first but about 10 minutes into it I started loving the non-linear structure, lazy weirdness, and funny dialogue. I've gone back and watched it several more times and I still haven't gotten bored. This movie deserves multiple viewings, you find something new every time (I'm a huge David Lynch fan and I noticed a picture of the Eraserhead baby on the Hit-And-Run Son's wall near the beginning). Everyone should rent Slacker but people who live in Austin will enjoy it a little more because you can so easily recognize everywhere it was filmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD, and a double-disc Criterion no less!","review":"Linklater's brilliant debut done in one continuous shot.

Its proof that where there is a will, there is way. It has the fluidic motion of a Pink Floyd album from the 70's while still managing to stick to the under lying theme: Anarchy. But with a warm and fuzzy slant ;)As mentioned, its too bad its not availible on DVD, wonder what the hold up is on that?I doubt if we will ever see a movie quite like this one made. It marks the beginning of a short lived era, refreshed with Clerks and jumping the shark with blair witch project. No \\"homemade\\" type movie will ever grace the big screen. Heck it even inspired me and my friends to attempt a movie, but only so much you can do with super-8 without being crap.I highly recommend the companion book to Slackers. Throw it on the back of toilet or coffee table, very enlighting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"My review is based on the first half of this movie because I was fortunate enough to fall asleep halfway through. In short this movie is a montage of people whom in real life I would either run away from or if it wasn't practical tell them to please shut up. I suppose people closer to the 'scene' would say I just don't get it and they're probably right but I don't want to. On the other hand if you like listening to people prattle on about Madonna's pap smear this may be your film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget your Kevin Smith movies...","review":"Slacker is the ultimate statement of what it was to be a twenty something in the early nineties.

It's really just a continuous, occasionally amusing monologue that simply drifts from one character to another.Linklater went on to do some legitimately good films, but this one, his third film, hardly deserves the massive study edition that this Criterion Collection edition is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect anything like 'Clerks'","review":"I rented this movie after reading that Kevin Smith was inspired by it to shoot Clerks. I'm a big fan of the dialogue, characters and originality of Clerks, so I thought Slacker would be worth a look.

There wasn't any real plot and leaves the viewer wondering about the protagonists pyhrric victory. The movies self-defeating concept of bashing centralized buisness may make the audience question the director's motive: Is their a real message in this movie, or is Linkletter just complaining about his innability to succeed in the social world? \\"Slacker\\" is a poor attempt to blame society's problems on large industries. Maybe the Director should try observing his surroundings before turning on his camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'D GIVE IT NO STARS, IF THAT WAS AN OPTION.","review":"This movie looked like some dropout film student's attempt to make himself feel better.

The plot is used as a tool to examine what ails our society. \\"The Legend That Was Earth\\" and \\"Thrice Upon a Time\\" are good examples of this technique. The characters are for the most part very interesting. Zambendorf is in constant conflict with Massey, until they realize that their real goals coincide(i.e., preventing corporate greed from exploiting and destroying an alien race).

It's like the writers just had another idea, and didn't even bother to go back and revised what they wrote before. Things just don't make any sense.

I almost wander if someone has an ax to grind with someone associated with the movie to rate this so low here on Amazon.Fortunately this is a movie that stands on it's own merits. I watched the movie last night all the way through (180 minutes). I bought it today. Netflix rates this movie about 4.25 stars, which is what I would rate it if you could \\"cut a star\\" on Amazon or Netflix.I admit it that I love things Arthurian and this movie did not disappoint me.

Didn't King Aurther die? Where is Merlin's wife? Not to mention the character of Merlin is highly downplayed to make way for Jack, his apprentice. Sam Neil is one of my favorite actors and could have really saved this movie if given a better script. The effects are cheesy and the acting is terrible. It's almost as if this is an entirely different version of Merlin played by the same actor.

Well, either those reviewers were misquoted, or I live in an alternative universe. The plot is difficult to follow, the acting varies from bad to ridiculous and the dialogue is amateurish. On the plus side, John Reardon as Merlin's apprentice, is pretty, Miranda Richardson seems to be on the verge of cracking up and Sam Neil is, well, Sam Neil.

The short archy essays ran for years in a major big-city newspaper (I forget which one...Chicago, I believe), and were beloved for their subtle humor and sharp satire. Because he's a cockroach, at home alone in the nighttime newspaper office, archy has typewriters at his disposal, but no way to type, other than hurling himself head down upon each key. Thus, his poetry has no punctuation and no capital letters, but it is grand poetry nonetheless.As a longtime fan of fine humor, I regard this small book, and its sequels, as valuable gems.

I received these shirts and they fit perfectly after washing and the fabric was a very good weight. So I ordered 4 more shirts feeling confident I had finally found the perfect t-shirt. WRONG.The next shipment of supposedly identical t-shirts were too tight and made of fabric of a slightly less weight. How could this be? I looked at the tagless printing on the inside collar and found that the shirts that fit perfectly were made in Honduras while the shirts from the second order were made in Haiti. A good product is important, but consistency in the products you sell is as important. I will return these shirts and not buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disapointed when I received this shirt.

We use it with the Humzinger hummingbird feeder in the summer (easily the best hummingbird feeder we have ever used) and it helps to keep the feeder shaded in sun and dry when it rains.

I encountered The Way I was Made and had the opportunity to read through it. It was refreshing to see the progression of a worshipper and songwriter and realize that successful people are made over the long-haul not overnight.Mr. Tomlin shares many insights into his songs, past and worship style. He also gives lots of excellent tips for building a solid spiritual foundation that should benefit any worshipper or worship leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Chris Tomlin is one of the thankfully increasing artists who place their emphasis on giving God glory rather than writing songs (and books) that focus on themselves. While the book is about Tomlin's call to become the song writer and musician he is today, it's also about the God who was always at work in his life guiding him and directing him to where he is today.

Large dandelions came out of the ground with ease. Every now and then I would come across a smaller dandelion in hard or mossy soil that just didn't want to come out of the ground and took extra effort. It was one of these that caused it to crack. I had maybe an hour of use before this happened. This tool did leave sizable holes behind. I don't know yet if it pulled enough of the dandelion to keep it from growing back. A better technique would have been to spray the dandelions with a grass friendly weed killer and removed them a day or two later but I was so excited to have a new toy I couldn't wait. I went to my local hardware store and found an all metal competitor that looked like it would last longer. Unforunately it doesn't grasp them as well as this one did and some times leaves part of the plants behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"UpRoot Weeder","review":"My wife and I both find this to be a usefull tool.

The band 311 has been creating music like this for several years now. I do think that this album is much better than their prior album. Some of the lyrics contradict themselves though. This is confusing to me. I think that \\"come correct\\" is a made for radio song in that it copies what is currently being aired. Less than half of the songs on this album are decent.

Singer Mike Busse in particular brings energy and extraordinary vocals to this cd. The lyrics are all positive, not violent and still cool, which is fairly revolutionary in today's musical world. You have to give ups to anyone that can write such excellent words, put it with music that spread good vibes and is also rocking hard core, all at the same time. These boys have done it. I recommend this to anyone who listens to Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, but urge everyone to give it a try as Chronic Future defines themselves seperately from any other band out there.

The album I believe to be filled with songs showing a strong woman living in the 90's. The songs range from either knowing you'll survive heartache (Bye Bye, I Know A Heartache, No Time For Tears), to surrendering (Cover Me, Because You Love Me), to affirming one's self (I'm Alright, Stand Beside Me), and more. The album was a large success, the album's first three singles (Bye Bye, I'm Alright, Stand Beside Me) all hit #1. Jo Dee covers the Dottie West hit Lesson in Leavin' which suits Jo Dee's personality perfectly, that was also a hit, but broke the chain of #1's.

It has everything that a good movie needs: a good plot, action, drama and, unlike most movies these days, this one is suitable for the entire family. It's about a lawyer, played by Melissa Gilbert, who discovers that her father was married to a rodeo cowgirl, Maggie Mae Jarrett, before he married her mother.

I think this new song is a real gem, and I agree that it's his best since \\"Fastlove\\". This song reels George back in from the Freeeek / Shoot The Dog hardened sound to his dance pop style which really suits his voice much better. The fact that the song pretty much puts it all out there says a ton, and I love his lyrical ability to state what has happened or is happening in his life very clearly. The bridge of this song is an excellent anthem statement to any young person coming out or anyone facing major changes in their life.If the rest of the album is this good, I simply can't wait!Bravo George for being who you are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, practical and demandingly honest","review":"Bishop Untener goes straight to the heart of what a preacher should be doing. He makes his readers take account of genuine feedback from 'folk in the pew' and offers practical solutions which respond to their comments but which also encourage the preacher to grow, develop and improve.The material is set out in short punchy chapters which are easy to read but difficult to forget. Above all, the reader will come away sharing the author's deep admiration for the flow of God's Word through a well-prepared preacher in full control of a well-prepared homily.This short book can upturn the bad habits of even the most experienced preacher and can teach the novice preacher some early profound principles. I cannot commend it too highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful resource","review":"This book is a quick and easy read, filled with countless useful suggestions and tips.

It hardly makes any noises as it rolls across the floor and hence he is less interested in it as a plaything. Does anybody know if there is a difference in the noisemaking between the 4.5 inch one and the 7 inch one? If there is not supposed to be a difference then perhaps the one I received it defective.

His was a generation that dealt with how the world would be put back together after the most devastating war in history. His service includes questioning Nazi prisoners as part of the US Strategic Bombing Survey (with his friend JK Galbraith), encouraging the formation of the Common Market (Jean Monnet), and guidance in the most contentious periods of the Cold War.The author's anecdotes are invaluable. An accomplished man, he recounts intimate views of luminaries in years of service matched only by his own admirable accomplishment. The latter included early principled opposition (and resignation) over the Vietnam War.This memoir is a pleasure to read: the author is a genuine American hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should probably look elsewhere","review":"I found this book to be weird quiet frankly.

I didn't find anything \\"Pro\\", as the name implies, or advanced with the book. It's a broad introductory text only.

What I do to prevent this is: open the trunk of the car, pull the string that's attached to the claw from the inside of the car, all the way back, then lay the string over the side of the trunk and close it. Lay the rest of the string inside the truck. This prevents the claw from popping out at all.

Wally, er, Bill Myers, has a wild imagination that he lets run free in this series! Each book addresses some problem or weakness pretty common to most of us, and then Myers has Wally take it to an extreme to make a point. Wally wants to be a writer, so part of each book is his writing a superhero story, usually science fiction, with events based on what just happened to him, only turning out the way he wished it had instead of reality. But even Wally's reality can be pretty far out. A large bully is after Wally at summer camp, and then he ends up in a canoe on a river with the guy, and they both learn lessons about fear, trust, and God. It is hard to turn the pages fast enough when you are laughing that hard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series","review":"My 10 year old daughter LOVES these books!!!

I tried to read this hoping it could get better, but the writing is dreadful. I quit half way through and wasted every moment.

Now I can tell by the first page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Start","review":"This is not a zany (a word actually used to describe the book in a review) Florida mystery yarn filled with interesting characters. It tries to be but doesn't come close. The author thinks putting his characters in an interesting location is enough work and his job is done. As a result nothing very interesting happens and absolutely none of it is amusing. Can't believe the publisher came back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Florida mystery","review":"Want a comfort read? Bahamarama is a summery romp between Florida and the Bahamas.Zack Chasteen, an ex-NFL player who was framed by smugglers and has just finished doing time as the book begins, is a likeable sleuth with a delightful sense of humor. The supporting cast, especially Boggy, Pederson, and Nixon, are the kinds of people you run into in the Bahamas and Florida and nowhere else. Chasteen, just trying to get reunited with his sweetie, Barbara, after those two lonely years in the pen, encounters murderers, kidnappers, tourists, too much rum, palm trees, and a hurricane. When it's all sorted out, Zack turns the tables on the villains, and it's the bad guys' turn go to jail.Okay, there are cliches and plot holes along the way. Okay, I figured out whodunit before the halfway point. But Bob Morris's voice is compelling and could only have come from a guy who has spent many years in Florida and loves the place very much. You will smell the coconut and conch, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect Caribbean mystery","review":"I must admit, I am a bit of a Caribbean/Florida mystery book fan and love to escape to the tropics on the page. Bahamarama is the perfect book to do that with. Bob Morris has captured the feel of the islands in his fictional Harbour Island (I'm sure I've been there...) and believable colorful characters in Zach, his ex-Dolphin main character, Lord Downey and Pederson, the refreshingly intelligent inspector investigating a murder. Morris has obviously spent many days in the islands and his love of their nature and beauty leaps from the page. I enjoyed every bit of Bahamarama and am starting his next one, Bermuda Schwartz, tonight.Victoria AllmanSEAsoned - A Chef's Journey with Her Captain"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sun, Beach, Pina Coladas and Kidnapping","review":"First off, let me say this is a great fun read and once you begin you better be prepared to read, because you will get hooked. I finished this book in about two days and it made me want to read more by Bob Morris.The story revolves around Zach Chasteen, an ex Football player for Miami, who found himself in jail after he was framed for a deal gone bad with some Latin drug lords. Zach is pretty hard bolied and down to earth and his only passions in life are his girlfriend and his boat. When his girlfriend winds up missing on a photo shoot in the Bahamas, Zach finds himself entangled in a game of cat and mouse with the kidnappers.The plot is okay and perhaps like me, you'll be able to figure out the ending before it happens. However, the characters are so good you'll keep reading anyway. Take a vacation and enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me more, please","review":"I can't believe I didn't read BAHAMARAMA until two years after it came out. The good thing about that was it enabled me to immediately jump into JAMAICA ME DEAD, the author's second Caribbean mystery novel, which is a fine followup to this one.If you like tropical islands, taut storytelling, wry humor and heroes who are more than cardboard figures, then you'll love BAHAMARAMA.I just wish Bob Morris would write faster.

Then there is, \\"2 See Me Is 2 Love Me\\", the music just will not allow me to keep still. I know I am jamming when this song plays. \\"Everythings Gonna Be Alright\\", Is soul stirring. So much so, that I find myself repeating this selection whenever things get me down;it lifts me right back up. My favorite of all is \\"Just Be Good To Me\\", this song tells it all. It says everthing I wanted to tell my significant other. I used it for the theme and dance selection for my Anniversary. Last but not least, \\"Da Bomb\\", I am Da Bomb and do not mind others knowing about my fake fingernails or hair pieces.

The puzzle pieces were incompletely cut, so that I had to pull them apart, and the cardboard backing tore and peeled. Every piece was able to fit into many other pieces, so it was impossible to say where it definitely belonged. After three days, we were not able to complete the border, and I could not put together the one figure in a distinctive costume. I not only quit, but recycled the puzzle so that no one else would suffer, trying to work it. I will never buy Clementoni again!

I acquired this film based on the positive reviews, including endorsements as a \\"family movie.\\" However, after watching it, I would not recommend it for young viewers, or for anyone who wants to avoid indecency. There is quite a bit of profanity as well as a bedroom scene involving an unmarried couple. Compared to many movies, this may be mild, but overall this greatly detracts from what could have been wholesome family viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow film attempting to be \\"deep\\"","review":"I'm sorry if I am insulting the other reviewers, but this movie is transparently stupid as can be! As the one battered reviewer who dared saying why he didn't like this movie, this totally has that awful \\"Made for TV\\" aftertaste and the acting is awkward and unnatural, even Mr. Poitier couldn't rescue this film.

It has that \\"Made for TV\\" feel about it. Sidney Poitier was the only element of this show worth 5-stars; however, the plot and other actors were so cheesy that dragged the rating down for me to a 2. Only 2 because of SP, if he weren't in it, it would be a 0!However, as the other reviewer stated, this may be a good film for kids to watch with the family.

The great late Laurindo Almeida plays acoustic and electric guitar on this collection of bossa tunes. Best cuts are \\"Um Abraco No Bonfa\\" and \\"Manha De Carnaval.\\" Also \\"Choro For People In Love\\" is a pretty slow tune. This is a must-have for all bossa lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Irene Kral for sure!","review":"There is no doubt that Laurindo's guest vocalist on the two tracks \\"Winter Moon\\" and \\"Old Guitaron\\" is the late, great Irene Kral. If this album is your only exposure to the beauty of her voice, then you're missing one of the greatest female vocalists in 20th century jazz. To hear Irene at her best, check out the best albums released under her own name such as \\"The Band And I\\" and \\"Kral Space.\\" They are both available on CD and both are terrific. Clint Eastwood had the fine taste to honor Irene by including two cuts from yet another great album called \\"Better Than Anything\\" on his sountrack to \\"The Bridges of Madison County.\\" Now if only someone would have the wisdom to remaster and release a CD of the album \\"Steveireno!\\" that she recorded on United Artists with the late Steve Allen in 1959......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar From Ipanema","review":"This is an almost forgotten classic of unpretentious soft evening Brazilian mood music. Almeida near his best. A nice mix of instrumental tracks with a couple of songs song sung by an unknown (to me) silky smooth female vocalist that puts you in the heart of Rio on a warm summer night. The vocal songs evoke a classic small cabaret atmosphere and the guitar tracks are inspired versions of classic Brazilian songs. I've put this album on back when I got the old \\"record\\" from my brother-in-law and was always asked what album was playing and where did I get it. Nice way to unwind after a long day at work or a hard rock concert.

Unfortunately, everyone else in the theatre was probably 13 years old, and the jokes sailed over thier heads. It is a biting high school satire that has quite a few funny points.

The development of some of them isn't done very well, for example Mena Suvari's character doesn't speak until about 20 minutes in, despite lurking in the background almost from the start.It's easy to see why Bring It On won the battle of cheerleader comedies when both film were released."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a surprise?

Their plans to pull off a successful robbery and getaway seem pretty smooth until cheerleader-wannabe Marla Sokoloff shows up and threatens to throw a wrench in the whole thing. Most of it is uninspired, and the messages about giving teens more opportunities to better run their lives is wasted in this films' irresponsible attitude.

Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it again!","review":"This movie at first felt wrong somehow, the voices didn't fit the characters and the songs didn't seem to fit into the story-line, but after I watched it again and again I grew to love how each of the chracters moved into the story, how they really grew to be the only voices i would havde wanted for them. I have been looking for the soundtrack for a long time now! And I am happy to find it here. I can't seem to get some of the songs out of my head! i can't wait until it comes!!!!

The story takes place in the time of King Arthur and the knights of the round table. When King Arthur's legendary sword is stolen, a spirited girl takes it upon herself to find it. Along the way she meets same strange friends.The songs are catchy and fun to sing along to. Celine Deon is one of the voices heard on this great soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teen's Review","review":"1. Though the country twist somewhat ruins the song, Rimes does an acceptable job. 2/52. He sounds like he's going to burst into tears throughout the entire song! 3/53. Celine does a beautiful job on what happens to be one of my favorite songs of all time. 5/54. Though a bit corny with the whole song and dance number, the music is well done. 4/55. A beautifully sung song, but it just doesn't seem to build up to anything. 4.5/56. Beautiful music combined with beautiful voices. 5/57. He's basically shouting the entire song, but the sinister feel is definitely there. 3/58. White does an amazing job with this ode to independence. 5/59. Not exactly the best technically, but the humor makes up for the sub-standard singing. 4/513. I'd never heard a Neo Operatic version before; VERY nicely done. 5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Brothers should stick to shorts!","review":"At least if this movie and its music are any indication, Warner Brothers should stay out of the feature business and just do what it does best - TV. The songs are flat and uninspiring, and I can't stand Garrett's voice. And why did they have to jump on the Celine Dion/LeeAnn Rimes bandwagon?! I think Warner Brothers could have made a better movie and a better soundtrack had they worked on it a little longer and spent some more money. They were obviously looking for tuneful, memorable songs, but Quest for Camelot misses the mark. Don't see the film, don't buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Great CD","review":"This is a teriffic CD. I am a pretty big fan of Celine Dion and LeAnn Rimes and I believe that thier performances on this album are really great. The Corrs and Bryan White also did very well. The music goes along with the movie's situations wonderfully; like \\"On my Father's Wings\\" goes with Kayley's dream of becoming more than what she is and Celine's \\"The Prayer\\" goes along with a mother's prayer that her child will be safe and find their way through hard times. Anyway, this is a great Soundtrack and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read...","review":"This book was written a long time ago, you can tell.

A must for every Bee Gees fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bee Gees are so much more than just disco...","review":"When this box set was released, a lot of reviewers and critics were asking \\"why have a box set for a disco group?\\". Naturally, this sent me into coniptions. The Bee Gees were making great music LONG before the \\"disco sucks\\" thing kicked in. This set is very comprehensive, even including songs from the godawful Staying Alive film (which Robin refers to, quite amusingly, the \\"Rocky in legwarmers\\" movie), as well as solo material from Robin. It has all their early hits, including New York Mining Disaster 1941, Holiday, To Love Somebody, Massachusetts, as well as the disco songs (which do not suck). The Bee Gees loved R & B quite a bit, and the songs Jive Talkin', Nights on Broadway, and the passionate, amazing Fanny (Be Tender with my Love) really reflect that. The Bee Gees made great pop music, and yes, they do deserve to have a 4 CD box set dedicated to them. This is definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Left in my Dreams","review":"I love the dream scape and the methodology of interpretation so I was excited to get this lil diddy.......until it arrived, not only does it NOT cover the most basic of dreams ie colors, people, places, things, it does little to provide more then cursory insights which left me dumbfounded and exasperated.

All we see from Rimes now is pop--and there's her personality problem. Her \\"Fame\\" has made her think she can shut herself out to everyon except stars...and she has become amazingly concited.If you're looking for a beautiful young voice in Country music, try Lila McCann--she stays true to country.. and people She's a down to earth person, and... well, hasn't tried to cross over into \\"Pop\\".So, try Lila--and leave everything of LeAnn's after \\"Blue\\" and \\"The Early Years\\" in the dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, Yuck, & Yuck","review":"I bought this CD THINKING I would like it, I was wrong.

Unique voice and lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORGET THIS!","review":"This could easily have been the cd that killed Leanne's career. Already you can see that with this cd she wanted to break away from country. Was it her father's choice or hers? Judging from her current new cd \\"Broken Angel\\", i'd say it was her decision. Sittin On Top Of The World is a forgettable bore. It sounds like leftover adult comtemporary stuff. And for her to end up doing cover tunes of stuff like Jann Arden's classic \\"Insensitive\\", and Prince's \\"Purple Rain\\" is horrendous! Neither one of those songs are country, ESPECIALLY not Purple Rain. I wonder, did Prince actually give her permission to do her embarrassing version? What a cheesefest her version is. It has to be THE lowest point in her career. Avoid this cd at all costs. It's about as country as Metallica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew","review":"Please quit emailing me reminders that you now have this adultress' c.d. available. I'll never buy any of her music again. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"LeAnn's worst CD so far","review":"What happened to the melodic singing that I heard on LeAnn's first CD, Blue? Where are the easiness and naturalness when she sings? They certainly aren't in this CD. In her songs, she forces the notes out so hard that it sounds really unnatural and very hard to listen to. Most of the upbeat songs are okay, but the slow songs are boring! Her voice and the way she sings do not sound good on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS AWESOME!!!!","review":"IT WAS REALLY A GOOD CD BUT SERIOUSLY I AM A HUGE FAN BUT SHE REALLY NEEDS TO USE SOME OF HER OWN SONGS!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A blueprint for bad music","review":"If a singer wants to know how to make a bad album then they could listen to this CD.

What do ya'll mean, giving her one star because she doesn't sing country? She isn't bound to any honky-tonk songs because of her first album! I think LeAnn Rimes made this CD into the best it could possibly be, and her voice is strong and beautiful on every song. Some are more pop-like while others are more slow and country-like. If you've enjoyed LeAnn Rimes before, or are simply looking for a fun CD, try this! I admit its not her best album, but it is entertaining to listen to and is definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"I've been a huge fan of Leann Rimes ever since she came out with One Way Ticket, but I really don't like this cd. I felt like it was a waste of my money. The only songs that I ended up liking was commitment and looking through your eyes. Commitment was pop/country and looking through your eyes leans more towards adult contemporary/pop.The rest of the songs seem to be a mix of old & contemporary country, it didn't have much pop in them so its not something that really interested me much because I'm more into pop/country. I was also disappointed with the fact that there are no lyrics listed on any of the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better albums out there","review":"LeAnn Rimes used to be really popular where I live until she came out with this album. LeAnn has done remakes before but we thought she would stop. Unfortunatley she ruins \\"Insensitive\\", \\"Sittin On Top Of The World\\" and like others have mentioned here \\"Purple Rain.\\" The new songs aren't much better so I'll have to give this album 1 star, though I wish I could give it none."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful CD","review":"I liked some of LeAnn's earlier work so I listened to this album with high hopes. However, after the first few songs I was dissapointed. The album doesn't sound like LeAnn and some of the songs are too horrible to even think about. LeAnn doesn't write her own songs and she sings loudly too often, she doesn't use restraint. Do not buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CD should never have been released","review":"LeAnn Rimes should have found better songs before releasing this CD.

The new songs are even worse so just avoid this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"LeAnn Rimes is going nowhere with this CD. The songs and the way she sings them do not compare to the rest of the singers out there.

Shame on you LeAnn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad effort","review":"LeAnn is putting out CD's too fast and choosing horrible songs. Her voice is always loud on the albums, her father can'turn the volume down on the production. The song \\"Purple Rain\\" is a Prince classic but LeAnn has ruined it with her version and this album has ruined my opinion of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"This album is not near as good as I expected it to be. She needs to get some original material. She's got a voice for the kind of hard core country like in Blue but she wondered away from that track trying to do stuff that her voice is not fit for. Keep trying LeAnn...you're forgetting your roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEANN RIMES COULD OF DONE BETTER!!!","review":"I think LeAnn has a good voice BUT you wouldn't know it in this album! This album had a poor taste in selection of songs along with her doing a horrible job at singing them! I was VERY disappointed in this album!! I felt like she was trying for something different in this album but boy did she failed! You can tell she's young and still not sure of what type of sound she wants. This album is not anything to brag about or to waste your money on!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album doesn't do her voice justice","review":"LeAnn sings with a clarity and range in her voice that has not been heard in quite a while in country. But her emotions definitely come through the most on traditional songs, like the terrific \\"Blue.\\" Instead, though, LeAnn's album includes too many boring pop songs and errors in her choices of remakes. The whole album is very overproduced, and the only good original songs are \\"These Arms Of Mine,\\" \\"Nothing New Under The Moon,\\" and \\"Rock Me.\\" Too many annoying echoes are heard, also. It's not that the remakes are bad songs, but the original artists like Prince use more appropriate arrangements and have more appropriate voices for them. For the most part, the lyrics on the album have gotten worse compared to her album Blue. I would only recommend buying this album if you are a determined fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lacked vocal abilities!","review":"It really was a horrible CD. I think she is using country music. If you listen to her she trys not to sound country, and she tries to go for that pop look, but it doesn't work for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad album","review":"I don't care if LeAnn chooses to mix genres in this album. I don't care which songs are pop and which are country. The point is, her voice is terrible, which makes the songs sound awful. The melodies in the ballads are boring, although the upbeat songs aren't as bad. But she forces her voice to belt out the songs, which sounds unnatural. LeAnn Rimes is going downhill. Each album has gotten worse. Hopefully, she can redeem herself with her next album. Hopefully, her voice would have improved by then."},{"rating":"1","title":"sittin on top of the world and smothering it","review":"Does she ever stop? I mean, she could scar children for life. Calling her a country singer totally disses country music. If pop wants her, they can have her. She sounds like a wounded animal that needs to be put out of their misery. And does she think of any songs on her own? Or will she continue to discrace other singers by redoing their songs with her horrible voice. I pity those who like her singing, for they do not know true music, but only yelling, bloodcurdling screeches that come out of Leann's um...voice?box."},{"rating":"2","title":"way to go leann!","review":"great album overall good harmonies and nice pop songs but was purple rain really nessassary? other then that good album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is amoung my favorite albums","review":"I think this is one of her best albums, tied with \\"blue\\". I wore it out and plan to purchase another. I or my sister together have every one of Leann's albums and sittin' on top of the world is better than her latest release, \\"Leann Rimes\\". 'Undeniable' and 'more than anyone deserves' are my personal favorites on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the Money Honey","review":"Blue was the best CD, of it's type, that I have ever owned. Those to follow have been,in my opinion, more inclined to making money rather than music. I have listened to this CD (have not bought one since Blue) and it is el stinko.

Even though I've never heard Prince's version of \\"Purple Rain\\", I'm sure she suceeded in destroying the song's atmosphere. I have been very disappointed with LeAnn's constant crossing from the pop world to the country, and agree with those critics who hold a low opinion of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this album","review":"I thought that LeAnn rimes would be a good singer and have good songs but the critics were right.

Children of the Corny 666: Isaac's Return is another crapfest. If you asked me what the movie was all about, I verily cannot be more clueless. As much I hate John Franklin, the sight of him being a midget puppet is deserving and funny.

Here is the basic idea, the children form the first are grown up. In the mean time the daughter of one of the origional children returns to find her birth mother. The birth Mother is played by Nancy Allen for a whole 15 20 minutes. Issac also returns to raise hell.

It is only appropriate that bad acting be accompanied by bad dialogue, don't ya think? There was some unintended comic relief in this messy film. Guess what folks, Isaac returns and he is a midget with a whiney voice. I almost felt bad for Isaac for having been in a coma for so many years only to survive as a silly looking buffoon.

Yes, that old chestnut - an international terrorist network, a fiercely loyal American good guy etc. etc. etc. Cheap, shoddy cash-in. I'd give it no stars if I could.

NO terrists were not in the novel and it was hit by a Tidel wave in the novel. But I still like the Novel better. But if you don't belive me.

I ordered this book on the strength of the acclaim from other readers. For the first several chapters I really enjoyed the read, with the biting satire and ultra hip characters. But the book lost steam mid way through, and was a bit of a chore to finish. Frankly the lectures on the nature of religion and verbal viruses were incredibly dull. It ruined the momentum created by the fast paced beginning. Also the humor virtually (pun intended) disappeared at the same time. I kept anticipating another amusing vignette but it never happened. As in many science fiction or fantasy hack jobs, the characters never rose above their stereotypic introductions. My advice is to check it out in your local library. When you get to the section involving the Librarian, if you still like it, then fork over the bucks for your own copy. Me, I'm rereading Hyperion."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPOILER ALERT: The ending blows","review":"For the most part this was a decent book. Stephenson is a better writer, in my opinion, than William Gibson based on what I've read in Neuromancer. He makes a fairly interesting plot that weaves Sumerian mythology with computer hacking, and I liked his vision of an ultra-libertarian society. But if his handling of male/female interactions is any indication, Stephenson must be one socially inept dweeb (Again, he's still better than Gibson in this regard).Honestly, his treatment of the story's main female character sounded like nerdy masturbation material at times (I mean, who has an orgasm THAT quickly?). Furthermore, the ending was so abrupt it seemed like Stephenson just gave up. He may as well have punctuated the last sentence of the book by blowing his brains out all over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not about the book, but about the Kindle edition","review":"I give the book 5 stars, as I love the style & the humour. What I give 1 star is the Kindle edition compared to the printed book. Did this book not exist as an electronic file prior to the Kindle version? I find that hard to belive, but nevertheless, Amazon must have thought so because the Kindle edition has very obviously been scanned & OCR'd from the printed page, and the OCR software they used must have come from the same year when Stephenson wrote the book longhand on paper, apparently.There are many, many OCR errors in the text, particularly misinterpretation of rn as m, which often makes non-words, or, worse, makes actual words which make no sense, or, even worse, makes actual words that change the meaning of a sentence and bring your reading to a grinding halt.Amazon; if you must OCR books to Kindle, spare a few hours to proof-read them. This is my first bad Kindle experience. Very amateur electronic publishing job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible kindle version","review":"I'd read the book before as a paperback but thought I'd get the kindle version to reread it. It was a bit of a waste of money.It looks as though it was converted from the book using bad OCR software. The text keeps naming the main character (Hiro) as \\"Hire\\". Whenever an interstate road is abbreviated as, for example, I-405 this appears in the kindle text as 1-405. These are just the most frequent mistakes, there are many, many more. While it doesn't make the text unreadable it does lead to several double takes which really breaks the flow of reading the novel.All it would have taken would be for someone to proof read the text for five minutes and they would have spotted at least one of these errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book--ever.","review":"I read this book regularly.

The authors are making a fortune on Kindle books. I know, I see my credit card every month. But that ends now, not just with this author but some of those other blown up heads that charge even more!!! I am not stupid. I would rather go to the library.

For the past two hours I have been trying to read it, to get past the intro chapters that most books have that set the story up, I finally made it to page 31 before just giving up. I really really wanted to get into this but I just couldnt. The writer seems to be writing just to type something up. The descriptions are flowering and wordy. You do not get caught up in or enjoy the extravagant techy jargon that just comes across as made up. For me it was as entertaining and reading a technical manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, for Christ's Sake.","review":"\\"Liked Neuromancer? You'll love Snowcrash!\\" I should have known better. The guy who uttered that recommendation was an idiot. Snowcrash features everything I despise about bad science fiction. First off, there's the high \\"geek\\" factor of technolust, where the author can't help gloating about his knowledge of computers. Second, I . . . I just can't go on. If you're looking for more Neuromancer, don't read this book. Read Cormac McCarthy or Tim O'brien instead; like Gibson, they are great writers first, genre writers second. Stephenson is a slightly clever SF hack, and that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your time with this book","review":"This book is full of fancy terminology and imaginary description, but that simply hides the fact that this book has no good plot behind it.

Read the first chapter. If you aren't at LEAST chuckling aloud at times (I personally howled at \\"That Was Stale\\" and \\"Smooth Move Ex-Lax\\"), then give it up- you must already be dead and just ain't fallen over yet... Some of the most biting satire on our \\"popular\\" culture I have ever come across can be found lurking, like buried treasure, in the pages of this quite astounding novel. I have found myself returning to this book every year, like some demented pilgrim, discovering anew on each reading some gem of wit and/or malice to my infinite amusement. This combined with Stepehenson's laser-sharp prose and absolutely insane characters give this book an honored place on my shelf. Sell the cat if you must to afford a copy, but by all means... Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tad overrated.","review":"I've heard very little other than high praise for this book, but it didn't work completely for me.The book is filled with interesting characters who will have you cheering, biting your nails and /or hissing in hatred, and they reside in the most completely developed cyberpunk world since Gibson's Neuromancer.But the impetus behind the plot, and the author's polemical explanation of the theory that is the germ of the plot were flat and unbelievable to me.SPOILER ALERT:This book also ends at a climactic point and has no real denoument, as far as I'm concerned. The final \\"crash\\" of _Snow Crash_ echoed hollowly in my head as I hoped for a little more resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"a post-post modern masterpiece","review":"Snow crash is an avalache of a novel, which picks you up and overwhelm s you with it's mix of cool gadgets, summerian mythology, fast action and names like Hiro Protagonist or Vitaly Chernobyl.In my opinion this is the best book by Stephenson, 'cause here he doesn't let his interest in the detailes of the world get into the way of the actual story (as he sadly did in Diamond Age, for example). The story defies description in a few words, and moreover, you don't want to read what it's about.But it starts with a pizza delivery man who works for mafia (and mafia here is official), but who is also an uber hacker.And for his antagonist - how about a guy, with an a-bomb strapped to his bike, and a chip in his head - if he dies, the bomb goes off.Mixing \\"Matrix\\"-style action (allthough it was written years before \\"Matrix\\") and \\"Da Vinci Code\\"-like revelations about history and religion this book will delight fans of cyber punk and other readers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"Usually I read 4-5 books at a time because neither can hold my attention long enough. This is not the case with Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, which pulls the reader into the eerie world that we can relate to as we discover the wonders and fears of virtual reality. Mafia, computer dorks, greatly developed characters, and fast plot surrounded by new fresh philosophies about cyberspace and cold war are what makes this novel a must read. You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the read, but easy to get lost in.","review":"Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash is a shining beacon in the world of cyperpunk novels. He twists the world of thr future around to make it dark, as per the formula, but also very interesting and at points humourous even. I enjoyed Snow Crash quite a bit, but I enjoyed Zodiac, also by Stephenson, so much more. Definitely read Snow Crash, but check out his other works are well.Snow Crash does do a wonderful job in its portrayals of the main characters, but Stephenson sometimes gets lost in the wonders of the world that he has created it. A tighter focus on characters and plotting would have served the book well."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Haven't Read This Yet, It's Not Too Late...","review":"Ten years ago, Neal Stephenson wrote Snow Crash, a book that is still considered a definitive work in the field of Virtual Reality Multi-User Worlds. This is the book that has and will continue to shape developments in VR; it is unlikely that you will find anyone in the VR field that has not read and been influenced by this book.Unfortunately, this book is only available now in a larger print format in paperback at a substantially higher price than many people are willing to pay... you won't find a trade paperback for sale that is brand new because that version seems to be out of print. I know because I've looked. <P..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just wasn't exciting.","review":"After struggling over what to buy next, I reached for Snow Crash. Frankly, I thought the story was kind of boring. I loved the idea of relating ancient Sumerian myth to modern society but the story, that is built around it, is weak. There was no desciptive writing anywhere. I couldn't wait to finish so I could move on to another book. And the ending - its bad. The whole \\"raft\\" sequence was confusing and dull. However, with the wide range of reviews given, you'll just have to read it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud!","review":"Though technicaly interesting, I thought the book followed the old rock and roll motto: if you can't play it good, play it loud. It was loud. I thoroughly enjoyed parts of the book. I found it too raunchy for my taste. I also find that authors who re-define facts, and draw their historical/technical advice seemingly from the detractors and critics more than a bit ANOYING. I would best sum it up by saying I forced my way through parts of the book to experience \\"the definitive cyper-punk novel\\", and in the end threw the book away rather than pass it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's clever, but not good.","review":"As an idea Snow Crash is fun, inventive, and exceedingly clever. As a book Snow Crash is frustrating, condescending, and extremely dull.Stephenson is talented at creating interesting plots, but he proves himself to be truly awful at writing. This is a common malady in the Science Fiction genre, but that shouldn't make it okay.All characters are as one dimensional as paper dolls, action scenes are a consistently muddled mess, the story never invokes any sort of emotion towards it's protagonists except apathy, and the author strives so hard to make everything \\"super cool\\" that you'll feel like you're back in junior high.I'm sorry to give this book a bad rating because it really is based on a fun if completely implausible concept, but the execution of that idea is absolutely inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"While Neil Stephenson shows some promise in this book, which will later show up as full-blown talent in Cryptonomicon, this is one of his works that is best avioded. The characters are two-dimensional, the setting is poorly thought out, and the \\"science\\" behind the eponymous drug and the mysterious illness related to it is no contrived and patently impossible as to cause a reader physical pain. There are some cute moments and good ideas in this book, but not enough to redeem it. This is one of Stephenson's earlier works, and it shows, do yourself a favor, skip this and move onto his later writings, which are much more polished."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY Overrated","review":"i love sci fi. i'd tried to read this twice & just couldn't get traction. when i finished edelman's infoquake trilogy i wanted more so tried again after advice from a friend that this is more accessible than cryptonomicon. so i slogged through the pizza delivery bits. i am giving this story 1 star for vision & 1 star for the first two segments about semi autonomous guard units. the virus/sumerian subplot i found tediously executed - an author with more talent and/or patience would have told the story without needing pages and pages of direct exposition that saps the book of its remaining momentum (which had been flagging for some time).i wanted to like this book but it is so uneven with odd flashes of bitterness misplaced even in such deep satire that i will pass on the rest of this authors work. if you like anime you might find this visually rewarding as the descriptions are very vivid. but if you like a coherent plot and consistency in characters give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Computer Fiction Novel","review":"This book was published in the early 90's, and really captures the style of early-90's sci-fi and computer fiction.

I enjoy many different authors within the genre, but if I could choose only one, it would be Neal Stephenson, without a doubt in my mind. He has several outstanding books, and I've read his entire canon. With that being said, Snow Crash is what started me off as a Neal Stephenson fan. It is a classic cyberpunk novel that just doesn't get old."},{"rating":"2","title":"World-Building at Its Best","review":"Neal Stephenson masterfully does what good science fiction is supposed to do: show a futuristic, somewhat plausible, quasi-dystopia, and populate it with solid characters who interact with that world.Snow Crash is a great, entertaining read. If nothing else, it is solid entertainment.However, like Stephenson's other blockbuster, The Diamond Age: A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, Snow Crash goes way beyond pure entertainment. He is similar to Orson Scott Card in his ability to see where technology is taking culture and then to take that technology several steps further, showing a likely end result.I recommend Snow Crash for fans of science fiction, good literature, technology, and even Biblical languages (you'll have to read the book to understand). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Try, But...","review":"I was offered Snow Crash by a friend to read. I was a little dismissive, due to it being 'cyber-punk', but I rallied on. After a fairly humourous opening, it went rapidly downhill from there.To give the man his dues, there are at least two cracking good ideas on every page. Unfortunately, the words stringing them together are awful. Horrible, dull, clunky sentences pervade most of the passages. I'd say the man can't write for toffee, but that would be unfair as I've not yet summoned the courage to read his other works. I'm told I would enjoy Cryptonomicon, but then again, I was told the same thing about Snow Crash.And then there is the info-dumping. How I hate info-dumps. The process of just reeling off large sections of what sounds like textbook or encyclopedia and just putting it down on the page as one character talking to another. Ugh. There's a lot of it in this book.So, The book gets 2 stars for the good ideas, but no more for everything else that makes it awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another donation to the library","review":"Way too overwritten, with Melville style tangents into things about which nobody cares.

I don't usually enjoy science fiction but this book was a big exception and came highly recommended to me by many friends. I am sure this will be made into a major movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Crash","review":"was such a great book for its time. That's not to say it's not still a great book. It is.

If they are all like this one though, I should pick up some more.This was entertaining, well thought out, funny and had a lesson for our life in it.I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool and engaging","review":"The first few pages of the book almost prompted me to put it down -- personally, I don't care about a Mob-owned pizza delivery service. Once I got past that, however, the book really picked up speed. I feel that it was well-written and everyday I looked forward to reading more about what was going on in the world of the metaverse. While the book is a lot of science fiction, much of it seems very close to reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular; All too Real.","review":"Stephensen portrays the future of Info Tech as few can. While his picture of America's future is somewhat fantastic, his view of cyberspace to come is, I feel, very close to the mark. A must read for anyone interested in computers/the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, tense, thought-provoking.","review":"Hilarious, tense, thought-provoking. I don't read a lot of fiction, and when I pick up an SF novel, I'll put it back down if it's not engaging. I didn't put this one down except to eat, go to the bathroom and sleep (three hours after I usually turn in). This will be a hard act to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORY","review":"My computer science professor recommended this book. I'm halfway through It and It's wonderful so far. I recommend reading it if you are a computer geek or just a regular person =]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Techno-babble mixed with religio-babble","review":"Our \\"Hiro\\" (sic) is an underachieving superman able to do anything and everything but with no desire to do anything. The author tries to tie in Sumerian superstition with the bible, and relates everything as a computer virus. The characters develop relationships amongst each other not because they should but because he needs it to further the plot. The primary characters are two-dimensional and the rest are one-dimensional. The technology side is a reasonable projection into the future from where we are. The rest is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great, then fizzles","review":"This book starts off great, but about 70% of the way through it just went flat for me. There was way, way too much tedious description of all kinds of tangential stuff, a lot of it really boring, as if the author were describing the movie he was envisioning the book would become someday. The characters never really develop that much, and the story just starts to drag. That's just my opinion. I know millions would disagree. As Y.T. would say, Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great geeky story","review":"Loved the story and all the geek that is involved. Didn't care so much for all of the language though. Would recommend to other geeks looking for a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A fabulous book, right from the very first life or death pizza delivery incident, and the adventure that flows from there.Our recursive main character, Hiro Protagonist, must help out a girl, solve a conspiracy, and find out where he comes from, all with a little help and a lot of danger. An intelligent, clever and very funny romp from start to finish, although the humour is more prevalent in the beginning, before the Sumerian encounter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Crash is my favorite book ever, period.","review":"Not much more to add. Other novelists my be more visionary, artistic, etc, but Stephenson is eminently readable and enjoyable. Haven't met anyone yet who dislikes this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible, comic, yet entertaining read","review":"That's why they call it fiction. The characters are crazy and a bit scary too. He has taken some of our most serious social problems; drugs, organized crime, the internet, hackers, corporate greed; and extrapolated them into an extremley entertaining, although unbelievable tale. No, this is not going to happen to America. Read the book though, I think you will enjoy it. If you like Stephenson, you must also check out \\"Transfer: the end of the begining,\\" by author Jerry Furland. Then you will know where America is really headed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Gibson","review":"Snow Crash is an excellent book. The first chapter is terribly funny tongue in cheek humor that sets the scene for a slightly more humorous look at the cyberpunk world than is offered by most authors. But the book does not continue like this. It progresses onwards, garnering a plot in the process. It does not possess the darkness that makes true cyberpunk (William Gibson) so great. Not to say that the book is not worth reading, but keep your expectations low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pizza, Swords, and the Metaverse","review":"Snowcrash isn't a novel for just anyone. It is certainly not a traditional sci-fi novel. Instead, into the subgenre known as cyberpunk. The story centers around a dystopic world where Hiro, the protagonist, surfs the metaverse... Something between the matrix and the internet. Hiro stumbles upon the Snowcrash virus which threatens not only the users of the metaverse, but also people in the real world. The story continues from there. This book is in the same vein as Gibson's Neuromancer, and is a very well written and satisfying read. Perfect for the readers willing to embrace their inner adolescent boy and have fun with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like trying to get nutrition from chewed up bubble gum","review":"This book is a complete waste of time. It is the worst book I have EVER read. I just kept reading it because someone recommended it to me and I was desperately hoping something interesting would happen, giving my friend the benefit of the doubt. In the end, nothing did happen. So the Raven guy tries to nuke America in cyberspace. So he fails. 500 pages of irrelevant mini tangents preceding the obvious denouement. The Sumerian legend junk and Hiro's paralleling of it to a computer/brain virus is completely far-fetched and boring (I had to skip entire paragraphs about the Ashkeran junk, it was so stupid). Then the book is peppered with spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, poor choice of words, and obvious mathematical fallacies (2^2 = 8? ). Trying to get something out of this book is like trying to get nutrients from a chewed up piece of bubble gum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words: Over Rated","review":"Comic book cyberpunk. I didn't care about the characters and thought some of the good 'uns were soul-less. Also, there is a strong anti-American, anti-capitalist vibe to this book. There is a character in the story who is \\"Bill Gates-level wealthy\\" yet who has given the world nothing useful. Well, 'the rich' DO provide useful goods and services, thus they have wealth. One positive note: very well done Sumerian mythology blend with plotline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, Bad Publisher","review":"Publishers who turn off text to speech should be boycotted. Customers who have bought the text should be able to process however they choose. Those with visual impairment are being persecuted. This is a good book, whose quality is tarnished by the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a tree, don't waste your time with this one!","review":"Childish, sophomoric, vulgar, juvenile. Get the picture? A complete waste of paper. My guess is that this book probably appeals to immature teenage boys with raging hormones (nothing wrong with that, per se, it's just that the book feels as if it was written by someone stuck in puberty) and those with limited imaginations - it certainly is not what one might call \\"literature.\\" At best, it may be possible to that state the author has an \\"imagination,\\" however, that doesn't make this book a creative experience. The story weaves and spins through endless threads that come from nowhere and then disappear, completely, into the ether. Got too much time on your hands and want something to scramble you brain on? Then this book is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere for substance - this book doesn't have any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully dated","review":"The technology in exceptional science fiction has a sort of timeless quality to it. Dune, Armor, and Enders Game are all common examples of books that I think do a wonderful job with technology. The things described are either thoroughly alien and a delight to imagine, or have already come to be in some form but the foresight exhibited by the author is still impressive. This book, written in 1992, dares to explore the amazing technological breakthroughs of 1996. Attempting to read it in 2007 was a painful experience. Any immersion I had in the story was destroyed when the protagonist started speaking about computers and I was reminded of my copy of \\"DOS for dummies\\" I had in middle school (years ago)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad enough to give you a headache","review":"Bad, silly, superficial and really, really boring. And, of course, it is not a novel, only a lot of words and too many childish simils without any meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I downloaded a free sample of this story because I thought the plot sounded interesting. Unfortunately the first two free chapters were explanation, description and backstory ending with a futuristic pizza delivery guy crashing into an empty swimming pool.With numerous f-bombs, lack of action, and wondering when the author was going to get to the real conflict and story line, I have no interest in paying to read the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous, insane, and a lot of fun","review":"You have to admire a writer who has the guts to name his hero/protagonist \\"Hiro Protagonist.\\" What seperates this book from the rest of the cyberschlock that litters bookstore shelves is an incredibly skewed sense of future Americana (pizza delivery is free if it doesn't make it in 30 minutes or less, complete with an apology from the Mafia Godfather, and the, um, termination of the hapless delivery boy), combined with some very heavy philosophy and ancient history. This book has scope, with nothing less at stake than the battle for control of the thoughts and actions of the future's cyberspace residents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in cyberspace ... you're here ....X","review":"This is a funny, hilarious and fabulous book.Ever since I have read it, I have never looked at the late pizza delivery guys the same way (you'll get this early in the book).I loved the plot, loved the characters even those of canine persuasion and enjoyed this book so much I was sorry it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Period 7 Book Review","review":"Snow Crash is an exceptional modern science fiction novel. In this book, the main character, Hiro, faces a corrupt world of cyber-punks. As a reader you will become quickly engrossed in the futuristic stream-lined world of the Metaverse, a virtual computer-generated world. This book is recomended to any science fiction lover. From Neal Stepehenson's use of hip attitude and profanity, this work is very realistic as well as realistic. The only drawback of the book is that is is long, but, it is still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilariously funny and highly entertaining book!","review":"This is a very funny book, written in a non-scientific style. You won't find yourself going back to the sentence or paragraph before to reread it. This is an excellent book. It's highly entertaining and won't be able to stop reading it for longer than 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dificult read","review":"If you are a serious \\"techie\\" then this may be an interesting read for you. There is so much inter-acting between the cyber world and the real world that most of the time you don't know if you are in the real world or the cyber world. I have plodded through over 25% of the book and it feel as though every page is introducing new characters with character descriptions that go on forever with no advancement of the plot. There has been a hint as to what Snow Crash is but so far as not been introduced into the plot of the story. I will attempt to continue reading this book and if the plot becomes easier to read. I will give up reading this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds up years later","review":"I actually lost my original copy in a roof-leaking misfortune; this was one of the lucky few to be repurchased. I hadn't read it since it first came out, and as I began rereading it, I was afraid it was a little dated. What actually \\"dated\\" it though, was more the fact that Mr Stephenson needed to explain a lot of the tech that we now take for granted because the book was written before a lot of the ideas and concepts became commonplace. Once I got past the small bouts of over-explanation I thoroughly enjoyed my reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, provocative use of linguistics/coding/religion","review":"I suppose I'm a geeky Ph.D. (although not a computer/science/math geek), and I agree with many of the positive remarks in the reviews. However, I disagree with the frequent remarks about the linguisitic elements that, indeed, are at the heart of the book, and without which, frankly there is nothing more than some clever cocktail-hour chat with a rather warped, imaginative geek. I'm sorry that some readers were disappointed in the explanations in the book that in my mind were abbreviated (not lengthy) and necessary to make the plot work. As an undergraduate English major (which I realize hardly makes me a qualified reviewer) I certainly wouldn't call the exposition on these topics in the book \\"poor writing.\\" But, I guess I'm operating with different \\"me\\" under the influence of a different nam-shub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Future-think to the max","review":"I read Snow Crash many years ago and just picked up the audiobook as a \\"refresher\\". Mindbogglingly accurate as to what we have now and still retains enough future-ware to entice our thinking. Semi-aware Robot guardians, huge city-raft of immigrant boats centering around a de-commissioned and private aircraft carrier, computer \\"wear\\", lives in the Metaverse world, etc. Although I don't think my SUV would be a good candidate to be \\"pooned\\" for a free ride (fiberglass panels). Listen and re-listen as Hiro, Y.T. and Raven mix it up in our very possible, disturbingly real, future world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A diversion, nothing more","review":"I read Snow Crash because someone recommended it as an alternative to Neuromancer, one of my favourite books. Snow Crash doesn't come close to Neuromancer, it's not complex enough, it doesn't have the same feel of seamlessnes.Snow Crash depicts a future of city-states spread across the former USA, where you join a country like you join a club. The technology is far advanced, but it seems to be for the benefit of the reader instead of using it as a tool to make the setting believable(imagined author quote: Hmm, people think railguns are cool, i'd better throw in one, an i'll make it fission powered and automatic- that'll make people like my book!).The same thing goes for most of everyhing when I come to think of it. It's a bit like eating large amounts of snacks; it's not that good, you won't feel good afterwards, but you don't stop eating anyway.Nonetheless, I did finish it, so if you like SF, and you have to much time on your hands, i recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Struggle","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I should have put it down after the first page. Instead, I struggled for weeks, forcing it down like the chicken nugget my kid didn't finish but I don't want to throw away.I dig comics and the cyberpunk aesthetic, but this one came across trite and thrown together -- like a cyberpunk wannabe wrote it. The sumerian tangent was disgracefully convoluted and as unintelligible as the 'babel' it draws from -- unless I'm a dumb ass and just didn't get it.Anyway, I give 2 stars because I feel like any author taking the time and energy and displaying the courage to carve out a place in the publishing world warrants such a rating, but this book is the least enjoyable that I've read in a very long time. I did finish it, but instead of taking it to our local paperback shop, I tossed it in my recycling bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some nice ideas, but it doesn't work","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but frankly I am glad to have finally finished it. There were some terrific ideas in here: the virtual-reality Metaverse where wealth and status impacts on your appearance; religion as a virus infecting people through a base, ancient and long forgotten language; brains as machines that can be affected by binary code. And the book was at it's best when the hero, called Hiro Protagonist, was having these ideas explained to him by a computer program librarian within the Metaverse. But the story just doesn't hang together and as a dystopian vision of the future is not a patch on the greats such as 1984, Brave New World or A Clockwork Orange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here comes the Metaverse!","review":"SNOW CRASH is set in the (not too distant) future, in a world where accessing the Internet has evolved from web pages like you are presently looking at to a 3D virtual world known as the Metaverse. Hiro Protagonist, the main character, is on of the most highly skilled Metaverse hackers. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book, as it dealt with a lot of the use of the Metaverse, but it seemed as though Stephenson got away from that in the last couple of chapters, and the ending was a little flat for me.Want to get involved in something that is possibly a precursor to a real Metaverse?

A fun, fast-paced read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shallow end is surprisingly deep","review":"Having never read this author before, I really had a difficult time pushing through the early part of Snow Crash... I found the whole pizza delivery/scateboard scene too far out. I learned after I finished the book that it was originally intended to be a graphic novel...it would've helped to know this at the start so I didn't try to apply logic to the scenario.However, after getting into it, I found the author has woven in pretty deep philosphy/religious themes that (appear) well researched and are thought provoking. Combined with a well timed sense of humor, I really enjoyed Snow Crash...and it was nice to pick a book I didn't finish in one or two sittings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Crash - One of my Top Ten favorite books","review":"Many other people will have already written full-on book reports about Snow Crash, so don't expect that here.I picked up this book at a friends house decades ago. He told me I couldn't borrow it if I liked it as he hadn't finished it yet. I read the first 100 or so pages and on the way home bought my own copy. In some ways even more-so then William Gibson, Neal Stephenson nailed the Near Possible Future squarely on the head. I found the pace and detail of the book perfectly to my liking with characters I wouldn't mind seeing again. The one thing I will say, Neal has trouble ending books. I don't mind they way they end in general but Snow Crash and also Cryptonomicon both ended shall I say Jaggedly? The story was wrapped up, but the ending wasn't clean. This however did not hurt my love of these books the first time I read, nor when I have had to re-read. And yes, being in my Top Ten means sometimes I *have* to reread this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the mature reader","review":"Superficial development and banal, stereotypical portrayal of all major characters.

This book initialy captivated me more than any other sci-fi novel I've read in recent years. I was hooked. The problem is the end of the book. Its so LAME and the climax is a BIG DUD. I'll never read another book by this author again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unreadable","review":"Like many other one-star reviewers, I heard about this being a classic in the Neuromancer sense. I tried to like it, I really did (I was hoping to have this be the first leap into discovering Stephenson's other works), but I ended up doing something quite rare for me: I put the book down halfway through it.I really tried, but I found it simply unreadable. I have to agree with other reviewers that the torturous sentences, simple plot, shallow characters, and just plain boring storyline killed it for me. I also found it funny that for futuristic cyberpunk sci fi, it wasn't very futuristic or cyberpunky... the technology feels like it was written by someone from the 1950's envisioning their future.I'm an avid sci fi/fantasy reader and can count the number of unfinished books on two hands. Snow Crash has joined that list. I wish I could get my money back, it was THAT bad. Are all his books written like this? Should I just stay away from Neil Stephenson?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on how you like your SF......","review":"Snow Crash is full of fun and often inventive SF gadgets and ideas. How much you will enjoy this novel will depend upon how heavily you are 'into' science fiction and how plausible you like your stories. I found the characters somewhat lacking in complexity, and some of the plot devices contrived. Snow Crash felt to me a little like a comic book, without the illustrations. If you like your science fiction with an extra fantastical flare, Snow Crash is for you. If you're into hard-science SF and plausible story lines, there are many better options available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Far From the Future","review":"Like a glimpse into the future we live in today, Stephenson cuts likes a samurai sword straight into a grainy and digitized reality enjoyable from page one. There is something for everyone to like in Snow Crash, from hacker geeks to rebellious religious fanatics alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Umberto Eco meets Joe Quirk","review":"Absolutely loved it! This book is for people who like intelligent fiction. Stephenson manages to capture pop-reality without being cheesey. It's a very well-researched and well-written book: silly and sardonic, futuristic and tangible. Potential readers shouldn't be turned off by the cover. The book is much better and more intricate than that silly illustration. Totally five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and original","review":"My suggestion is: read the first 20 pages. If you can put the book down at that point, do it - but I'll bet you can't.Snow Crash is an ultra-fast paced journey into the day after tomorrow that includes everything from acient Sumerians to the Metaverse (an extension of the internet) to a pizza delivery guy who carries Samurai swords and a canoe-paddling assasin whose blades are a molecule thick. His characters jump out of the pages, and his view of the not-so-distant future is startling and impressive.Stephenson's storytelling style fits the motif perfectly - hip, modern, and told entirely in present tense in something almost reminiscent of modernist stream-of-consciousness writers.This is the book you'll be telling your friends about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"A fantastic cyberpunk novel that I could not put down! Plus, with all of the new technology surfacing lately, it is rather prophetic as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent mix: technological SF, neurolinguistics, metaverse","review":"Lots of action, realistic extrapolation, and even a message built in, I did really enjoy reading this book.(incidentally, I was in Mumbay and got to wander why when you visit a temple they offer you a milky holy water: read the book and you'll wander too)Technically, I would recommend the author to consider compact light reactors (based on U233 and from Brasil in my extrapolations) rather then radioisotope sources as power supplies. The Diamond Age has more stile and is clearly more mature a job: Snow Crash has more action and frankly for me it was more fun to read. Re other reviews: what is the Big U?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful fictional look at the future of virtual worlds","review":"I never did like any of William Gibson's work... \\"Neuromancer\\"felt like what it was: a description of fictional technologywritten by someone who didn't know much about the technologyitself. But \\"Snow Crash\\" is different; from the first few pages,it's obvious Neal Stephenson understands his subject matter well. Sure,there are hokey parts, like a motorcycle race in cyberspace (whynot just move to a different location?), but then there arebits which are brilliant. This book is the Bible of peoplebuilding virtual world technology, and deservedly so. If youwork in the computer industry, consider this a must-read. Besides,how can you not love a book in which the central character'sname is \\"Hiro Protagonist?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilling.","review":"This exciting, imaginative tale is marred by its homogenous characters and puerile sensibility.For example: two-thirds in we're finally given a good look at Raven, the story's mysterious bad guy, who turns out to be just another foul-mouthed boor with a bad 'tude.And, as they say, it's all downhill from there: the remainder is almost unreadable, as the author turns to insipid, highly contrived monologue/action sequences to come up with an ending - ANY ending, I imagine. This is an extreme disappointment after the blazing, highly readable opening chapters.Oh, well - there are some interesting bits: some of the satire is funny, the technology is funky, and the premise, although poorly executed, is fascinating. Still, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forecast or Forerunner?","review":"Though not exactly distopian.

Neal Stephenson is an awesome writer; this is a highly entertaining book and the best in the cyber punk genre. This book is best for mature readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it","review":"Snow Crash is just a wild ride in a high tech world. Like all good science fiction, it allows a historical archetype (the Samurai) to explore a brilliantly created world- in this case with his futuristic sword and in pursuit of a harpoon-wielding bad guy. Stephenson is a very creative author, and his characters all shine. He put a lot of work into this stand-alone novel (rare for sequel-obsessed authors such as him) and I was sorry it had to end. I picked up Snow Crash after my favorite author, Max Barry, recommended it. Now I have CO-favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephenson's unique","review":"Snow Crash is one of those books that will either grab you in the first 30 pages, and hold you to the end, or you will hate. You'll worry about the comic book aspect at first, but quickly get past that.As with much of Neal Stephenson's writing, Snow Crash is completely unique. It is hilarious through the first half of the book, and has a couple of Stephenson's amazing allegories sprinkled throughout. One in particular describing a Dilbert-view of a future Federal bureaucracy is worth the price of the book on it's own. Snow Crash is not, however, at the level of Cryptonomicon. The world of Snow Crash seriously bogs down and becomes Hollywood-movie-clichéd at the end. But it's a great ride getting there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has not aged well.","review":"The book has not aged well in 20 years. Unfortunately I read it for the first time in 2012.

In comparision Dune Book 2 is only about 387 pages and it was a lot of fun by the time I was on page 300.Sentenses are complicated. There are too many made up words that in the end don't mean much. Mix those together and you get a difficult to follow book. Other reviewers described this issue better than I did here.Main plot drags nowhere and I even cannot see main plot. I have now given up on the book and think it was a waste of money.I tried this book because I like \\"The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer\\" by Neal Stephenson. The Diamond Age is a brilliant work and beats Snow Crash without any doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly bad","review":"Thankfully I got the free sample for this book.This has the distinction of being the first sample I couldn't finish.Two pages of drivel was enough for me to delete it.It reads like a bad essay from a school boy.Maybe it gets better, since it could hardly get worse, but that was enough adolescent tripe for me to give up on this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"big gaping hole","review":"i haven't finished, just skipped to the part about sumer and whatnot to see how that played out, and i realize that may be the dumbest idea on the planet. if he's saying humankind spoke the same language until the sumers, is he ignoring the aztecs, native americans, etc.? is he advocating some sort of christian creation story? because if he's not, then there were already different languages before the sumerians?! am i missing something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"The beetle ate the cockroach while reading \\"100 Days of Solitude\\".

Of course, Jamie didn't see it that way because, well, when flying over a house, one's mind drifts - but perhaps we all drift (even when eating pizza) to somewhere over the rainbow beyond the metaphysical boundaries of common literature...WHAM! The motorcycle skidded on the poor beetle and flipped over, causing a thermonuclear explosion and a time dilation which made Star Trek into reality (yes, Kirt was interviewed by Oprah, seriously).

Inventive, crazy, disturbing, and definitely entertaining. Tried to re-read it recently and found it deeply offensive, now that I am a Christian. In this book the Holy Spirit is likened to a virus. I threw it in the trash, could not finish it. So, if you are an atheist and like books that trash Christianity and reinforce your world view, then this one is for you. I don't require the promotion of my world view in the books I read, but I'd rather not have it attacked. I don't understand why so many sci-fi authors do that these days, given that the super majority of Americans self identify as Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Crash","review":"If you enjoy science fiction books, then knock yourself out, enjoy the book and move on with your life. I did not enjoy the book. I live a normal life and I do not find these types of books interesting. I only read it upon the recommendation of one of my friends-apparently we have different taste in literature. Other than being extremely confused with the book, I did find it helpful on those sleepless nights. If you like this kind of book, then I recommend it. If you do not like this type of book, move on in the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it.","review":"I can never stop reading a book half way. With the books I have had trouble getting through I usually buy the audio book. This is one of those books. It is a great concept, awesome in fact, but the story just drags on and on. I couldn't get into it. It took me about a month to get through it. Unlike the hunger games trilogy which I read all three in about a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stand the test of time...","review":"I read and enjoyed Cryptonomicon, so I figured I'd give another of Stephenson's books a shot.This just didn't really stand up. The events in the book really felt like they were the dream of some adolescent teenager, with a random pizza-guy-hacker-swordmaster running around doing stuff. Stephenson did a bit too much telling, not showing, with how the events unfold in the book (the main character - Hiro Protagonist - spends pages describing exactly what just happened to someone, rather than making the events clear through the actual story).The books saving grace is it's very-early realization of a virtual reality world. Stephenson got a lot right, even before such a thing was really more than a pipe dream. However, now that we're starting to see similar stuff, it loses a lot of it's luster. It also was pretty quickly paced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful copy of an amazing piece of SciFi","review":"This is a replacement for my _extremely_ well worn softcover copy of this book that I've had for years and years. The signed/boxed edition is very nicely done and I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Although I would have to agree that sometimes things could've been better, I loved this book. A LOT! I actually enjoyed the sense of chronological disconnection between the characters. I absolutely fell in love with the universe that Stephenson created. Yes, I know that he's not shaking things up the way gibson or stirling have, but there were people before them doing similar things. Any great works can be seen as not all that original as we think they are, but bla bla bla THIS is a GREAT book. It's his personal twists that get you. No it's not a radical departure from other cyberpunk, but it is still an intriguing, delightful and entertaining vision of the not-so-distant future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"This book is an incredible journey into the future of the Internet and corporate America. Join Hiro Protaganist on his quest to make the 'Net safe for hackers everywhere! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention to Detail","review":"Stephenson loves details, and this book is full of 'em. Every single thing in this book, from the pizza deliveries to the metaverse to the orign of a deadly virus, everything in this book is detailed to perfection. Stephenson's description of his post-modern world is truly quite amazing.The characters are also quite great, but perhaps not as detailed as the environments themselves. The relationship between Hiro Protagonist (the coolest character name ever, btw) and Y.T. is never really explained, and you sometimes wonder why they even help each other out. Their whole relationship seems to be not based on of loyalty or much less friendship, but one of being there at the same time. They're never aware what the other one is up to until they run into each other. But it actually makes for a few laughs and unpredictability.You can't go wrong with Snow Crash. It's an easy read, entertaining and even informative. You'll be wanting to read it again right after you finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the software engineers of the future are reading this book","review":"Java/Network programmers are already buildingprototypes of the Street. Where do they gettheir ideas? Snow Crash, Neuromancer, True Names.Read 'em all to see the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pizza Pizza","review":"Would consider it NOT BAD cyberpunk. Goes down a few roads traveled 2 often in the genre. Just like in the real world. Interfaces change, applications grow, but its still just the internet gone hyper-global.However, the first chapter describing the pizza delivery is by far one of the best openers in a novel I have ever read. If you like the genre check it out. His other book \\"Diamond Age\\" is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A surrealistic yet highly probable look at the future!","review":"The moment I started reading this book I couldn't stop. It offers not only insight into today's society and psychology, but shows what could really be the future of America. This is also one of the first books I have read that accurrately depicts hackers. It's fast paced fun with some interesting intellectual discussions"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride from start to finish","review":"Neal Stephenson pulls you into a world that seems at the same time ridiculous, and familiar. Snow Crash starts in a new America which has fallen into privately owned city states, each with their own laws, security forces, and regulations. Parallel to this America lies the \\"Metaverse\\"; an internet where one lives a second life and anything is possible. The story seems rather shallow and campy through the first few chapters, but with every page you turn Snow Crash unwraps a deep, complex idea that will completely engross you.Stephenson's novel will take you on a wild ride of technology, linguistics, love... and drugs, violence and corruption. The style is very fluid, and though he often jumps from character to character and changing perspectives, Stepehenson captures you until you flip the last page. This book is a blast, I highly recommend it to anyone with an appreciation for science-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Snow Crash......NOW!","review":"So, Neal?Are you getting it yet? After all this time, people are selling an $80.00 collector's edition of your book. There are like, a dozen editions, re-issues, and reprints of this book. I personally own at least 4 copies I can think of.When will we have more of this? Some of your other stuff is OK, But we NEED more snow crash.Just write more of this genre. I promise you, everything like this you write, I'll read, OK?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most fun in SF","review":"Stephenson is one of the 3 best cyberpunk authors, one of the 10 best SF authors, and certainly one of the 100 best authors alive (how's that for random?) This may not be his best book, but is the most fun, and not to be missed. If you are new to Stephenson, promise yourself to give it 50 pages. If you do, you'll read everything he has written. Do it in this order: Snow Crash, Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon. After that, you're on your own, because you are truly hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Metaverse Prophecy","review":"As an employee of Linden Lab (the company behind the popular virtual world, Second Life), I found this book prophetic. It's amazing to think many years ago Stephenson was writing the blueprint for what would exist in metaverses, like Second Life, but he did, and he nailed it. His vision overall of online 3-D communities, even down to the details, is poignant, well-thought-out, and inspiring.As an author myself and reader, I found the book still very engaging, but - at times - meandering and arrhythmic. However, much of this unique style, blended with Stephenson's dystopian descriptions of the future, gives Snow Crash an engaging pallor that is hard to turn away from.This book obviously has a core cyberpunk readership, but I would encourage anyone to read this who is interested in the emergence of 3-D virtual worlds and the effect they may have on the future of reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast.","review":"OK, the genre is passe. (yeah right) Fact is that some of the most exciting writers in the past 10 or 20 years have cut their teeth on it.Speed and pacing to rival Gibson and a wicked sense of humor, this book is a tour de force of the absurd logical conclusion!Like Gibson and Sterling? Gotta read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Possibly this book was half decent in the mid 90s, but reading this book today it comes off completely ridiculous. The female character YT is written in an unrealistic and, I think, sexist manner. When I started the book I thought the first couple chapters must be a character having a dream or something, it couldn't possibly be the book I had read positive reviews about, but it was and it didn't get much better. Snow Crash managed to be completely idiotic at certain points, and hard to follow at other points. Don't waste your time, there are a lot of better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pizza, computers, and rock and roll","review":"While the cyber-punk subgenre certainly started with William Gibson's Neuromancer, it peaked with Stephenson's Snowcrash. Cyberpunk is 80's speculative fiction that tries to imagine Reagan's America in the 2020's. Cyberpunk is mall mythology, and it doesn't get any better than Snowcrash. The story follows Hiro Protagonist, VR-internet god and real world pizza delivery boy, and a young skateboard courier named YT through an American that is a shattered mirror of our own. Snowcrash suffers from some terrible late 80's action movie conventions (most notably some of Hiro's clunker dialogue and his terrible name), but more than makes up for it with some of the funniest prose ever laid down, and ideas so grand in scope as to make Isaak Asimov weep. For anyone who wants an intelligent read, biting with black humor, Snowcrash is the summer beach novel for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good light reading","review":"OK, so it's a bit Hollywood-esque & shallow. It's good cyberpunk escapism and an enjoyable summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neal Stephenson has done it again!","review":"Thanks to Neal's books, including \\"Cryptonomicon\\", \\"The Diamond Age\\", \\"Zodiac\\", etc., I have suddenly become a great lover of the entire cyberpunk spectrum. \\"Snow Crash\\" has only solidified my newfound love with this sub-genre of science-fiction and I find myself thirsting for more. Such as another book, which is very oddly written yet still tells a great cyberpunk tale in my opinion, is \\"Darkeye: Cyber Hunter\\". It has also wound up on my list of good cyberpunk books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting future","review":"I only picked up this book because I had seen a review on this site. This book is not in my usual style/genre of reading. But I am so glad I read it! Wow!What really appealled to me about this book is the setting in a future that you can easily confuse with tomorrow. It's set in such a way that this future is very credible and almost possible. The technology is certainly feasible! And the current events and ideas that make and define us today could lead to a future, as described in Snow Crash!The history and mythology were also very interesting and the dialogue was smart. The characters are fully fleshed. You want to hate Raven but there is something that make you like him, just a bit, against your better judgement.This book is a page turner. No matter your type of book, this is an awesome read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time coming...","review":"I loved this book, I am an avid reader of both Sci-Fi & Fantasy and when a book comes along that grabs you and shakes you and makes you smile almost the entire time you are reading it... Well... Need I really say more? I had this booking sitting on my shelf for almost two years, hemmed and hawed, something about the blurb did not sit well with me. Then one day I picked it up, and I couldn't put it down! Read this book, force it on your friends, it is quick and well planned out and an excellent read. Now isn't that something we all wish we could find more of! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is the editing so bad?","review":"This Kindle book contains numerous typographical errors which, for me, ruin the experience. What a disgrace. Every single night I read it, I spotted an obvious problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahead of its time","review":"A friend recommended this book years ago, but I finally got around to reading it. After a few chapters I was totally immersed in Stephenson's bizarre, yet oddly plausible, future reality. I don't read much sci-fi, but this is now one of my favorite books. I can't wait to read more of his work. This book was published in 1992 - it's way ahead of its time. In some ways, this book predicted the future popularity of Facebook and other social media websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"proceed with caution","review":"I really wish that I liked this book. It was obviously well reseached and entertaining in some parts. But I just completely lost interest after about 100 pages. It tried to get to serious, and for me, this ruined the book. I can see why some people would love this book, but it is not for everyone. I hate books that take themselves to seriously when they dont have to. This book should have been about 100 pages shorter by cutting out all the useless information that was in it. I liked the pace of the book but the things that were happening were boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Whenever someone's output is described as a romp, that is natures way of saying \\"don't touch\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable - couldn't finish it","review":"There are a lot of well written reviews for this book, and I'm not going to attempt a thorough review. That would be unfair as I didn't finish the book. But I just wanted to say that I didn't really like it. For some reason I found the style of writing extremely irritating. I think the author tries too hard to write in a cool style, but it ends up as a flashy, verbose, cacophony of words totally obscuring anything in the way of character development or plot. After a while I got so annoyed with the book I couldn't be bothered finishing it and took it back to the library.Some people might like it, but I found it unreadable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biblical revisionism","review":"I listened to an audio version of this book. I enjoyed the plot, and the characters were ok. At times, the audio version was hard to follow. This was especially true of the parts pertaining to Sumerians and Judeo-Christian religion, which also didn't hold my interest when they got lengthy. The foundational concept of the book was based on revisionist interpretation of the Bible, which might bother some people."},{"rating":"1","title":"No heart, all whiz bang techiness","review":"Interesting idea... but.. and this is a huge but... there is very, very little character development... no matter what the genre... if an author doesn't give a character a personality that I can delve into and go with I am bored, bored, bored with pages of technostuff no matter how brilliant.

If you have never seen an ECW match before then you are in for a big treat of gory action violence, epic matches that contain real blood and paralyzing feats of daring. ECW wrestlers did lots of different kinds of hardcore such as barbed wire matches, cane beatings, fire tables, chairs to the head, daring leaps of courage, all out brawls in the crowd, and lots of tables. See some hardcore action from greats such as Taz, Rob Van Damme, The Dudley Boyz, Tommy Dreamer, Mick Foley, Terry Funk, Sandman, Sabu, Bam Bam Bigelow, and other legends.

You will tone your muscles and improve your cardiovascular system very well with this video. The aerobics are low-impact, so beginners should not have much problem with this video, and the muscle-toning segments have subtitles at the bottom for beginners to follow if they find certain exercises too difficult. This video is good for beginners, but more advanced exercisers should also find it a good, all-around workout.Yes, this was filmed in the 80s, but a good workout doesn't become \\"outdated\\" just because of the date it was filmed.

Not a good ratio, since I have 12 jars and am expecting a third box eventually. Additionally, the measurments are not as described. Actual sizes are 1.6L (1), .9L (1), .5L (2) and .3L(2). I will use them for storing odds and ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference for French verbs","review":"This book on French verbs is the greatest book on verbs out there.

My daughter loves Aviva...and the boys both identify with Chris and Martin. I just wish PBS supported the show more with coloring pages, etc. The Wild Kratts game on the PBS website is great, though.Can't wait for season 2 to come out... as well as Wild Kratts costumes.

It unmounts from my desktop and tells me that the disk has not been ejected properly. I tried disk utility repair, but it does the same thing when I try to repair it. Then my Mac tells me to reformat the disk - I have no idea what that even means, and whenever I try to access the disk or the information on it, it gets really temperamental and stops working.

The card reads my SD and micro-SD cards (with the micro-SD card adapter that came with the card).I liked the fact that the back cover can be placed on the drive, even when the SD card is inside. That way the SD card is protected, and the drive is protected from dust, etc.This provided a convenient way for me to edit the contents of the micro-SD card I use for my cell phone.

Exchanging files with friends running Win'98, 2k, XP has been flawless (Win'98 requires installing a driver, but that's true for all USB devices under Windows 98).I bought several (for pocket, fanny pack, and laptop shoulder bag) and they work great.

It is a very unusual movie, but very well done and very enjoyable. Everything about it is amazing. Ewan McGregor was awesome, and he did an amazing job singing and portraying emotions. Nicole Kidman also did a great job, and her singing was very beautiful too. I had bought the soundtrack before seeing the movie, so I knew that both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were very talented, but watching them sing was great still. Ewan and Nicole had incredible chemistry and they made the love story so awesome. The story, set, and costumes were also incredible. I recommend that anyone who sees this movie keeps an open mind, because it is very differnt, very fast paced, and very visually dizzying. Also realize, that it is a musical. It was a very well done movie and I hope that it gains the recognition and praise that it truly deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! Best movie ever since Show Girls!","review":"Anybody out there know what CONTEXT means? Well, OK, for the 98% of you out there still scratching your hairdos, it's what is totally absence from this hollywood O-D experience, a mechanical production from beginning to end, touring through 100 years of pop music with all the over-speeded charm of a 42nd street live porn show. This is the audio-visual equivalent of too much acid & speed taken at the same time by the wrong person.

She loves it, and has told me on many occasions that the actors have excellent chemistry on screen, and portray their characters with such depth of feeling.She has told me that she has cried each time she watched this movie, so if you want an evocative, tear-jerker of a movie, get this flick. I feel that if it stirs emotions, whether happy or sad, it is a good film. If you feel nothing, it isn't worth the money or the time.

Moulin Rouge! is definitely one of the best movies of 2001. Ewan and Nicole blew me away with their performances in this movie. Everything was perfect in this movie. The songs were one of the best I've heard all around. I am so happy that this movie got 6 GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS. Without a doubt it is definitely going to win BEST PICTURE and BEST ACTRESS. Nicole Kidman shines in this movie. I strongly recommend this movie. Don't hesitate. BUY IT NOW!

Of course Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman were fantastic(and they can sing!!!), but there was also the Unconscious Argentinean (Jacek Koman) who was wonderful. Anyone who has a taste for the unusual should try this out. I will admit that there was one point when I felt uncomfortably overwhelmed with color, sound, and flashing images. If you decide to give it a try, DO NOT go into it as a serious film. The first time I saw it, there were several \\"what was THAT\\" for me in the movie. I consider this movie a keeper, but it has a different flavor from the normal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moulin Rouge","review":"I have seen the movie Moulin Rouge twice now and both times I cried I was a wonderful movie and I hoped you did or will like it too.

Baz Luhrmann's vision is different than any other director's. In the same way that Tim Burton's movies all have something distinctly Burton about them, Luhrmann seems to infuse his movies with something that makes them his, even from a distance.Kidman and McGregor both have lovely voices, and there is real on-screne chemistry between them. Leguizamo is funny and tragic and perfect.Don't sit in the front row for this movie; it's too big - you'll miss something. And see it on the big screen, preferably in a theatre that has a good sound system."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Singing","review":"When I went to see this movie, it was at my daughter's request. When the movie started, I thought I would be bored, and I was, until Ewan McGregor opened his mouth and began to sing. Themost wonderful sound came out. If I see this movie again, it would be to see and hear him sing. I really believe that the singing between him and Nicole Kidman were the saving features of this film. They pulled the movie together. Yes, I would watch it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO OTHER MOVIE LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you have read all the reveaws, you know that there is one that, needless to say the person didn't like it. Well, let me tell you that I went to see it 4 times, and my friend went to see it 7 times. Everyone that went to see it raved about it. People even came up to me at the theaters telling me to go see it, I went up to people and told them about it! I have never seen a movie with such good cam work, sound, color, music!!!!!!And the love story!!! All I can say is, watch it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Lurhmann","review":"Sit back and let your mind roll, this is magnificent. After watching this film I was actually proud to be an Aussie for a few days. Although Baz Lurhman sounds like a typically shallow pretentious Sydney boy that good and honest Novocastrians like myself despise, he's actually incredibly clever. There are moments of sheer, blinding beauty that are overwhelming. The use of the music is incredible and the arrangements of the songs are novel and exciting. As for the editing, at no point was it anything but thrilling. The visual narrative is sumptuous. Ewan Macgregor and Nicole Kidman are luminous; I actually teared up twice not because it was sad but because it's so damn gorgeous. The film is also incredibly funny and just plain fun to sit through. I saw it 3 days ago and I'm still thrilled to bits about it. I kept thinking, at last this is a musical for me, for my generation unburdened by traditional musical theatre narrative, so inventive.

I don't think the film makes any pretensions about what it is, you need to just sit back and be absorbed into this is a tragic and amusing story. Visually, the film is stunning and you can't help feeling part of it. The attention to detail is fabulous, and the \`behind the scenes' stuff on the DVD enhances the enjoyment.While the film works best on the big screen, it does transfer pretty well in widescreen format. You're going to get the most out of the film with a decent sound system."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who love \\"Love\\"","review":"This movie is not for everyone, but if you truly are a romantic at heart, no greater love story has ever been told. I thought the music was tremendous, I loved Ewan McGregor's voice, as well as Nicoles. Some of the camera movement was too much, but the scenery, story line, movement of the movie and the music were great.I watched this movie 3 times in 2 days because of the music and the touching love story. I'm not a critic, but it was much more fulfilling to me as a movie goer than the crash and burn movies like Swordfish. Nor was there any full nudity, or even risque nudity, no cursing, no drugs, warlords, or fighting. Just the age old story of love, being love, and being touched by love.Bohemia is \\"out there\\" and this movie is not mainstream movie making. It's not for everyone, but it is for anyone who loves a love story.

I found it a bloated, incomprehensible mish-mash of cheap cinematic tricks, with little or no substance, relying on the use of pre-existing musical numbers, erratically staged, and performances obviosuly coaxed from actors who cared little about their roles or the project. Visually tiring, with its peculiar editing, it was a total chore to sit through. Thank goodness Miramax ignored this dismal effort and took the plunge to make CHICAGO, which is infinately a much better film musical. If \\"the musical\\" does indeed return to Hollywood and once again becomes acceptable and accessible to the movie-going public, it will be because of CHICAGO, not the trite and over-the-top MOULIN ROUGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"How was this a blockbuster?","review":"Time is too short to waste on this.

Frankly, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and this would be the type of movie I would like. The actors could not sing (take a page from My Fair Lady and dub voices as necessary, guys).

The CGs are not being used effectively at all, one might as well use hand drawings and they would look better. The story was dull and repeating. Sometimes it just looked ridiculous to me. The movie needs more \\"faces\\" than nicole and the hotshot.

So weird, campy. Good acting?? I guess so, if you consider they didn't laugh themselves to death throughout this silly movie. The music choices made me cringe.

My opinion, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Frustrating Flick","review":"There were a couple of times during \\"Moulin Rouge\\" when I wanted to get up and walk out. There were a couple of other times when I was almost moved to tears. That's the kind of movie \\"Rouge\\" is. It throws you for a huge loop. Take Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman (eye and ear candy), throw in some pop, rock and dance music, and add broad brushstrokes of color and rich sound. That's \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" It's beautiful, vibrant, annoying, cheesy, bombastic, ecstatic, and uplifting all at the same time. And for that, it's definitely worth the price of admission -- and DVD.

But if you've been to an opera, you'd know that they are finer, more original works. So I'd suggest describing this flick as operettic: light, silly, and pretty chatty for a musical.As for it being excessive, I thought it was pretty tame. There were no big production numbers, just quick editing to give the effect of substance. Look at a Busby Berkley flick and compare the excess.Still don't get why Toulouse Lautrec was played like a giddy bozo. He was a well-borne and educated artist. He enjoyed a good time and putting on funny clothes for the cameras, but nothing this silly.One bonus: more garterbelts than Fredricks of Hollywood :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Thrilling, Front of the seat entertainment\\"","review":"I absolutely loved this movie.

However I'm one of those who disagree with the great ratings it received... There's nothing wrong with the acting... just the plot is so ridiculous and I felt silly watching it. It tries to be fairy-tale-like in an adult sort of way... to me these 2 just don't mix very well... I'd prefer either the one genre or the other. The songs were great remakes of old-time classics from musicals and bands, which I really enjoyed being a music lover myself. I think if not for the songs, I would have walked out of the movie 30 minutes into the show. Perhaps its true what people say : you either love this or hate this. Watch it at your own risk (of disappointment, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"audio expirience","review":"as i was disgusted (!) by this movie as i saw the previews, and avoided it, i finally decided to rent it, to see how right i was.well, it [was bad]! but there is one good thing about it: SOUND!!!if you have a good home theater system, youre in for a ride!the sound quality is amazing, the film is fast and full of, well, intresting tracks.worth the 2$ rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuous","review":"I know people who just can't understand why I hated this film.

Sure, the dancing is big and that accounts for my 2 star rating, but I found the overall premise to be stupid. The pop culture inspired lyrics were especially annoying. As the Editorial above states, \\"Nothing is original...\\" Although that could be said of many films, it has never been more true than with Moulin Rouge. I apparently had difficulty redigesting the material that Moulin Rouge barfed onto the screen. \\"Oh but it is so original by reweaving the lyrics and cultural references of the modern age into the context of turn of the century Paris.\\" Really? I just found this to be a vacuous waste of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING","review":"the creators of this movie obviously have some talent.. and lots of money.. every aspect of this movie is completley annoying, the characters, set, music, editing, ect ect.. a thoroughly terrible experience.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"I was completely surprised by this movie. I heard nothing but good things about it. I was so annoyed by the end of the movie I had to watch American pie with a Remember the titans chaser to calm down.

Its surrealistic, naive character made it the embarassment it was. Had the plot been more consistant and possible, and the characters not so much the shallow characatures that they were, the movie may have found success with me.

I give total thumbs up to the fantastic soundtrack as well-- nothing like it.By the movie's end I was so touched that I have been able to think of nothing else but the ache of a love like that.

And it wasn't.It's very original musical and there are a lot of things about this side of the film, but...This is a story of love. Young poet and courtesan. Their life. Their fate. Their love. Above everything - there is only one thing. And it is love. The main thing in the world. And it is beautiful and light feeling even if it is a tragical love. Romeo + Juliet was about it. Moulin Rouge! was about it.

The \\"writers\\" filch bits and pieces of well-known pop-culture tunes and shove them into scenes randomly, and then only a line or two every couple of seconds. It can't justifyably be called a \\"musical\\". I'm glad I didn't shell out any money for this video (it was a well-intentioned gift), however I feel cheated as I wasted over 2 hours of precious time watching this drivel. In short: the story was trite and cliched, the singing was amateur, the acting laughable, and the effects were wasted.The fact that the average rating is 4 stars (as of this review) alarms me and causes me to fear for the course of our culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"It's difficult to watch a movie supposedly taking place in the year 1899-1900 and hear Elton John, The Beatles and Madonna quoted.

Bad & boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This movie has some original ideas, but unfortunately the finished product comes off very badly. This show tries to be a spectacle at every - and I mean EVERY - turn, at the expense of the film. Way too many special effects - you'll be hard pressed to find a single scene which doesn't use some sort of overly-lavish camera, computer or audio effect.Moulin Rouge runs at breakneck speed, constantly hitting you with some sort of extreme stimulus until it magically slows down for some random, cliche, saccharine-drenched love scene (horribly over-produced as well).I agree that this movie would have worked much better as a stage musical. But as a movie, it just tries too hard - WAY too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad musical","review":"What do you get when you mix Dr. Seuss characters with a Nirvana/Elton John/Madonna soundtrack, Nicole Kidman and John Leguizamo?

Forget about the plot. If you have seen La Traviata or Camille you've got it (including the spitting blood and the throwing of money to the courtesan in public, not to forget the recriminating old father). The formal originality consists on mixing a Ken Russell inflated musical with unrestrained bits from a Franco Zefirelli production. In the added material Nicole Kidman enlightens us about the moving force of this enterprise: love can be expressed in music better than in any other genre. The only advantage over La Traviata is that we are spared listening to 'Di Provenza il mare il sol', an aria I hate more than any other. Thanks to that I can honestly say that yes, I liked the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"My husband and I got through the first 15 minutes of this movie and turned it off.

Perhaps it is an impossible task. Moulin Rouge is an indulgent mess, with a few wonderful sequences and performances (most notably by Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent, both of whom are quite good) Personally I am mystified by the film's appeal. Kidman and Leguizamo are both way over the top, the story is much too simplistic and the dance sequences are unfocused and dull. I would very much like Luhrmann to take a look at an earlier film of his \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" and take a lesson from it. Maybe going back to his roots (as they say) might help him create something worthwhile.Although not as dreadful as his Romeo and Juliet, Moulin Rouge is still a failure. I can not recommend it to any but the least discriminating viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk!","review":"I am surprised by how this mediocre \\"art\\" was able to deceive so many people.

Luhrmann should stick to meatier scripts (I greatly enjoyed 'Romeo and Juilet'). Injection of Top 40 lyrics every six and a half minutes coupled with an absolute ceiling of 6 seconds per shot gives the edited work all the appeal of chewing gum. Can't fault the cast, choreographers, etc., as this was obviously a failure of writing, direction, editing, and possibly cinematrography.Sober and bored, I bailed in under a half an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but meaningless.","review":"I found Moulin Rouge a brilliant technical exercise, but completely without any meaning or any kind of good drama. All I could ask myself watching this DVD is...why?

I seldom heard such emptyness. The script is level zero of content. If Fox wants to survive, one of the first things it has to do is fire the sript-writer but maybe there was not any or maybe, to save money, Baz Luhrmann did ask some young illiterate 12 years old boy to write something about Paris, Love and Moulin Rouge. Whatever, the result is a complete disaster. Everything sounds wrong and you cannot understand why Nicole Kidman would fall in love with such a dumb guy who has no idea about writing or singing, and certainly no gift for poetry. Besides, be sure to find all the clichés about Paris, love and Toulouse-Lautrec!If the movie had been mute, it would have been better because, yes, the pictures and the colors are beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointed","review":"We were looking forward to a movie with passion and excitement, and got a musical with songs that were out of place and not sung very well either. Imagine the scene set around 1900 and the songs that are sung are from today's music. None of the dance/music pieces were long enough to grab the viewer, more like abbreviated clips. Nicole Kidman is beautiful but she can't sing well enough for a musical. The first half of the movie was so confusing and boring, and the exaggerated theatrics of the characters were too much. Acting does not involve screaming your lines with emphasis on the end of the sentences. Ziegler, the theater director, is annoying, and Ewan, the male romance interest, was bland. The last 1/3 of the movie was better, but not enough to save it. It was disappointing because the premise behind the movie could have created something wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still wondering who dreamed this one up","review":"Add me to the list of those who \\"just don't get it\\". All of the superlatives one can read about the visually stunning sets and costumes, the quality of singing, the moxie needed to even conceive of such an anachronistic musical interpretation... forget 'em. The irritation afforded me by these distractions negated any desire to develop an appreciation for the sappy plight of the characters, the too-confusing plot, and the mediocre singing.

(Probably drank Absinth stright up)Anyone who's been to the real Molin Rouge in Paris will see that this is completely off base. There are no fat people in the show, everyone sits at tables and not dance around. The place has a lot of high standards.It's supposed to be set in 1900, yet they have a lot of modern music like Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana?

Their excellent voices and emotion-filled acting carries this movie and makes it what it is. Baz Luhrmann created a masterpiece in Moulin Rouge.The best way to see this movie, now that it isn't in theaters anymore, is to get the DVD. That way you can see it in widescreen--you miss so much by seeing it chopped up, formatted for television. See the un-chopped-up version. Everything should be widescreen.

This movie is both Ewan's and Nicole best movie yet.Moulin Rouge is a feast for the eyes and ears. Both Ewan and Nicole sing excellent(considering they had to song live; this movie was NOT a voiceover musical), and are both appealing to look at and listen to...But, if u don't have a great imagination or are creative (hey, some people aren't), then this movie isn't for you.

But after 45 minutes or so, the whole idea of this film began to wear a little thin. The whole \\"Hey, we've moderized some old songs and turned some modern ones into show tunes\\" really began to grate on my nerves.

As the former, I have no interest whatsoever discussing this movie as a spiritual experience or a deep love story. It is the world's greatest nightmare of MTV American style fable. I cannot believe Ewan did this film, in fact. Love is a construct. It is a contract based on social needs and norms and nothing else. Maybe in Tibet or with doped up people in Los Angeles or New York this movie could have appeal. Not with more sophisticated cultures such as the ones one finds in London and Paris."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could only take 30 minutes of this asinine movie","review":"It presents about the ugliest facade of Paris I've ever seen, it's scatter-brained with no real focus, or at least everytime you start to focus on something, something else gets shoved in your face. The sight of Nicole Kidman singing Madonna tunes then yelping around onstage to Spanish-style music was laughable at best (although I must admit she does have a nice voice). When you think of this movie, think of circus-style freak show meets the '70's drag scene. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Get Past The Music","review":"If you love music--and if you expect to be humming a new tune or two after seeing a musical--save yourself two hours and skip this film. I was so repulsed by the haphazard collage of contemporary music. If you closed your eyes, you'd swear you were listening to a B-grade (and very smarmy) lounge act. There is NOTHING original about the music, and aside from some extravagant visuals, NOTHING special about this movie. For a truly Oscar-worthy movie, try seeing 'Amelie'. And if you're looking for a ground-breaking, contemporary musical, check out 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch'."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of [junk]!","review":"This is one of the WORST of \\"good\\" movies of all time! Just the sight of Nicole Kidman lipcynching to \\"Like A Virgin\\" and poor, brilliant old Jim Broadbent lipsynching his way through some 90s dance tune was enough to turn my stomach. WHat were people thinking??!! How did the creators succeed in pitching this movie to the studio? As far as \\"good\\" movies go (meaning, well made and big budget with lots of support from the critics), this ranks right up there \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\"! It is truly horrible. Painful to sit through. If you want a movie musical, pick almost anything else in the whole wide world. Definitely pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or hate it...........","review":"I sat down to watch this film, as my girlfriend loves it, and I had heard quite a few things about it, at both ends of the spectrum. After sitting through two hours of an awful story that was blatantly lifted from \\"Shakespeare in Love,\\" I was in a bad mood. I realized I had seen what I consider to be one of the three worst films of all time. Now, people who are more into visuals and less into story will like this, as the visuals are fairly interesting. The music was interesting, since it was one medley after another, but I didn't find any of them very compelling or moving. The cast was great, but couldn't do much with such a cliche script. If I had my choice, I'd bury the master reel of this film at the bottom of the ocean, and pray that no other human has to endure the two hours of spoon fed schlock that I did. Some will claim to enjoy this film, but I just can't see how. It's reall, really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth paying any price!","review":"We rented it, thank God. Baz Luhrman has the Midas touch in reverse (if you can imagine what I mean). What a waste of young, lovely talent (Nicole Kidman) and the gifted Ewan McGregor. A fertile topic, Moulin Rouge and the delicious city of Paris that was wasted by Luhrman. His is a name we will avoid in the future. But why write more? ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Musical I Have Ever Seen!!!","review":"I have to start out by saying that Baz Luhrmann is now one of my favorite directors, next to Steven Speilberg and Stanley Kubrick. I loved this movie because it was DIFFERENT. Studios have been making remakes and sequels and it's just getting boring. Even though this movie was a remake, it had a different feeling to it. It is my favorite musical, next to The Sound Of Music.Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman should seriously get into singing. They brought out the most beautiful singing voices you could ever imagine. I own the CD and I love the songs that they compiled onto it, even though they forgot a lot of songs from the movie. They need to come out with a 2nd Volume of the soundtrack. I am hoping that the DVD will not only have the music video of \\"Lady Marmalade\\", but a commentary by Baz."},{"rating":"1","title":"They call this a musical?","review":"What in God's name has happened to Hollywood. What has happened to all the wonderful talent that they use to have? How can Hollywood call this a musical??The musical numbers are very chopy, the acting is something like i've never seen before,,,,,,,UNTALENTED people!!!I really hope this isn't the new direction that Hollywood is taking in new movie musicals because if it is \\"they don't have a clue.\\"If you read my review of \\"Dolly\\" and i gave that \\"1-star\\", this would be a minus \\"100\\".

Why on earth for?","review":"I could not wait to see this movie.You get lured in by certain takes in the pre-vieuws and by the music. Of course the costumes where great. The whole story is like a running joke of existing songs and a love story nobody really cares for. Truly it is now questionable whyso many other good movies do not get the nominations they deserve. Why was this one even mentioned?????Hopefully this dusty old Oscar institution will be modernized.Why not involve the largest group of judges: the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Excuse for a Movie","review":"This is an absolutely abysmal movie. During the early moments of the film I kept thinking surely it will break out of this intolerable and convoluted visionary and musical mess and give us intelligent film-making. It never did. How on earth this film has garnered any of the awards or nominations it has is beyond me. To attempt to juxtapose turn of the century Paris with Elton John and Madonna lyrics as well as references to tunes such as The Beatles' \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and the Sweet's \\"Love is Like Oxygen\\" is utterly ridiculous. Watching this film, or attempting to watch it (I made it only about half way through it), is an absolutely tortuous undertaking.Don't waste your time on this wretched mess!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The triumph of style over... just about everything else!","review":"Scary movie! The gushing reviews should be your warning...I thought it was going to be my kind of movie, but the only high-point was reached when the Fox intro was accompanied by a conductor with flailing arms in the first few seconds. It went steadily downhill from there. Good for a cinematography Oscar perhaps, but the movie was all-dressed-up with nowhere to go and nothing to say. God help us if this is the new musical style for the 21st Century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poke me in the eye with a sharp stick!!","review":"That would be more fun than watching this one. Get it over with quick so we can get on with our lives.This film was awful. I endured about 30 minutes of it. If there was an actual story, I was unable to detect it. The first 10 minutes were so confusing, I was wondering what we were actually watching....My wife didn't even like it. I was actually done with it at about 20 minutes. I endured an additional 10 minutes out of respect for her. She finally looked at me and said she was glad we didn't see it at the theatre. (Me Too)If you have to spend the money, nearly any other movie would be a better buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and intriguing.","review":"I admit, I picked up this movie because Nicole Kidman was in it. That said, I wasn't prepare for the elegance of the performances, which made her a moot point. Kidman's along with Ewan (way far from an Obi-Wan presario)chemistry lit up the screen and you can't help being drawn into the sometimes mythical atmosphere. The addition of an Elton John classic only heightened the power of Moulin Rouge. From the wardrobes to the songs, acting and choreography, the film achieved success. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was a little overdone in parts, but I recommend you pick this up and let that little glitch be: a moot point. If you're a musical fan, a closet art-film fan, or just want to curl up for some good entertainment...get it.<P..."},{"rating":"2","title":"new and different","review":"I loved this movie, it was fresh, funny, and kept reminding you that you are watching a movie, which is bold, but they pull it off. The best art is that which sparks controversy, and this one has to be one of the most controversial pieces of art from the movie industry. I've noticed that pretty much all the bad reviews were from men so I'm guessing they can't stand the fact that this film was made to be that, a film. Moulin Rouge wanted the boundry between the audience and the story to be prominent- sometimes pulling you in just to push you right back out-toying with the audience. Films that are strong enough to do this are amazing to watch emotionaly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this film less than one star","review":"This vile piece of schlock brings new meaning to the phrase \\"Please, make it stop!\\" Its vapid, mundane, cliched plot makes me want to retch. The acting was inferior to that of Mrs. Johnson's kindergarten class' production of \\"Gary the Bravest Tooth\\". There are plot holes you could ride a big glowing elephant through, and the only entertaining moment occurs when Nicole Kidman's two-dimensional, unholy character dies to the relief of the audience who by that point is embarrassed to have paid perfectly good money to watch that wretched drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!","review":"This is not a movie!

Doesn't get ANY WORSE then this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Musical Movie Ever","review":"The movie was so long and drawn out with nothing but songs. Even the first fifteen minutes had nothing but musicals. My entire family had to shut this movie off and return it for a full refund at our local rental store it was so bad.If you have a taste for cheesy musicals with a bad story line then this just might be your movie.The movie felt like it was so drawn out even in the first fifteen minutes of watching it! I would say this was the worst musical movie ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I just saw this stupid movie. I should have waited even longer than I did.

I can't overstate this enough that this movie totally and thoroughly stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this movie thinking it would be a classic Aussie production, but I was sadly disappointed. I absolutely hated it!I want to give it away to someone, but I am afraid I might lose a friendship"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another vote for crap","review":"It looks great, it sounds great, it does nothing for me at all. It goes nowhere, and it couldn't interest me in the characters at all. Cardboard cutouts have more personality. The storyline simply wasn't there. My ruler has more twists. Had I seen it in the theatre, I would have walked out and gone and seen whatever was playing in the next room. If you love musicals and are amused by rhe constant recyling of old pop music lyrics in a new context, by all means, you'll love this one, but before you buy it, rent it. It's very easy not to like. We hit stop with over an hour remaining, and I don't expect we'll put it back in the DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFUL!","review":"This is one of the most unwatchable messes ever to be captured on film. From the manic pacing, the endless close-ups, the childish storyline and singing of the same Elton John song (\\"Your Song\\") a gazillion times, this disaster is nothing more than a 2 hour MTV video.Rodgers & Hammerstein must be rolling in their graves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but random scenes and songs tossed together","review":"\\"Moulin Rouge\\"is nothing but a bunch of random scenestossed together with random songs slapped on.The costumeswere from different eras,too(like the 1920's showgirl costumes).If this is supposed to take place in 1900,why are therethings like 1930's style buildings and songs that camefrom the 40's,50's and 60's?The guy in the ringmasteroutfit was terribly out-of-place for a club like that-itlooks like someone yanked him out of a circus tent andstuck him at the nightclub/bar.The actors yell their linesinstead of just talking normally,and the acting is WAYoverdone.I don't remember who directed this movie,but they dida horrible job!The only thing this movie has going for it isthe songs.That's all.If you want \\"Moulin Rouge\\",I suggest justbuying the CD,and forget about seeing the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic Pretentious Grandstanding","review":"What a Bomb ! What personal insecurity leads \\"Baz\\" Luhrmann tomake such a piece of pretentious grandstanding ? And why doeshe call himself \\"Baz\\" ? Isn't Baz a discredited slang name forBarry that was rarely used in Australia in the 1960s ?What does a song about New Orleans have to do with Paris ? TheFrench must hate this film, if for no other reason than the factthat the French have reasonably good taste in pop music - unlikeAustralia and the USA. The awful, banal whitebread music on thisfilm is typical to what one gets on dreadful Australian andAmerican radio - and the public loves it. Pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moulin Rouge","review":"This was one of the worst movies that I have ever attempted to see. 1 star is much more than it deserves. The ONLY thing good about this was the surprise that Ewan McGregor could sing. At one point I actually had to plug my ears to keep them from bleeding. The true hero of this movie was the \\"consumption\\" that ended the howling of Satine. On a positive note no one can say Roxanne better than Jacek Koman. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody wake me up!","review":"People say all the time the words, \\"This is the worst movie I've ever seen!\\" Well I can honestly say that about this movie. I must have missed something because it made no sence. Its like the director had alot of creative ideas and instead of trying to create a plot, he just crammed all of these ideas and creative scenes into a movie! I was bored out of my mind sitting through this thing. Did you ever have a bad dream in which alot of things crazy things happened that didnt make any sence? Thats exactly what this movie was like, a bad dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as bad as bad as it gets","review":"What amazes me most about this film was that it did so much right.Was it visually stunning? Indeed.Was the acting good? It was great. I didn't believe Nicole Kidman could give such a performance. I still think a stunt-double must have done the acting parts for her.Unfortunately, no amount of polish can make up for the fact that the framework of this film is rotten. The story is completely uninspired. And the songs, well... let's just say I was expecting to hear the cast break out into a Boz Scaggs tune at any time (that's NOT a compliment).It amazes me that anyone could find this film enjoyable, and that is not sarcasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR $$$$$$$$$","review":"What is the big deal with this movie?!? I've had more fun at the dentist. I could only stand it for 30 minutes. I knew it would be a musical- the music is ok.

Actually, he's a latecomer if such were his intention. The brilliant under-appreciated \\"Pennies From Heaven,\\" with Bernadette Peters and Steve Martin, either of whom can act and sing circles around Kidman and McGregor, is the film that actually deserves the ravesthis tiresome eyesore is now unjustly receiving.

Maybe tucked away in some of the storyboards? Maybe in some obscure Easter Egg?I give the movie two stars primarily for the fine, sharp cinematography of Donald McAlpine and beautiful production design by Catherine Martin, but the director Baz Luhrmann, though a very capable producer (having birthed this 127 minute long MTV video), is cleary suffering from \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\" syndrome. And so it seems are most who fawn over this paean to Attention Deficit Disorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hodge-podge of stuff!","review":"This IS a \\"like or dislike\\" movie. I'm on the dislike side. All the talk about \\"Moulin Rouge\\" bringing back the musical genre is a bunch of hooey. The songs are relatively recent songs originally recorded by Elton John, Madonna, etc., and with these non-singers attempting them adds even more irritation to watching and listening to this film. The acting is okay, but I don't think it's breakthrough for anyone. After all the hype--and I do like \\"true\\" musicals (original songs, etc.)--I was completely disappointed. In fact, I watched it a second time to see if I was missing something. I didn't. Those who praise this movie as a musical haven't seen the great musicals of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it all.","review":"Being a fan of musicals this dissapointed me greatly the lack of a good script and songs made it sink to the level of badness it achieved.

On the bright side, the art direction is very good. I love the colors, typography and some of the special effects... to an extent. The storyline is so riduculous that it comes across as late-show camp. The film's downside is enhanced by unlikeable characters and pathetic overacting. What is especially irritating though are the song and dance numbers. Mixing pop music with a peroid drama is an interesting idea but executed, it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I must attack the people who made this movie, and those of you who liked it. It is truely a piece of trash. The characters are totally boring and undeveloped. Maybe I am asking for to much? How could they possibly develop characters when the movie is nothing more that a splatter of different scenes fused together with no specific thoughts or reasons. This movie doesn't make a mark anywhere except for the toilet. It is horrible and the music is very much out of place. Much like this movie would have been if I was unlucky enough to have bought it. I shudder at the thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!!!!!!","review":"What is up with everybody saying how great this movie is. I sat in the front row with a friend and we couldnt stand it.

I lost interest in the film in the first 20 minutes, but stuck with it to the very last to see if there was anything redeeming about this \\"musical.\\" There was not. From the first surreal, frenzied, overpowering production number to the last breath of the heroine, it was a mish-mash of nothing more than whirling colors, music that drowned out the vocals, and pathetic acting.

A bastardization and a not very entertaining one, you got it. The only thing entertaining was the rapid pace which left you wondering what it was you'd just seen.

Just rent anything else, eat 6 candy bars, drink a case of Coke, and be sure to watch whatever you rent on fast forward. There, you have the general experience. Try to have a few photos of Nicole Kidman nearby, too, to calm yourself down occasionally. To be fair, the film must have been a nightmare to make and edit, and Luhrmann has done an estimable job with that, but it's ultimately one of those experiments that I'm not sure anyone had to really make.

And it's an interesting idea here to do a sort-of send-up of the movie musical. But come on, Baz--to stay engaged, we need to care about these characters, and we don't. Again, it's kinda fun to time-trip with music from today set in a turn-of-the-century (the PREVIOUS turn-of-the-century)fantasy, but couldn't you pick some more worthy examples than sappy, early Elton John--especially to be the film's signature song? Yes, Nicole can sing, but she has little else to do. I'm amazed she got an Oscar nod for this non-performance. I keep hearing that Moulin Rouge marks the rebirth of the movie musical.

It is an outrage, but not the outrage most reviewers think it is. The nominating committee was half right. It neglected to nominate Luhrmann; it ought also to have given the film a pass.Luhrmann is, it seems to me, the Cecil B. Demille of the current batch of MTV-inspired directors and his gimmicky film is as likely to be well-regarded twenty-thirty years hense as are the over-blown Demille creations. Both made films that are vastly overstated, under-acted and over-rated.Finally, while I'm a Nicole Kidman fan, if she deserved a nomination as best actress, it ought to have come for her performance in the better -- by far -- Other film she made last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"The order came on time but when I tried to play it in my DVD player it wouldn't work.

Show them a scene or two. I'll watch anything with Nicole Kidman, and this is very good !Tell your Congressman to legalize Absinthe, so folks can enjoy the movie as it was probably meant to be viewed. I hear Marilyn Manson has the good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amaing Movie","review":"Ok i will admit the first 1/2 hour is wire wind .. but after that it becomes clear this is a amazing movie .. the visuals are amazing and the story is heart warming and heart breaking at the same time .. it is why we watch movies .. it is worth watching 3 or 4 times"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance and you will love it","review":"I saw this movie in the theater and on dvd. I have worked in and studied musical theater for years and do not typically enjoy movie musicals, because you can never connect to a tv as you can to seeing something live. During the first few minutes I was a bit overwhelemed by the camera shots but soon was able to get into the story. I recomend seeing this movie twice, the 1st time you have to get use to the visual experience but when you watch it again you can fall in love with the story. This movie is very different and refreshing. The plot is simple but it is visually and emotionally stimulating. Even my husband loved it and his idea of a great movie classic is James Bond or Adam Sandler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moulin Rouge, a Waste","review":"If all one can say in favor of a movie is that the costumes were great, this is a sad commentary about the film. What a waste of resources -- time, talent, money, etc.! Don't waste yours on seeing this picture! Even when the viewer can begin to possibly enjoy the plot of this seemingly endless show, there are stupid interruptions with the actors trying to sing and/or be kitchy.This film is a poor imitation of other shows, a \\"La Boheme-meets-The-Rocky-Horror-Picture-Show\\" badly combined. Go rent the videos of either, before spending your money on this bomb.I first viewed this film as part of a preview audience many months before the movie was released. A large number of audience members who hadn't fallen asleep, actually walked out of this free screening! That says a lot about this picture. Even for free, people couldn't stick around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was SPECTACULAR SPECTACULAR!","review":"I just got back from seeing this movie at the theatre and I can't put into words how good it is. If you don't like musicals, you shouldn't go see this--it is very much a modern day musical. Nicole Kidman proves to be a magician of many tricks once again. Her talent is heightened to a new level. Ewan McGregor shines very brightly, even in the light of Ms. Kidman. He is gorgeous and talented, all in one. They both have extremely pleasant voices to listen to. All in all, everything was awesome, to say the least. Be ready for continual business on the screen-- your eyes really don't get a break throughout the movie. The plot moved along nicely, not lacking for anything, not dragging. I didn't once look at my watch, like I do in many recent movies. As soon as this comes out to pre-order, I'll be ordering it! It is a MUST HAVE in every music-buff's collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Visually brilliant throughout, wonderful eye candy. Every other aspect of this film is shockingly bad. Several scenes were laugh out loud awful. The 1st disc has several nice features. The 2nd disc never entered the player. I forced myself to finish the film and almost stopped several times. I was pulled along just to see how much worse it could get and was not denied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get away...fast!!!","review":"A daring film that ultimately fails miserably. It is painful to watch only partly due to Kidman's lack of musical talent. There are no reedeming qualities. The editing will give you headaches. The side plots are like nightmares. The movie tries too hard to establish itself as the next Rocky Horror Picture Show or Priscilla Queen of the Desert at the cost of quality. Don't just turn away from this film, run away and fast!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Proves That Oscars Are Bought","review":"I wish I could have given this no stars. Unquestionably one of the 10 worst movies ever made, although it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie. A lacerated video clip more like it. Nominated for a bunch of Oscars, together with A BEAUTIFUL MIND(another overrated dose of sugar), it proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that those awards are completely political & utterly misguided. As many will agree, CHICAGO was everything this dismal effort so desperately yearned to be. A girlfriend of mine told me she cried when Satine(Nicole Kidman)died. I was incredulous. Who cared???? (I was overjoyed since it meant the ordeal was nearly over) With Richard Roxburgh apparently suffering from constipation coupled with Tourette's & Jim Broadbent(usually brilliant)doing some sort of Quentin Crisp/Tootsie impersonation, I would equate this experience with a 3 day migraine. What in God's name were they smoking in the editing room?"},{"rating":"1","title":"most overrated film of the year","review":"I have read the glowing terms that other reviewers have used to describe this film, and I am amazed. I don't care how \\"groundbreaking\\" the attempt was, the resulting film was so disjointed and boring that it was only the second film in my life that I could not sit through. After a half hour of it, I had to turn it off. This was the first DVD I tried to watch on my new player, and it was so bad that I had to go and rent another one just to take the bad taste out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated every second of it.","review":"Absolutely the worst movie of 2001, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen, PERIOD. Even the beautiful Nicole Kidman couldn't save the movie. When I saw it in the theater, I noticed that people kept getting up and leaving. At first I thought they might just be going to the concession stand, but as more and more people trickled out and never came back, I realized they were leaving because it was truly an awful movie. Less than half the original audience was there by movie's end. If I would've been by myself, I would've left also. Come to find out, my viewing companion felt the same way I did! Too bad we didn't speak about it during the movie, so we could've left and spared ourselves the misery of watching such tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moulin Rouge all the way!!","review":"Well this film is perfect for anyone who is a true romantic at heart! It makes me cry every time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Funny French Fairies .....","review":"WELL! I avoided this one like the plague, just couldn't accept the concept of dove-tailing modern music ala Madonna, Elton John, etc. into the vivid world [thank you John Huston - the 1952 version] of whores, pimps, dancers, singers, drug addicts, alcoholics and one or two nice people ...... IF you've moved through that area [Blanche,Pigalle,Sacre Couer,DuVallon] you'll recognize it!YOU will either love this crazy movie - OR hate it - you cannot be luke warm about this one. MYself? Naturally loved it, cannot get enough! It's brilliant DVD strategy - an experience unto itself, a Super 2 disc set with extended dance sequences, etc. etc. etc.Always versatile, NICOLE KIDMAN vividly reminds one of Rita Hayworth or is it Moira Shearer? BUT she still owns Satine - a rare beauty. An Award-Winning performance!Ewan McGregor is also excellent as the naive love interest.Bravo Baz Luhrmann!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF you can last throught the first 20 minutes...","review":"A great idea which does turn into a pretty good movie once the first 20 minutes of chaotic jumble is past. Luckily I sat through the first 20 minutes AND made it to the real film which calms down a bit and takes on a decidedly better tone as the plot develops.This is fantastic cinematography, creative \\"lyrical recycling\\" from many pop anthems of the last 30 years, and an inspiring love story to boot.I was put off initially by the down-the-rabbit-hole approach of the beginning where I found the non-stop movement to be annoying, but after that I ended up really getting into this movie. I found the ending very emotional!Check it out, I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best musical i've seen in a loooong time","review":"This film is truly excellent. I was unsure at first about seeing it, but I was accompanied by a friend who had seen it, at that time, 8 times before. She vouched for its greatness. I discovered that not only can Ewan McGregor sing (and very well), but Nicole Kidman has some pipes on her! The story is amazing, and I can't wait until it comes out on video!!Ewan McGregor's character, Christian, tells the story after everything has happened, after his true love has died. Its a beautiful story of true love, even though sometimes we just want to yell \\"Christ Satine! Run off with him!!\\" Makes me want to name my children Christian and Satine...everything in this movie is so perfect, and the only way I keep from going insane before it comes out on video is to listen to the soundtrack at every chance I get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Kidman, McGrgor and Luhrmann combine in a brilliant whirl of vibrant colours and outstanding dances. Australians Nicole and Luhrmann have shown the world some of their personal best in this movie( and Ewan isn't bad either!) A fab. DVD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews by FreaK","review":"Well, what can I say, it isn't very good. The music was great, and I liked the costume design, but the story *cringes* is different...it didn't make much sense at all. I would expect better with Nicole Kidman, but it isn't good, that is all I have to say I guess. It was up for best picture, but isn't nearly as good as A Beautiful Mind or Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie I've seen this year.","review":"This is the best movie I've seen this year and it's one the greatest that I've seen in my life. Everything is perfect, the direction, the acting, the singing. It's been quite a time since a musical hit the screens and Baz Luhrmann has done a great job bringing back to life this genre. This movie deserves a million awards and lots of money, for being the great movie it is. Better than ... Pearl Harbor, Jurassic Park III, Planet Of The Apes, etc. That all have grossed over 160M only in the US. Mindless movies. This movie will touch you deeply and will make you want to go watch it a couple of times, I'm hoping for the DVD to come out soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I say?","review":"What more can I say?This movie re-wrote history. It brought back the movie musical.Today, movie musicals are arriving head strong in Hollywood. It's like Hollywood and Broadway are having a love fest.

It gave me chills when I first heard it.PLEASE NOTE: You CANNOT buy the sheet music for these songs. The only song available for purchase in sheet music form is Come What May. This is because Come What May is the ONLY original song from the show. All others are old\\"er\\" pop songs, written by major artists over the past 30 years. Madonna, Queen, and Elton John are some of the artists whose material is re-mastered and covered in this film.BUY ME!\\"The best thing in the world is to love, and be loved in return...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the Worst of 2001?","review":"Ok...maybe not the worst movie of 2001..but the worst of the ones I saw. I tried to give it another chance on DVD. I can now say it was the worst DVD I have so far seen in 2002. The story line..and I use the phrase loosely..is so bland that it will put you to sleep.It did have great photography though it was the one area in which this film could be termed outstanding. This film is a great example of why the musical, in film form, died. If this film is an attempt to bring it back, well they surely have failed. Leave the musicals to Broadway and live productions and spare us the film makers attempts at so called \\"art\\". This was a very hard film for me to take as I am a big Nicole Kidman fan. Most of my friends would say I would pay [money] to watch her brush her teeth for 2+ hours...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frenzied noisy mess","review":"In this age of noise above subtlety and charm, this music video was a fitting touchstone. It is not a movie in the conventional sense but a jarring montage of fast moving glaring images and blaring sounds.

Unless you are inthe 10-14 year old age range, OR you are prepared for a2 hour movie with the maturity level and plot complexityof a music video--- This film is a ***complete*** waste of your time!It is in the same league with Bugs Bunny meets MichaelJordan and films like that. Some of the dance sequenceswould be more appropriate in a horror movie, or somewierd sort of a \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\"-esque,hideous film.Maybe this film was made by someone who absolutely hatesthe real Moulin Rouge, and wants everyone else to hateit as well.I have seen thousands of films, 5% I loved, 90% Imostly enjoyed. Only 2 ever got a bad review from me:Eraserhead and Moulin Rogue.This film makes me want to vomit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moulin Rouge","review":"This is unmistakenly the best movie I have ever seen. In the first 10 minutes it assaults all your senses, with nerve wracking pleasure. Just keep an open mind and your eyes open and absorb all the motion, music, sounds and its beauty.

This is truly an exciting movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INTRIGUING AND HEARTFUL FILM!!!!","review":"I just saw this movie and I absolutely loved it!!!

The plot was great and the movie was also very emotional. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAAAAAT MOVIE","review":"This is one of the BEST movies I have ever seen. The music was incredible. The directing was out of this world. Nicole & Ewan's performances were amazing. I never thought Nicole had it in her.They both are blessed with beautiful voices that they show off in this flick. It is a must buy for any collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for those with a short attention span","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, but it was not one you could watch while doing 5 other things. I sat down ready to watch a good movie and I was not disappointed. It was in no way what I was expecting but I found myself laughing and amazed at the way the most appropriate songs were thrown in at the most appropriate time. My husband could not get into the movie for anything, he's not into the singing/dancing type thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This film/musical is a must see! It is visually incredible..I was literally trembling when I left the theater (I have just seen it in New York). It has great romance, drama, comedy and fantastic music! See it with an open mind...modern music in a \\"period\\" movie may be a bit anachronistic, but this movie grabs you and goes beyond. It was thoroughly enjoyable, unique, and fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smorgasbord of sights and sounds","review":"Moulin Rouge is spectacular! Without question, one of the most entertaining movies in years with surprising performances from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. If the characterizations are a bit thin, the incredible energy of this movie more than compensates. The anachronistic music, rather than detracting as some reviewers have claimed, is one of the more amusing aspects. Moulin Rouge is a gluttonous smorgasbord for the senses-colorful and raucous with bearly a moment to relax. Kidman is deliciously manipulative, McGregor is perfect as the breathless innocent playwright, and the supporting cast fills in the slower moments. Moulin Rouge may set the standard for a new breed of movie musical, and if it does, it will take its place not just as great entertainment, but also as a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intensely Colorful, Enjoyable Moulin Rouge","review":"I was not prepared for the intensity of color, noise and closeups that begin the movie, but they worked - they took me right into the time and place. I liked the caring group of misfit friends and thought Nicole Kidman & Ewan McGregor singing quite believable, fun and heartbreaking. The movie made me smile and laugh often, the contemproary music an added kick. Just a plain good flick. What a movie should be, entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ewan and Nicole really make this Movie GREAT","review":"This movie is awsome.. i've seen it 3 times in theaters and am willing to go see it many many more times.

They are Definatly up for Best Actor and best actress...."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!... PURE TORTURE!","review":"Now I know what TRUE madness it. The theatre was empty during this whole movie from so many people walking out. I am appalled at the amount of people giving this good reviews. I guess everyone praises movies that drive them crazy so much to the point where they start to believe they like it!I've never seen such a flawed movie in my life. What's all thisabout a standing ovation and clapping between numbers? Gimme a break.2001 was the worst year ever for movies.

This is true, just as you either have a brain or you don't. Watching this movie was like watching hyperactive 8 year-olds on speed doing some sort of sock-puppet routine in front of the mirror. It boggles the mind that some talented actors (and I don't mean Leguizamo) participated in this nonsense. And about Leguizamo....what drug would cause someone's brain to choose him to play Toulouse-Lautrec?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALLEZ VOUS ON","review":"WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS HAS TO ONE OF THE WORSE MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.IT REMINDS ME OF ONE OF THE ITALIAN ART FILMS OF THE 60\\"S , FULL OF \\"SOUND AND FURY\\" SIGNIFYING NOTHING.

I did not watch the entire thing so my view is biased on superficial impressions of what little I did see. I don't care for musicals (usually), and I'm not a fan of Nicole Kidman so I had NO interest in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"a joke","review":"After seeing a costume layout of this movie in Vogue with Nicole, and being an artist, photographer, costume designer and lover of most anything French, I awaited this movie with great anticipation.Well, I hated it.It's dizzyingly fast paced flash+dash editing made me nauceous. Not one frame lasts long enough for my eyes to focus. The songs, many borrowed from other musicals, are presented in half people/ half animation form, and look ridiculous. It seemed like they couldn't decide what they wanted this film to be.The screenplay is based on the story of a real life dancer in Paris, but what is a real tragedy of life cut short is here turned into a comic travesty.The only good thing is that Nicole can actually sing, but her costar cannot.I walked out half-way through and asked for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too contemporary for the period.","review":"Loved the costumes, especially the lingerie but I was not satisfied with the historical presentation of that decade, Moulin Rouge. The music was too contemporary for that particular time, the 1890s. I thought it would have been a drama based musical centering around the night club life. But my expectations were not as what I predicted it to be. This movie may have garnered the respect and high praise of the critics but to some viewers, it wasn't that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie, ever!","review":"If you like movies at all then you have to see Moulin Rouge or else your viewing experience will not be complete.The beautiful imagery mixed with the wonderful sound makes it a delight to watch. The way they combine modern songs with a timeless theme makes is wonderful to watch. This movie has comedy, drama, saddness, action, singing, dancing and the best costumes.Nicole Kidman is gorgeous and Ewan McGregor is timeless.This is a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaack! Doesn't even deserve a full star!","review":"Oh this movie was horrible! I 100% agree with Dr. Ravna (see review below)--this movie was awful, awful, awful. Even though I was impressed with the vocal talent of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, I don't know how anybody liked it, and I do not understand how it possibly won the awards it has. I only know one person who liked it (and more because she's a fan of Nicole Kidman and Christina Aguilera who sang the title track along with 3 others) but everyone else that I know, ranging from children to professionals detested this despicible waste of time, money, and effort. In short, it's much to glitzy, fake, uncomfortable, awkward, unwatchable, and unbearable. I don't care if the whole world disagrees with me--I will never subject myself to this cinematic atrocity again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I am a Nicole Kidman fan. I like the soundtrack to Moulin Rouge. However, I must say this is the most ill-directed, ill-conceieved piece of trash to come out of Hollywood in the past seventy-five years.

Don't even waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrrrggghhh!","review":"Okay, first off I would like to say that these oh so referentially hip and ironic types pieces of pop culture fluff are wearing dreadfully thin. The singing in this film is amateurish, but I could have dealt with that (as I did in \\"Everyone Says I Love You\\".) The visuals are pretty, but they are candy and are ultimately empty images. The story is a pure drag with terribly slow pacing for having such hyperactive editing techniques. The acting is truly awful, from all parties involved. I could not suffer through this turgid movie one more time. Maybe if you dig on movies like \\"Shrek\\" and \\"10 things I hate about you\\", this is your kind of flick. Or maybe if you like cinematography for it's own sake you will like the stylishness of the shots. I found this movie aggravating to no end.

I won't say I hated it, but I sure didn't love it. It's too busy, frantic and noisy. The story is pretty thin and predictable. The characters are mostly caricatures.

The pan-in/pan-out technique was more irritating than anything else, I had no sympathy for any of the characters and could care less if they tried to bring the sound of music to 1890's Paris.Badly produced, excellent acting, maddening cinematography and a poor excuse for 2 hours of my time.Kidmann can find better uses for her talent than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Hey we're the Monkees","review":"If you saw the movie and liked it then sure...buy the DVD.

First I could not understand why they didn't come up with original music, they had to borrow from \\"The Sound of Music.\\" Are they kidding? Diamonds are Girl's Best Friend? And when did rap come in to play in the 1900's? The camera action was so fast I had to go in to slow play to see what I had missed.I had to turn the volume up to hear what the actors were sayingand then when the music came on it was so loud and I had to turn it down. Actors should take alocution lessons and learn to project their lines so we can understand what they are saying. And as for their singing, Nicole and Ewan sounded like two wimps.Well others may like it, but I am from the old school when musicals were made to be entertaining and the voices could be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undoubtedly, The Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"... and that includes Meatballs II.Baz when around shooting off his mouth prior to the Oscars, and he ruined his own opportunity to garner so much as a nomination for his direction: in his words, he had created the best film since CITIZEN KANE, and, with such disrespect for classic cinema, the Academy disagreed resolutely. His arrogance killed his opportunity to be viewed as a visionary, and this film, especially, should be dismissed as a stock production best left to very lewd community theatres in lesser California communities.The only redeeming quality the film offers: Ewan McGregor can sing, and he sings with a passion. Had the film centered on his character instead of the stock players, MOULIN ROUGE might've worked. Since Baz couldn't contain his arrogance, he's done little more than provided 'the alternative lifestyle community' with a regular rental and a film that the rest of society will rightfully ignore."},{"rating":"1","title":"sensory overload","review":"I did not enjoy this movie at all. There was sensory overload from the beginning of the film - with gaudy costumes, overacting, loud music, and no central theme. I did not find myself attached to the film - rather I wanted to fast forward through many of the scenes, particularly the singing ones (which practically encompass the whole movie).This movie was disconcerting on all levels. I would have rather watched the movie in mute than listen to the singing dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moulin Rouge Review","review":"The editing is fast-paced and that's not a good thing. Maybe in a music video,it would work but not here. The writing is terrible at best. 99.9% of the story makes little-to-no sense. Even WCW during it's dying years made more sense then this film. Half of the cast is either dumb or unlikable. It uses copyrighted songs and tries to make them thier own with little success. 99.9% of the acting is very over-the-top to the 5th power. The goodsides are that the settings are stylish,songs are pretty good and the dance numbers are fun to watch. I give this film a 3 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular, Spectacular","review":"Okay, I admit it. When the Absinthe fairy appeared, I was hooked.

Luhrmann keeps piling up bad 70s pop songs, relentless kitsch, bad 80s pop songs, dizzying camerawork, bad 90s pop songs, huge dance numbers, bad Rogers and Hammerstein songs and narcoleptic Argentinians, one upon the other, until he creates this massive, frenetic, rococo tower of crazed pop images that lists wildly back and forth in the wind, but somehow manages never to collapse upon itself. It's a gorgeous, sprawling, insane mess that completely impressed me with its audacity, energy and originality.And, of course, now I'm gonna think of Jim Broadbent every time I hear a Madonna song . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular! Spectacular! - Nothing But Spectacular!","review":"This movie is one of the most refreshing films I have seen in along, long, long time. It has color and style and energy and music and pacing and performances and more and more.This is the kind of film you'll either love or hate. No middle ground here. Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman give outstanding performaces. All the supporting cast are just as brillaint. The sets and costumes are magnificent and the cinemantography extremely vibrant and exciting.This movie is so stylized - that hoping it will remain one of a kind.The DVD edition is \\"Spectacular\\"! The commentary, bunus footage, music videos and the unique interactive menus are brillaint. This is a must in every ones collection. I had just as much fun discovering all the goodies on this DVD as I did watching the actual movie.I still am watching it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I'm very unhappy with this movie. It had a lot of potential but listening to classic songs re-done poorly and jumbled together was absolutely painful. The singing and acting were fine - not stellar but fine. I am more disappointed in the fact that I had to hear many of my favorite songs from the 70's and 80's completely butchered. What happened to the days when musicals had original music and lyrics?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever made","review":"with awful singing and dancing and awful performances this is the worst movie ever made , Chicago is alot better , Forget this try hard musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes, just yikes! A movie way out of it's time.","review":"Ummm.... I watched this movie at work one day because we had to preview it for our surround sound display and my boss and we were at a loss. We had trouble following the storyline because we're not used to watching musicals. But overall I turned it off and threw it in the trash because it was soo aweful. The only way I can describe it as an \\"artsy ditsy touchy-feely\\" movie which is one of those movies where you have to be so-called artistic to understand the basic concept of it.All in all: Guys, don't get this one. It's one of those chick flicks that us guys are forced to watch with our girlfriends."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT! Could not finish it","review":"WOW I think what surprises me more than anything is the number of GOOD reviews this thing got! This has got to be the worst piece of \\"entertainment\\" I have ever seen! I never got over the opening credits, when a subtitle tells us the setting is Paris in the 1800s or something.. and then they proceed to sing all these 1999-2001 songs... and i was left thinking.. what the H@LL is going on here! Are we in a timewarp or what! My friend kept telling me.. it will get better, just wait. But after 30 minutes they were doing the same nonsense--singing noisily and I can't see even a vague resemblence of a plot. Needless to say I watched not another second of this garbage. As soon as I saw \\"from the maker of Romeo and Juliet\\" I should have turned it off.. That was also unbearable. What I can't get is that some people actually like this guy's style?!?! All I can say is WATCH IT before you BUY IT!!! Don't make my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not a film of great imagination","review":"Here is an example of a film that looks great but is a terrible mess. If you feel that elton john madonna et al need more residuals ($$) for their music, then perhaps you will like this film, but my husband and I watched half of it in great discomfort waiting for some kind of shift in its lack. We noticed so many problems with editing, script, song choices, and voice overs for all the songs we ceased to care about the beautiful sets, actors and costumes. We wanted it to be fun and waited for it to be fun, but ultimately felt that our tastes, senses and intelligence had been insulted. I can see that many many liked this spectacle, so I just wanted to add that I feel it may be the worst big budget film I have ever seen. I wish I could give it zero stars. This is not a successful musical in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst dog ever...","review":"Beautiful costumes. So what! Stolen music. Never mind that, they probably wanted to save money or didn't want to hire a good composer. Beautiful dance sequences destroyed by poor camera work. When skillful dancers are doing their thing I don't want to see ceseless closeups of heads or feet. I want good lighting, and love to see the whole figure, not a palette of color from 50 feet up in the air. (As an example of good camera work for dace sequences, \\"Center Stage\\" comes to mind). For the first 42 minutes of \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" the camera never pauses more than 5 seconds on anything. When it does, it's such a relief you feel like crying, but you can't because you already have a terrible head ache. Oh, the plot is nice, but that's too little too late. This dog will go to the pound in a short time. It's an atrocity done with a lot of promotion. They wanted to buy an Oscar. Fortunatelly they didn't, but a lot of people was fooled by the hype, including myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Campy but not in a good way.","review":"Moulin Rouge starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is a doomed love story set to classic pop songs. I really wanted to like this colorful musical but I think this film would have been better if the songs were set to an original score, hearing songs I heard a thousand times made watching this film seem silly and pretenious. I don't think Kidman deserved to be nominated for an Oscar, that same year she was absolutely brilliant in The Others so I don't know what all the fuss was about? She's not good here, her singing is ok - nothing spectacular. The Like A Virgin performance is kinda cute but otherwise Moulin Rouge is just average."},{"rating":"2","title":"I diasagree with everyone","review":"I thought this movie was really good. I heard from a lot of people thought it was bad but I liked it. It was a different style of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern musical set in the past","review":"If the title of this review sounds like an oxymoron, then you get some idea of the dichotomies in the film. This is a weirdly wonderful, artistic film which delights the eye and the ear, and plays on the viewer's emotions. The plot concerns a young writer (Ewan McGregor) who is mistaken for a duke by a beautiful courtesan (Nicole Kidman). She falls in love with the writer, while playing up to the duke so that he will bankroll the play which the young man is writing for her. The play parallels their real lives in this cat-and-mouse game where the young couple try to hide their affair from the duke. Finally the duke catches on and threatens to kill the writer if the courtesan doesn't leave him. McGregor and Kidman display great emotional intensity and beautiful singing voices in their starring roles, and the supporting parts are also well played. Throw away your old preconceptions of what a musical is like and enjoy the beauty and poetry of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"An odd hodge podge of unpleasantness.

Instead, I got Madonna."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to art and intelligence","review":"This movie is a travesty. I am sure those who liked it were either stoned or bribed. I think to really appreciate this movie you need to have 75% of of your brain removed. It is camp, cliched and unimaginative. I will never watch a movie by Baz Luhrmann again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Battlefield Earth look like Oscar material.","review":"Like Titanic, this was a movie that I intented to enter my grave having never seen. Unfortunately I ended up watching it.That's two hours of my life I want back.This movie is the most disjointed piece of trash I have ever seen. The cinematography alone is enough to make me hate it, but add to that the plot that seemed to have been created while the writer was on some sort of illegal substance[...].P>I'll admit that the costumes and sets were great. Fine.But everything else was so bad that it made up for it. I can't see how anyone likes this movie, or how anyone would be proud to have been in it. I just kept expecting that it would get better, but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macabre","review":"What are the folks out in tinsel land thinking? Moulin Rouge was awful--yes, just awful, not even worthy of the one star I have given it. Yes, it may be an extravaganza, but what does this word really mean? Is it meant to portray this garish concoction of fin-du-ciecle cabaret pierced with groteseque 21st century sexuality and voiced with the modern songs of Elton John etc. ? The skewed camera angles peeking up the voluminous skirts revealing fish-netted thunder-thighs (Ugh) gave me the frantic, queasy feeling that I was participating in a stale rendition of a neverending Mardi Gras gone awry after four or five days guzzling of cheap beer.The star goes to poor Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--I have to wonder why people of this acting caliber would ever want to be in such a film unless it was done solely for charity.Relieved that I did not see this one on the big screen as there would have been absolutely no escape other than leaving the theatre before the film's end."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOULAH LOOSE","review":"This attempt at Fellini,3 Stooges,Beatles,Monty Python,etc..was embarrassing to even watch..Maybe if I would have been \\"totaled\\" on absinthe a message would have been received,but, not from this movie. Even the photography was bad. If I had rotten fruit I would have thrown it at the screen. \\"The double hook\\"..smelled.I asked for my money back..even tho' I had free passes!! A total waste of time..I'll wait for the Crazy Horse or La Barone!!Show it without sound or color and see if it follows Hitchcock's \\"Rules\\"....Put the people responsible for this \\"movie\\" up against the wall and shoot them with their own shots...and make them doubles!!Use the future DVDs for coasters!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced and insulting","review":"This movie is so forced, trying to be camp, that it really is manipulative and insulting. Who wants to listen to people read Madonna lyrics to each other? The \\"Warner Brothers meets Rocky Horror\\" musical numbers are inane. Don't bother, and don't believe the awestruck reviews. This movie has beautiful cinmatography slapped over a seething bit of nuclear waste for a script and for music.The funniest thing about this movie is that, apparently, the director takes it all seriously. Sheesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful!","review":"A melange of paper-thin plot, garish turn-of-the-century costumes and contemporary music (melange is, of course, the French word for \\"hopeless mess presented artistically\\"). The Hollywood hype machine seems desperate to laud this drivel until Niclole Kidman receives an Oscar (perhaps part of her divorce settlement with Tom Cuise, or perhaps just public sympathy run amok) but don't you be fooled. If you feel absolutely compelled to waste two hours of your life, try David Lynch's equally stylish but incomprehensible two-hour Twin Peaks finale instead. It also has midgets and velvet drapes, but at least the midgets talk backwards and no one sings \\"The Sound of Music.\\" Or drink a bottle of absinthe instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moulin Rouge...What a Diassappointment","review":"Three words for this movie...I HATED IT!!! I bought this movie without seeing it cause my friend said I would LOVE it...so I took his advise. BIG MISTAKE....I couldn't even sit through the first 30 mins. I would have walked out of the theater had I seen it while it was there. Now my biggest problem is how to get rid of this aweful DVD and replace it with something I'll enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"I have been to the real Moulin Rouge in Paris, it wasn't has glamorous as the movie was, in the real place all the girls were half naked. This was definitly a lovely movie, true drama, a wild ride of imaginations all the way. The singing, the dancing, the story less so, but still nice, and the acting. Nicole Kidman did some of her best movieing, Ewan Mcgregor nost as good, but the rest of the cast was impressive. One problem, What was up with Mcgregor when he was supposingly writing the Story of Moulin Rouge, the story that we are watching? How could he have known what happened when he wasn't present? And how could he have told them to us? This significantly reduced the realism of the story, and perfection of the movie. Still, this was a tremendous film. After watching the preview I was like, no, this is going to be bad, but it actually turned out as a nice surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excederin Headache #2031","review":"I have to respect that a number of people whose taste I trust loved this, but, my God did it give me a headache. It was similar to being subjected to a strobe light for 2 hours. Was this a musical for the attention span deficiant, or an attempt to recreate a 19th century acid flashback? I guess that my zero tolerence for the \\"art form\\" of the musical may have pre-disposed me to loathing this. Nonetheless, ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get off the drugs!","review":"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. From the opening scene to the point of \\"Like a Virgin\\", where I walked out, the movie is a total waste. Unfortunatley I did follow the majority of the crowd who walked during the first 15 minutes of the film. Nicole and the entire cast and crew should lay off the drugs and get back to earth. Unfortunately Nicole's character did not die soon enough and spare the audience the pain of this horrible screeching and howling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic, Gut wrenching, Funny...","review":"I mean that the acting and plot are tragically bad and the singing evokes a gag response that will make you wish you hadn't eaten the fish for dinner.It is hilarious that THIS movie was so popular.

To death..."},{"rating":"1","title":"overwrought and silly","review":"Those who watched \\"Moulin Rouge\\" are divided into two camps: Love it or hate it. This reviewer considers it a complete waste of time, an overwrought and silly exercise, operatic without the redeeming quality of opera music, lurid and phantasmagoric without the redeeming lightness of camp. In a word, perfectly horrid. The hackneyed story is filled with cliched dialogue; freshness is completely lacking. The concept for this movie took a wrong turn somewhere early on in development, like an early prototype for an airplane that ended in disaster for all concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wounderful Movie","review":"I see this movie in Zurich movie theater and was impressed from the beginning. Its fast, funny and also sad. but allround, i just went the next day to find the soundtrack CD, i bought it and enjoy listening to most of the songs. Than i stumbled unto the DVD and bought it also. All the special features are great and give an insight of the making of.I liked the actor who performed the duke? the rich man who should finance the moulin rouge anyway, his facial expressions are damn fantastic.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have wounderful voices, i love to hear their songs.All in All, i would recommend to buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Assault on the Senses","review":"What an innovative, dazzling piece of filmmaking!One of the most original films of the past decade, Moulin Rouge juxtaposes a classic, tragic love story with swirling Mtv-like camera work and a boisterous soundtrack. (Standout tunes include a surprisingly good remake of Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and a Bollywood-inspired take on \\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend.\\")This is a film for people who love both flashy Broadway dance numbers and excellent acting.Hands down, this is the most feature-rich DVD I have ever come across. Special tidbits include (but are not limited to): Designers' Commentary, Dance Rehearsals, \\"International Sizzle Reel\\" (Their term. Not mine.), Set Design Overview, and In-Depth Interviews with the Performers. Also, if you play around with the scroll buttons on your remote, you're likely to come across a secret feature or two. (Keep your eyes peeled for the red windmill or fairy.)Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a movie. Just a big budget blown on confusing bunk","review":"Don't listen to the people who praise this movie. They obviously want you to think they are understanding something about it that you don't. There's nothing to understand except a big budget was wasted on a confusing, incoherent, and very maddening collection of scenes. It's like taking five or six pails of different colored paint, throwing them against a wall and trying to pass it off as \\"art\\". There will always be a bunch of sheep who claim the result is a \\"masterpiece\\", \\"genius\\". Please! I'm surprised my DVD player didn't just automatically eject it after an hour in a gagging, convulsive fit of disgust. If I had watched this in a theatre, I would have demanded my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is too silly!","review":"I could not believe raves over this movie.

Blech! you'll find my copy for sale on Ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MOVIE","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just a lot of noise and confusion ... no acting..... no story ... no plot. It stinks, period. Now, if you find someone who tells you they like this movie, you should reevaluate your friends taste. This movie was absolutely a waste of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Well, I guess I didn't \\"get it,\\" since that's how everyone who loves this stinking movie explains away those of us who don't. Couldn't have anything to do with the ridiculous performances (who else wanted to see John Leguizamo take a long walk off a short pier, and who else but me felt embarrassed for poor Jim Broadbent, terrific in so many other things), Baz Luhrmann's irritating directorial style (his target audience would appear to be 14-year old girls with ADS), or the banal music (\\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch,\\" a REAL muscical, made fun of \\"I Will Always Love You.\\" \\"Moulin Rouge\\" pays homage to it). This film is vapid eye candy stretched out over an exhausting 2 hours. Congrats, Baz---you've succeeded in inventing a new genre---the feature-length MTV video. And for those of you who think we've all missed the point----Baz ain't exactly Ingmar Bergman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Moulin Rouge! is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is a unique, colorful, and overall fun film. The acting is great, the story is a bit cliched but what it lacks the unique and beautiful touches make up for, the songs are FABULOUS, the main reason to see the film, and the scenery and atmosphere of the movie are great. I must warn, though, if you don't like musicals, this movie is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough Moulin Rouge","review":"This movie is a wonderful variation from the typical modern chick flick. The music is beyond compare. Performances by Richard \\"The Duke\\" and Ewan \\"Christian\\" are remarkable. Nicole \\"Satine\\" is incredibly beautiful.

This movie was an awsome movie and If I could shake nicole kidman hand I would let her know that I could see that she was showing alot of her love for tom was put into this movie and nicole don't give up on tom you two remind me alot of me and my fience and I wish you the best keep your head up. If give nicole an emmy I would she gets a 10 in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I was one of those people that didn't see Moulin Rouge when it was in theaters, and now I'm really sad I didn't. Seeing this movie on a small tv screen does not do it justice. The visuals are absolutely amazing, and the acting performances from Nicole Kidman and Ewan Macgregor are electrifying. The story was straight-forward, but the way director Baz Luhrman brought it to life was incredible. It's a damn shame he wasn't nominated for best director for this year's Oscars, because Moulin Rouge is easily one of the best and most imaginative films of 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the Oscar goes to...","review":"If Ewan McGregor doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for his role in MR...there is no justice. He plays the role of Christian with starry eyed innocence to a person full of torment and rage(when Satine claims to not love him). There is so many layers to his performance. His singing on the other hand is just a wonderfully added bonus. Man can he sing! For anyone of you that walked out of the theatre because you were frustrated with the \\"LOOK\\" of the movie... You missed the BEST performance from an actor this year. Ewan is absolutely BRILLIANT : )Moulin Rouge as a movie is a breathtaking, original, groundbreaking musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fodder for the Addled Minded","review":"This is an example of totally inept filmmaking. However, impressionistic it is. My impression was that it was a good imitation of pseudo art-house fodder complete with affected acting and even less effective singing by its two stars. This is definitely not my parents' idea of a musical nor anyone else's of sound mind for that matter. To think that members of a certain organization even considered this film for any award belittles the very legitimacy of award giving in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This product didn't work.

Kidman's voice ruined classic songs (for me at least) and it was just way too eccentric for me, which is funny because I liked Across the Universe and that's very eccentric as well . . . It seemed to just try to have shock value more than anything else. It was a very plot driven movie with not much character work.

All flash and no substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Thing You'll Ever Learn...","review":"...is how 'spectacular spectacular' this movie truly is! The timeless theme of forbidden love thrown in with catchy (and familiar) songs make this movie an instant classic! From the first time we see Christian step off the train into France, we are drawn into a magical world of truth, beauty, freedom, and 'above all things, love!' You will be dazzled by the expressive dancing and passionate music found inside the Moulin Rouge.

I was dreadfully wrong. Chicago had origional songs with an ok plot, but I couldn't even get through the first half hour of Moulin Rouge. The movie was too busy for my taste with too much going on all at once. I didn't care for the music and thought it was entirely out of place.

Umm...what didn't I get? The trailer looked dazzling- images of luscious glitz spliced with Nicole pouting seductively as the music spirals to an ecstatic explosion of decadent frenzy...(breathe)...And yet the film was a plodding, embarassing mess of shrill caterwauling and gaudy/trailer-trash (NOT gaudy/burlesque) mise-en-scene. I know it was supposed to be a post-modern/avant-garde pastiche etc etc,but I obviously watched a different film to everyone else.

It is very long and very boring. The movie bombards you with recycled old songs, bright colors, and frantic movements. The movie can bombard you all it wants, but it can't make you care.

The camera keeps jumping all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"my head will explode","review":"I give this two stars for some of the cinematography and the costumes. But in every other way this movie is a mess. Grossly overdone in the tradition of Natural Born Killers, a movie that gave new meaning to the cliche\\"sometimes less is more\\". I did want to like this movie, but it was far too chaotic and bloated. Makes me wonder what the director is like in person. plus I was dissapointed that this was supposed to be a musical and very little of the music was original, mostly covers of pop music. The visuals though interesting at times jumped from one idea to another too quickly making me dizzy.

But I was soon swept in. Either you love it or you hate it. I ended up loving it. People who only see it as part of Luhrman's trilogy are missing something-- he not only steals sets and ideas from his Boheme production, he also steals plot details from Camille/La Dame aux Camelias/La Traviata. But I don't mind such plagiarism since the method is so original. I think he is stealing from a higher level than most of his audience realizes.My only complaint is that the DVD edition is poorly organized and labeled. It is almost impossible to find what you want. Don't give up. Give yourself time. You will probably end up loving it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical!","review":"I was enchanted by this movie.

The music works well in this movie as well!BEAUTIFUL LOVE MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie if you're able to understand it.","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. The cinimetography and visual affects blew me away. I will say though that the movie was a bit \\"artsy\\"; it took a little while to get into the rythem of it.

Bring those kleenex boxes out of hiding, they'll be put to use during this movie. There's great music and acting. Nicole Kidman has a voice I never knew she had.

Are you ready for a modern day musical to dazzle you with great style? From the very moment this film opens it takes you on a ride. Imaginatively creative, this film is packed! Vibrantly alive, the audience was interactive, I heard the positive murmurings during the film. The sets are gorgeous (the color, the details), almost all the acting was spot-on -- bravo to Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, the story was intriguing, the musical quality was uniquely done (the musical numbers -- a bridge between old and new), and the directing could have been slowed down a tad at the beginning but is the glue. Not many films like it come around very often. I do think this is the last film about star crossed lovers I can handle for awhile, but this film provides so much it demands you see it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"merit?","review":"Spent forty wasted minutes watching much ado about nothing.

It was best example I've seen of somebody trying to film a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!! Doesn't even deserve a star!","review":"I agree you either love this or you absolutely hate it. I hate it. I love musicals ~ I grew up on Rodgers and Hammerstein. I had to force myself to watch this.

I was happy to see that perhaps the musical was coming back. If they are like this one - they can stay away. I was ready to run outside screaming after watching only half the first disc. WHAT A MESS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really DULL Film","review":"This movie obviously thinks it is doing something 'new' and 'special', and evidently it has managed to deceive many people. The trouble is, the film is entirely lacking in heart. The plot is thin and predictable, the characters are cliches, the dialogue is appaling. Even the editing and the direction appear heavy-handed. Every sequence goes on too long. Lengthy parts of the film are actually REPEATED later on, and sometimes more than once. As if they weren't dull enough the first time round, we have to see them again!If you want to see a real work of art which revitalises the musical genre, check out 'Everyone says I love you'."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Soul","review":"If there has ever been a film undeserving of the accolades it's received, it's Moulin Rouge.

The cinematography is remarkable in its oddity, the costumes are glittering and glamorous and the music is a collection of twentieth century anthems presented together with a jarring but effective twist that is both rejuventating and nostalgic. The story itself is simple so as to not detract from the wonders that appear on the screen and in many places its advisable to let the story take a backseat and allow yourself to carried through the dizzying array of colours and sights. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman both exhibit vocal skills that seem to erupt with emotion and conviction and effectivately remind many of us why we love musicals. It's possibly the oddest movie made this year - odd but refreshingly so."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO SEE THIS MOVIE!","review":"This movie is fun. It's like a vacation. It's silly and magical.

It was unlike any other movie I had ever seen. The whole movie was (spectacular, spectacular)! When I came home from seeing it, I was so touched. I had never in my life felt so strongly towards a movie and made me think about true love. I even went as far as making the story. I have finished it and made 6pages from it ha. I cried so deeply in the movie. It was truely inspiring and the best movie I have ever seen in my life. Nicloe has a stunning voice with a gorgeous personality and beautiful looks. Ewan is the sexiest man alive in my angle. He is a shy guy - sweet. He is soooo handsome, lovely accent, kind heart and he can SING!

The industry just doesn't make many muscial films these days and to have one with such emotion and clever entertainment was a joy to watch.Christian (McGregor) and Satine (Kidman) have great chemistry on screen. They make one's heart melt with the passion they have for one another. The fact that both McGregor & Kidman sang their own songs in the movie was impressive. They make it fun to watch.I would recommend it to anyone who is a romantic with a light-hearted spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped and overrated","review":"Baz Luhrmann deserves credit for his bravado, but he scores zero points for making a chaotic, excessive, in-your-face movie which is essentially one big mess. The movie is frantic and jittery in its pacing and is filled with self-indulgent rapid-fire camera movements and editing which does NOT ENHANCE the story in anyway. Rather it DETRACTS from it.It gives the viewer a throbbing headache rather than touching one's heart or stimulating the viewer's intellect.Nicole Kidman is lovely and she has a beautiful singing voice. But Ewan McGregor, handsome as he is, has a loud, colorless voice which lacks any nuance or subtletly.On the plus side, the sets and costumes are quite spectacular, but the movie as a whole is trying too hard to \\"redefine\\" the musical so that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" loses coherence or poignancy. Sometimes less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best musical: Moulin Rouge","review":"I think this movie its just the best musical I've ever seen. It's ammazing.

I was afraid based on the music video sleeze of the Lady Marmalide quartete that it would be tacky, but praise God not! Ewan Mcgregor a singer who would of thought. But as a leading man definitely!

I have friends who saw it 4 or 5 times the first week it came and and who raved about it, and friends who thought it was the stupidest movie they had ever seen. I have to give the director credit--this is nothing like any movie I have seen before--the idea is unique, the visuals are stunning, but it just doesn't hang together the way it should. Part of the reason is the ridiculously simplistic story line, but mostly I think it fails because the editing is poorly done. At no point in the film does the editor slow down long enough to let you really see anything, and the effect which is at first energizing and creative becomes annoying, and dizzying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over stimulating, frenetic pace...you get the idea","review":"This was just an awful experience. The dialogue was puerile, the music ordinary and the acting over done. You either love this or hate it. It's nice from a technical standpoint but, for someone who likes a fresh story line, this is not interesting. The actors did what they could, frenetically, but the techniques are bigger than they are; in any movie other than Star Wars, that's bad news!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty video, good sound, lousy story","review":"I had great expectations for the movie, but to be honest didn't have the patience to even watch it to the end.The tunes, while nice, don't fit the period.Just too much creative licence taken and the story, sigh, not worth watching for free, let alone buying it.I enjoy musicals, but this one was disjointed and the story line ... a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film of The Year","review":"It is rare that I walk out of a movie, or worse, stop a movie on DVD before its completion. I was ready to chuck this movie out the window after about 10 minutes into it. It came across like a really bad SNL skit and just got more annoying as time wore on. After 20 minutes, I threw in the towel.Yikes! What the hell was this piece of ... anyway? The weekly countdown of old pop tunes?The story was incomprehensible, even if I could stand the ridiculous musical score.Whatever it was, I would not recommend it to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"i LOVE moulin rouge. its my favorite movie!!! the widescreen kind of sucks but it's totally worth it to see this movie whenever i want!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!

It is so ridiculous that it is brilliant. To begin with, I worried that it was simply going to be a 'let's make this silly and it'll be called good' kind of film, but it has plot, brains and emotion behind all its glitsy, loud fanfare (and let's face it, there's a lot of that). Good performances from both leads and lots of good individual characters guarenteed to raise a smile.Good singing, with the hilarity of Luhrmann seemingly trying to incorporate every song he ever enjoyed into just a few sequences. Several of these songs are re-interpreted originally and hilarious way (the version of the Police's 'Roxanne' springs to mind).This really is as everyone says a multimedia experience. It's a hilarious but also touching, overblown, clever film in classic Luhrmann style. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally was not what I expected","review":"I am so happy that I watched this movie, when it first came out I never wanted to go see it because it just looked boring. But recently I went to rent the video and found out that that was the biggest mistake I had made. It's fantastic! I had never really been a fan of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor, but this movie totally just changed my view towards them both.Now I am a total Ewan fan and am really happy to discover this. I find him totally suitable for his character, very charming in doing his part and I love his voice, there are not many actors out there that can act well, AND sing well, but there's Ewan. The story although is not original and the songs also but It blended together perfectly, Your Song, Come What May are my personal favorites, I'm always rewinding back just to listen to the songs and now I got them both on computer! I would totally recommand this film to those who have not seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a surprise","review":"Rented this movie over the weekend. I really wasn't interested in seeing it. However, It was my wife's night to choose. This movie was great! I've never seen such a strange and entertaining mix of modern music, period costumes, outrageous performances (John Leguizamo was hillarious ad Tolouse Letrec!) and rapid fire editing.Overall the film was like grabbing the leash of a very big dog that decides to take you for a run. All you can do is hang on for the ride.We rented it this weekend, but I'm definately going to buy it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diamond Sparkles.","review":"This movie was remarkable! I entered the cinema expecting to see some half-baked movie toting a few seconds of 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend' and 'The Sound of Music', mixed and jumbled, smashed together by someone who was trying to make a few bucks. By the time that the film had finished, I wanted to get up and applaud. It really was that great! I feel though, that to enjoy this film, one must (in this order): (a) like or love a musical (b) like or love a romance (c) have an open mind (d) have a sense of humor. The film is great fun to watch, and even re-watch. This movie does contain music, is a romance, and if you have an open mind, most, if not all of the humor will come to you. For the most part, the humor isn't crude, but it comes in the form of parodies of different things, whether it be songs, skits, or expressions. My final word of advice: go to the cinema, and enjoy a night at the MOULIN ROUGE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moulin Rouge","review":"Moulin Rouge was one of the best movies I have ever seen!

Otherwise, this is a great film. I loved it, the visual effects were great, the story, and the music, was all spectacular. Nicole Kidman was abosolutely beautiful and her voice very similar to Helen Reddy. I think Ewan McGregar was great as well, didn't know he could sing either.However, my husband thought it was the dumbest movie ever. I'd say rent it first, and if you like then buy it.Unfortunately it is only available on DVD. They did the same thing with A Knights Tale (another great film). Hollywood dosen't seem to realize not all of us are rich enough to own a DVD player yet.Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing Blu-ray","review":"This review is not on the movie; it's one of my favorites and we had been waiting for the Blu-ray for sometime thinking it would be incredible. Unfortunately, the Blu-ray is not good at all; the picture at times appears grainy and I can see no difference in the DVD vs the Blu-ray. It seems no effort was put into this transfer and the result is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Romantic Escapism","review":"This movie is beautifully filmed and wonderfully cast. Ewan does a great job portraying the charming and nave Christian. And, it is a treat to hear him sing &#65533; he has a beautiful voice. He also looks better than usual &#65533; those &#65533;mohawk&#65533; haircuts he opts for in real life do not do him justice. Nicole Kidman was outstanding as Satine. She showed a strong range of emotions and her voice is lovely. She deserved to win a Golden Globe, and she was gracious in later saying she wanted to share the award with Ewan, who lost out in his category. I&#65533;m disappointed that &#65533;Come What May&#65533; hasn&#65533;t won any awards to date, and that the Academy did not allow it on its ballot. It would&#65533;ve been wonderful to see Nicole and Ewan sing it together. Oh well, thanks Baz for the romantic escapism that is Moulin Rouge.

I really couldn't figure out why until I realized I'd almost been duped by all the shiny objects, which were desperately trying to cover up the extrordinarily dull script. After a bit over an hour it seemed that the director, and the film, simply ran out of steam, and were just trying to wrap up the film in such a way as to not call attention to the lousy story. The actual direction, once the really big numbers are over, is pretty awful. Every single time something \\"heavy\\" or dramatic happens he resorts to a blurred slo-mo of the characters in question. After seeing this same trick 5 times I was officially sick of the movie. Blim, blam, zim, zam, at the end of it all it's smoke and mirrors.As a spectacle it works fine, but then \\"COPS\\" is a spectacle too. As a film it's severly dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie","review":"This is an absolute wonderful movie. I've never seen anything like it. It brings back the musical to Hollywood.

Not one song original! Okay, okay, maybe one or two, but is THAT what a true musical is suppose to be? Ewan and Nicole's talent it wasted. Not one scene is not surreal. That may be good sometimes but althroughout the movie it makes you sick! I cannot stress how much I hated this.

From the kitchy score and dated soundtrack, to the unbearable acting and staggeringly unfunny lines, this film moves me not. The script begs the question of just why this film was made. It could have been a soso film if the director wasn't intent on gagging the audience with the hellatious singing of all involved. This will be a sad footnote on musicals in the 21st century.

This movie stirred those longings for my first love. Though some may think the movie was long, I hardly noticed as I enjoyed it so much.

True the first 20 min of the movie are very fast paced, but it is mainly setting up the movie.

Unless you love musicals at any cost, this will not only put you to sleep...but you'll have a horrible hangover when you wake up to leave the theater. The awful singing is only the start...but the pathetic close-ups throughout the film make it almost unbearable to watch. You keep wanting to stretch your neck back to get some perspective. The story is pure cliche...right out the butt. Some silly courtesan finds real love and no longer wants to shell it out for money. Etc etc. Nicole Kidman's acting is really bad, as well. Ewan McGregor is fine, but the role he's given...well...it leaves something to be desired. The film is banking on the hype created by the Cruise-Kidman divorce along with the prostitute outfits of the Aguilera/Mya/Lil' Kim video. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Musical Ever","review":"I find it hard to believe that people actually enjoyed this movie, and am glad that it only won Oscars for costumes and scenery. At the opening of the movie I hoped that it would be a mocking homage to the MTV generation, done in a very interesting style. I soon found out that the movie could not decide if it was the former, a stream of consciousness comedy bizarre, or a serious (albeit extremely trite) love story. Some people bill this as the genius of the movie, I see it as serving no larger artistic purpose, and thus merely distracting and frustrating. Add to this the facts that all of the music was stolen, not performed in ways that give integrity to the original artists, and the lead male vocals were horrible; spell an absolutely horrible cacophony of a movie. If this opens a new era of similar musicals, I'll be in the basement staring at the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endlessly irritating","review":"Yes, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is a technically daring movie. But it is also one of the most irritating movies of all time. The director Baz Luhrmann rarely keeps his camera focused for more than a split second on any actor in this movie. Everytime you want to get a good look at the actor's face and expressions, Luhrmann purposely swings the camera away from the actor. It makes for a very cold and distant presentation of the story.And the songs are often screamed (rather than sung) in an annoying high pitch. This becomes grating, even repulsive to hear.I think Baz Luhrmann has appeared on every entertainment news show on television praising the \\"artistry\\" of his own movie. That kind of vanity just adds to the general distastefulness of this movie.Getting a root canal is a less painful experience than seeing and listening to this in-your-face, over-the-top, and reveling-in-its-own-excess shipwreck of a movie. And when I say \\"shipwreck\\", I'm talking the Titanic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a joke right..","review":"I had the misfortune of seeing this film at my father's house over the holidays, and came away convinced that I had in fact missed nothing by avoiding it's theatrical run.What might have started out as a novel idea to attract my generation to turn of the 20th century cabaret theater wound up being a self-indulged and haywire production that will leave many viewers with a bad headache. At times, the effects seemed sureal, as if the movie crew was suffering from a collective migrane durring the conception and production of this team.Even the pairing of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (who really do deserve credit for trying to make something out of the story) could not save this vastly overrated production from collapsing in it's own excesses. Considering much of the prepublicity billed the film as a nostalgia period piece, some of the selections such as Elton John (and certainly Nirvana) are truly puzzling."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The WOrst Movies I Have EVER seen","review":"I have never reviewed a movie before, but if i can save someone from seeing this god awful movie, then it is worth it.

The camera-work would give even an MTV producer motion sickness. The characters are crude stereotypes. The performances are, at best, mediocre. And the music?

If not, then I can understand their recommendation of this waste of celluloid for sheer lack of comparison to something entertaining and original. A vaste collection of derivation does not originality make, but this film fails to even copy well. The singing is horrid, the acting is worse, and nobody seems to have any idea what they're doing. Now I am a fan of most of the stars, but I seriously feel ashamed for them for there being such a record of the worst they could possibly do. The sets and costumes fail to be artistic and only come off as garish, reminiscent of a working girl on Hollywood Blvd at best and autopsy photos at worst.

There are dozens of edits every minute, each unjustified and collectively incoherent. The plot hangs together by a thread, weakly starched by lyrics borrowed from several familiar songs.The speedy stop-motion video and overdubbed cartoon sound effects are insulting.The movie views like a bad acid trip.That this movie received such interest and critical acclaim speaks to the unsatisfied demand for creativity from Hollywood, and the void of taste swirling in the wake of the American populus."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need to be wasted to get into this film","review":"After trying to watch this film sober (and I couldn't), I have concluded that if it is to make any sense and/or if you really want to enjoy it, you need to get ... drunk.

Ewan McGregor lights up the stage. And what a voice! It's one of his best movies. Any Ewan McGregor fan HAS to see this movie!This movie was really wonderful. It made me laugh and cry. The first half is generally more happy and funny, while the second half is more dramatic and serious. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are so convincing that you really get into the story and feel for the characters, especially at the end. The music throughout the movie is also spectacular, even though it is not original. I never knew that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could sing so well. (Esp. Ewan McGregor)In short, this movie was done fantastically. It kept me on the edge of my seat.

It's got Ewen Mcgregor and Nicole Kidman. That's a reason in itself. There is a lot of symbolism for the lit lover and did I mention Ewen McGregor?

Ewan McGregor has an incredible voice and adds incredible emotion to his character, Christian, which I think is Oscarworthy. Nicole Kidman shows her diversity yet again in an outstanding performance. Who knew she had such a great voice. She has my vote for Oscar! To top it off, Director Baz Luhrman provides a feast for the eyes with a movie that was very well put together and directed. A gutsy movie for all performed in it! Hats off to all! A wonderful movie to own and rent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, defective DVD","review":"I loved this movie. I would give it 5 stars.

I know people love it but, and here I have to justify my rating, this is one of the most pretentious, half-baked, ill conceived and grating pieces of cinema I have ever seen. It is shot in permanent half dark, gives little or no insight into Paris of the period and is more amused with itself than its audience ever will be. Reviewers often stress their annoyance at having no \\"no star\\" option. No stars does not go far enough for this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have two words for this movie....","review":"HATED IT!!!!!!!!!!I give it one star only because you can't give half a star.

A visual treat -- and the idea of quoting pop songs is cute. But it doesn't work. It's too sappy, trite, arch -- whatever. I couldn't sit still, it made me fidgety. Fact is, I got BORED! Next day, we saw Cabaret, with Joel Grey and Liza. Night and day!

Truly a magical piece of art that has the capacity to both visually entrance you and touch your heart.It's a beautiful testament to the concept of loving someone \\"...come what may....until my dying day.\\"That's something that in our modern fast paced world we may need to be reminded about......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I realize this was trying to be original...","review":"Or maybe it wasn't. That's the whole problem with this movie. Now I know people try to say this is a \\"love it or hate it\\" scenario, and they may be right. I, for one, hated it, from the bastardization of 80's pop hits to the sickening brilliance of color to the cheesy plot and poor acting, I thought this was a decadent, self-indulgent movie whose doubtless enormous budget was ciphoned into all the wrong areas. Both Kidman and MacGregor deserve much better. The camera angles are annoying, and the plot is terribly unoriginal. I can't say it enough - stay away from this movie.However, I also hated \\"Romeo + Juliet\\". I love Shakespere, and I also love musical theater. So maybe you just have to appreciate one or the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moulin Rouge","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever tried to watch . I could not take more than 30 mins.

It was like a big roller coaster ride that takes you all around with lots of energy and electricity that makes you want to stand up and dance! This is one film that's not to be missed.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are powerful with strong acting and strong voices. The music for the movie was contemporary with a mix of pop, rap & jazz that usually replaces the dialogue with the lyrics. This trick to me worked and that's why I cant say nothing bad about this film. But it's easier if you know the tune of the original music so you can interpret the song into the movie.Remember, get the Soundtrack, own the Movie and get ready for A Wild Ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moulin Rouge is 5 stars!","review":"I have only seen the movie once since its theatrical release but the moment I saw it I knew I was in love with it. Dazzling, Romantic, seducting, and a musical all rolled into one movie! If you want a fun, colorful and dramatic movie, I suggest you see Moulin Rouge ASAP! Baz Luhrmanns creation comes to life on your television as Satine and Christian light up the screen with a romantic song and dance love story. Some may call it a tragedy, but is only a tragedy if you dont believe in love.

I may only be 20 years old, but there's just something about a musical and this one was fabulously constructed. I loved the cinematography, as the music was superb as well. I must admit I prefer the songs in the movie that the characters sang, not so much as the songs that were done by artists themself...if i hear Lady Marmalade one more time I will scream. But in the way that this movie touched me...no other recent movie has done that as much as this one...It made me laugh and it made me cry, and it's really difficult to find a movie like that nowadays...It was beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The film that revived musicals!","review":"I rented this movie when it first came out to see what all the hype was about....

In a case of mistaken identity, Satine comes on to Christian (McGregor) only to find out that he is a poor poet. However, in trying to cover up the misgivings, Satine tells the Duke that Christian has written the first play to be performed at the new Moulin Rouge. The two fall mdaly in love despite Christian's lack of money. They must devise a plan of escape so that there love is not squashed by the Duke and Zidler.

Dazzling performances by all actors involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie I've Seen In Years!","review":"This movie pulled you in from the start with a strange song and a green fairy. Not to mention Ewan McGregor singing at the top of his lungs \\"The hills are alive, with the sound of music!\\" It has you laughing, crying, and gasping from start to finish. Those who hate need to think outside of the box, not every movie has to completely follow history. Most movies are actually more exciting when they don't because it allows the directors/writers creative imaginations to go wild collaborating funky songs with bright glittery showy scenery and smooth sensational voices that ring as clear as bells. In the end what do you get? Moulin Rouge. This story plot brings out the true meaning of love, the deception, and loyalty that create ups and downs in a relationship. I would definetely rent this with a bunch of my gal pals or a sweetheart and laugh, cry and cuddle until the film reaches its end. Have Fun and Enjoy! Hopefully you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting and Inspiring!!!...","review":"UNBELIEVABLE! Anyone who doesnt like this movie is not quite right in the head and they must have ADD. It demonstrates how love can thrive despite social standing. Ewan surprised us all with his acting skills in Episode 1, but who the hell knew he could sing that extroardiny!? Nicole Kidman was another shocker. This movie was the rebirth of the musical.

It's sad, really.","review":"I expected a haunting drama glowing with crimson lips and lit by dim light bulb filaments, set in Paris on a damp night circa 1890.Instead, I was blasted by a melodramatic comedy that made no sense and was just all in all stupid. Buskers on speed bounce around in a cartoonish manner making jokes. A fat guy dressed like a ring leader rolls around singing Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin\\". In one dance scene a dwarf woman does the Charleston to an awful remix of \\"Lady Marmalade\\".This movie lacked so much and yet there was enough good material in there to make a decent picture. The backbone romance worked well and some of the dance numbers could be slowed and set to period music. Maybe I'll buy it on DVD and edit together my own version. To remake Moulin Rouge would be my big project if I ever become a millionaire or decide to go to film school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype . . .","review":"Seeing this movie once was enough. I loved the costumes and art direction and the movie deserved its Oscars for those. What I didn't like about the movie was that the director couldn't seem to decide whether it was a campy spoof or a serious musical. It ended up being neither, which made it weak. I did like the cast, but didn't like the music - it didn't fit and was distracting. Some great ideas were there, but I don't think the picture put it all together. Maybe that's why Luhrmann wasn't nominated for best director and why it didn't win best picture.Previous reviews have described this as one long MTV video. I think that is a fair description. It would have been much better with original music, a better story and without a frantic pace that assault's one's senses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie of 2001!!!","review":"When I first saw this movie in the theatre I was blown away. Watching it is like going on a fantastic ride at Disneyland. The look and feel of the picture is like nothing you have ever seen. It's so ahead of its time. I don't know if it can even be truly appreciated for the masterpiece it is right now. I promise, in half a century it will be comparable to The Wizard of Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectacular, Spectacular - not","review":"When I saw the previews for Moulin Rouge, I truly thought that it was going to be a good movie. I like musicals and I like both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. So when I saw it on HBO, my brother and I decided to sit down and watch it. By the end, I was cheering - because it was over.I could write a long review, or I could summarize it - I didn't like the acting, I didn't like the costumes, the choreograpy was terrible, the camera work was sub-par, and the unoriginal music drove me crazy. The dramatic parts were stiff and the humerous parts did not make me laugh. What a disappointing, terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIGRANE ROUGE? MORON ROUGE?","review":"Call it what you will MOULIN ROUGE is a complete waste of time and only suceeds in giving the viewer a splitting headache (have some asprin on standby, you'll need 'em). How this film was a multiple Oscar nominee with Best Actress and Best Picture among them I'll never know. Nicole Kidman overacts frenetically, as does the rest of the cast, though she has a good singing voice and she does look gorgeous throughout the movie. However MOULIN ROUGE rates 8/10 on the vidiot's \\"Cringe Meter\\". By the time you hear the rendition of Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN you'll be ready to break your TV set."},{"rating":"1","title":"...mess","review":"Several adjectives come to mind when watching this movie; from brilliant and beautiful, to annoying and stupid. Baz Luhrman needs to... make up his mind. Does he want to make beautiful movies that unfold like a series of brilliant moving photographs, or does he want to make infantile drivel where he can use painful close-ups, pointless fast motion film, and tacked on sound effects that would make the producers of America's Funniest Home Videos blush? I just hate having to subject myself to the latter to get to the former. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are both great. They somehow manage to maintain some dignity despite some the [junk] they are asked to do, say, and sing. If I were to rate it only on cinematography or art direction, I would give it an A+. This is a beautiful, train wreck of a movie. And though not everyone dies, the casualties are high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even after the 20th time!","review":"Loved this movie!

I can watch it back to back (like what cable TV does) and still enjoy it every single time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it was meant to be","review":"I must admit that Moulin Rouge isn't as spectacular as some have rated it as being. But, for what it was supposed to be (a wild ride of color and sound serving as a backdrop for a simple romance story) this film has hit its target. It was not meant to be a historically accurate documentary representing turn of the century Paris. The inclusion of contemporary pop culture only makes this movie more lively and appealing to a modern audience.As for Nicole Kidman's acting, she was convincing at times but at others she fell slightly short. Stiff and overdramatic when she should have been otherwise. Nothing extraordinarily bad, and nothing to mar the film.I found the high energy pace of the film combined with modern elements to be engaging. Although you will find no enlightening ideas or underlying meanings in this film, it is very entertaining (which is what a movie should be, right?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MUSICAL WHERE NO ONE CAN SING","review":"A musical where no one can sing is about as good as a comedy which is not funny. Every time Ewan or Nicole opend thire mouths to sing a cold shiver went down my spine and i clenched my fists hopeing they wouldn't kill another classic song - but they allways did.The story is weak - and the play within a play idea has been clearly ripped off of mid summers night dream which Baz Lurman directed on stage. The charicters where flat and at times annoying as the script was weak at best.Admitadly Baz Lurmans Directing was flashy, using CGI, modles, fast editting and vivid photography - but a turd is still a turd no matter how much glitter is on it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Please Explain...","review":"Someone please explain to me how it is that in a film which is supposed to take place in 1900 Paris everybody is speaking in English and singing Nirvana songs.

It was derivative beginning with Cabaret (one of the best movies ever made).

And while we're at it, let's put the whole \\"This movie reinvents the movie musical\\" nonsense to rest. This was a P.R. contrivance that worked precisely because the studio could depend on selling this product to a movie-going audience that has absolutely no memory or real knowledge of movie history. \\"Pennies From Heaven\\" (just to name one example) did everything \\"Moulin Rouge\\" attempted to do, twenty years ago!

It left me with one important unanswered question, \\"What the hell did I just watch!?\\" This is one of the most disturbing movies of all time yet everyone seems to love it. I wonder how much in royalties the creators had to pay to use all those songs they \\"borrowed\\". They combine Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", Lady Marmalade, the Can Can song, and some hideous rap song to create the most disturbing and freakish opening musical number ever. I was severely disappointed in this \\"Oscar Worthy\\" film. To end on a better note Ewan McGregor was the only thing that made this film worthy of the manditory One-Star.

The foam is scored into deep squares so you can pull out the squares you need to make sure whatever you're hauling has a snug fit. I recommend placing your object(s) on the foam, and using toothpicks to \\"draw\\" the outline.My only complaint with the case is that over time, the squares have a tendency to tear at the scores with heavy use.

I actually met Bayard back in the late 90's when I managed my college's radio station.He was walking around, promoting this vile piece of awful noise. He was spouting some nonsense about how Japanese is the language of the future and that his likenes (an X-ray) is on the cover.Like his persona, this CD comes off as extremely pretentious, and above all just plain awful....(groan).Do NOT buy this CD, even with a gun to your head.

Less a biography than a reoccuring theme, it is still worth reading if you like history books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable? Not by me","review":"This book was a real disappointment.

First of all, incandescent bulbs aren't banned, but they are being phased out. The United States is one of the last countries to do so. Brazil started in 2005, and Europe in 2009. The U.S. won't phase out incandescents until 2014. The U.S. bill was passed by President George W. Bush in an attempt to free us from depending on hostile countries for oil energy.LED bulbs are not dangerous or toxic, and contain no mercury.

About 1/3 of the bulbs were broken and, if there was that kind of impact, I can't help but wonder about how long they'll last considering the filaments may be weaker now. The product itself which wasn't damaged is fine. On a positive note Amazon is refunded my money without requiring a return shipment so I got the undamaged ones for free.

I have lamps in my bed room, and they give off 400 watts of nice warm heat, plus plenty of good reading light, which increases the temperature in my bedroom by at least 6 degrees, and takes out the chill in the air in my bedroom. I didn't realize that factor, till when I changed all the bulbs to fluorescent, and wondered why it was the bedroom had such a chill, plus how poor the light they gave out to read by.

I opted to try again asking for another shipment (shipping paid as originally)rather than a refund. I want the bulbs at that inexpensive price!I did get my second shipment, bulbs intact.

The video aspect is also poor quality, one concert shot in a football stadium in the middle of a sunny day makes for a very boring lack-lustre ambience. This one should have stayed in VHS format.

The second is early/mid 80's and Merle has aged, but still sounds great singing ballad after ballad, and the third is a TNN concert special Merle did in the late 80's, still sounding great wether it be singing, playing his guitar, or playing the fiddle.

Not too much to ask, and it would have done the job -- except it rides up something fierce. I immediately thought this was because the garment ran small, so I bought one a size larger --no luck.

Even more disasapointing is that I enjoy many of Peter David's original works. When he \\"adds\\" to pump up the story...to make this into a book...it is useless, boring wasteless stuff.

It's short, with only sixty pages, but it does manage to pack a fair amount of info in there, and include some very nice fondue recipes (how many fondue recipes are out there, anyway?) It focuses more on dinner, rather than dessert fondues, but has a wide variety of styles, so there should be a recipe for every taste here.Szwillus uses five main categories: Cheese fondues; Oil fondues; Stock fondues; International fondues; and Side dishes and sweet fondues. She includes a recipe table, which shows a list of the various recipes and whether they are easy or hard, can be made fast or take more time, lists calories per serving, and other criteria by which to pick a specific one. There is also an index that makes it easy to find what you're looking for if you have something specific in mind.

I remember seeing it while on vacation in New Zealand, and when it came out on DVD, I jumped at buying it. Bruno Lawrence delivers an incredible performance as Al Shaw. Smash Palace is a junkyard filled with run-down and wrecked card and is owned by Al and his wife Jacqui. It also serves as one of Al's two main obsessions. The other is with building a race car. Jacqui craves attention;Unfortunately, Al pays more attention to his obsessions then he does to her, which leads her to having an affair with his best friend Ray. When Al finds out, he reverts to drastic action which includes kidnapping their young daughter and heading for the hills.

Typical topics include:-Descriptons of upcoming new slot machines-Strategies for video poker, especially new variations-Slot machine history-How slot machines work-Casino news and reviewsThe humor column at the end of each issue usually cracks me up.One drawback: if you also subscribe toCasino Player, you'll find some casino news and slot machine information is repeated in both magazines. However, even when covering the same topic, there are differences. Casino Player tends to have more detailed casino news and reviews, while Strictly Slots tends to have more detailed slot machine information. And both magazines contain topics the other doesn't: Strictly Slots doesn't cover table games (Blackjack, Craps, Poker, etc.) and Casino Player doesn't have much Video Poker.

The book calls into question the American achievement ideology and forces the reader to reconsider his or her pre-concieved notions on poverty and its causes. The truth is that people aren't poor because they are lazy; they are poor because of numberous structural barriers in society that basicly trap them into poverty. This book is excellent for anyone interested in the social structure, but it would be better for someone who has never thought about the way society works and has the kind of closed-mindedness that cause many upper and middle-class people to view people of lesser social standing as lazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American Achievement Ideology is False","review":"This book explores the lives of two groups of inner-city teenagers. One group adamently believes in the achievement ideology, and the other group rejects it. Hence the title, the outcome for both groups is the same. I recommend this book to those who refuse to cast away their pre-conceived notions that those who live in poverty are lazy and stupid. This book is a painfully real account of the different ways in which society plays a detrimental role in the lives of the less fortunate, while allowing the upper class to place the blame on the victims themselves (in the name of the acheivement ideology)."},{"rating":"2","title":"CITY SCHOL AND THE AMERICAN DREAM","review":"Excellent condition.

I'm not sure who chose this book or why--perhaps the BBC miniseries was good. This 500+ page book should have been about 200 pages to speed up the plodding, boring storyline.

This may be an acceptable character to a target audience of 12 yr olds (see Johnny Quest or Asimov's Lucky Starr series) but just proves annoying to anyone beyond a middle school level education.

The most obvious criticism: How could a mind that understands the workings of physics miss the workings of culture and society? Clearly, Mr. Forward harkens from the \\"Greatest Generation\\" whose heroes were John Wayne, Errol Flynn and other, now mostly forgotten, larger-than-life examples of manhood in, say, the nineteen fifties. Did he not realize that people would move on and change in almost every way by 2036 - 2050?This book feels like it was written by Ayn Rand! The slagging of animal rights activists and the worship of wealth and over-consumption completely ruined what was left of the plot for me. Normally, I don't drag my personal beliefs into a book...but this was simply way too much. I think this book was written by Forward in 1952 and sent, ahem, forward, to 1992 just to upset the more progressive SF readers! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful 2 and re-reviewed to a 2 star","review":"The \\"hero\\" of the book acts and sounds like a 10 year old brat.

The sexual trysts were less than reviting, and the book was promoted as akin to \\"Sex in the City\\". Hardly. The front cover was far more titillating than the pages following. I completed the book due to my\\"once started, must finish a book rule\\"; and it was a book club selection. Rachel's writing style didn't capture the elements that might have made it a great read. It should have been a sophisticated story; however, the writing style didn't catch it. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this book","review":"I spent many years in China.

It was bland, like a dish without salt and spices. One would expect the author's interesting experience in China, and at such an interesting time for that country's emergence as the true global power that it should be, would yield a deeper insight and interpretation. It read like a sheltered, American undergraduate's essay on a trip to Beijing."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-person cultural perspective of China","review":"This was a unique introduction to Chinese culture that I have been looking for given an upcoming trip in 2008. There are numerous books on how the economy, businesses, politics, etc. of China have changed and how they have affected the world around them. However, this perspective rings true because you come to the realization that world governments represent the interests of their people yet rarely do they give an accurate portrayal in what those people are like. You get a sense of how far China has come and yet how far it still has to go. This may sound incredibly condescending but on the flip side, the outside world has come a long way in understanding China yet still has a long way to go. It was also great to learn a few Mandarin phrases in pinyin which you practice saying to yourself while reading. It is a refreshing departure from more supposedly scholarly books about China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip Roaring Ride through Expat China","review":"A touching, personal account of life and culture shock in late 1990's Beijing.

Rachel Dewoskin engages her reader as she relates her experiences as an American who breaks down barriers in Beijing. The courage and adventure she exhibits through her stories are enviable and her experiences are quite entertaining. Juxtaposed against the old culture of China, Rachel shows us the deep desire of the Chinese to understand and grasp Americanism. But, she also exhibits how very wrong preconceived ideas can be. Her experience seems to echo my own impressions--that there are at least 2 Chinas (if not more). Foreigners get to see one of them, but the other \\"Chinas\\" you may only glimpse or not see at all. A good book. A good read. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for ex-laowai","review":"I loved this book! But, like some of the other readers with positive reviews, I went into it slightly biased. Her descriptions of a expats life in Beijing are dead on and really reminded me of when I was in China. I found the things she went through, people she talked to, Chinese words she used, and feelings she had very amusingly familiar and had a hard time putting this book down.That being said, I'm not sure if someone who hasn't spent time in Beijing (or China) would really appreciate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"christmas time","review":"I found this book very helpfull with easy to do recipies, a lot of interesting tips andi would definatley recomend it to everyone who loves to cook because there are loads of fantastic recipies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have","review":"This glorious book is not only visually stunning, but thoroughly researched and extremely well written.

Though the intention of the author is good, the examples are made unecessarily complicated to demostrate simple concepts that could confuse a beginner. The Servlet version used in this book is rather outdated (v2.1) and the discussion on WAP and WML is just enough to explain the examples specifically developed for this book. There is also a big chapter in this book explaining the outdated servlet 2.1 api.Given the high cost of this book, the readers are better off buying a book on WAP and a book on Servlets separately. (Most of the books on Servlets discuss how to use XML with servlets.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction and Hands-on examples","review":"As a newcomer to WAP and Java Servlets, I found this book to be informative with an excellent introduction to both WAP/WML and Java Servlets. This book is written in such a way that its like the author is sitting right next to me to answer questions.

I would recommend this book to the neophyte as well as the seasoned programmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute fun","review":"I've always liked the shopaholic series because it's relaxing and funny to read. Reading them is a great break from reading more scholarly works. They are great beach, airplane and weekend books. This one is no exception.Basically the plot is Becky finds out she has a half sister from before her parents were married and wants to be best buds with her. But Jess hates shopping, spending and Becky's constant (well meaning) lies to her husband Luke.Set against the backdrop of Becky returning for her ten month honeymoon and Luke going back to the corporate world big-time, Becky's parents on a therapy cruise and Suz, Becky's best friend having twins and finding new friends this book is an equation for Becky to a major shopping meltdown! But our favorite material girl can be surprising and all fans of Becky will love this latest installment in her life.I'm hoping for another book soon. Four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still funny, but storyline getting a bit old","review":"I loved the first Shopaholic book and really enjoyed \\"Manhattan\\" and \\"Ties the Knot\\", but the storyline is starting to get a bit old. I'm starting to lose sympathy for Becky, she just simply refuses to grow up and learn. That was cute for a while, but I'm starting to feel like Jess - that she needs to grow up! She's still making the same stupid mistakes and still expecting others to just cover for her and it started to get a bit old in this book.That said, Ms. Kinsella is still entertaining and funny, so it was an easy read. However, I think this character has run her course - unless she can find something new to do with Becky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shopaholic and Sister...","review":"Like The Princess Diaries, I feel that this is a series that should have ended after the third installment. There is such a thing as quitting while you are ahead. The intent of this novel clearly isn't to provide fans with another hilarious adventure of the main character, but to simply ride off the success of the previous three. It was completely unnecessary. I hope Ms. Kinsella cares enough about her writing to know that she should discontinue the series after this book.The plot is the same as mentioned by previous reviewers. Becky shops, gets in trouble and is bailed out. As usual. Does anyone else find it completely unbelievable that someone as resourceful and smart as Luke would be interested in someone as vain and selfish as Becky? And that \\"twist ending\\" wasn't a big surprise to me. I saw that one coming a mile away.Overall, it was an alright novel. It felt a bit rushed though. If only authors knew when to stop a title and move on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does she ever learn?","review":"I am a big fan of Becky Bloomwood. I loved her first three books, Shopaholic, Manhattan, and Ties the Knot. However, this book was not as good as those. I am, sadly to say, starting to get a little annoyed at Becky. Does she ever learn her lesson? Her and I are the same age, yet she continually repeats the same offenses and covers them up with lies. Why Luke stands by her is beyond me, which only perpetuates her childish behavior. Like I said, I enjoyed her first three adventures, but with Sister, I feel that Kinsella only wrote it to continue the series without coming up with anything really fresh and new."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I'm very dissapointed with the outcome of this book. I may not even finish reading it. so far I've read the forst 300 hundred pages and I've laughed only once. I don't know what all the rave is about. If you want a good read as I did-don't buy this book!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Becky can go to Shopping hell!","review":"Okay, I admit, it's my own fault. After the last Shopaholic book, I should have never gotten this one. I guess I'm a Shopaholic as well. I couldn't care less about Bex or anyone else in the plot (was there a plot?) They should stuff it all in their contrived Angel bag and be done with it. Please, no more, we can't take it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst Kinsella book","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. In this book, Becky is an airhead. Same boring plot, nothing new.I can't bring myself to finish reading the book, it's so boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Book...","review":"Okay i have not read this book, but i have read the first three. I enjoyed the first three but i'm sorry but this one sounds idiotic. Just so you know Shopie is coming out with a new shopAholic book SHOPAHOLIC & BABY. You can just imagine what'll happen. And i agree Bex needs professional help...like moving into a happy house?"},{"rating":"2","title":"shopaholic and sister","review":"Very entertaining; enjoyed the last third of the book the most. This woman reminded me of a couple of people I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Becky- but the story was lacking","review":"I hate to say anything bad about the series I love so much, but this one was just not up there for me. I love Becky, but this could have been better. I would never not read it- and I'm glad I did. I was slightly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Becky, and Kinsella","review":"This is my fourth book in the series, and I'm still enchanted by Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood). Yes, her material obsession is ridiculous, but it's funny, too. And her basic sweet optimism and boundless positive energy makes the reader ready to forgive her just about anything. The regular supporting cast is here -- Luke (who finally finds himself exasperated with Becky ... I wonder what took him so long, and am glad to see he's human), Suze (and her horsey new best friend) and her parents (who have a wildly funny conversation about Becky, Cher and Kylie Minogue). There are new characters, too, like Kelly, the dreamy small-town girl who should have been Becky's sister, and Jess, the thrify and sensible environmentalist who is Becky's sister. If you're a fan of the series, I recommend this edition whole-heartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"While this is my least favorite among the Bloomwood stories, it was still a great read. In this story, Rebecca's wishes seem to come true when she finds out that she has a long lost half sister. She immediately assumes the best, and believes she has a new best friend. Not to mention that the timing couldn't be better, since Rebecca's long time friend Suze, seems to have moved on and made new friends and experiences without her. But nothing ever goes as planned in Rebecca's life, and she and her sister couldn't be any more different. I found this story to be a little too unbelievable, but it was a fast read, and worth my time. I hope you like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"This book was not a great read. Similar to the I Love Lucy character but less endearing. Disappointed by the writing and voice of the author - maybe young adult readers? I probably will not read any others of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"Like all of Sophie's books - I could not put it down when I got it. I actually have all of her books now. She is a very good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stopped at 3","review":"Shopaholic and Sister was a huge disappointment. There were so many cliche moments, it seems Ms. Kinsella has cranked this story out under pressure from the Publisher, not from wanting to continue Becky Bloomwood's story. Awful plot, annoying characters, and Kinsella offers nothing new. I now hate Becky Bloomwood , and I used to love this character. Becky has become a useless moron. AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...a good fluffy read but....","review":"It must say something about me that I sympathized much more with Becky's long lost frugal sister Jess, who at least has some sense. And I feel sorry for Luke--does anyone know *why* he was attracted to somebody who is so completely clueless about money and life in general?This book does redeem itself in the end, though, with Becky having the incredible revelation that she's been *gasp* spoiled all her life with people around her willing to forgive her faux pas and her goof ups, and parents who unconditionally accept her, and the great luck to get out of her scrapes. Heck, Luke pays off her huge credit card bills!Jess does exactly what i've been wanting to do to Becky for the past three books---tell her exactly how shallow and superficial her interests and concerns are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Growing disdain!","review":"I made it through books 1 and 2 without being sure if I was charmed or repulsed by the main character. Book 4 arrived before 3, so I started reading. How very dreadful! Becky's inability to focus on anything except shopping and her own personal needs, her constant lying about even trivial matters, and her fundamental stupidity got to be too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Kinsella, but Becky is insufferable","review":"Seriously -- Becky Bloomwood is a pathological liar, incredibly irresponsible, and refuses to learn from her mistakes. On top of all that, she's a complete dimwit. I have to admit I keep reading this series because I always hope she'll learn her lesson (and because I shortsightedly purchased all five of the current books at once.) But it really is getting to be just too much. If you haven't started the Shopaholic series yet, save yourself and read \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love shpoaholic","review":"I really liked this book it wasn't my favorite of Kinsellas book BUT it did make it unbearable to wait for the next book Shopaholic and baby. I have really enjoyed everything she has written"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this author! Long Live Kinsella","review":"Sophie keeps writing the most delightful and entertaining books. Nothing earth shattering - just fun! Clever and witty. She should be required to write a book every month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but lesser in the series","review":"All of the Shopaholic books are great but this one was not as good as the others. Don't get me wrong it is still worth reading and leaves the impression that there is more to come but it simply does not compare to the first three books.Becky is even more out of control than ever in this installment of the series, when she meets her long lost half sister, who happens to HATE shopping. Becky with her overwhelming desire to be the best sister ever (because she was always an only child) tries so hard to get her new sister (who happens to be everything Becky is not) to be her best friend. The usual hilarity that comes with Becky insues and Kinsella once again provides her reader with great fun and laughs.Ending gives the impression that there is more of Becky's life to come... can't wait for another book in this great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, it was cute.","review":"Rebecca Bloomwood has gotten considerably dumber, and it kind of made me want to just go over to her and knock some sense into her. The ending was very cute. Basically I wouldn't start reading the first 3 because of this one, but if you already read the other ones then you might as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"Sophie Kinsella had proven the lighten can stike 4 times. But the 4th time might not be as brillant. In this book Becky seems to have lost her sparkle a little. While in some ways she still the same whirlwind that we remember her as, but in other way she's a little to over the top. The book is still an enjoyable read, and the ending does brings the old Becky's spirit back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivial, Tiresome and Tedious","review":"This fourth installment of Becky's trying tribulations is the worst. The qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment. I don't understand how Kinsella's editor didn't draw the line (and the red pencil) at the litany of shopping expeditions. And her endless, excrutitating 'inner' reflections. Becky's exploits aren't amusing anymore. Her purchases on her honeymoon aren't wacky. They're bewildering. For a shopaholic with supposedly good taste, Becky buys the ugliest sounding things on her travels and then flogs them all on Ebay once home in England. And oh yes, then she discovers a long lost sister. That situation is about as believable as three designer wedding dresses and two weddings from the previous book. And then Bex and her sister wind up on a rock rescued by Tarquin in his personal helicopter. I am not making this up. It's all there in the book. And none of it is even remotely entertaining. And now God help us, Becky is pregnant. AARRGGGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But not her best","review":"I loved this book as much as the other ones. I am a die-hard fan of Sophie Kinsella and I think everything she writes is wonderful. Although it was good I still think that Becky shouldn't be quite as careless and stupid. I mean how many things can you do in just one book? A lot apparantely, according to Becky. I still love her though and hope Ms. Kinsella will continue with the series. Becky's pregnant!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable","review":"I have not read the first two of the series but I have read Shopaholic Ties the Knot and this one. Shopaholic Ties the Knot is superior to this one, I found, but this is still incredibly fun, an extremely easy read, totally escapist. It is true, Becky is floating in the clouds, absolutely optimistic and ridiculously out of reality and to tell the truth it never irritated me in Shopaholic Ties the Knot but in this book I found it to the extreme and I commend Luke, her husband, for putting up with her.All in all the story line wasn't as interesting as Shopaholic Ties the Knot, which I absolutely loooved, but Shopaholic and Sister was still cute and fun. Definitely worth the read, can't wait to read the first two and Shopaholic and Baby, I love this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was introduced to the series a year ago by by best friend, and have loved every Becky Bloomwood book. I sit and wait patiently for the next one to be published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the Continuing Saga of Shopaholic","review":"Shopaholic is back and I enjoyed the continuing story. Okay, maybe a bit recycled and maybe Becky should really get a reality check and curb the lying -- but, this is a character and a series that you will either enjoy or not. I enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointed..","review":"I've read the first 3 shopaholic series and it was pretty satisfying.. but shopaholic and sister was disappointing. in fact i didn't even finish reading it. Becky seemed so shallow on this one. It left me wondering if anyone can actually be so shallow and self centered....i hope the next novels are better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here she goes again!","review":"Unfortunately, Becky is at it again. Although I loved the previous shopaholic books, this one is never-ending. She pulls so many antics that it really insults the reader's intelligence! Come on, how can all these diasters happen to one person? I know it is fiction, but I felt that the story was quite dumb and I am glad I got it from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just can't keep reading this book....","review":"I tried so hard to like this book. I loved the other ones in the series and Can you Keep a Secret?, but this book was boring me silly. I just can't take it anymore. I read about 3/4 of it and I just don't care about what happens to Becky anymore. Her character seems different now. Before she was intelligent, but loved to shop. Now she's a walking moron (maybe that's what happens to you if you honeymoon for 10 months). The story line is so obvious and I can't take it any more. I'm off to read The Secret Lives of Bees."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and a half stars I guess - (this book = the day after christmas depression.)","review":"Sophie? What is UP?!?! This one fell flat after two chapters. ugh. I just couldn't bring myself to continue reading it. I guess book number three (ties the knot) was SO great that this one seemed like a let down - I would read it if I were stuck on a plane or something but even then I might just fall asleep and I HATE saying that b/c I loved Kinsella's other books but this one just didn't pull me in - maybe b/c Becky and Luke are already married and honestly - I don't really care about her long lost sister, it just doesn't do it for me.I would like to see Kinsella write more books that aren't series' and then introduce Becky on the side as a background character in the novel just to get another narrative point of view on her.my other friends who read this book agreed w/ me - \\"ties the knot\\" is better...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Sophie Kinsella continues to make me laugh. I love her Becky books!! She keeps me wanting more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow Up!!!","review":"I enjoyed the first book in the Shopaholic series. I thought is was amusing and cute. But with every subsequent book in the series, I have been more and more annoyed with Becky Bloomwood's antics, and frankly just thought this book was a waste of time. Why does Sophie Kinsella never address the real serious problem Becky has with self-control? She gets into all these messes that she has created herself, and through her pluck and luck manages to get out of them. Becky never does any serious soul searching- everything always just works out for her. That is not realistic. To me, the character of Becky just seemed spoiled and pathetic in this book. There are plenty of other chick lit books out there that are less fluffy than this one- where the characters actually learn from their mistakes and don't continuously repeat them over and over and over. Try those instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to slap Becky!","review":"I have not yet finished the book but I wanted to see what others thought. I don't know why I keep reading these books. I find parts amusing (which I why I keep reading them) but I really wish the character of Becky wasn't so stupid and selfish. Why would someone like Luke stick around for this? What is endearing about Becky? She is just plain clueless about life and marriage. I think she is truly the most annoying character ever. I will finish the book but honestly, I can't stand Becky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I was stuck without a book at the library a few days ago, and this was what I came up with. I've read \\"Confessions\\" and \\"Shopaholic Ties the Knot\\" before, but really, this is too much. Why would Luke Brandon love Becky? She is constantly immature, sneaky, and deceitful, and I don't really get what goodness overcomes this. I probably wouldn't be so frustrated except that I always have to finish a book once I start it, so I was stuck with it until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good ...","review":"I love Sophie Kinsella books so I was extremely happy when I heard that Shopaholic & Sister was coming out. I even pre-ordered it. It only took 3 days to read, but I was a little disappointed. The other 3 books in the series were laugh out loud funny, and I thought that this one was just off the mark. It won't keep me from reading any more in the series (if there are any... PLEASE) I love Bex and Suze and Luke... Please keep them coming, but leave Jess out of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of all shopaholics","review":"This is the worst of the series so far. One question, can Becky Bloomwood get any dumber? In \\"Confession\\", I assumed the auther was having fun with the personality. It was fresh and cute. As Becky's life progressed, her IQ was dropping from one book to the next. She becomes the typical \\"air-head\\". It seems that all she knows is nothing else but fashion (don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Harvey Nicks and Harrods too). Her life seems to be flat and uninteresting. Sophie Kinsella may want to do more research if she wants to write the 5th shopaholic. It is very evidental that she has been taken over by a lot of British writers who can come up with better plots and characters.If you like the same stylish/ modern British chiklit, you can try Helen Dunne or Clare Naylor. Their writings are way better than Kinsella's. If you really want to read this book, wait for the mass market copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"After three books, it gets to be TOO MUCH!","review":"The first books were great, simply because they were the first of their kind. Another lovable clueless English chick, ala Bridget Jones. But after three books on the same note, full of Becky's shallow character and stupidity, i just couldn't take it anymore.Note to Sophie Kinsella - time to stop with the \\"Shopaholic\\" series while you're ahead. I know similar to Becky one-brain cell women will gobble them up as long as they're written, but broaden your horizons a bit and dig deeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of Becky !","review":"I agree with Rainforest's review...I loved the 2 first books of this series, 3rd one was \\"ok\\"....this one is simply boring...To be honest, you get bored with Becky's addiction to shopping, her blunders,...I even found her very, very stupid!...I'll read the latest books by Sophie KInsella, with the \\"other character\\", hoping that she will be more interesting than Becky, and that I will enjoy reading these books as much as I enjoyed the first stories of \\"shopaholic\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becky Bloomwood is Maxed Out","review":"I enjoyed the first couple of the Shopaholic series, but the rest just deteriorated in quality and fun. Shopaholic & Sister seems like a rush job, like the author was on a deadline, and slapped a few ideas together. It wasn't original and I gave up in the middle of the book. That said, I am still a big fan of Sophie Kinsella and look forward to reading her future non-shopaholic books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite up to Shopaholic standards","review":"This was a good read (I love everything by Sophie Kinsella), but it definitely felt much slower than the other installments of the Shopaholic series."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!!","review":"i wasn't expecting to get my book fast and in really good conditions, but my expectations were totally off the mark. i received my book in about about 8 days!!! and the book looked brand new!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"brilliant!!!love the begining and end. better then the rest of the other shopahloic series. simply enjoyed reading the entire book. the contrast of the sister was brilliantly shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great tale in the Shopaholic series!","review":"Becky and Luke are returning from their round the world honeymoon (where, as is typical, Becky has purchased a lot more than she remembers!!)Their return back home does not turn into the grand welcome Becky has pictured in her head. Her best friend has a new best friend and her parents are very preoccupied and acting quite strange. It turns out that Becky has a half sister and in her mind Becky builds her into a carbon copy of herself and it turns out that nothing could be further from the truth.Her half sister is a very frugal cautious young woman, so much so that the two seem to have absolutely nothing in common......but will that in fact be the case or can they discover a hidden link between them??Becky and Luke have those newlywed problems that have to be worked out, but Becky's involvement with a mystery business man may be the downfall of Luke's business and quite possibly their marriage!This is another good book in the Shopaholic series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready for the Next One!","review":"If you loved the first three shopaholic books then this one will capture your attention too. Becky and Luke are on their year-long honeymoon in the beginning of this one and having a wonderful time. Except that Becky can't remember how much she has spent or purchased in each country. The spending (and rationalizing) is enough to make you laugh hysterically. They end their honeymoon a little bit early and Becky is eager to surprise her parents and best friend Suze. However, they surprise her! Her parents tell her that she has a sister from a fling her father had before meeting her mother. And Suze has a new (and irritating) best friend. She thinks her sister will be her new best friend, but they couldn't be more different! Jess is frugal and HATES SHOPPING. The horror! Hilarity ensues as you read on. And definitely read on. It's a great book.Now I just can't wait for Shopaholic & Baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"so funny!","review":"the shopaholic series is truly the funniest books that i have ever read! really laugh out loud books! i hope that ms kinsella will continue writing these books through rebecca's child birth and child raising years(to include toddler and teenage years)and through grandchildren years!i would highly recommend these books to anyone who loves to shop and loves to laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"The description of the product is not clear.

No explanations are given for why the great disaster caused a tyranny to arise nor are the tyrants, \\"The rulers\\", ever revealed as actual people . The reader doesn't know where they live or why they act as they do.More disturbingly the book is a crude attempt at feminism of an out of date type. There is even a culminating section in which the noble brave women slaughter the evil stupid men.There is an incompetent attempt to criticize racism but again not enough background. A quick reader might easily miss that Lex is a Native American.I would not recommend this book for any age. I did not want to give it even one star and I consider myself to be a liberal.I would not want any young person to read this with an uncritical eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting, post appocalypse adventure.","review":"The descendent of a clairvoyant woman who forsaw the the coming of the meteor that destroyed Earth, outcast Leora is considered a mutant because of her deformed hand and her premonitions of the future.

She finds the sister she thought dead, and joins a band of freedom-fighting rebels. This was an exciting novel with a view of a possible future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great, but worth a visit to the library","review":"While the plot line of this book is pretty interesting, in some places, it just falls flat. For instance, I think a lot of things are way too easy for Leora, and that people are also too willing to believe her story. For people who are oppressed and ready to get into a war, they are unrealistically trusting of her, and her \\"predictions\\" which they buy into almost immediately. I also thought Leora was a very pale character, with not a lot of life. I am a very avid reader, and I like almost everything I read, so the fact that I disliked this so much is a surprise even to me. However, it is an amusing read, and like I've previously stated, the plot line is pretty good.

And yes, I know it's designed for children, but children's books can, and should be, extraordinarily well written. But nothing pulls you into this child's life. The author portrays the feeling of trying to create magic, and being quite unsuccessful at it. In the end the listener is struck with wonder that everything worked together, with multiple deus ex machinas. And the voice of Kate Forbes is not only sickly-sweet, but lacks character range.Still, children will likely enjoy it, and it's something to stick in the car as you are driving on a long trip. It's just not good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I had decided to read this book for a book report a while ago. I was mostly inspired by the original plot to read it, however, I was disappointed by the rushed writing and lack of descriptions of characters and locations. Throughout the book, even the main character does not have a distinct age, physical appearance, or personality (unless you own the paperback copy with her on the cover). And although she does have the power of clairvoyance, most of the story is way too predictable. I would recommend this for young children who do not see such points as important, but for older readers, though, I think you should pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"Leo Gandelman is a musician's musician.

What I like about it is if I don't feel up to it, I can keep my feet on the floor (not jump if I don't want to) and still feel like I had a good workout. I usually only do the aerobic portion which is only 30 mins, but there's also a toning portion targeting all those fun areas.

I wished he had used someone else to deliver the audio book. A hard listen for me despite the subject matter.

I loved this album sooo much I decided to go out and the self titled ablum and I wasn't dissapointed.An Eve6 fan grew on me and i had to get the third album released three years later \\"It's All in Your Head\\".Eve6 changes their style with each album and this one goes back to the hard rock roots. The album is amazing and has strong and catchy lyrics. Max Collins is a musical genious, has a beautiful voice, and can really play bass while Jon Siebles and Tony Fagenson are perfect on guitar and drums. Eve6 is pure divinty and very admirable. Their music is what gets me through the day. I have seen Eve6 play live five times and they are even better live if thats possible to get better than they already are. Give this CD a try if you listen to it once you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"When I started listening to this CD, I was disapointed - I've been an avid Eve6 fan for years, and the first few songs on the new CD are mediocre. The style is more hard-rockish, less like their first two CDs. However, there's some really good stuff later in the disc... the first two songs aren't hot, but the rest is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop comparing everything to Horrorscope! IAIYH rocks!","review":"Maybe it's because I'm almost 30 that this release seems to strike a chord with me. \\"Arch Drive Goodbye\\", \\"Good Lives\\", and \\"Think Twice\\" all resonate with typical Eve 6 rock-angst. The other tracks are also excellent. But the magnum opus on the album is \\"At Least We're Dreaming\\":I'm alrightI tell myself twicein the mirrorbefore I can'tgo to sleep at nightI need a lullabyI need some timeI need to get adime bag from my guy'Nuff said. Once all of you spend a big chunk of your lives slaving away in some 9 to 5 job, you will realize how fitting this song is and how much these guys rock. Horrorscope was great, but so is this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to this band?","review":"I've been a huge Eve 6 fan ever since purchasing their debut album a few years ago. Out of all the albums the band has released, Horrorscope is my favorite. I hate to say it, but I'm very disappointed with this new album. It has three of four decent songs, but the rest is pretty dull. Horrorscope had clever songwriting with huge hooks, but this new material is boring. This CD will probably be in the cheap bin at the music store before too much longer. Of course, music tastes are subjective, and I know a lot of people really like this album. But for me, I just can't get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"raw and simple","review":"After wating long enough for their new album..i thought it was gonna blow...after the popularity of the heres to the night single..they were going in a softer direction..but the band has showed us once again what their reall talent is..sticking too their old sound..from soft accoustic songs..too speed punck..so many genres are crosed in this album...keep rocking"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album yet","review":"I have every cd eve 6 has put out, and i am a fan of their self-titled cd. \\"Its all in your head\\" is amazing. It surpasses anything they have put out, and its one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third CD and Still Rocking","review":"As a huge Eve 6 fan I can be a bit biased, but this third CD is as awesome as the first two. Their first single, \\"Think Twice\\" will get you listening to the CD, but the lyrics of \\"Good Lives\\", \\"Bring the Night On\\" and \\"Friend of Mine\\" will remind you why the CD rocks. It's a different sound than their debut CD and \\"Horrorscope\\", but the main point is that they've come farther along as a band and it shows in their arrangement and lyrics. The CD also comes with some cool interviews and videos. Highly recommended for all Eve 6 fans and for those looking for some real rock with a little punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Cd's Ever!!!!!!!!","review":"I have been a fan of Eve 6's for few years now. I started listening to their Horroscope then their 1st album so i was from then on hooked to them. When \\"It's All in Your Head's\\" single \\"Think Twice\\" came out, i just thought it was an ok song but then i went to a store and got it since i couldnt find anything else. After that i loved every single song and now a huge Eve 6 fan. After I went to their sick concert i knew i have found a new favorite band. They were awsome in concert along with \\"Stage\\" and \\"AM Radio\\" who also were sick. But all in all this is the best CD I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!!!!!!!So if u dont have the CD i would strongly urge you to go and get it.

However if your looking for a unique, catchy, sing songy record that any rock fan (alt. rock/punk/pop-punk/rock/emo) can enjoy, look no further than \\"It's all in your head\\". it could easily be one the most creative albums of 2003..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy bueno","review":"This CD is great. It shows a lot of depth for Eve 6 as a band. From Think Twice, to Hokis, to Good Lives, to Hey Montana, they display a lot of different styles while still remaining unmistakably Eve 6. People may criticize this album for changing a bit from their first two, but I think this album is a lot more well thought out, and developed. More mature really. The lyrics are still quite solid, and the music behind them seems to get stronger and stronger. If you like your alternative rock/punk/emo (I'm not exactly sure what to call this), do yourself a favor and pick up this CD. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"I have been fan of Eve 6 since their first album released under the name Eleventeen. They have grown and matured a lot since that first album, and this newest offering It's all in your head is a solid album. One of my favorite things about Eve 6 is that their music usually has a story to tell, and it is always told very well. I have always been able to listen to an entire Eve 6 album without turning it off or skipping any songs. Whether it be their self titled album, Horrorscope or even this new album. Every song is very catchy and will have you singing along in no time. Eve 6 is a good band that is easily overlooked with a slur of similar bands out there, but in my opinion eve 6 has been able to provide consistantly good meterial throughout their career. Give this album a try you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOO!","review":"after hearing think twice i figured id go out and get the eve 6 cd. never have i wasted 10 bucks worse. this album flat out sucks. one good song is think twice. the rest of the songs are so bad i thought about wiping my a** with the cd. i finnally threw it out. dont buy the cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost directions","review":"I got Horrorscope for free two years ago.

There seems to be three bands playing on this album. The crafty lyrics are there in part but not used as well. Catchy toe-tapping beats are gone too.

The questions were tired, and Stan's responses were what he has been saying for 40 or 50 years. He is a loveable and charming man (who I met as a young fan-boy), but I don't want to hear him, yet again, take near total credit for the creation of the early Marvel universe. And then there is Kevin Smith. He come off as a half-wit, not only with his insipid questions, but with his endless stream of profanities that he must think makes him sound like an adult. Even the mediocre production values would not have gotten in the way if the content were worth the time it takes to watch this DVD. If you want to see a much tighter production of Stan's reminiscences, I recommend the DVD \\"Stan Lee's Mutants, Monsters & Marvels: Creating Spider-Man and Here Come the Heroes\\" and his autobiography, \\"Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee\\", and the biography, \\"Stan Lee and the Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book\\" by Jordan Raphael."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good sprayer - a best buy and quality product","review":"It's not super fancy, but it's effective; about like grandpa's old metal sprayer, but poly-ethlsomething so it's more durable.

Overall I like this sprayer and prefer it over the $100 backpack sprayer I was using since this sprays forever once you pump it up. I use it for poison and fertilizer, and with soap as well.

This sounds like everything that is bad about Enya, Enigma, ERA, Gordon Summner and Deep Forest, all rolled into one. The awful, pseudo-celtic pap of the first wrapped in the jokey cod-religious / fauz-latin of the second and third, with the anachronistic soundtrack of the Geordie fourth and the marketed spirtuality of last (and all of them, ultimately).

It has been and will continue to be one of my favorite collections of songs. It really sucked to see where the band went, as sit now with no vocals for the second time. However vocals aside, I wish they could go back to making music like this because even though their new stuff is good, nothing has been able to come close even years later. Melodic, deep lyrics, excellent and unique layering of vocals, perfect mix of clean vocals with screams, and addicting riffs and choruses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Translating The Name Is A Must","review":"There is no question that Saosin is the best thing to happen to Hardcore Emo in a very long time.

A definite value for such an amazing cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can u say McGrath, minus makeup","review":"Best way to sum this cd up, a grouping of musicians that could put out music so intense and hard, yet something so embracing as the acoustic. To transcribe something so hard into a lighter feel of an acoustic range, only real talent can walk this line. Without a doubt one of the most important EPs ever recorded. The tracks \\"they perch on their stilts...\\" and \\"lost symphonies\\" drum lines (as any Saosin fan knows of this cds drumming)... well the only way to put it in words that do it honor is transcendent. Anthony's vocals, both singing and screaming, are superb and for those with an aversion to screaming, it's rather limited.To put it plainly, if you're trying to decide to purchase this album or their full length. I'd pay the 40 bucks for this one of 5 tracks over the full length of 12 or so songs of average price. The full length is toned down, formulaic, crap fit for the AR label guys hoping to appeal to a wide audience based of the success off of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this little ep rocks","review":"This band is wonderful.

As with all good books, this one too can be read on many levels, with the reader obtaining whatever s/he wants from the book.

No matter what, there is always value to something, even if the value is us realizing that something is not for us but it could resonate to others.

(Regrettably, the Beatles did not provide voices to their animated counterparts. Instead, the producers hired Liverpool actors, who did a passable job emulating the group's deadpan wit.)

The characters look like they've been drawn by six year olds, the story seems like it was written by a two year old, and the music is the same old abstract garbage that the Beatles are known for. I don't think they were the great legends people portray them to be. Their music is a result of what music sounds like when you're so high that you can't tell what in the world you're doing.

The great thing about it is,of course, the music.\\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"Elenor Rigby\\" rank as some of my favorite songs from the movie. And going along with the animation seemed to fit it. All the colors in the movie were tremendous and i have heard it being compared to an acid trip. But i enjoyed the hell of of it, without the acid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The original story remains intact but it's definitely not dated.

First of all the new sound is explosive. You have never heard The Beatles sound this way before. It's amazing that the greatest band of all time not have their music sound the way it is supposed to. Imagine how much we are missing out on. If they decide to remaster all of their albums, i will be forced to restock my collection. the movie is still not that good. some scenes are better than others, the story still is for the most part a waste, and the voice talents detract, rather than enhance the film. The special features are wonderful. Don't do the audio commentary track. The guy will put you to sleep within 20 minutes. move the cursor onto the submarine, click ok and see what happens. i'm very glad i got this DVD. now i have to get \\"A Hard Day's Night\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite of my dad and myself for years!","review":"After finding this movie gone from video stores about ten to 15 years ago, I was slightly miffed... The last video store in town to have it in stock finally closed down last year, so the re-release of Yellow Submarine couldn't come at a better time!I've been in love with this movie ever since I started watching movies. Lots of memories attached with it for me... It is easily my all time favorite movie. As for why they took it off the shelves at all is obvious: Disney takes their 'Classics' off the shelves to build up anticipation for the re-released version, the Beatles, or Apple, or whoever owns the rights, did it to revamp the movie and build up massive anticipation in the Beatles Fan Ranks... Well done, too, might I add... Thank Goddess its finally released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic colour animation.

Even my 11-year old son was caught up in it watching it for the first time (he snuck out of bed when he heard the title song...)While George Harrison's songs are (apologetically) throw-aways, the Lennon-McCartney songs fare well, and the cut-out quality of the story animation is balanced out by the superb animation of the musical numbers.While the dialogue is sparse and droll, it is full of wonderfully bad puns ('Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night...and this is only Thursday morning!'; 'I haven't laughed so much since Pompeill'; 'Pepperland! A bit salty around here, gents...'; etc.)I am curious to see how the DVD looks and sounds newly remastered, but it will devalue my laserdisc (collectors have paid up to $300) to about $10...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really trippy but cool","review":"I never saw this movie originally since I wasn't old enough when it came out. The transfer seems really good though, esp. when comparing it w/ the clips seen within the documentary.I saw the movie w/ my wife, and about 5 minutes into the show we both looked at each other and thought the same thing: the Yellow submarine has a acid-trip/ pshychedelic/ high on drugs - like quality to it.

Certain cuts from Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Pepper, and Magical Mystery Tour plus a small handful of songs written specifically for the movie all find their way on to the soundtrack. The DVD offers some nice bonuses, including a producer commentary track, isolated score (which is perfect for background music) and never before seen interviews with members of the production team are included as well.

It's very colorful and a must for every Beatle fan to see. Although The Beatles aren't in it(except to play All Together Now at the end)the actors voicing them do a good job. The movie starts in the magical place called Pepperland. A happy place with music. The Blue Meanies on the other hand hate that and take over. So it's up to Captain Fred to take the Yellow Sub and find help. He goes to London and finds The Beatles. They decide to go along, but on the way are many dangers.

I love the Beatles and own all of their U.S. releases on the original Capitol and Apple Records. I bought this so my children could see it. What a disappointment! It really hasn't aged well. The music and songs sounded great but other parts of the dialogue were difficult to hear. Parts of it were really boring. The best part was seeing the fab four at the very end. A Hard Day's Night would probably have been a better choice. I've seen it recently on American Movie Classics and it's funnier than I had remembered. I suggest you rent this before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letterboxing Cuts Off Top and Bottom!","review":"I thought this looked odd when I watched it on DVD in the letterboxed widescreen format. My fears were confirmed when I found a copy of the VHS \\"full frame\\" version at a yard sale (for 50 cents -- what a deal!).It turns out that part of the top and bottom of the movie were covered to create the widescreen version (which I think was the only version available on DVD). There is more picture at top and bottom in the full-frame VHS version! Although the left and right are trimmed a little on the VHS full-frame version, that's not nearly as noticeable (and annoying) as the missing top and bottom on the DVD.If this ever is released again (maybe when the remake comes out), I hope we get the full picture next time. Trying to watch it with the top and bottom or the sides missing is a less than ideal experience, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles --- Yellow Submarine","review":"This is a very enjoyable, some what pschadelic animated movie based on many of the Beatle's songs.

NO OTHER MAJOR RETAILER CURRENTLY CARRIES THIS DVD! There has been NO authorized re-release since 1999. It's understandable that those of us who have waited so long for a legitimate re-release would snap up this item on Amazon.com, but it shows all the marks of a pirated DVD. Amazon.com--which has such a solid reputation--should have looked into questions raised by previous reviewers about this matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the beatles but...","review":"I am a huge beatles fan, but in my opinion, this movie is terrible. The story is all over the place and it gets very boring very fast. The movie is about an hour and a half, and it seems to drag on for years. The only saving factor for this film is the great music, but even still, the Beatles have many better tunes than these. I think your money would be better spent on a Beatles CD (perhaps Sgt. Pepper or Rubber Soul) or on Pink Floyd's The Wall, which is worlds above and beyond this sinking submarine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???????","review":"When I was about 12 my uncle (who loved it when he was a kid) played it on his computer.

At first I thought it might be too dated and anchored in unfathomable (great pun, eh?) hippie humor... But she loves it, and it's still better than 99% of the kiddie fare available today.

What I found most interesting was the terrific restoration job done on the DVD. They took a so-so mono soundtrack, cleaned it up and turned it into a full 5.1 Dolby Digital. The video has also been cleaned up.I was also impressed at the number of listening options they offer. You can watch the movie with the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, with the original mono soundtrack, with the director's commentary or, best of all, with just the music. When you select that option the dialog is removed and you hear only the incidental music and the Beatle's songs in the film and you hear it in 5.1 surround.They didn't neglect the .1 channel, BTW.

For the longest time, it seemed as though I was the only fan of it anywhere; for nobody, not even most adults, remembered it. Was I overjoyed when it was re-released! The DVD is truly brilliant. I never knew this movie could look any better!I think the reason why Yellow Submarine has held up so well for me all this time is that it can appeal to all ages.

I found that in this day and time I had to really work at trying to get into the idiom of this silent film, and never totally succeeded. The gestures and dramatic conventions from so long ago are hard to fathom. Louise is lovely to look at, but the story line is rather predictable, but that may be a function of nearly 80 years' refinement of that plot. It may have been quite fresh and daring back in the twenties, but I couldn't get my mind there. If you wish to see a movie nearly as old that was very racey at the time and has wonderful usage of symbolism, I would recommend \\"Ecstacy\\" with Heddy Lamarr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost identical with excellent on-line material","review":"This is an excellent reference.

But... some of the examples used I did not think were strong enough to reach a \\"faithless\\" audience. I know the producer(s) meant well, but this was not as good as I thought it would be. I appreciated the honesty in the filming though, (like when they were at a witch festival & not getting immediate results with passers-by).

The duet with Alejandro Fernandez. That one was pure butter. It melted my heart and got my inspiration going.I couldn't help thinking when listening to his latest CD that he wanted to capture the Josh Groban market.

WHY do these critics always ASSUME that if you like Josh Groban you will like other singers such as this guy or Watson or Bocelli? I can't stand Bocelli or Watson--they both sound like they are singing with something stuck up their noses. This guy is better than Bocelli or Watson, but nowhere NEAR as good as Josh!

Nevertheless, I play Follow Your Heart at least once a day and this has been going on for several weeks now.

I really love the originals of these tunes, and the new versions sound off to me - the rhythm was redone, and it's distracting. The rest of the CD is from a live performance of fairly bland \\"mood\\" pieces, with flute, that have no reference to Charlie Brown. On top of this, the live pieces were recorded badly.

The movie is basically about raw animal drives subverting the attempt to civilize and modernize.Apparently it is not available in US NTSC format. However, this transfer is pretty decent quality if you have a multi-region player - with some caveats. It is delivered in the annoying letterbox format, a 16:9 image within a 4:3 frame.On a 4:3 screen, the subtitles appear in the letterbox area, which is OK.

The one exception, and the movie's only real saving grace, is Penelope Cruz, who makes a scorching love interest; still, she doesn't quite rise above the mess.Some parts are pretty hot (the couple against the skyline, for example), but not worth the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW","review":"Jamon Jamon is one of those spainish films you watch because Penelope Cruz is in it, but, by the time the naked bullfight scene rolls around, if not before, you realize that not even the best looking actress around can make up for such a bizarre and ridiculously sketchy peice of cinema. Meant to be funny, the outrageous sexual innuendo that is the script is just too strange to be humerous or even erotic.The plot set up in the beginning of the movie, which had potential, breaks down as a result of the plethera of random hook-ups, many implausible, and by the time Silvia makes out with her fiance's father, one is just too wierded out to care. Some themes adressed in the movie are masculinity and the role of the man and woman, but through poor acting and trippy cinematography, even these are too blured to amount to any semblance of profoundness. All in all, if you're looking for a good movie with Penelope Cruz in it, watch Belle Epoque."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sirve.....SOLO ES SEXO SEXO Y MAS SEXO","review":"Vi la pelicula esta, y me resulto una porqueria.

I have not found any outside of New Zealand, and especially few, outside of live performances. Kahurangi seemed to bill itself as Maori music, however, it is incredibly disappointing to hear the awkward fusion of two genres that are best not played together. It seemes like an incredibly synthetic attempt to market traditional music of a unique and artistic people.

I like this album alot, but it doesn't earn a full 5 starts from me. Why, you ask? I'm not a huge fan of the remixes, escpecially the Cruelty remix. The first 30 seconds sound like a remix, and the rest of the song sounds exactly the same as the origional Cruelty. The rest of the remixes are fine, i'm not a huge remix fan though. The new songs are great, and the spoken work track, Annabel Lee, is a wonderful reworking of the classic Poe poem. I highly recommend this for any Cruxshadows fan, as well as any darkwave/goth/snythpop fan. Check it out, its worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woo.","review":"Even though I'm not too big on remixes, the new songs on this EP (four of the seven) are amazingly cool, at least as good as anything on Mystery of the Whisper. Ave Maria is my favorite track, and Annabel Lee is a staple of the concerts that finally made it onto a cd... Maybe next time they'll put the Jabberwocky on there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Possibility!!!!","review":"Cut up into short essays, this book shares with you the many experiences and feelings of those involved with the Deaf community.

It is the journal of a 13 yr. old girl.Why is it \\"not the best book\\"?1. The story is fairly dull. Most of it is about her everyday life (some people might find that interesting, but I didn't AT ALL)2. The most exciting things that happen in the story, aren't that exciting.3. There is not really a \\"climax\\" to the story.4. Sometimes, she starts to write about an event in her journal, but never finishes it.5. It is written in 1800's style English, making it hard to understand sometimes.6. It abruptly ends; there isn't really a \\"conclusion\\" or a wrapping up of her thoughts.These are the reasons that this isn't the best book. I would NOT read it again or for pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOR-RING","review":"This book was terribly boring! It was a two-year journal of a 14-year-old girl named Catherine Hall. The spelling of words and grammer were old fashioned(journal written in early 1830's) and I found it hard to understand and I am thirteen! I read alot and I found this book very boring. I couldn't even finish it. The book was 144 pages and I read up to 112. It was too boring to finish. And yes, I did pay attention to the book, but it just wasn't my type."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid!","review":"I thought this story was extremely boring! Maybe I'm just a kid (13), but there was no interesting parts. Everyday had a different subject and I couldn't understand the old fashioned language.

Some parts were very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrsteph - My Review for Academy Extra Credit","review":"I had to read this book for school this week. The first 20 - 30 pages were very slow and boring. In the end, the book was a slight more interesting. I would not recommend this book to my peers. I did not enjoy reading A Gathering of Days.Some of my ideas of how the author could have made this book less boring:1. Added more suspenseful climaxes2. Taken out unimportant information3. Wrote this book in regular format, not journal format4. Used better word choices throughout the context of the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catherine and the phantom","review":"Catherne writes her diary from 1830 to 1832. She faces many challenges, such as growing up without a mother and losing a dear friend. Catherine can't find her school book. She looks for it everywhere. When she finds the book there is a call for help from a phantom, runnaway slave. Will she help? I didn't like this book very much. The text is a little \\"old fashioned\\" and the events are pretty boring. It started out with good suspense, but it lost my interest pretty fast. It is an actionless book. So that's why I rated it low."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gathering of Days","review":"I did not enjoy reading the book, A Gathering of Days. The entire book uses odd phrasology that detracts from the overall effect of the story. The word choices throughout the book make it very difficult to read and understand. The story is fine in and of itself but I was unable to enjoy the story because of the heavy word usage and poor sentence structures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough read","review":"I'm a middle school teacher and have read loads of teen lit. This is probably the most difficult teen lit book I've ever encountered. The language was so stilted, trying (overtrying really) to sound like \\"old-fashioned\\" diction. While the story was passable, I found the language to be a major impediment (and I'm an English major, used to the likes of Shakespeare and Milton). I can't imagine any of my students getting out of this book what is actually in it. Unfortunately because of its brief length, well-spaced print and short chapters, I'm afraid my struggling readers will be drawn to it thinking it easy. As a result I'm taking it off my choice book shelf. I can't imagine what the people who set reading level, or who award the Newberry Medal were thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A year in the life of a girl from the early 1830's","review":"Written in the form of a journal, this book is the story of a year in the life of a fourteen year old girl living in New England in the early 1830's. During the year, Catherine helps a runaway slave, loses her best friend, sees her widowed father remarry, and leaves her farm forever.There is something about a book written as a journal that draws the reader close to the characters.I had just started this book when a fifth grader came into the library and asked if I could find her a book like A Gathering of Days. She loved it and wanted to read more books like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT a page-turner","review":"'A Gathering of Days' had a lot of potential. Catherine went through a lot of conflicts, i.e. the Phantom, Cassie's death etc. But it was just plain boring. I had to force myself to finish it. Maybe I would have liked the book better if it wasn't written in journal form. I don't know. None of the conflicts were portrayed well enough and they all had a very hollow ring. I don't think I would recommend 'A Gathering of Days' to anyone and I will definitely not read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Yawn!","review":"I had to read this book for reading class and had to keep a log for each chapter!!! I am 13 and enjoy reading alot, but this book lacks a plot. The begining starts out fine. You read about the Phantom but then you don't hear about him till the very end of the book. I felt like burning the book and trashing it, and I probley would have. But if I did that I would have failed. This is the most stupid book, and I pity anyone who has to read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I thought this book was extremely dull and didn't deserve to win that award.

I only read this because it was part of my class project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better as you get older","review":"As other reviewers have said, this book gets better as the reader gets older. I read this in grade school (15 years ago!) and never liked it much, but now it's a whole lot better. It's not a fast-paced, super exciting book, but life in the 1830s on a farm wasn't exactly fast-paced either. When Catherine writes that the family was snowed in and she knitted all afternoon, that's exactly what happened. It's not exciting but life can't always be a thrill a minute. I thought the language was appropriate for the times, and the depiction of relationships was appealing. The small pleasures of life are recorded, and the problems of life also weave their way through the journal.If you hated it when you were young, try it again when you are through high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it worth it?","review":"I found the book \\"A Gathering of Days\\" interesting and filled with small pieces of history, but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read. The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but I want stereo versions too.","review":"Mono is a disease, it squeezes the life out of music but that's they way they recorded it. The band is great and the music top notch, but frankly I will have to also search for stereo versions of these songs wether they are remixed or not. I don't know what the hell they were thinking back then. It was 1964 (onward) and by that date few were recording in that flat format. Oh well. If you want it all in mono then it's all here. And that's better than nothing. I do love this band though as they were awesome in spite of the mono recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I received my order promptly.

I always loved the Zombies, Argent, Colin's solo works, and I still have the vinyl recordings. When I first saw this, my super-ego kicked in, and for a while my id was in deep pain. Why is it so expensive? Well, I found out the answer. It's worth it. Imagine clean sound, great stereo mixes where available, unearthed BBC recordings, brilliant liner notes. This is the real deal. Plus you realize that this was a band for the ages. Worth every penny. Come on, you're worth it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get better","review":"The Zombies are on par with the Beatles, The Who, the Kinks, and better the overrated Rolling Stones. These guys wrote more complex music than anyone outside of Brian Wilson. The melodies are positively shimmering. Buy this box. It has everything they ever recorded and all of it is worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any fan of good tuneful pop music","review":"In my opinion,The Zombies rank as the most underrated pop band of all time. This set proves my point better than anything I could ever say about the band. The variety of the material is overwhelming, straight r&b numbers to bittersweet romantic ballads and more progressive sounding numbers (which would lay the groundwork for bands like Procul Harum who emerged shortly after the Zombies demise). Their version of George Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\" ranks as one of the best versions of the tune,on my list it is right next to the Miles Davis/Gil Evans rendition done a few years earlier.There are so many standout tracks its hard to just contain myself to naming a few. My only recommendation is that if you don't have it now....Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Price","review":"The Zombies were the ultimate white R&B; group from England. Guys like Tom Petty grew up idolizing these guys and the reasons are easy to see on this box set. You get everything the guys did in the studio and a ton of BBC recordings on the 4th disc.I am not that crazy about the 3rd disc - out takes and alternate takes - it's the music on discs 1, 2, and 4 that make this a pleasurable listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time to Remember / One Special Night","review":"great product would buy from again without hesitation very good still sealed very good one of the best wonderful out of words to use"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loved them!","review":"I happened upon these by chance for a gift for my 13 yo daughter for Christmas.

There are subsequent volumes on Theater, Architecture, Poetry, Painting, Cinema, The Novel, Opera.The approach is by and large historical and Grunfeld ably conducts us along the long route from the 'primitive tribal musicmaker through the medieval chorister, the eighteenth century court performer, the romantic composer to the jazz improviser.'He touches in the last chapter on the Beatles and popular music. There are one- hundred and seventy - accompanying illustrations.Were such a volume produced today it would of course come with an accompanying C.D. containing illustrations of the music spoken about.But this is a good, solid history which too relates the development of Music to parallel developments in the other Arts and Society in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"May work great, but they don't fit my Cobra MR HH425LI","review":"Well, purchased the Cobra HH425 waterproof, handheld marine radios about a year ago and still haven't seem to find a earbuc/mic that works.

My only objection is that Melanie Travis begins to wear on your nerves because she is so obstinate about EVERYTHING. There isn't just a few things she is hard headed about but everytime she comes up against something, she braces her feet. She is stubborn about her dog, her son, her job, her ex, Sam, her aunts and the list goes on. This becomes not only predictable but very boring. Melanie needs to become somewhat flexible and leave some of the pig headedness behind to make these books not only entertaining but more believable. Ms Berenson does an excellent job of transporting you to the dog show world, it's just that sometimes I wish she'd leave Melanie at home to grow up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great listen, now i want to see them live!","review":"great, light and funky. it travels...anything but discordant, but don't plan on prediciting the next change or where the groove will go. recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this tape!

With persistence all the dust etc. can be removed, but it's impossible to get the streaks out that the cleaner itself puts there - a real mess. It is possible to sort of clean the screen so that when it is turned on I can sort of convince myself that remaining streaks don't mater that much, and anyway the sun will move round in an hour or so.. However this is quite unnecessary, the regular cleaner I use for my anti-reflective spectacle lenses works very well (Hilco Shield AR cleaner) in combination with a good microfiber cloth, and even successfully cleans up the streaky film left by the iClean (wash the cloth as per instructions after doing this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Save yourself $10 and buy a jar of mayonnaise, you'll get the same results smearing that all over your screen.

The writing style in the book is lighthearted and a bit funny, so it's great to read when you're bored.I sort of stopped at the part where it required the reader to sing and dance, but I'm sure that would have been a good sort of spacey bit of fun had I been alone.

I found the descriptions of the imagery used in the Universal Waite deck to be very useful, and the spreads included were fun to use, not just the same old spreads found in every book. I did find the organization to be counter-intuitive, however, what with the court cards coming before the pips. Also, I would have appreciated it if some of the examples of readings shown were more realistic--apparently, the people the authors read for have ideal lives and nothing ahead but great things, which is not generally the case for me and those for whom I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on Tarot, I Love it.","review":"I have a few books on Tarot, and to be honest with you, this has to be my most favorite book on the subject.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for beginners","review":"I always say, you can't go wrong with an Idiot's Guide, and this book is proof! The authors do a great job in not only providing card interpretations but creating a structure for the reader to expand on those interpretations and come up with their own system of divination. Each card is explored in a logical progression, with upright and reversed meanings as well as worksheets for the reader and hints on relating the card to the everyday environment. Then there's the famous Idiot's Guide hints on each page about the information covered. Tips for different spreads and for designing your own spread are also included.The additional information on different fortune telling systems seemed like an afterthought to me, but that hardly diminishes the book's usefulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fab How-To-Guide","review":"In a word: Thorough.

When the evil Shredder attacks,these turtles boys don't cut him no slack.

It also makes absolutely no sense to me as to why the game is a two-player fest only, when it was absolutely a natural for up to four players.My 5 year-old twins, on the other hand, loved it and couldn't put it down. Unfortunately there isn't much available on the X-box for young kids. Is it a violent game? Yes. Is it mild afternoon cartoon violence that the kids have seen before? Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"This game is for young kids only. The graphics are not worthy of an xbox game, nor is the sound. It is just mindless fighting along the lines of late 80's style arcade games with comparable graphics...I thought we had escaped those types forever. In addition to all of its problems, the characters keep saying the same 2 or 3 phrases over and over and over and over....did I say and over!The only xbox game that I've seen worse than this one would probably be sneakers and I gave it a higher rating, just because it doesn't have one liners that drive you crazy. This is a great gift for that neighbor that you don't like...his kids will drive him insane inside of 3 minutes.

Hess has written one of the best researched accounts of Pickett's charge ever written. Working from primary sources with some secondary sources thrown in, Hess takes the reader through a step by step account of what happened on July 3, 1863. The author provides the reader with everything they need to understand the place this event holds in the battle of Gettysburg specifically, but also in the course of the war generally. The major actors; Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, Pettigrew and others are revealed in detail. Hess also introduces voices often overlooked. In this case the foot soldier who made history. Enlisted and commissioned remembrances are used and both confederate and union participants are included. Due homeage is paid to the bravery of the confederates. However the author also reveals the courage of the union forces that repulsed the attack.For civil war buffs this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picketts Charge, The Last Attack at Gettysburg","review":"I agree that the Battle of Gettysburg and Pickett's charge were actual events; However the rest of this book is fiction.General Lee is the one who ordered Picketts Charge, not General Longstreet.

It's something that's not the easiest thing to do and they should be commended for it. \\"Remedy\\" was a near masterpiece, and \\"Rooty\\" was almost as good. Heck, even their \\"atlantic jaxx recordings\\" complimation had some great work. \\"Kish Kash\\" continues this \\"evolution\\", but is not a stand out performance. In fact, there isn't even a \\"outstanding\\" song on the album. Maybe all the guest appearances take your mind off finding the \\"great\\" song on the album.

Their downfall though was the fact that after a while their songs become annoying and painfull to listen to (If I hear Red Alert/Romeo once more!!!!. I am happy to say that this album contains none of that rubbish anymore.All the songs on this cd must be heard a few times before they begin to work their magic on your ears. Songs such as Good Luck and Hot'n Cold are some of the best house tracks available anywhere. They are pure genius with the unresistable beat of H'nC with Felix in the background, and the funky house song Good Luck which must be played on full volume. The rest of the album is superb except for two horrible, horrible songs Cish Cash and Supersonic which are pointless and are as bad as nails on a blackboard. Overall the best house album you can buy this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!!!","review":"I've loved Basement Jaxx since their beginnings with FLy Life. I've seen them live twice.

Three good songs and the rest is just boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"heroin-chic, acid-infused pop","review":"This album is perfect for summer. I must admit I was a little phased by some songs upon first listen - at how really bizarre they are!But its truly a venture into this hyperpaced, acid-infused carnival. Every song is pure hyped up fun - but not without a large dose of serious musicianship, computerization, and thought.If you arent too sure about it at first...I recommend playing it while working out or getting pumped up for a fast night on the town.This is the first online review I've given, basically because you wont regret getting this CD. Its like Groove Armada's amazing 2003 disc \\"LoveBox\\" - just far better. And Outkast will be long forgotten if this disc really gets its arse out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"Ok So I love Rooty and Remedy. They are both great cd's which I loved the first time I heard them. So when I heard Basement Jaxx was releasing a new album I ran out to get it. I put it on and after listening to it about halfway I had to get the cd sleeve out and make sure that it was the same band. Yeh all the same type production was there but just not the fun. There was nothing that really stood out even after 5 listens. I guess if you like hip hop you might like this album more but if your looking for the fun dance music of the past dont look here. I am sorry to ruin its perfect rating and maybe down the road I will put the CD in and be like this is awesome but as for first impressions and expectations i was let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs for everyone","review":"I love love love this cd!

If you're feeling quiet and mellow they have some songs to listen to, or if you're feeling more upbeat they some of those songs too. If you don't have a taste for different music, this cd may not be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about winning the war","review":"Basement Jaxx has always been the most diverse dance music team. Far more risk taking than either Chemical Brothers or Fatboy Slim. Probably only Leftfield is more exotic. It's all about moving your body. The first two Basement Jaxx records were very different from each other. There is a lot of hard driving disco on most of their records. Kish Kash is probably more heavy funk than their past records. For this new sound they get singers Meshell Ndegeocello, JC Chasez, and Dizzee Rascal. JC Chasez rips it up on \\"Plug It In\\" and sounds like a Michael Jackson at his best in the process. Siouxsie Sioux sings the title track that sounds like a hyped up punk track, much like The Prodigy. Siouxsie sounds most unlike herself in years. Meshell Ndegeocello is the standout singer on her two songs, especially \\"Right Here's The Spot.\\" A definite winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, well produced dance music","review":"With all the bad dance music that exists in the world (Ian Van Dahl and other Cheesetrance) its great to hear the consistantly well made and enjoyable music of Basement Jaxx. Kish Kash may not be the magnum opus everyone wanted or expected, but its full of excellent genre jumping grooves. From the stellar opener with Lisa Kekaula on the electro-punk-rock-60s soul of Good Luck, to the sexy fun groove house of Meshell Ndege Ocello on Right Heres The Spot, and JC Chasez best performance to date on the insidiously catchy Plug It In.The most unexpected pleasure for me on this album was the cyber-ballad of If I Ever Recover with its great string section and melancholy vocal.No its not Remedy or Rooty again, but its trademark Jaxx, with some amazing tunes, musicianship and singing. Give it a chance"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jaxx' second best album...","review":"I'll agree Remedy Part Deux it ain't. While we're at it, it's starting to sink in that Daft Punk is never going to remake Homework. I'll weep while I boogie to this very good, if a tad bit overworked, album from the Jaxx. Tracks 4 and 6 stand up against the best of the Jaxx in my opinion. Kish Kash (love that name) is slightly better than Rooty (a good album in its own right) and the beats are out of this world as ever. I just wish they'd return to the real dirty funk and cut back on the all-star parade of guest singers. It's a common affliction shared with several of their brethren, and it's maddening.I still give it 4 stars, in part cuz it is good on its own and in part for being so much better than most of the drivel we saw in 2003. On second thought...is that really one of them n'sync boys on Plug it in??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basement Jaxx at its best","review":"Basement Jaxx continues to prove that when it comes to House music, they are in a class by themselves. Kish Kash sounds nothing like their previous two albums, Remedy and Rooty, but Kish Kash is evidence that Basement Jaxx will continue to take risks and come up with something unique.The album is fusion of House, Rock, Techno, Hip-Hop, Pop, and Funk. In my opinion, all of the tracks stand out for their uniqueness. The best tracks are \\"Lucky Star\\", which features UK rap artist Dizzee Rascal and \\"Good Luck\\", featuring Lisa Kekaula. The two MeShell Ndegeocello songs are also very catchy. Basement Jaxx also did the unthinkable: They made a song featuring a member of N'Sync (J.C. Chavez) very listenable.When Basement Jaxx comes out with their fourth U.S. release, I bet you that it will sound totally different from any of the other 3 albums. Kish Kash proves that Basement Jaxx are among the most talented artists in dance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alaska Highway","review":"Bought this book for my dad who was going to take a trip down the Alcan highway!

Well, it just wouldn't go back together easily... like not at all. It was constructed poorly, couldn't get it back on without forcing it. I ended up not even bothering and just throwing it away the first day out of the package.

I found this one at a local home improvement store and after a recommendation from one of the store employees got it. I was using it to find studs for hanging grab bars. I tested it on places I knew there were studs and it found them. So I went to work with the latest grab bar and this found the stud like a dream.

The only thing that has any redeeming value are the hot girls, but even then it doesn't do much. NOT WORTH IT.Terrible. I'd rate this a \\"Instant stream\\" or a \\"torrent\\". Dont waste a lot of money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"Well as long as you know going into this movie that it is supposed to be cheesy you will be ok. This is an ideal popcorn movie for the simple fact it is funny, cheesy, and plenty of boobage (come one who gives thumbs down to that). Not a bad movie to add to your 3D collection, although I have seen way better 3D in other movies this one adds to the \\"popcorn\\" movie effect. I gave it three stars because it is a good piece to watch with a couple of friends while drunk or drinking, or hanging out. For the price you cant say no to this one. A watchable cheesy fest with boobs galore."},{"rating":"2","title":"BAD HORROR GREAT COMEDY","review":"PIRANHA 3DD is not a great \\"horror\\" movie but it's pretty funny..and ultimately a hoot to watch. Director John Gulager obviously had his tongue deeply in cheek. There's plenty of T&A, excessive gore, complete with cheesy effects...and David Hasselhoff's self-parody is priceless. David Koechner, Ving Rhames, Clu Gulager. Gary Busey and Christopher Lloyd join in the fun. Danielle Pannabaker, Matt Bush and Chris Zylka gamely play the straight roles. It's a movie that entertains in spite of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"great to watch","review":"i think that there are more breast shots in this movie then the first one. In this movie it is based at a water park that turns wild. David Hasselhoff plays the life guard in the movie but he does nothing at all literally but just sit on the life guard seat watching. he runs to get someone only once. would be better if they had David to actually do some life guard stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"B Movie","review":"I haven't watched this movies as of yet, but my nephew loved it and said that it made fun of everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Sequel on all Counts","review":"What a disappointment. Actually, I didn't think Aja's Piranha held a candle to Joe Dante's original, anyway. However, it was at least a visceral, gory blast with lots of great eye candy. In this more-of-the-same sequel, there is less of everything. Less fun, less gore, less tongue-in-cheek comedy, less professionalism on the parts of the writer and director. What you get in this sequel is a bunch of pointless cameos, cartoonish direction, too-goofy comedy and less creative gore. Not to mention some less-than-inspired acting. It's no wonder this only got dumped into a handful of theaters before ending up on disc. However, if you're looking for mindless fun on the level of a SyFy channel movie (with a bigger budget), then you'll probably enjoy this undemanding junk. Not too bad for a beer-drinking time-killer. You be the judge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odyssey","review":"When I first read this book about 40 years ago I remember thinking that no government could be so spineless.

I bought it for my grand daughter for Christmas. Although it is advance for her, it is a great learning tool and a wonderful story........"},{"rating":"2","title":"why my daughter always asks me to read this","review":"...the writing is so lyrical, the characters so funny, and characteristic of thurber, frought with human flaws while still being heroes, and each adventure solved, in the end, by wit and ingenuity. the prose is beautifully tight. it is written, like E.B. White, for the inner ear -- sonorous, and full of Thurber mischief. \\"I am the Golux, the one and only Golux -- and not a mere device.\\" My eight-year old loves the rhythm. My 11 year old loves the humor, and I love thurber's wink to me about literary devices...for us, this book is always at hand for the sheer joy of reading it aloud."},{"rating":"1","title":"You may not want these illustrations","review":"Be warned that this edition does not have the 1960s illustrations by Ronald Searle, which are masterpieces of children's illustration. Alone, \\"The 13 Clocks\\" is five stars.(The edition with Searle has the Duke on the cover, standing with his sword on a blue and white harlequin floor.)The publishers chose to reissue the book with the original illustrations. Unfortunately, James Thurber was blind by the time \\"The 13 Clocks\\" was illustrated, so he had a friend, Marc Simont, do them. Although Simont is an award-winning artist, he is rather conventional. It's Searle who did the really extraordinary, detailed illustrations matching the mood of the book.Obviously this is partly a matter of taste (or of which version you read first!), but I bet 4 out of 5 preteens would prefer Searle. As an adult, I have multiple illustrated versions of some of my favorite books. Suffice it to say I don't have Simont's version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thirteen Clocks and the Wonderful O","review":"'The Thirteen Clocks and the Wonderful O' is one of the childhood books my brother and I still fight over, even aged in our mid to late thirties. It is a perfect combination of stories about princesses, goodies, baddies and above all about what language means. The two books I connect it with in my mind (and I've no idea why the first, some idea about the second) are 'The Phantom Tollbooth' (forgotten the author) and Haroun and the Sea of Stories (Salman Rushdie) which has the same glorious connections between words and metaphor"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight For Young And Old And In-Between","review":"\\"Once upon a time, in a gloomy castle on a lonely hill, where there were thirteen clocks that wouldn't go, there lived a cold, aggressive Duke, and his niece, the Princess Saralinda...\\"This was a fast and fun romp. One part wicked to two parts whimsy, it's a book to delight all ages. Children will love the story, and adults will enjoy the more sophisticated humor and word play. If you know anything about James Thurber, (or maybe even if you don't), you'll appreciate how much fun he had writing this story. In the Foreword he explains that he wrote The Thirteen Clocks when he was supposed to be working on another book. He called this \\"an example of escapism and self-indulgence.\\" Sixty years later, it served the same purpose for me.The funky and stylized artwork is entertaining, too. When Zorn of Zorna dons his princely raiment, he looks like he's wearing a frilly tablecloth. But it's a welcome change from the uniformity of today's computerized graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was about to give this book away","review":"But before I did, I noticed it was written by James Thurber of humor fame. I must have picked up this book at a flea market or thrift store before I began noting the date/place I bought it. It was a discard from an area junior high school. The last date someone checked it out was in the late 1970s (the ink was smeared).The book sat in my loaded bookshelves for lo these many years.Before I put it in the give-away box, I decided to read it. Now, I WILL NOT give it away! The dust jacket is still attached and a plastic sleeve (torn, but still...)protects it even more. It is the Simont edition. Being a Janie-come-lately writer, I loved the poetic devices that other reviewers have mentioned. I agree that it's too intense for all children, but for the fantasy readers, it will be exciting. I may read it again--aloud--to my cats. I wonder if they would go to sleep before I finished?I'll go to Ever After with this book clasped in my cold, ungloved hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thirteen Clocks","review":"I thought that this book was a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read great fairy tale. A tale with Princes, Princess and an evil Duke. I couldn't put the book down. It was short and sweet. There is a simple plot and characters that are easy to relate to. There were many descriptive sentences that painted detailed pictures in your head. I also enjoyed the pictures in the book and found them very amusing. This book as some surprising twists in it that you would never guess.

I like mysteries that I can solve myself but this one was too difficult. Also, it was strange because the Hardy boys rode motorcycles and they are too young.

Rosa Passos has the ability to take the listener outside of his/her element into an exotic musical experience. I would venture to say that the majority of the people who enjoy the Bossa Nova genre, aren't well versed in the language or the culture of Brasil. Aficionados in this case will compensate by using musical discernment. The real joy in lisenting to Rosa Passos is the emotion her voice evokes and the aficionado's response to her voice.

I found new information that makes me think that both sides screwed up the peace process and how the English are just as ruthless as the IRA, if maybe not more so. The book cleared up a few questions I had on Bloody Sunday and other pertinent dates in this war. Holland should be commended for keeping the details interesting and at the same time informative. The \\"Troubles\\" will never really be a victory for either side but at least it is a little easier to see how things have progressed or regressed through the years.

So she instead focuses on classic southern soul, traces of which are heavy in her only hit \\"Don't Think I'm Not.\\" That song is the standout track on here, and it isn't even that good. It has too much of an old-school feel. I also thought \\"Hey Kandi\\" and \\"Sucka For You\\" were catchy, and \\"Easier\\" was a smooth duet with Faith Evans, but there's no obvious hits on this entire CD.

DiPiazza and Eccles propose, for instance, that the internal data managers use to make operational decisions within their company be made available externally.

Perhaps the story has been over-done, but I found nothing new and challenging in this book. I haven't read the first book and I don't think I am going to. It is not offensive but not powerful either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"I absolutely love Elizabeth Berg and started to fall in love when I first read her novel \\"Open House\\". I was soooo excited to finally read \\"joy school\\". Well, it did not add up to Berg's other books at all, and I was very disappointed. Since I am in my early 20s, I found the character Katie to be nothing like a 13 year old. Her character was very unbelieveable. I constantly felt like I was rolling my eyes at Katie while I was reading. In Berg's other books, the characters are dynamic and interesting and believeable. This book was not all I hoped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read","review":"This is the fourth Elizabeth Berg book I've read, and it has cemented my admiration for this writer. \\"Joy School\\" is actually a follow-up to \\"Durable Goods\\", but I wasn't aware of this when I commenced this book. You don't need to have read the first book to enjoy this one. Ms Berg has a real gift for creating wonderfully three-dimensional characters. In this case she's writing in the first person as a teenage girl (often a curly one for some writers) and she pulls it off beautifully. There are funny moments, sad moments, and moments so poignant you feel as though you're the main character yourself. I've just started another of Elizabeth Berg's books, \\"Range of Motion\\" and so far, so good. I'll certainly keep buying books by this author - long may she write!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and true to life.","review":"Once again I'm amazed that Elizabeth Berg has so perfectly captured the essence of a teen aged girl...or at least the kind of girl I was.

But when I got into it, and read about Princess Phones and the Presidents program for youth fitness, I started to realize that this was a period piece. That is my favorite form of writing. So, I spend my time looking for clues. The Princess Phone was introduced in 1959. But it was really only like a status symbol cool thing in the early 1960s. I have this feel for history, and I believe I narrowed down my guess to 1962. I wanted to write the author, but she gives out her home address, but no email. She even has her own website.I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in recent history as told from the point of view of a teenager.

The story centres around the recreation of one of the firms earlier and failing magazines by Maxi, to the point where she is able to take on Cutter and so preserve the company..admittedly a big stretch of the imagination but so in tune with the soap opera style of the book that it's almost impossible to put down !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy for $39 on publishers website","review":"You can order this book for much less on the Wiley website.

What makes this album truly interesting, however, is the fact that it is actually a studio recording with crowd noise overdubbed onto it. Thus, this is almost like listening to a rehearsal of the group in the studio, albeit with crowd sounds. Don't let this album scare you away from further exploration of the 13th Floor Elevators.

Mr. Ross is great not only at story-telling but also at gleaning lessons (life lessons) from his and others' experiences. He shares those in this book without being too preachy.

It is the same movement that led to the American Revolution, and it is motivated by the same kinds of abuses. He chooses to ignore the abuses and dismiss them as \\"conspiracy theories\\", but one has only to read the many books on such abuses to find the real causes of the militia movement, and learn the stories of the many victims of abuse that haven't been told yet.

And it netted a bunch of people in my group of friends who I've been trying for YEARS to get hooked on Phish. Sleep has this decidedly Simon and Garfunkel feel to it.

The writing is really quite good. The arrangements are simpler, yes, but they are no less profound.

I hope all of you enjoy the phish rhythms, beats, and all around jams because you all will surely burn for your laughter and joy. When trey sings \\"God isn't one of these\\" I would have liked to burn his hide with the rod of the mighty lord, but instead I prayed for his sins and the sins of all the lizard sinners. When the phish get all funky and tripped out on \\"Gotta Jibbo\\" I thought I was going to get a contact (if you hippies know what I mean). I hope the lord takes mercy on your snake bitten, resin filled, dank, sticky, fluffhead worlds. You phish people are doing the work of satan, especially on that creepy, crafty song \\"Back on the train\\" - is that a reference to the ride satan takes on the crazy acid train? Interesting, isn't it? Pray for forgiveness phish people the lord is coming - try reading \\"left behind\\" by Jerry Jenkins. It will save your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Non-Phish-Fan LOVES this album","review":"My previous exposure to Phish gave me the impression that they were great riff-masters with short attention spans who couldn't put together a nice, coherent song. This album changed my mind! Every single number is not only beautifully composed and original, but they also hang together as songs that you never get tired of hearing. The songs have great melody, lyrics and emotional resonance. They have that hippie-ish feel of the 60's with plenty of riffs to go round. A bit folky, a bit psychedelic, some Allman-type riffs--this is one crowd-pleaser album. Buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the best","review":"Farmhouse, The latest from the loveable \\"jamband\\" Phish is another good studio album.....nothing amazing but nothing all that poor either..This album has the pop elements that make it very accesable for the new listener, but some of the loved concert jams that make it appeal to the avid fan....although im not fond of this version of Piper...give me 12-6-97 anyday :). Although you cant compair any stupid phish to their live outings.

A couple of the tunes have landed in my head and can't get out, like \\"Bug\\", \\"Gotta Jibboo\\" and \\"Dirt\\", and the album itself has multiple play power. A finely crafted piece of music. My only complaint is that the first listen didn't quite catch me like the live albums did, and Phish is just more listenable live than in the studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dig it...","review":"Yeah, Farmhouse is good. 4 or 5 tracks totally kick butt.

Here is how you rate a phish album, go buy whatever billboard says is the #1 album (santana aside) listen to how much it [is bad] and then listen to some phish, ANY phish. They are the last of the great musicians and while their lyrics tend to scare people away, no one can dispute their skills. Trey may be the cleanest guitar player I have ever heard. Page's playing is, at times, straight up orgazmic. And you will NEVER find a better rythem section then mike and fish. Oh, as for farmhouse, I love it because I get MORE phish in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is phish?","review":"ok this is ridiculous.When i heard phish was comin out with a new cd a while back i couldn't stop smiling...

RIDICULOUS i'm gettin tired of hearing heavy things on teeny bop radio. I'm gonna go listen to Rift now."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is All The Complaining About","review":"This is definitely not Phish's best album. In fact, it very well may be their worst. Nonetheless, the complaints that this album has strayed from previous albums are unfounded. No one can say that Story of the Ghost or Billy Breathes were any less mainstream. And as for Hoist, Down With Disease is the most altered studio song in the band's history. You have to go all the way back to Lawn Boy to get studio stuff that sounds remotely similar to the live Phish sound, but even this masterpiece has been altered, as Page's piano solo at the close of Squirming Coil would attest. So give Phish a break and understand that this stuff is not what it is live. Do understand, though, that Farmhouse's playlist is worse than any album to date (perhaps with the exception of Ghost). Outside of First Tube and Piper this is not GREAT Phish. It is, however, the work of the best band of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Studio sound just keeps getting phatter","review":"Phish is continuing to evolve into an important studio rock band through thoughtfully written songs and also through the careful attention to the production of their albums. Ever since Billy Breathes, the sound of their studio albums just keeps on accelerating and the sound of \\"Farmhouse\\" is the best yet. Most of the critic reviews have stated that this album is good, but a bit bland and I just don't see that. The tunes are catchy enough to satisfy me. I think I may be in the minority who enjoys Phish's studio albums more than a live tape. I enjoy them both, but honestly their live stuff wore on me after a little while and I am enjoying seeing their studio evolution.(especially since B.B.) Farmhouse is definitely the peak in that evolution thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have album, even for none Phish fans!","review":"I'm no fan of Phish, but I was always into the Grateful Dead and Jerry, so this type of music is nothing new. But I'll tell you this is the first Phish album I listen too, and it is amazing! I love this album, it is so adictive. Here are the songs:1. Farmhouse - superb song, Bob Marley would have cried. 2. Twist - ok 3. Bug - Amazing, heavy, grungy. A five star song. 4. Back on the Train - On the road fun! 5. Heavy Things - Very well written. Amazing tune. 6. Gotta Jibboo - Trippy and flashy. Another five star song. 7. Dirt - The best song on the album. 8. Piper - Psyco to the max. 9. Sleep - Get drunk and you'll understand. V. Good 10. The Inlaw Josie Wales - Slow 11. Sand - Too pop 12. First Tube - Unbeleivable, what a play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phish is SOOOOOOO SWEET WITH this","review":"I got this CD and I can't believe how much I love it.

Thats the bottom line. buy this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phish's \\"American Beauty\\"","review":"Many of the reviewers have not failed to mention that Phish is best experienced \\"live\\". However, it is pertinent to mention that the band's latest disc, \\"Farmhouse\\" is comparable to the Dead's \\"American Beauty\\" album, in that the songs are short, well consise, beautifully played, and, might I mention, extremely catchy. Hopefully, more music aficionados will catch on to Phish because of this more accessible format. I, myself, am finally starting to appreciate the longer jams, i.e. Tweezer, that have been captured on the band's live CD's (\\"A Live One\\") or on tape. On that note, thanks Trey, Mike, Page, and Fishman for a great disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE ARE THE PHISH FANS?","review":"Lets not moan about phish \\"selling-out\\". I doubt that is even an issue. They are simply trying new things and if you are a fan you will except the new work for what it is. What were you people expecting to hear for years and years? Albums that sound identical to each other? Every great band has a \\"soft album\\". I don't think that most of you even care about the musical aspect of the song, you got so wrapped up in the length of it and immediately assumed this was for radio air time. please....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Artist!","review":"This is a great first album by a real up and comer. Tarsha Vega's lyrics are a much needed antidote to the sappy sugar of today's pop teen idols. She's got a great groove and this is definitely music to get you going -- try to sit still when Tarsha sings.

Relive the time when Sandy Stone was a working husband having a 'bit of strife parking the vehicle' on a Saturday morning and witness Les Patterson's definitive tribute to \\"The Yartz\\". Best of all, this book will introduce you to Humphries lesser known characters such as Rex Lear (a father of the bride), Lance Boyle (a Trade Unionist) and Neal Singleton (a trendy artist).

'What might have been' competes with the indictment of the lost opportunity to prevent the spread of the plantation system into the new territories of the emerging American system, especially in the wake of the Louisiana Purchase.Between the Declaration and the Gettysberg Address we find too much American history sawdust.Excellent piece of research behind the myth machines operating on a July Fourth schedule, 'whole cloth', like the commodity of empire in the British cotton kingdom that rapidly survived the blunder of losing its fiefdom in the soon reconquered South.Yeoman farmers?

There is 1 - 2 1/2 pages of written text and 1 picture given for each saint.

It will make good slices of about half of each clove, however, at the beginning of slicing a clove and at the end the garlic tends to get smashed and gummed up in the presser or in the blade. Also, it's difficult to get down to the very end of a clove since the press doesn't really allow you to press down completely to the blades. Finally, the metal part is small and poorly balanced making it difficult to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"In my opinion, do not waste your money on this particular item. First of all, this garlic slicer does not slide easily or evenly and I feel that there is a good chance of hurting your fingers. Secondly, it does not slice the garlic, it mangles it, as there is no blade and the metal opening that it has is not sharp. Thirdly, the bottom of the slicer slides on the counter when being used, as the base is plastic.

The songs are not only nostalgic, atmospheric, and humorous: they're downright well-written. Not only that, but the level of plot description in the liner notes only makes me wish that \\"Logan's Sanctuary\\" were a real movie. Jason Falkner's excellent solo number, \\"Search for Tomorrow\\" recalls James Bond movies and lounge singers.

Read what the critics are raving about and marvel that you actually agree for probably the first time. The songs are plenty in number and surprisingly (and refreshingly) short in length. Everything about them having multiple influences is true. They initially come across as another teen-angst band ala Limp Bizkit or Rage Against the Machine, but there is more. I'm starting to hear Blue Oyster Cult, for crying out loud. And even older late sixties blues-rock bands like Mountain and Vanilla Fudge. And that, my friends, is no small feat.

Be aware that it is not. It is rather a 6 song CD by a Chris Costa, and the only connection to Davis is that he wrote one of the songs. I listened to the CD, however, hoping I had inadvertently discovered an unexpected gem. I had not. The CD consists of bland, uninteresting, second-rate top 40/neo-country music.

Most of the \\"all-new\\" mini games are pretty mucht the same: repeadtedly pushing a button or dodging something. As for the format I don't like the different stars introducing the games. The Ice-Hockey is almost impossible and Volleyball is the same you got on Mario Party 4.

We took it home, popped it in, and played. Now when I say played, what I really mean is sit back in the chair and hold the controller with one hand, and wait for the computer to move your characters around and do everything while you wait to hit A again.Honestly, that's about it. You push A to roll dice. You push A to make a choice, and every once in a while you push A as fast as you can. The so called \\"great mini-games\\" were great challenges of \\"which plant is different from the others,\\" \\"who can push A the fastest,\\" or some form of addition and subtraction. We weren't pleased.If you are looking for a fun challenge, go for Super Mario Sunshine, or even Luigi's Mansion if you want something more simplified.

Good compressor and great price for what you get. I give it a thumbs up all the way! The only draw back is the copper pipe that leads to the tank from the compressor motor to pressurize the tank is exposed enough where it could be damaged.

For instance, the young viking obviously does not have blonde hair, so they set a thick wig upon his head.The acting is less than quality.

Looking back at the terroism of those years early 19 and 20th century which I lived through I think that the IRA plot of the story is just wrong. The story of Deirdra and her life choices is interesting. But that is the only good thing I have to say.

The author writes simply and clearly, in a tone that speaks to young adults with respect and kindness. The illustrations are also very attractive. I am thrilled to learn that I can order the other books in the series too. I have only two laments: a) that the author didn't push beyond the self-help tips to talking about the values and Christian virtues behind the recommended responses; and b) that there is no single book containing all the topics.

Second, and much worse, the phones don't always connect to the base when you try to answer an incoming call. I've reprogrammed the handsets to the base 4 times now, and still the same thing happens---the phone rings, I try to answer it, it beeps and the screen says \\"unable to connect\\". Good thing I have caller ID, so I can call these people back! Third and most annoying is the customer service department. If they know of a way to fix this problem I'll never be able to find it as all I can get are pre-recorded messages.

Charlesworth is simultaneously optimistic, warm, AND logical in her plain-language explanations of this complicated, overwhelming process. Reading it is like having a best friend who also happens to be a reproductive endocrinologist drop by for a few hours for coffee and a long chat! Charlesworth is an expert communicator--distilling detailed scientific processes into plain English. (My favorite is when she talks about the process of conception, and compares the navigation of sperm in the cervical canal to an action-adventure flick--as opposed to a tender romance movie--it's actually quite a feat for sperm to perform.) The author also sprinkles the book with enough information about her personal experience to reassure you that she's been there herself.

For one thing, volume 1 and 2 were carelessly packed on the same CD, a debatable choice, but let's say not dramatic. Where it hurts is the passage from one track to the other, where audible ticks and music discontinuity kills the original music flow.This is particularity annoying on volume 2. Theoretically there are 20 titles or so on the album, but when it came out, we listened to side one and then side two has a whole, not even noticing the passage from one song to the other. But this re-edition artificially reminds you that the track has changed, certainly not the way this masterpiece was intended.I simply threw this re-edition in the garbage and ordered the single re-editions, hoping I'll get better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of JUNK!!!!","review":"Took my dogs out on it once for about three minutes.

I bought this record thinking it would contain great (but odd) catchy pop punk, typical of what the band usually writes. It's nothing like that at all.

But take a couple more listens and you will find a classic band refusing to become a novelty act as they mature into a pop powerhouse.

Vocalist Chad Price stretches-out on his fourth album with the band. And let's not forget that you will never find a tighter band than Bill Stevenson (drums), Karl Alvarez (bass), and Stephen Egerton (guitar). Egerton especially deserves kudos for his playing here, which is fresh and energetic. This is a punk band that has a bunch of guys who could be playing jazz/fusion (and have! )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic?

With good effin' reason! The best way for me to describe this album is absoluting galloping, punishing Maiden on uppers. There is not a single weak moment, and all fans of speedy, melodic POWER metal must own this album. It is essential to any collection.

Reviving the tree serves as a balm to their imaginations, as they fantasize about the tree growing up, out, and below their apartment. Hence, the title, The Tree that Grew to the Moon.Each fantasy scenario is excellently illustrated and the story moves briskly to the point the girl decides it would be better to plant the tree outdoors. This decision conjures up a new wave of imaginary depictions about how the tree will bring joy to the neighborhood.Eugenie Fernandes, who is both author and illustrator, crafts a sweet tale that is not condescending or cloaked in some sort of lesson. Her vivid color illustrations reward those who look carefully, making this book fun to read with your favorite youngster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Tree Grows in Brooklyn and Keeps Right On Going","review":"This is a book with brightly colored illustrations that shows the imaginings of a little girl and her mother as they discuss the tree seedling that the little girl finds wilting on a hot summer day in Brooklyn.

It would be a sweet thing to observe in real life because of the warm-hearted spontaneity it would require but when it's transferred to paper it becomes stilted.

They wanted to have fun, but they also wanted to stretch their collective vocal prowess even further - and they succeed!I love this album (meaning: having a theme)!

Best is \\"Latin Soul\\", \\"Riddle\\", \\"I Love You More\\", the ballad \\"Whatever Will Be Will Be\\" and funky and cool \\"Dogs\\". The producers are really using the harmanies of the trio.

I believe that this album beats their previous ones hands down. They went for a truly unique concept (blending R&B with classical) and it works. This album also has a slightly harder edge than the lite-R&B of EV3.The album is worth the price for the \\"En Vogue Love Suite\\" alone. Never have these women sounded better or had better material to sing. The four songs in this love suite are incredible. \\"Crazay Love\\" is upbeat and fun. \\"Sad But True\\" is a beautiful ballad. \\"Love Won't Take Me Out\\" sounds empowering and exquisite with a classical backdrop. The album's highlight has to be \\"Whatever Will Be Will Be.\\" The classical outro is great in it.Some other great songs are \\"Latin Soul\\", \\"No No No\\", \\"Those Dogs\\", and \\"Falling In Love\\". This album may not generate any huge hits, but that doesn't matter. This album should be a hit so pick up a so far undiscovered classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a Masterpiece","review":"As I reviewed the other comments posted, I noticed that the majority of the reviewers were male. I also referred to these same comments before I purchased this CD. I regret that I did not follow my instinct to just WAIT until another friend has bought it. The album itself is not terrible. I have spent weeks trying to figure out if I like it or if I hate it which to me means that there is nothing special about it. I loved the single \\"Riddle\\" and like \\"Falling in love\\" and \\"Beat of Love\\" but given a choice between these singles and others by another artist, I would probably pick the other artist. So basically if you have $15 to donate to EnVogue, go ahead and buy the album. If you are a thrifty music buyer like I am - proceed with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I bought this used two days ago and I'm pretty glad I didn't pay full price. Mind you, Masterpiece Theater is not as bad everyone is saying, but by no means is it good. It's definitely below average. The production is just alright. At times, it is quite mediocre, cheesy and basic. The vocals are not very good. As mentioned by another reviewer, the ad-libs are bad and there is definitely some off-key singing on here. The songs are so, so repetitive and the nice harmonies cannot save them. The songs are poorly written, the lyrics are not great. Some may call the sampling of classical masterpieces as ingenious, but I see it more as a scheme to make their songs instantly familiar without having to pay the big check. (After 50 years of a composer's death, the samples can be used free of charge and without credit.) Also, the no-name rappers are terrible. There are one or two alright songs on here, unfortunately, I can't really remember which ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"EN VOGUE?","review":"Simply put, this record lacks imagination and innovation. En Vogue's production team fills this record with dated material. I am a big En Vogue fan, however I am resigned to say that maybe their time has passed.

I thought that Masterpiece Theatre might be a great album, unfortunately I was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Masterpiece Here","review":"There was a time when no female group could touch En Vogue. Not only did they possess flawless vocal and harmonizing ability, but they actually produced some pretty good stuff to listen to. It's sad to say that that day has passed, as is evident with \\"Masterpiece Theater\\". While their last album(and first without Dawn Robinson),EV3, was slightly below the quality of the first two records, this one is way below the level of anything that they have put out. The only good song on the album, \\"Riddle\\", actually swipes a sample of one of their previous hits. Talk about desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Masterpiece Here!","review":"Why did I buy this album, I HAVE NO IDEA!. This is a HORRIBLE album, only 1 song came off of this album and it barely charted hitting #93 on the R&B chart. \\"Riddle\\" was the only release from this album that I am aware of, how this group went from \\"EV3\\" to this piece of ...., is beyond me.

Soon after buying the Very Best Of album I decided to buy Masterpiece Theatre, as Riddle was not included on the Best Of, and I was not disappointed, in fact i felt compelled to purchase the other three albums. This album prooves that these women can still sing, with stand-out tracks including Sad But True, Love Won't Take Me Out and Love U Crazay. Beat Of Love and Latin Soul are also both excellent tracks, and although Those Dogs is strange first time round it gets better after each time you listen. My only complaints are Whatever Will Be Will Be and the fact that there are none of the kind of tracks they are so famous for, like Free Your Mind and My Lovin'.

The constructs that Keirsey invented -- most notably, the temperament groups SP, NF, NT and SJ -- are a very helpful expansion of the MBTI theoretical base. I believe Keirsey's portrait of an ISTP is the finest summary I have ever read for that type. It fits my brother to a \\"T\\". I identify most strongly with the ISFP, and Keirsey's characterization of that type is surely the most flattering ever penned. Though some will not agree with Keirsey's speculations about the temperaments of long-dead historical figures, there is much to admire about this volume.

Reminds me of the lives some people lead - and can learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundhog Day","review":"In the hands of director, HAROLD RAMIS, a film that could have been dull and depressing, is an imaginative, funny and a surprisingly toughing comedy. However Groundhog Day is much more than just a funny film, it confronts a whole grey area in mainstream cinema, and is incredibly philosophical.On top of all this, the film boasts some amazing performances. Most notably Bill Muarry and Andie MacDowell, in the leading roles. The chemistry between them in unequalled."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 for the movie one for the lying dvd","review":"First off this is wrong to try to sell people something that does not have what it says it has on the box. There is no DTS sound on this disc it is a flat out lie, Just like wwf raw for xbox half of what was on the back of the case was not on the game. Studios and game makers need to have a little integrity and atleatst be honest about whats something offers or doesnt offer. The movie is great and has always been a favorite the documentry is entraining, the commentery very dull harlod ramis seems to be doing it only because they told him he had too or maybe he needed some money. There are no new intrveiews with anyone accept Andie Mcdowell,no Bill Murray or Chirs elliot. If you have the old dvd or vhs this is not really whorth it if you have no GroundHog Day at all buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique and delightful movie","review":"Here's a movie that provides some humor, some romance, and an uplifting message. I think it would appeal to almost anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true classic comedy","review":"I have to go back to a funny classic like this, from time to time. Bill Murray at his best. The ideas that go through his mind are amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, original film","review":"I remember when this came out. Bill was on \\"GMA\\" & did the weather.Funny, original film. You wish comedies were ALL like this.Bill did a great job as Phil. All the things he did in the film as February 2 kept repeating.Harold in his bit part as the doctor. Another cameo by Willie Garson (Stanford from Sex & the City, There's Something About Mary).Decent extras on the DVD.BUT, an anniversary edition? Needed more. Like.........NO CHAPTER LIST OR ANY INFORMATION INSIDE ON THE FILM. The film was a hit & this is an anniversary release of it, how about something inside to read on the film?I did NOT care for the artwork on the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bill Murray's Best","review":"One of the best comedic performances to date by Bill Murray. He carries the load virtually by himself throughout the movie, although he also has an outstanding supporting cast.Doomed to relive Groundhog Day over and over again, we follow Murray's emotions as he goes from denial to acceptance, from happy to suicidal, and finally to conformity with his situation. We follow all of his hilarious attempts to correct the mistakes he makes in wooing his boss which he does by repeating all of his actions up to the point of failure and then correcting each failure the next day. And he does this until he can actually live out the \\"perfect day.\\"Lots of laughs here. Excellent acting by Murray. If you are a Murray fan, this is a definite \\"must have\\" DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ground Hog Day","review":"Sound was completely distorted, such that the background sound overpowered the voices of the main characters - impossible to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groundhog Day Blu Ray skips","review":"Movie skipped during playing.

Opened it to view the DVD and it will not play. It just shuts off. The DVD player reads \\"error\\". I contacted the shipper the next day and still haven't heard from them. Contacted Amazon and it is in review for refund.We went and rented it from Blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Sucking After All These Years","review":"I've heard so many people say this movie is great over the years that I actually almost started to believe it. But this film is like Starship Troopers: you can succeed in telling yourself that it was good up until the point where you actually have to watch it again. I suppose it may have been the intention of the writers for the audience to experience Bill Murray's agony, but not quite to this degree.I like Bill Murray, the problem in this film is everyone else. They're two-dimensional morons, cardboard cutouts that float around delivering scripted lines to advance the increasingly rickety plotline. There's not a single believable character in this film. A small problem for a romantic comedy, considering it's not actually funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your time seeing something else!","review":"Let me start by saying I'm a Bill Murray fan. I've been watching him since his great days on Saturday Night Live. With that said, this film has to be the worst I have seen during my stay on this planet! They took a good plot and slaughtered it. If the rating system allowed zero stars, I would have exercised it here. My wife and I watched this, dilly of dull, film together and could hardly keep our eyes open. This wasn't due to fatigue but rather the monotonous, monotone, stodgy way it DRAGGED on and on. As for the other reviewers who viewed this film more than once... I say, there's time lost you will NEVER get back. Get a life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring Murray film ever","review":"I have always been a Bill Murray fan. This movie is dull, it goes beyond repetitious, and it gets so old after the second iteration, its not funny. The only benefit I can think of from watching this video is that it may dull your senses into slumber if you are an insomniac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Anything Quite Like It","review":"No one invented quite such an original premise as is depicted in this movie.And it works great as a chaser after seeing \\"I Heart Huckabees.\\" It's every bit as existential, and frames a proposition for personal growth out of a nightmarish stagnation as compared to the complete freedom of time enjoyed by the \\"Huckabees\\" folks.No matter where you go, there you are. Each film says that it is up to us to make something better. This film says that once you get to a place of generosity, other-centeredness and relentless good will, you can be redeemed - if only to figure out anew what to do with all the time we've been given."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with this one.","review":"I have to admit I do not own this particular DVD. Why? I have no idea. I should, because I stop and watch it whenever it's on TV. Then again, maybe that's why I don't own it. Well, whatever the reason, I can assure you of this, it is not because this is a bad movie. When this movie first came out I saw it twice. It has so many elements that are so perfectly suited for Murray and his comedic style. Since it's release it has been copied many, many times, but it has never been duplicated. What would you so if you had to relive the same day over and over. Would you use your knowledge to take advantage of the situation? Would you eventually go crazy? Or would you use the time to better yourself? Well, pick up this movie and see what Bill Murray did with it. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite comedies!","review":"I thought Bill Murray was the perfect person to play this role, and I think its one of the funniest movies I have seen. The idea of having to live the same day over and over again is a great setting for Bill Murray's talents to shine. I love all the situations he puts himself into, for example the numerous suicide attempts and how he eventually learns anything and everything about everyone in the entire town. If you haven't seen this movie yet, definetly go check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"watched it over and over and over","review":"This movie is SO funny! I've seen it as many times as there are groundhog days in the movie. You can see the progression of Murray's character, too, as he moves from shallow and sarcastic to deeper and more caring. Nothing but thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, clever, unexplained plot!","review":"Why he's trapped forever in the same day is never explained, but it really doesn't matter in the end! This was a fun film, and I especially liked the progression regarding Phil Connor's approach toward dealing with his permanently living the same day over & over. First, he can't believe it, then he cynically tries to take advantage of it, before falling into despair, and finally lifting himself above it all. It's both an enjoyable and satisfying experience to witness his \\"rebirth\\" as a human being, although it's really not any kind of serious film! Bill Murray is perfectly cast, although I'd have rather seen someone like Meg Ryan in the female lead, instead of Andie McDowell. But that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absoulte classic, no doubt about it! Murray is great!","review":"Although it took me a couple viewings to realize this, it is defintly on my list of classic movies. It mixes a wonderful amount of comedy, romance, and a moral lesson(if you follow it right). Bill Murray in one of his best performances plays the egotistical weatherman Phil Connors. Every Groundhog Day he travels out to Punxtawney, Pa. to cover a groundhog festival. But with the intent on leaving the small town the next day he wakes up to find its Feb 2 again! And he keeps reliving the same day over and over until he gets it right. Its great to see Phil change from an egotistical selfish man to a kind hearted person. Along with him are Rita, a producer(Andie MacDowell) and Larry the cameraman(Chris Elliot). A great light feal good comedy that can be watched many times to enjoyment. All ages will love it. I highly reccomend that you see this. No dobut about it, a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic That Looks Great as a Blu Ray","review":"This has always been one of my favourite movies. As a Blu Ray the transfer is clean and the sound clear. Not much else to say really."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Bill Murray...","review":"...you'll love Groundhog Day.

It was on the coming soon list. Turned out to be a reissue with RCE. Doh!!!Excellent film, lousy DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What DTS sound?","review":"The only reason I bought this is the DTS sound. It says it in the back and its not.

I would definitely do business with this seller again1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...Over and Over and Over and Over and Over and Over","review":"This movie was hillariously funny. It was about a TV reporter(Bill Murray) who relives ground hog day for six months. His mission is to make his producer fall in love with him. This is acomedy for the whole family to enjoy. Comedy at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love me some Bill Murray","review":"What a great movie. This is where Bill Murray started for me. A must see for any fan of his!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crawl Out of Your Hole and See Groundhog Day!","review":"Just like other reviewers, I feel that one could watch Groundhog Dog again and again... How ironic, but maybe that's the point- to watch it until you cannot laugh anymore. Bill Murray was perfectly cast for the role of a reporter covering Groundhog Day. He is obnoxious, but has the opportunity to keep trying until he gets to get it right. Murray exceeds his Meatballs performance. Andie MacDowell and Chris Elliot are really cute too in their respective roles.Definitely make sure you see this movie, on G-hog day or any other time you need a good laugh- you might learn a little bit more about yourself too... And, you might never think about \\"I Got You, Babe\\" in the same way again- and maybe that's not such a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST SEE COMEDY!","review":"THis film is must see. You get good acting by the cast and some well timed humor. Futher more has a good plot. If you are in the mood for a romantic comedy this movie is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Drive Angry!","review":"A very cute movie. Many of my friends do NOT like this movie... it's definitely an \\"either you love it or you hate it\\" kinda movie. Personally, I could watch it over and over again and never get bored with it, there's always something new to catch that you missed before. You won't rent it for mental stimulation...in fact, it could quite give you a headache... it's dizzying storyline is very much pre-\\"Run Lola Run\\". Nonetheless, its humor - both slapstick and morbid - is very entertaining. I'd say: Try it first (i.e., rent it from the video store)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Classic","review":"I've seen this movie numerous times and it's still funny and enjoyable to watch. We watched it on Groundhog Day along with our kids (who usually refuse to watch \\"old\\" movies) and everyone really enjoyed. Bill Murray is a perfect fit for this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless favorite","review":"This is a very funny comedy; the jokes are truly timeless. I will never get tired of watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful picture","review":"I first saw this film a few years ago . I loved it .You delivered the product in perfect order in due time . Excellent !Merry Christmas and a happy new Year !Thor hafstad , Norway"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Murray at his best","review":"One of my most watched and favourite comedies. I was interested to see some of the other reviews here that compare it to a Karmic journey - that opened my eyes a little.I must confess the fascination for me lies in wondering exactly how long it took him to learn everything he does in the course of that movie. How many times would *you* have to repeat the same day to turn it into the best possible day? How many lives would you try to save, how many people would you try to make happy? How many piano lessons would you take? Would it be an option in the \\"real\\" world or would you just go mad from boredom instead?Oh I also like to watch it because it is very funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you watch, the funnier it gets","review":"This is one of those movies that I watched once and thought, \\"Jeez, that was fun.\\" I watched it again with some friends and caught all sorts of extra things. Each time I watch it, it gets funnier and funnier!You have the take the whole thing as a fun campy movie. Bill Murray is great as his character goes from egocentric weatherman to caring individual. Sure, this bizarre timewarp just \\"appears\\". Sure, much of Bill's motivation to change is that he just wants to escape the warp, not that he (at least initially) really cares about the people he's helping. But it's all in fun, and the bizarre things that go on are hilarious.There isn't any great redemption in the movie, or mystic message ... it's simply a lot of fun to watch, to catch all the subtle ways things change as the day continually loops back into itself for Bill. If you ever feel like you're stuck in a rut, this is the perfect movie to help you laugh your way out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plot, great philosophy, great comedy","review":"Bill Murray plays a not too sympathetic TV weatherman who's suddenly stuck in a snowy town he hates to be in. He's stuck there because he wakes up morning after morning at 6 a.m. to the same day, February 2, Groundhog Day.He just can't escape, he's there, in the same place, whereas everybody else live through this February 2 for the first time.He experiments with this life of his. He tries to be evil, tries to be over-good, tries not to care, tries to care too much, tries to commit suicide in all possible ways.Until he decides to live. To exploit all the positive and creative possibilities of living and not growing older and not having people blame or praise him for what he did yesterday (today!).An interesting philosophical experiment, more intense than other movies that play with similar thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundhog Day","review":"This movie is so much fun to watch, even if you have seen it many, many times. We watch it on Feb. 2, much as we watch A Christmas Carol in December. It is a holiday tradition. But the movie is also an inspiration, and it wouldn't hurt all of us to watch it a few times a year, just to remind us to be better people."},{"rating":"2","title":"6:00 Over & Over & Over Again!","review":"I purchased two of these. One for my cousin that just moved to Woodstock, IL where this movie is deeply rooted. I sent it to him so that he could watch it on Groundhog Day! He didn't own it and I thought that was an utter shame. I purchased the second one for me since I only owned it on VHS. It is wonderfully funny and everyone could relate to a horrible day that just doesn't seem to end. Everyone would definitely love this movie. Bill Murray is sarcastic and hilarious! It has great cameos of Chicago comedians and a really good cast of characters. If you don't own it - buy it. If you have never seen it, you really should! You won't regret it, unless you just don't like to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic great comedy with awesome bonus features","review":"I loved the movie Groundhog's day and I was impressed with this version. The DVD has a clearer brighter picture which made the movie that much more enjoyable. I also enjoyed the insight provided by the director, writer,and producer in the bonus features. The way they discuss this unique story line of the man having one day(albeit over and over again) to get it right; I am left with a better deeper enjoyment of the movie. Usually bonus feature ruin the movie's original effect but this time I found the bonus feature to heighten this movie watching experience"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundhog Day","review":"Harold Ramis's oddball comedy tracks a cynical meteorologist's hilarious efforts to free himself from a wormhole that's locked him into one of the dreariest days of his entire life. Murray's deadpan line reading and impeccable comic timing are what really make this such a cult favorite--especially as he devises various schemes to escape the temporal loop (including suicide!), and then decides to take a more productive tack. Chris Elliott, playing a dodo-brained camera operator, and sultry brunette MacDowell, the charming, cool-headed love interest, are wonderful as well. This is a fun, heady riff on petty misery that's tailor-made for Murray fans. Plus, you'll never hear Sonny and Cher's \\"I Got You, Babe\\" quite the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Existential Primer","review":"Wow. I came here to gush about this film but I see others have beaten me to the punch. Oh, what the heck...Brilliant film in a subtle, understated way. It works as a comedy, as a romance, and, most importantly, as a life lesson. In fact this film could serve as a light hearted but effective primer for existential philosophy. Note Bill Murry's character development in the film: He starts off his existential quest completely self serving seeking out physical gratification (don't we all). Then, when faced with the meaningless repetition of each of his 'days', he despairs. Only later when he comes to accept and even embrace the repetition of each Groundhog's Day does he find his salvation.
