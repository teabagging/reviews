In quality she can compete with the big boys. But she does have a tendency to have her characters radiate intense emotion constantly when there is no need for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"above-average chase book","review":"I enjoyed the book, although here and there i could have wished for a few fewer cliches; I think it is a little too much a book in which everyone who finds out anything is killed until near the end; the subject of the conspiracy itself is not novel; but the writing is fast-paced, and through the device of cellular memory the heroine is less of a wimpy damsel in distress than is usual in thrillers. On the whole, an enjoyable read. Oh, and I loved the scene in which Beth tells off her boss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring Intrigue","review":"Gayle Lynds has a special talent for pushing the edge of the genre, and the edge of science as well. Though all her books are well researched, this one is particularly so. What sounds impossible (the crux of the story) is not just a hairbrained (or should I say heart transplant) improbability. Though she's pushing it, only history can tell us if she was nudging it. This read will keep you with it, happily amazed. She's a made female top-of-the-form author, now, so look for her in print for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breathless ride","review":"Here is an author who puts the controversy of cellular memory on center stage while peeling away layers and layers of comspiracy. Yes, she suspends the reader's belief, but in doing so she raises another question: what part does attitude play in physical activity? Bev Convey has a transplanted heart, from a Russian agent killed in a car accident. She craves new tastes and new interests, but before a heart attack disabled her, she was physically fit. If the cellular memory contained in a new heart brings a new way of looking at life, then why can't Bev prefer Karate to some other sport? She has a fit body and a change of desire could very well provide her with new competencies. Gayle Lynd's exploration of this interesting medical phenomen while developing characters and a plot that rivets you to each page shows why Robert Ludlum collaborated with her to produce his last books. Already, in this story, she out-Ludlums Ludlum."},{"rating":"2","title":"How have we not heard of these guys yet?","review":"I bought this record when I was in the UK recently after I had read about the band on Iron Maiden's website.

But I have to say Ruffian is my all time sentimental favorite.I can remember watching the match race between Ruffian and the colt Foolish Pleasure. It was a time for women's lib and Billie Jean King vs. Bobby Riggs. I always wanted the girls to win!! But tragically Ruffian paid the price in front of our own eyes. I can remember crying for weeks after watching her beautiful black body fall. My heart was broken for years!This book is truly a magnificent tribute to one of racing's greatest heros, a big black filly named Ruffian. It reads much more emotionally than other tribute books currently on the market and will stay with you for years. Reading about Ruffian's will to keep running even with two broken legs will rip your heart out! Make sure you buy some stock in Kleenex before you begin this emotional memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMERICANS KILL THOROUGHBREDS","review":"Ruffian was run too hard too early. A thoroughbred doesn't stop growing the plates in their legs until they are three years old. They run them here in America one full year before that. That's why these horses' legs break when they are overworked. The same thing happened to the filly Go For Wand, who died in a race at Belmont Park for the same reason. Her foot actually broke off in front of national television. Now, Zenyatta's owners and trainer waited until she was three to run her and she may be the best horse ever. She was actually grown up before being asked to give her all.So, I can't read these tear-jerker books that are written in ignorance of a horse's anatomy and are about the greediness of American racehorse owners who can't wait until a horse is grown to ask such a price of an incredible animal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Horse Story Ever Told!","review":"I heard absolutely nothing about Ruffian other than the fact she was a great racehorse. Now I feel like I know everyone involved with her,intimately. This book was an emotional rollercoaster of a ride and I will read it many more times. Jane Schwartz captivated me from beginning to end with her wonderful ability to make you feel like your witnessing everything that is taking place. Anyone who appreciates great racehorses has to read this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience of exhiliration, reflection and tragedy.","review":"Difficult to read as the book unfolds because the ending is known but the personification of Ruffian holds one to the text. The author creates an historical flow and does not bog down in intricacies. A complex tapestry of the fraility of human personality and decision-making, causes the reader to ponder the \\"if\\" question.The book appears to be very honest in its approach to the people involved, the surly part of horse racing and tragedy itself. Ruffian's last night will be poignantly imaged in the reader's memory. The injury, subsequent failed surgery and eventual death are graphic but tastefully portrayed. A difficult belnd for any author.Top notch - just wish I could find a hard back copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK","review":"O MY GOD I LOVE THIS BOOK. IT IS SOOO GOOD. ITS VERY DEATAILED AND TELLS YOU EVER THING ABOUT HER LIFE. I FEEL LIKE IM ACTULLY IN THE RACES AND I CAN PICTURE EVERYTHING. I DONT NO IF YOU GUYS NO THE STORY OF RUFFIAN BUT IT IS SOO SAD! I CRIED. AND NO IM NOT JOKING I WAS LITTERLY CRYING!!!! I REALLY RECOMEND THIS BOOK AND IT WAS SO GOOD I THINK IM GONAN READ IT AGAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart breaking","review":"Well written, heart felt story about this fantastic horse and her short life. The story portrays the horros of the racetrack, the humanity of the people around the horses, and at the same time the horrifying aspekt af what happens when human kind turns a blind eye and put the wellfare of the animals ind second place. This story should never have been about her downfall, but about her triumps as an adult, fully grown horse.Absolutely heart breaking...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and Heartwrenching- well worth the read","review":"This is an amazing book! I loved every second of it from start to finish... I wish there were more to follow. One of the greatest throroughbreds of all times finally gets a great book. I learned so much about her life that just added to her brilliance. Everyone should know about this horse- most don't or say once she saw real speed she couldn't handle it and broke down. This is not the case and whether or not you are a horse lover, know a lot about racing or not, this story will get you hooked. I definately recommend this book, it will not disappoint you! You may shed a tear or two at the end, but it is WELL worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this slowly, slowly...","review":"because I knew where we were going, and I could not bear it. But it happened, it was Ruffian's story, and I had to make it to the end, just as she did. Horses work for us and they die for us. The least we can do is take note of their passing, hats off, eyes down in respect. Jane Schwartz is no Laura Hillenbrand, but she's good enough. Four stars for the skill in writing, for the way she constructed her story, and the will to write it, TEN stars for the greatest filly to ever set foot on a racetrack. Ruffian broke my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruffian review","review":"A moving, heartbreaking, wonderful book. If you love horses you must read it. You will cry and you will care.

Now that the Internet has enabled employees, suppliers, consumers, gadflies, critics and casual lookers to get and swap previously confidential information about companies, the business environment will never be its old self again. Companies have no confidentiality, no privacy and no way to dodge the truth. Those with nowhere to hide must to get accustomed to life in the open. It's not so bad. But to prosper in this wide-open world, managers need to understand that the new way of life has different demands than the old one. Although many of this book's recommendations have become fairly well known, we find plenty of insights that remain fresh and worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't order online","review":"I ordered a subscription for the Electric Flight magazine online and have yet to receive an issue.

It has less information than most of the magizine articles that are the basis of the author's knowledge base. It is unclear if the author has ever meet,interviewed or seen Mr. Waits preform. Huge omissions and years of information are not present. Some facts like the fact Tom had a relationship with Ricky Lee Jones or the first 3 albums for Island are a \\"Trilogy\\" are mentioned numerous times in a attempt to pad this books 150 double spaced pages. It looks and reads like a bad high school term paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the definitive Bio but it will do for now","review":"This is a small book in every sense of the word but amazingly is well researched and packs in a lot of fact and fiction (mostly generated by Tom himself!)about the bard of low-down losers of everytown skidrows.

In addition, it was nice to see that Jason was still having problems with what happened in Sherbrooke Twins. In so many books, characters get over something like that in a day - one day they are having nightmares and the next night because they have fallen in love they are fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just keeps getting worst","review":"After five long years, Jason Sherbrooke is returning to England. Deciding to by a horse farm, Jason comes up against Hallie Carrick who would also wants the farm. Deciding to become parnters. After a while, they learn to love each other.I wanted to like \\"Lyon's Gate\\" by Catherine Coulter but this book was bad. I don't know what's wrong with Ms. Coulter, but the charm is gone. Her earlier books were so much better, but lately it seems that she is writing book for the money and not for the readers. So save your 9.99 or just buy a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"This was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read... I say attempted because I could not finish it. This book was simply not worth my time. Hallie was immature, self-centered, shrewish and selfish and we are supposed to believe that Jason found this attractive? I cannot believe Catherine Coulter wrote this trype. The situation of the two of them living in the same house during this time period was ridiculous. And this book was an RT award nominee !! What were those people thinking !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agony!","review":"I generally do most of my reading when I travel. This took me several trips (and months) to complete. I have read some that just start slow but I didn't like Hallie from the first moment and was sorry that she would be the love interest. She was a total shrew and I don't understand how he was even physically attracted to her. She hated him then threw herself at him at the sight of bare chest?!I wish I had read these reviews before putting myself through this pain!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the library copy","review":"Being an avid Coulter reader, especially of the bride series, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I was disapointed to find that this book was not as good as the rest of the series. Coulter's usual edge of your seat plot lines are non existant and I found myself skipping through some parts just to find the real story. I love that she has created a historical soap opera with all her characters but in this case it cluttered the story. Lyon's Gate is a tale worth reading maybe buying if you collect the series but I won't be rereading this book anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP TELLING ME HOW HANDSOME JASON IS!!!!","review":"I have been a Coulter fan for years. I love that she has created a historical soap opera with all her characters.This one I had to force myself to finish I nearly stopped 1/3 of the way through but persisted.I really became sick of hearing how handsome Jason was not once or twice about 50 times and how women are always fainting or throwing themselves at Jason and his brother.If you wish to read a good CC book, check out her older stuff they are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed at best","review":"I really was disappointed with this book. Catherine Coulter's novels are usually very entertaining and easy to read. I have read almost every one. This one, though, was very hard to read and very easy to put down. There was too much dialogue and most of it wasn't very entertaining and scenes jumped from one to the other without thought. There wasn't any emotion involved in this book. I really wasn't happy with this one and am sorry I spent the ten dollars for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Much better than some of her others.

I always pick up her books the first day of release, and I must admit that I waited about a week to purchase Lyon's Gate because both twins were covered so well in the previous book, that I thought I had already read this twin's story. I thought that the story was well developed and humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulter of old is no more.","review":"Was this a romance novel or a book about horse farms and real estate? There was NO sexual tension between the h/h. Their first kiss happened toward the middle of the book. The sex was mediocre at best. There were no sparks, no fire, no romance.

After reading all of the reviews I decided not to buy this book. However, I found it for a $.01 and couldn't turn down the deal. In retrospect, I should have saved my penny and thrown it into the fountain at the nearest mall. I would have made a wish that Catherine Coulter could still write books the way she used to. Don't waste your money even if it's only a penny...."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. When I met Jason in The Sherbrooke Twins book I was really looking forward to reading his story but his character and that of Hallie are unbelievable weak. From the very beginning the story is weak and not the least bit believable for that time period or this! The way that the Sherbrookes respond to Hallie is also horrible and makes me not like the Sherbrookes anymore at all, they are all very shallow and selfish. I have no desire to even read The Wizard's Daughter when it is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyon's Gate","review":"I have to agree with the majority of the other reviews. This was awful. Hallie was a half-wit and dumb. For one thing, she couldn't figure out why Jason kept leaving the house. And there was our wonderful hero running down the road every time you turned a page to \\"visit\\" other women. I quit reading when it got to the wedding night. I couldn't enjoy a happy ending when I had no liking for the hero and heroine. I will still read books by Catherine Coulter but not in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is A Waste Of Time!! Save Your Money!","review":"I have read Catherine Coulter for years and have always been a fan, but this book was TERRIBLE!!! It starts off SO slow and the hero of the book Jason Sherbrooke doesn't even show any interest in the heroine of the book until page 178 and even then it is a barely worth mentioning. Their first kiss doesn't even happen until page 283, so you can see what I mean by a slow read! Hallie Carrick is so disappointing, she has none of the great qualities I desire in my heroine. She actually borders on the obnoxious. There isn't really anything good I can say about this book, it does improve slightly in the end, but it is definately too little to late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy me!","review":"Listen to all the other reviewers. It's THAT bad. I was at the airport facing a nice relaxing trip & saw the book & bought it despite the bad reviews on here, thinking: it can't be THAT horrible. It is. Oh, how beautiful is Jason.

The series is definitely funny, but there aren't a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. Most of the humor comes from the characterization, which develops over multiple episodes.Sadly, only 3 of the 8 episodes have commentaries, with the other special features being an outtakes reel and deleted scenes (no Making Of featurettes or anything).If you like The Kids in the Hall, you'll enjoy the characters they play in Death Comes To Town.

But of course this book is for experianced DM and Players alike, if you were to be starting out as a DM, then the older monster manual (1st) or the new book that has all 3 books combined, yet leaves out quite a bit of monsters, would also be very helpful to you.

I don't think she has the right kind of voice for these tunes. My personal belief is that Carly Simon's 20 year old album \\"Torch\\" is the only 40's remake album that is worth having.

The other FANTASTIC feature is that it truly does staple 25 (or more) sheets of paper. Other staplers \\"say\\" they staple 25 sheets, but jam up when you try to staple 15-20 sheets. I have had a stack of 27-30 papers and it has stapled just fine (all the way through!).I first used this type of stapler at a new job a few years ago, and it was love at first staple.

AF vocals did not get any better. The lyrics for the songs are the most simple unimaginative ones I've read. The music of the songs are soo commercial I bet AF would be bored to sing those songs himself. there are good tracks on this cd hence 2 stars. Francisco Cespedes song was a good one as well as the bachata pop one. If you notice closely he is not being himself but rather trying to imitate Christian Castro and Luis Miguel. If you never heard of those artists that's why you will like this cd. other than that NOTHIng new here nor worth shelling out $$ for. Unless you like AF as a physical person of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"A portrait of passion and sensuality, Latin style!!!!","review":"I remember being introduced to Alejandro which was about the same time I was introduced to Luis Miguel. \\"Me Estoy Enamorando\\" and I was impressed with his delievery of the title track and his collaboration with Gloria Estefan on \\"En El Jardin\\". But \\"Entre Tus Brazos\\" is another exciting vocal outing for Alejandro. His interpretation and performance of the compositons on this cd reminds me of Steve Perry of Journey. Steve Perry can sing and so can Alejandro. The lush musical arrangements and Alejandro voice compliment each other nicely. I love spanish guitar and it is prominent in all of the compositions. But the voice swoons and dips with ease and appears effortless. I grew up on soul/r&b and some rock (a la' Tina) but always loved latin music even before it became the in thing. Alejandro will be around for a while. If you do not have this cd you should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful romantic CD","review":"Entre Tus BrazosI have discovered how much I enjoy Latin music. Alejandro Fernandez has many musical styles. I was searching for mood music and found it here. Even if you don't understand Spanish, it doesn't matter, the music is great for that slow dance, tango or just plain \\"elevator\\" dancing. I actually listened to the CD as I was reading \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" by E L James. Adding the music while reading just put you in the book and still allowed you to pay attention to the music. What a great paring for entertainment. If you like Latin music or just want to try something new, this is the CD to buy.

The modem worked fine for around five weeks, at which time I stopped receiving phone calls on my home phone line. I traced the problem to my computer modem. It was blocking all phone calls when the computer was on or off. After calling Trendnet Support, there was no answer for this problem. I tried switching phone lines, and went through all the diagnostics.

It uses another time and place to write a rather overwrought story of religious intolerance that is somehow supposed to reflect on our times. Such a theme is universal.

Those have been covered more than sufficiently.The characters are well developed. The language is flowing and formal and authentic. The historical details enrich the story. I love books that have to do with old England, but not this one. It has nothing to do with the hardness of the times, the triumvirate's power hungry mindset or the manifestations of their determination to wipe out every last vestige of sin, no matter how small. I've read other books that deal with that theme.But somehow this one just didn't work for me. And it's not the ending becuase I've read plenty of books with depressing endings. Perhaps it had to do with the madness of Kate Shay, her determination - along with the others who were displaced - to elevate Brigge to some sort of prophet status, viewing him as St. Germanus. At any rate, it was a depressing ending to a depressing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy-handed","review":"The cover notes for this historical novel indicate that it is a sort of parable for our own time, and that is accurate. It is, however, somewhat self-consciously a parable, and therefore not a very good novel.

The Kilroy mini-movie that is shown at the start of the video and the acting scenes between Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw are just as bad as I remember them (no wonder Shaw left the band shortly thereafter - he did return in later years). However, the music is pretty good, although the presentation is a little lackluster. But I think that this video will bring back pleasant memories for Styx fans from their heyday of the late 70's and early 80's, especially if they saw the Kilroy tour. Overall, not a bad investment for the Styx fan, but if you had to choose, take the \\"Return to Paradise\\" video that is also for sale on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright, colorful and fun for children!","review":"After the lightning and thunder has stopped, that is the time the Rainbow Fairy babies come sliding down the arch, coating their delicate wings with the colors of the rainbow.

The construction quality was terrible compared to all other furniture I have purchased. A couple of the boards have been physically wet before and were water stained.

Then the more you use the dresser the more it begins to come lose at all the posts and the railings come unscrewed until the drawers are no longer functional. I emailed the part manufacturer and they advised me to tighten all the posts. After I did that it worked ok for about another week until they all started coming lose again.

Personally I could have done without \\"Dos Ninos\\" (the kids sound way too depressed) and \\"Los Fantasmas\\" (I just never liked that song) but thanks to CD technology you can either listen or zap past them.

I keep recomending this pack over and over and would give it 10 stars if it would be an option. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOJ6UM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Information","review":"This set of CD's is a recording of a multiday conference with Dr. Hawkins. The person is a genius and you have to be patient with his 'humor' and disdain toward the mundane. However, the information contained within is excellent!I do recommend reading his book Power vs. Force: The Hidden Determinants of Human Behavior before you listen to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy!","review":"After taking the time to listen to all of the CD's, I was extremely disappointed! This was billed to me as information on/or a way to use kinesthesis to know the truth about something. This was the reason that I bought this course. It turned out to be something that I had heard before from others who state that they are enlightened and actually do nothing! If enlightenment is noncaring, then what good is it? The only reason I gave any stars at all is that Nikko shares the practice of chanting the Lotus Sutra on the last CD and that is really excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Google This Guy Before You Buy","review":"I was looking for a meditation-oriented selection on spirituality, and I got David Hawkins instead. If you believe that all one needs to detrmine truth or falsehood is a tugging contest between acolytes (I'm not making this up-he's selling a sort of kinesiological lie detector) then this fellow is for you. Otherwise, research Dr. Hawkins a little before you waste money like I did. This material has about as much to do with quantum physics as Barnum & Bailey (unless, of course, you subscribe to P.T. Barnum's postulate that there is exactly one sucker born a minute)."},{"rating":"2","title":"spooky,groovy mishmash of Channel One flavor","review":"The penultimate background kind-music; i've barbecued this CD into a burnt-umber frisbee. Really it's Smykle's pandora-box of psycho-bass noodlings. Folks who profess to not like reggae don't know what to make of this. That's how's come I like playing this toward the end of my get-togethers... gives folks this odd cadence to keep them alert on the long ride home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dub Review","review":"I bought this C.D. as an accident, not knowing that it was dub. I was almost going to return it, but after listening to the songs a couple of times it turned me into a dub fan. I would suggest this album to any reggae lovers, even if you generally dont like dub."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best reggae albums ever!","review":"this is a great disc to just listen to and get carried away with the sounds of great reggae! It is an older album and I loved it in college (yes, in the 80s). It still holds up today! It was good to hear it again because I was afraid it was going to be unavailable due to its original production. I was very pleased to see it on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and Not worth the Money","review":"This book is not only confusing - I was lost before the end of the second chapter, it seems like the Dr. Neuharth may need to do just a little more real life research into the Real World. He tries to make simple the complex issues that surround so many of us. His over use of labels to attempt to be cute just does not work. I visited his website and even his photo posted there is over a decade old and does not look like the picture of the man on the back cover, what is the secret that he is keeping from himself? What is it about this \\"Dr.\\" that makes his second literary self-help attempt so desperate? Does the fact that he is the son of Al Neuharth make a difference in getting anything published? His use of quotes got old as I tried to plow my way through the confusion of each section of the book. I am more confused than ever - it was little help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy-to-Use Guide to Obtaining Optimum Self-Awareness","review":"This book was truly inspirational -- in a very simple and easy-to-read guide, I learned the key to defeating some behaviors I was not even aware of. Just stopping and looking before I took that last step is such a useful practice. It seems like some of the things I was most worried about were the easiest to solve once I applied Neuharth's 3-step process. I wish everything in life was so straightforward. This book was well worth th emoney -- I look forward to Neuharth's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what a great book","review":"This was one of the most helpful self help books I have read. It not only states the problems that we have, but also gives ways to overcome. I checked it out at the library, but had to have a copy of my own. I'll reread and underline this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"APA is back!!!!!!!!!","review":"The APA is the best tag team to ever dominate the WWE. They are so awesome.

Very good coverage of paleolithic environment and the impact on prehistoric peoples. However, there is virtually no mention of women throughout the entire book. There is almost a complete lack of description of female burials and burial objects, and lack of any attempt to document the role of women in prehistoric times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be rated PG!!!","review":"Beware: In the last movie clip 'Horton hatches the Egg' a fish puts a pistol to his head and shoots himself.

It is very confusing to identify the 3d animated movie, with so many titles given the same name. I had to return twice as I couldn't get the right one. Better contact customer care and confirm the content before ordering it. Thus you can avoid all those returning headaches.I am still surprised to see these titles floating in Amazon ever after having so many complaints that the title and description do not depict the content accurately and most of the time misleading.Buying blue ray version for these still pictures makes you even more disappointed. And also gives negative impressions on Amazon. Just so you know, returning is easy. Anyway beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the book is great but DON'T BUT the DVD","review":"The cartoon Horton Hears a Who is fine, but also on the DVD is Horton Hatches an Egg. The Book of Horton Hatches an Egg is also a nice story that teaches your kids to keep their word and do what they say. But in the Carton on this DVD there is a scene that's not in the book. When Horton is on the ship, a fish comes out of the water and says \\"Now I've seen everything\\" then pulls out a gun and puts it to his head and fires the gun and the fish falls back in the water. I don't know about you but I couldn't believe this was in a Dr Seuss story. I went to the Walmart where I bought the DVD and told them and they pulled the DVD off the shelve right then. I will not buy anymore Dr. Seuss DVD, I will only read the books. I only gave this DVD one Star because I had too."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is crap","review":"Looking for the 1970's Chuck Jones \\"Horton Hears A Who\\" film.

I've been a piper more than 30 years and have yet to see anything from that part of the world which was not fit only for display over the fireplace -- or kindling in it. A good chanter reed these days will cost about $10 US; there's no 2 ways around it, and there are any number of reputable piping sources online, all across the US as well as Scotland and Canada. A decent set of pipes will cost in the $1000 range, so if you see a set going for 2 or 3 hundred somewhere -- don't even bother. Even a decent used set is worth in the $600 range --at least. Same with chanters alone -- a good plastic chanter will run about $150, blackwood about $100 more than that. So again, if you are seeing pipe chanters selling for $50 -- yes, it is too good to be true. You will be buying junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Cheap Cheap!","review":"The whole collection of Rose Petal Cottage are so cute! And overall well made besides these products. These are cheaply made! Plus the changing table does nothing. To me, Hasbro should make a draw to hold diapers and clothes for the Baby Alive wet and giggles and other Baby Alives. Then it would tie in and market better. Over all I would purchase all the other items that go with the rose petal cottage but would save my money on this item and purchase a different crib set. The crib is very cheaply made and does not come with a blanket or a mat at the bottom so you can see the cheap plastic at the bottom. Both me and a friend are reselling ours. Don't waiste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable furniture","review":"My 4 and 1/2 year old daughter really wanted this for Christmas. I thought that she was a little old for it and I was right. The furniture and the cottage is for a smaller child (age 2-3).

I would recommend this product to younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Toy","review":"I bought the toy for my 1.5 year old daughter as a Christmas gift. My 3.5 year old son loves it too. We normally put the two pieces closed to make a square house. My son will cook something inside and hand out 'Hot dogs\\", \\"cupcakes\\" via the top half of the door for us to buy. The house doesn't look big, but if four of us sit closely, we can all fit in the house.

They are adorable, functional, colorful, sturdy and fun. My 3-year-old granddaughter loves them. I wish the dressing table was a little taller, but other than that they're perfect. This is the first product from the Rose Petal Cottage accessory line that I've purchased.

Initially I purchased this product due to the price being cheaper than it's main competitor spry. What a mistake that was. Actually this product is no cheaper after you spend 4.99 on shipping and also count in the additional time you have to wait for the product (4 -5 days) to be delivered. The product tastes great initially but after about 5 minutes of chewing it tastes like crap. It leaves a very nasty after taste in your mouth. I'm forcing myself to chew it so I don't feel like I've wasted my money but it's not worth it. The Spry gum tastes soooooo much better and it lasts. Also I've tasted the variety of Spry flavors and they are all good. So my final recommendation is to save your money on this product if taste matters. If it doesn't matter and cleaning you teeth is the key issue then go right ahead and torture yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This gum is not worth the money. There are far better Xylitol products out there for sale. This gum's taste lasts less than one minute before it is spent and tastes like an old shoe. Additionally, about the time that the flavor goes bad the gum turns to mush and does not even resemble gum at all.Most Xylitol gums that I have tried to not last that long but this one by far is the quickest to go south.I have had much better luck with others, you probably will as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sprouting seeds","review":"I had to throw these sprouting seeds away, they are so full of sharp and bitter tastes, they ruined my green smoothies.

It discusses the accomplishments of Caroline Kennedy, Maria Shriver, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, and Kerry Kennedy Cuomo. There are great video footages from when they were younger, playing at Hyannis Port and at Hickory Hill. I especially like the interviews with Kerry Kennedy and how she is helping to uphold her father's (RFK's) visions for a better world through her work in international human rights. Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in the Kennedy family, especially since there is not much out there about the 3rd generation Kennedy women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like an actual dance lesson","review":"This DVD is a little bit different from most of the bellydance DVD's I've seen or own. There's no music in the background which seems a little odd, but you can hear Princess Farhana easily. The focus of this DVD is really on the flutters and rolls but she covers other things, too. This is a true intermediate level workout, but she breaks it down so well and makes it seem so easy. This is honestly like a Bellydance lesson more than a workout, and I think that beginners might be able to follow it. I don't know if I think she's the best bellydancer I've ever seen, (although she is really great), but she might be the best bellydance instructor I've come across. I'll definitely purchase more of her DVD's because of her style of teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This DVD had great reviews especially for doing belly rolls so I bought it hoping to be inspired.Its the worst Bellydance DVD I have bought - Whilst Princess Farhana seems really lovely person and passionate about her dance and has a lovely manner - the quality of DVD is cheap, and the section on belly work very short and not that comprehensive at all.The rest of the DVD is also not that meaty and really a bit cheesy altogether.My preference in style for meaty learning would be Autumn Ward, Jenna, or Leila of Egypt.

I think mainly because it is the story of Tom Brown Jr. as told to William Jon Watkins. I think Watkins tries to make it sound a little too poetic and loses a lot in his \\"translations\\" of Tom's stories. If you just want a good book about Tom Brown Jr., and not a field guide or a poor interpretation of his life, I would strongly recommend \\"Case Files the Tracker.\\" it tells some of the same stories and many different, but i find it remarkably more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"written by one who knows (Tom, not me)","review":"This diminutive softback is not short on instruction and interest.

Leave debate about Tom out.","review":"There are many people who think Tom Brown is a fraud. There are many people who worship him as almost a god. If you have preconceived notions about Tom Brown, then you may not want to pick up this book. As other reviews have stated, this book tells the childhood story of Tom Brown who learned tracking and love and respect for nature from a Native American named Stalking Wolf. You can pick up some techniques from this book. But, I think the book is largely a vivid, dramatically told story in which we follow Tom Brown through his journey. I don't care how much of it may or may not be made up. The book is well written. It's an easy read. It does a good job of placing you in these wonderful situations in nature. It is very inspiring in terms of wanting to protect the sanctitiy of nature and in terms of relaying the discipline needed to learn all you can about any subject be it nature or otherwise. I recommend the book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Tracker\\" book","review":"I am happy supprised how good the book is. Very interesting.

It really shows how a boy can be inspired by the adults around him and ultimately change his whole outlook on life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book....","review":"This is a good book will provide more inspiration than instruction. You will have a new perspective next time you go into the woods, but you won't be a tracker. It's pretty amazing that a guy who apparently spent his life in the woods, mostly alone, can crank out a well-written book. Then again, maybe it shouldn't be too shocking. It would be pretty easy to dismiss some of the stories in this book as too extreme to be true, but just because the guy doesn't have a PhD doesn't mean he's not incredibly smart and talented.Edit: I edited this review to dock it from 4 to 2 stars and add that you may want to do your own research on the author. I'm not going to change the review above, but I now have serious doubts about the truth of any of this. Stories circulating about this fellow make him and his followers sound like a cult."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"This is a book that is honest and inspiring.

I'd finally gotten around to the book this week, but was disappointed as my sense of disbelief grew, page by page. When viewed through the lens of an adult wiith a reasonable amount backcountry experience, I think most readers would recognize the stories as exagerated or downright unprobable. In addition, the writing style/voice is self indulgent.Will be using the book as firestarter this week. Not sure it's worth much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved this book","review":"Tom Brown opens your eyes to the magic, mystery, and hidden knowledge - all just in the woods. Whether fact or fiction - doesn't matter to me, i believe that we walk thru life with blinders on most the time - and forget how lost we are becoming. Like \\"Walden's Pond\\" we need to simplify and go back to listening to, learning from, and respecting the earth and it's creatures.Along the same lines of a Blackfoot proverb that I love: \\"All animals know more than you do\\"; this book tells of \\"Brown's childhood in the Pine Barrens [woods] of southern New Jersey and the survival skills he learned from an old Apache scout who was wise in the ways of the woods\\" and it's inhabitants.Worthwhile and enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book to Awaken Your Soul","review":"Everyone should read this book. Don't just think about getting it, just order it now and read it a couple of times, then get The Search and read it, and then order the others. If you read them with an open mind and listen to your heart, you will be a better person. The Tracker should be required reading in school as it teaches so much about how life should be lived. It will change your life. It has changed mine.Society is doing everything wrong. We need to look more toward the spiritual side of life instead of the physical. Society is killing us with stress, routine, the need to climb the economic ladder to feel successful, and pollution. I'm too old with too many societal burdens to do what I would like to do but I will try to do whatever I can to get as close as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous & Boring","review":"I had to put this book down after 75 pages or so. I was intrigued by the subject matter, and very curious to read it. However, the story includes too much play-by-play accounts of events that happened, without a sense for where the story was going, and without the reflective nuggets one would expect in an autobiographical story. Maybe that comes later in the book, but I didn't have the patience to get through the monotony to get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nature lover","review":"A must read for anyone that believes in the sacredness of nature and life.

For example, his business is ruined by an ungrateful stepson,a first wife leaves him with a newborn baby, another stepson commits date rape and he doesn't even raise his voice.

First of all, when I installed it, it reset my graphics options. Second, when I attempt to play a game, even at the settings that it chose, I get nothing but a white screen. After numerous tries, and killing the program with the task manager, I finally attempted the other Activities options. Clicking on them does absolutely nothing! It doesn't recognize my mouse clicks.I'm assuming that the game was written for the Apple Mac, and ported to the PC.

I had hoped this subliminal CD would be as good, and then my plan was to buy a Stop Smoking CD for a male relative in his mid twenties so he could have a chance at a reasonable life-span.But I know if it is like the positive thinking subliminal,he couldn't tolerate it.

Fact is, it's got elements of trance (what the kids today are calling techno with few words, repeating melodies, and a constant soft beat). So if you're looking for straight-up rock 'n' roll, this isn't it. What it is is what says: meditative music (not Tibetan, but Christian). Sure, most of the songs do have lyrics, but the instrumental cuts are truly inspired. Get this disc or the mega-three set for revelatory spiritual communion--I'd sell my tickets, but I want to keep this disc. Oh yeah, \\"Carry You\\" is awesome, with just the right blend of vocals and instruments for such a prayerful piece. God Bless SNTR!P.S.

I got Super Mario World 3, thinking that it would be another good Mario game. It's not! Super Mario Advance 2 is a classical, fun, and well-made game. This almost isn't a Mario game.

I mean, COME ON! Also, you cannot \\"spin jump.\\" With a spin jump, you can kill virtually any enemy in one hit. It's just not the same! Bottom line: avoid this game at all costs.

It reminds me of the NES game. The first level is easy and the second, but the third is so hard. But in Mario as you all know, if you're the tiny Mario if you get hit once, boom, you are dead, have to start the level over again. Here's the lowdown:Graphics: 5/5 They have really improved the graphics of the old version alot. They aren't those blocky NES graphics, they are fine and colorful. That's what I like about the Mario Franchise.Sound: 5/5 The sound is fantastic in this game. You get to hear the classic theme and all Mario's phrases like \\"Oh, Mama Mea\\"Controls: 5/5 The controls are pretty simple. A is to jump and thats about it and the D-pad. Also you use R to speed up.Fun: 4/5 I always like the Mario franchise, but the game is literally too hard. One hit your are dead pretty much if you're not the racoon or Super Mario. But that's what Mario is I can't complain too much about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomee game!!","review":"If you are a big mario fan...i would highly recommend this game.

If you don't have an e-Reader and a Game Boy Player for Gamecube or a buddy with another GBA, this game definitely makes it worth your while to seek those things out. Some of the new levels are really hard and many include items, enemies, and obstacles not seen in the main game of Mario Bros. 3. Plus, you can scan in items not seen in the main game - imagine soaring through the Pipe Maze (World 7) with the cape from Super Mario World!As Nintendo keeps releasing e-Reader expansion packs, the play value you get out of this game will continue to grow!

I ordered a 36/32, knowing full well that I wear a 38/32 in most pants, but I wanted these to last after I get back to my usual weight which fits a 34-36 nicely. The elastic waist band is nice, it easily stretches to size larger and shrinks to a bit under a size smaller. The legs are a nice loose fit. I have large thighs and where a lot of pants simply don't work, these give me the room I need.

The pockets are really handy and you can carry everything you need, be it for a job or even to go out for an evening. Wallet, multiple phones, knife, all get swallowed up comfortable be these pants.The downsides are they are \\"bulky\\" on my frame, being a shortie, and they certainly look like tactical pants, but honestly I don't notice it, but my wife doesn't really like the look.

Apple Broccoli Bananas Carrots...etc. i don't want my child to only be into fruits..so I switch back and forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"User Friendly","review":"This book delivers a wide array of food recipes--from simple purees to much more complex dishes. After cooking one, my husband and I often wished we had made enough for ourselves. More importantly, my baby loved the recipes. The book is divided by the baby's age, which is helpful. I especially like that the book is not alarmist in nature-- it doesn't make you into a nervous mess about introducing every food to your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good.","review":"A few things need adjusting so it isn't too runny, but overall there are some great recipies and good basics. We are just beginning to make month 8 foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS RECIPES","review":"Though this book has some interesting recipes, the author clearly knows very little about infant nutrition. Many of the recipes called for citrus and honey along with a few other foods that are NOT to be given to children under the age of 1 under any circumstances. If you plan on purchasing this book make sure you know all of the rules to making homemade baby food inside and out so that you can omit the recipes that are unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I was excited about this book after reading the reviews, but the excitement ended there. While the layout is nice and accessible and many of the recipes look quite tasty, the nutritional information is off. Many of the recipes include ingredients inappropriate for the age group listed in the book. For example, strawberries, citrus, and cow's milk products are included in recipes for babies under a year, and all of these should be avoided until a baby is older. I don't want to have to weed through and re-think every recipe in the book, especially at this price, so I returned it. I recommendNaturally Healthy First Foods for Baby: The Best Nutrition for the First Year and Beyondinstead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best baby food book","review":"I love this book!!! I bought \\"First Meals\\" and got about 4 other books on baby food from a local library. This is the best book. The ingredient lists are very short and you can get everything easily at your local grocery stores. My freezer is now full of baby food just because I just cannot stop trying all the recipes. I tasted some and they are delicious. It also has a sample menu (BF, Lunch, Dinner, snakcs) for 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 months. It helps me figure out how much I should serve. Buy this book and this is all you need to make baby food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful. I have been using it often, making a variety of foods straight from our friends and families gardens! It's great to know exactly what is going in my childs food.

NOT worth the $$"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I went through several baby food books before finding (and loving) this one. Other books are huge with tons of info about how to feed, when to feed, nutritional analysis, etc.etc. I just wanted a book with a bunch of homemade baby food recipes categorized by age - and that's exactly what this is! It's easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to make their own baby food. Also - next to some of the recipes it gives you tips on how to make the recipe \\"older child\\" friendly.Only reason I didn't give it a \\"perfect\\" score is because I wish it had even more recipes in it - not that it doesn't have enough - I just really love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor work","review":"I bought this video when it first came out for $30, and took it home with high expectations. After all, it was produced in the \\"Golden Era\\" of animation, and was based on the best comic strip ever done. Boy was I disappointed! The animation is flat and lifeless. The characters do nothing but pale, cliched imitations of themselves, and there is NO satire. I taped an episode of The Munsters over it. If you like Lil Abner, get one of the book collections of reprints of the strip. I still think Lil Abner would make a great animated film, if done with the savage wit and gorgeous art featured in the Al Capp original, but even a little kid would be bored by this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution","review":"My own stupidity but I read the lsiitng as a 4-1/2 pint capacity funnel and not the 4\\" 1/2 pint capacity.

The self proclaimed \\"longest posse cut in history,\\" \\"The Session\\" seems to never end. It's well over ten minutes long, but it's not un-bearable. In fact, it's actually an alright track. \\"Essaywhaman,\\" performed live at the Soulshack, is early evidence of their brilliance in live performances. But the best track on this album has to be \\"Leonard I-V.\\" Similar to \\"Swept Away\\" and \\"Distortion To Static\\" (off DYWM), this track uses human voice as part of the beat. Very nice outcome.Overall, although the production on \\"Organix\\" is not as advanced or thorough as the Roots newer albums, it still delivers in what's important---providing the listener with some Good Music to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun puzzle for family nights","review":"We got this puzzle for Grandma for Mother's Day and she loves it.

Those special weapons that you acquire get wasted quick and are not effective when they are the boss' weakness. I love the armors that X has throughout the series, but I have to say, the armor in this game looks like the one from the first one with minor changes for looks and the abilities suck. Zero and Axl can go through the levels, but going through the bosses are going to make you pull your hair out if you have any. Then the voice acting is horrible that you wish you didn't play the game. Overall, if you're a fan, it's going to make you go WTF.

I have not seen the Mega Man games change very much over the years.Yes, there have been things added, but it really all boils down to \\"figure out what weapon works best against which boss and defeat him/her/it\\", and that, my friends, is not fun.

They are air ride(normal racing),top ride(the camera is above and you are looking down with a bird's eye view),and city trial(go around for a few minutes collecting power ups. Then have a random race or battle after the timer expires). One of them, city trial, has you running around around a virtual city collecting powerups that are pointless for a few minutes.

The one button controls make it very simple to learn how to play and the great amount of unlockable stars(racing carts)make the game play more intense.

In air ride mode up to four players, or a lone racer battling the CPUs, can engage in fast and furious racing action! Players can choose from courses like Checker Knights,Celestial Valley,Lava Flows,Machine Passage and many others. In the battle mode players fight using special items that are spread across the extra small course to help them win 1st place. City Trial mode is a large town area where players can ride fast rails, high ferriswheels,and volcanoes where they fight each other or team up to find the parts of the dragoon and hydra.

Finally after about a foot, I started to look at other patterns and realized that probably I should have cast on 100 less. I am really disappointed that the numbers were not correct and I wonder how many other errors there are in this book! (Lilacs in Bloom on 116 is fine and Royal Luxury on 62 is fine).

In Mokyr's commentary, there is what seems to me an unnecessarily condescending view towards other writers on the subject, ie. in almost every paragraph he argues with the case of another writer, and often with a marked lack of respect (I apologize for doing the same, here). In my opinion, this form of analysis grates on the nerves, and shows a great lack of originality as well.Lastly, the force of a falling object is not variable (page 49).

This civilization developed great intellect, but no technological innovators. Their technology relied on harnessing the energy of their slaves period. They had no incentive to innovate, that would have caused an idle and restless underclass prone to civil unrest.I am sure there must be another much more interesting book about the same subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ill-founded Deductions","review":"To be useful a book on the creativity of societies and peoples which makes deductions based on what was invented, where and when, has to get the underlying facts approximately right.

In the field of invention it is always to check the facts carefully as false claims are very often made.

This game is a good game for almost anyone (if it's your type of game). The graphics on it are outstanding. It gives you chills just playing it. I would say buy it if you love snowboarding. The controls a pretty easy but some of the tricks can be tricky.

The anti-VBAC tone makes me wonder whether the statistics and information presented are accurate. I wouldn't recommend this book to a mother who wants a VBAC.

If you're serious about VBAC--and there's no reason why you shouldn't be--please don't read this book.

The other major book I have read contends that only a foolish, fearful woman will resist VBAC...to me, this book deals much more thoroughly with the trade offs of both approaches.

Ever Passing Moment showed that MxPx was headed towards a more melodic, mature sound.....well guess what, this cd is not melodic and it does not have a mature sound. The thing that I hate about this cd the most is not that it is poppy, but the fact that it's not even catchy?? I mean if you're going to write pop-punk you should at least make it catchy."},{"rating":"1","title":"what...happenend?","review":"i thought i would never give mxpx a bad rating, and i never thought they could ever come out with a bad cd. i gave them a one because i know they can do much better. sorry guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This was an awesome cd!

This CD is definitely the band's most radio-friendly album yet. They have changed their sound somewhat from their first few releases, but I enjoy all their music and it was not a change for the worse. The Halo Friendlies, Benji Madden of Good Charlotte, Jordan Pundik of New Found Glory, and Kris Roe of the Ataris make guest appearances. There's not a weak spot on this album. Every track is certain to leave you singing the tunes in your head for the rest of the day.

This is a must-buy for any punk band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Attempt at the Big Time","review":"I believe that for their entire body of work Mxpx are the best punk rock band ever. They have made three of the best punk albums I've ever heard with Life In General, Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo, and The Ever Passing Moment. This one I hate to say, seemed like they were just trying to hit the radio and MTV by abandoning their style with a very watered down version of themselves. I heard someone say \\"it sounds like Mxpx operating at 40% of their potential just to reach a mainstream audience.\\" I believe that to be the simple honest truth. They wanted to sell out and hit big money with this one so they ended up making a record that sounded pretty fake and generic. It doesnt have the honest, raw emotion or edge of their earlier work. I wish they hadnt done it because even after Panic and Secret Weapon they still havent come back to what they used to be, I think this record was a mistake and they still haven't recovered from making it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true punk cd!","review":"Mxpx's \\"Before Everything and After\\" is a great cd!

They are very very polished sounding.Overall I would say don't buy this cd if you are a new fan to them, Get slowly going the way of the buffalo or life in general, If you are an mxpx fan.. Atleast you have some respect for them already.. so if you want it buy it, i don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"holy freakin crap","review":"this is an amazing album. *applauds* i own all of mxpx's albums (which is like 12, by the way!) and i can't stop listening to this one. i put it right up there with \\"slowly going..\\" which is one of my favorites. its music is diverse, but still sticks to mxpx's style. kudos to the boys for writing another love song (everything sucks) which is lovely just like \\"do your feet hurt\\". \\"brokenhearted\\" also cracks me up because it's so true. and i love the bass line to \\"kings of hollywood. so fun. keep up the work, guys! as always, i'm here for the ride..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"BEFORE EVERYTHING else these guys rocked, now AFTER all these years they've gone soft.

MxPx doesn't try to take anyones licks. If you don't like this CD than you got problems. Just kidding. The Drumming is some of the most inovative I have ever heard. Most of the tracks have a kicking bass line, and the guitars are so good. They mix a little country in \\"Everything Sucks\\", and a little I funk into \\"Kings of Hollywood\\". It all sounds like it should be there, and that is what is amazing. Adding a little Aucoustic in the CD is so cool. MxPx doesn't sound like the aucoustic type, but they pull it off to perfection. It relates to us guys, and you can picture your girl in most of these songs. MxPx goes a little deeper in \\"Me for Me\\" and shows their spirtual side. This CD has some extras wich are cool. You can watch some \\"making of\\" videos and extra tour stuff.

It has such poppy vocals and to make up for it they play boring, repetitive riffs. On the inside there is a picture of the band and they all look the same and their lip is pierced in the same place. When was conforming considered punk rock? They sound like every other band who claims to be punk now adays like Good Charlotte, Simple Plan ect, and their lyrics are sappy and predictable.

It's designed to be safe, and for the MTV generation, it succeeds amicably. for those who love music, it fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this now you fools","review":"the best cd of all time.

I have been a fan since the 1st MXPX album. I have every CD the band has ever released. Most of the songs on this CD remind me of Good Charlotte (that is bad). The lyrics and music are very repetitive and not nearly as creative as the older CD's. Who knows, maybe this new poppy repetitive stuff will put them on MTV with all the other lame pop punk bands. Makes me sad to see such a cool band put out such a bad CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whole Lot Better Than Teenage Politics and Buffalo","review":"This is one of MXPX's better albums. I have to say that Let it Happen is their best and then Ever Passing Moment. I really think this is better than Buffalo, which has some great song but then a lot of sub par songs--such as Kid Quit It, which is the worst MXPX song. The best songs are Well Adjusted, Broken Hearted--my personal favorite--, Everything Sucks, Quit Your Life, and Don't Walk Away. Stay away from Kings Of Hollywood, which has a horrible guitar riff. It's Alright has a fitting title, and The First Day of The Rest of Our Lives song too much like one Untitiled by Finch, one of the best bands out there. Basically, all the stuff about MXPX selling out is stupid. Mike finally learned how to sing--don't get me wrong, I liked them even when he couldn't sing very well--and they've changed styles again. They change styles somewhat on every album, and that's a sign of a talented band. Go Buy this CD, it's one of their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"From the Punk to the Junk\\"","review":"This band used to write really solid punk tunes with a lot of original style, but this album goes far beyond generic. It sounds like they hired writers to come in and write \\"radio friendly\\" hits for them. Every song sounds like it was edited to perfection in Protools which just doesn't work for this band. I wasn't really happy with The Everpassing Moment, but it still has songs that I like. This album on the other hand is some of the worst music I've ever heard. My advice to MxPx is to stop trying so hard to be a huge arena rock band, get rid of there stacks of effects processors, get rid of their rows and rows of guitars and play some freaking punk music. Get a guitar and a half stack and play music. This album is perfect example of a band that is trying so hard to write music that will be popular they have gone full circle and not realized that they just finished a session of horribly stale music. Save your money and buy the next Arthur album."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst MXPX Albums","review":"As an avid MXPX fan (I've been there from Pokinatcha and have every album since), I could not like this album, no matter how hard I tried. It's manufactured power-pop, no edge, nothing original, and not even close to anything near MXPX's true potential. It's clear that Mike & gang were really struggling lyric-wise, because the songs are the same rehashed lyrics. While they have very few catchy melodies and guitar progressions, this album is worth passing by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk? Not really.","review":"Ok, first off, this is possibly the worst album that MxPx has ever recorded. Punk is not puck anymore. New Found Glory, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, and other bands, who claim to be punk, turn out to be very middle of the road, pop-ish sounding. I really liked MxPx on their earlier stuff. It was more raw. It was less commercialized. It was the closest thing to punk that MxPx ever got. I feel like I wasted the money I spent for the CD. I don't want anyone to think that I'm \\"dissing\\" MxPx. I love 'em. I wish they would have spent more time and made something with more quality. Not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"MxPx's new album \\"Before Everything and After\\" really kicks.

The same goes for a band like No Use For A Name, their first few albums were a lot more 'underground' than their newer stuff, but I tolerate them because of where they have come from, but I have no respect for a band like Simple Plan or say Good Charlotte, who were 'sold-out' from the start. Support Mxpx, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"No words to describe how great!!","review":"Every song on this album kicks! I can listen from the first track to the very last without skipping.

I reccomend you buy this cd for yourself and your friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slick, New, and Unique Sound.","review":"Some people pass it off as a replica of Good Charlotte, Blink 182, Sum 41, Simple Plan; this is on the contrary. This album has it's own style, range and uniqueness. The melodies are original, and you don't have your standard I, IV, V pattern while palm muting the first variation. MxPx told us the fans to expect something different and that they experimented big time. Well they were sure right, it's different than anything they've ever made. It has the power of Life In General, the quality of Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo, the energy of The Everpassing Moment, and to touch it off the originality the has kept MxPx runnning for so long!

I saw a trailer of it and the game acts just like it's GAMECUBE counterpart, with the exception of the RPG Mode, and an even greater game play. Instead of controling one character, you control 2! That's right, in this game, just like Mario Tennis for GBC, you control 2 characters, but only in the overworld, \\"in-game\\" or while golfing, you only control your own character. You can hook it up to your GAMECUBE using the \\"GBA/GC Link Cable\\". You can transfer your \\"Custom Couple\\" to the game, but no word on if the characters \\"stay saved\\" or get removed and have to constantly replace the characters in the game EVERY time you turn on the game.

The install was easy and I have had no issues with it over the years. It uses a lot less water than the previous faucet I had and yet it has better pressure. I know this because I fill up a humidifier every night before bed and this one takes much longer... I wouldnt have guessed that it was a water-miser since it works very well.My only complaint is that, for whatever reason, the hot water handle has a bit of rust coming out from underneath it. Not sure what this is from since the handle has no cosmetic issues at all. Wipe the rust off the sink and its fine. perhaps there is an internal leak that is slowly rusting the interior, not sure but it has not been an issue functionally. I also make a huge mess when I wash my hands or brush my teeth (per my wife :) and water likely sits on the handle on a regular basis.Great faucet and I am ordering another one today..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"I have owned this album for 20 years.

I ordered it but then had second thoughts and cancelled it because of the cost - the MP3 version is much cheaper.Here's my question: is this import version expanded or does it only contain the 11 songs listed under the Amazon description? Amazon can be confusing because they often neglect to list additional material when they combine all previous versions of a release under the product description. If it's expanded then I'm more willing to purchase the CD... if not, I'll probably just buy the cheaper MP3 download.May seem silly to some folks, but I still prefer physical copies of my music over digital downloads. In this case, however, the price differential has tempted me to ignore that bias.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essencial rock n'roll","review":"magnificent piece of rock n'roll from 81, a year full of new wave synth crap (not all but, yeah you get the point).

To make sure I didn't get caught in a rainstorm and find out it didn't work, I sprayed it with the hose! The water beaded up and rolled off without any penetration anywhere. I was very liberal with the application and really concentrated on the seams, bottom, and the side that will be out when wearing it.

Why would a camper stand there and apologizing repeatedly to his friend who was just stabbed with a tree limb? I do understand in a horror movie some suspended disbelief is a given...but at the same time a little bit of common since is nice. Also, the acting is horrible. The actors seemed to either be bored or overact. The sound effects were cheesey and got annoying after awhile. How many \\"boooing\\" sounds can one person bear to hear when a killing is about to occur? There is some gore but I wouldn't call it gory compared to today's movies.

Between the ungodly filming, acting, and the lamest blood and gore effects you may ever see, Don't Go Into the Woods...Alone ! isn't just bad, it's a crime against celluloid. Not to mention that this also features possibly the worst soundtrack \\"score\\" (and I use that term lightly) in film history. Now I know that films like these aren't made to win any awards, and I like horror films that are so bad they're hysterical as much as the next guy, but laying down any amount of cash to see this movie is as bad as a rip-off can get.

Here, the premise is slightly different in that the \\"deranged killer\\" is actually a deranged \\"wildman\\", no less. Aside from that, not much is different. Though what brings the film down, as a whole, would have to be the almost nonexistent acting, paper-thin storyline (which is pretty bad considering most films of the sort have similar storylines), and the horrendous soundtrack, which sounds as if it were composed in a laundromat, atop a washing or drying machine.

A group of four pre-packaged victims head in to the woods on a camping trip, only to be killed off by a crazed mountain man in a timely fashion. The highly-untrained acting and directing are apparent in every moment of the film, and the story structure is almost non-existent. Only the weakest Slasher movie stereotypes and conventions shine through here, but for everything it lacks in quality, it more than makes up for in bloody killings. Severed limbs, missing heads, and gallons of blood are strewn across the screen, making it far more violent than many of the mid- to late-80's Slashers.

Eventually you find out that she is the grandaughter of the ruer of Caelin.I won't spoil anything else.The only thing that is bad is that you can't explore or anything because the only thing you do is lead wars.The whole game is conected to the story amd you can only do things that are happening in the story.

So I wasn't expecting too much. But it appears I overestimated the quality of Ms. Bleasdale's writing. Creating a believable character does not mean relaying every thought in her head (and then repeating them again and again and again throughout the book). Rather than telling us \\"She thought this, she thought that\\" this book would have benefited more by letting the characters interact in a believable fashion and letting us learn to know them that way. Throwing the entire backstory at us in the first 20 pages was a big mistake - those pages should have been taken out in editing the first draft. We, the readers, like to work some stuff out for ourselves. Show rather than tell.Additionally 3 out of 4 sentences started with \\"She did, She looked, She was, She could.\\" That's dull and annoying. Finally sentences can be longer than four words.

But now the brave Jordanian journalist, Rana Husseini, who actually did risk her life to bring this issue to the fore in Jordan has come out definitively against the book's veracity. Does Amazon have a responsibility to make note of this? I think the booksellers at least should caution on the book description that it is now widely considered to be a fake.

Her prose style may be somewhat turgid, but her contribution is presented more as a journalistic account of honour killing in the Levant rather than as a work of great literature.I find most of the reviews more telling than Norma Khouri's book. Rather than addressing the evidence that she puts to the reader of a widely prevalent scourge in the region and discuss its veracity, these reviewers instead attack the author's sincerity and integrity.As someone who was brought up in the Middle East, I know that Norma provides a fair reflection of the darker side of traditional Arab society, albeit that she gives it heightened poignancy.

Amsterdam, Chills, Young Folks and Paris 2004 among them."},{"rating":"2","title":"deserves a listen","review":"this is what this album sounds like: swedish boys who like john lennon, but have studied the smiths and play like the walkmen. if you like the walkmen and the concretes (the concretes' lead singer cameos on this record), you will really like this one. also, the songs all sound different, so you can actually listen to the entire cd without skipping around. i like \\"amsterdam\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Indie music","review":"Peter, Bjorn and John cover no new ground with this album. That is not to say that it is not a bad CD, but the fact is there have been artists in the same territory before, and without a doubt many will follow in the footsteps of Peter, Bjorn and John.It is a fun record to listen to on the edge of pop and indie, which makes it very accessible for the greatest amount of consumers. The track \\"Young Folks\\" is the best song, and was also released as a single. It is a fun song and it is a nice song to relax to, but the rest of the album is rather lacking in depth and execution.Overall, I would say download the track \\"Young Folks\\" and skip the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay Leno","review":"These two, whom I've never heard before last night, kind of took me back for a moment. I thought I was listening to a new revived Figurine album which is greatly anticipated from that dynamic trio.I liked the sound, and although faintly mumbled by the poorest sound engineer in Cali. I was able to get a feel for what this Swedish pop group can do. I suggest, if I may, making it yourself.If you feel the music, live by it, you know they will come to hear it. This group tends to remind me of the smae hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"This music is the lowest common denominator of the indie-pop scene just like Nickelback is the lowest common denominator of the modern rock scene. Stupid keyboard effects, boyish processed vocals that barely qualify as singing, limp-wristed monotonous guitar strumming like Coldplay, drum parts limited to 2 or 3 second loops, minor key quasi-melodies. If you're generally ambivalent to creative use of rhythm, harmony and melody and only hear the bohemian chic in the timbres this album will be a valueable fashion statement to add to your wardrobe. Recent stylistically similar albums with more musical substance incluce Postastatic's Be Still Please and Math And Physics Club's Self-titled."},{"rating":"1","title":"I seriously don't get it...","review":"I don't understand the praise this album is getting.

People tell me that they get a nostalgic feeling while listening to this, but I don't see it.

I managed to hear a little bit of the narration taken from the Bunnell book, and there didn't seem to be any indication that \\"Dr.\\" Bunnell's book, written decades after the fact during a boom in Yosemite's reputation, is considered to be somewhat bogus--but it's dramatic, so what the hey? For the unvarnished history of the valley (such as the fact that it was a mosquito-invested wall-to-wall swamp when it was discovered), I'd recommended picking up a few of the available books; for scenery, there's got to be something better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I have used for my poodle.","review":"My black toy poodle has had dry flakey skin since he was born.

Each page reveals the many many ways that Natalie's Nana is one of greatest people in her life.I wish there were more books out there about Nanas, but if you are looking for a book to read to your child that explores the wonderful relationship between grandchild and grandparent, you will like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers the same features as other timers that cost more.","review":"I've had mine since last Spring '08, and it does just what I need. It offers the same features as other timers that cost more. It counts up or down, (timer or stopwatch mode) up to 10 hours, and has digit buttons to set the time. I didn't understand the comment from another reviewer that \\"carrying the timer is not feasible\\" - I clip mine on my belt all the time. It can also stand on my desk or lay flat on a table. True, it does not have an on/off switch, but that is not needed - it just sits there displaying \\"0:00:00\\" when not in use. I haven't had to replace the batteries yet, so it does not appear to draw much power. To me, the display is comparable to other devices with an LCD display. I can read it and program it upside down when I'm wearing it on my belt. The only feature not there that I might wish for would be a way to control the volume of the beeper, which is pretty loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"versatile and well designed timer.","review":"This has about all you could want in a digital timer, except finger-sized buttons, if that is your prime consideration. It counts up or down and has a digit key pad. Your last entry automatically is repeated, unless you want to change it with the clear button. Most, but not all digital timers have this feature. It is small and well balanced enough to use as a frig magnetic timer, or can be clipped onto a fairly thin surface with the large clip on the back, which also can serve as a stand for a table, when the wire brace is pulled out. You can even hang it on a nail with the pull out eye in the back. Unlike many digital timers, it uses a cheap easily obtained AAA battery, which is easily changed without a microscrewdriver. I've only had it a few weeks, so can't comment on durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have bought 3!!!!!!!","review":"This is SO handy and useful, I should have bought the three-pack so I wouldn't have to lug it all over the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man this (is bad)","review":"really really disappointed with the game play and graphics blocky and un attractive charaters ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The origonl is my favorite game of all time and I bought this game when it came out hopeing to god, It would be close engoh to the orignal.

It has an easy to understand turn-based battle system, which, while it is a little slow, allows you to plan out your moves. Each battle is like a chess match, requireing strategy and focus. While this game actually has little plot, it has enough to keep you interested, and for some reason, you find yourself playing more and more, hoping to buy that new weapon, or praying that you'll level up.If you like RPGs that play like a chess match, I strongly reccommend this game.

This game, however, I didn't care for much. The sound and graphics were decent, but the playability was way down. In the original, you were able to rotate the camera angle to get a better view; that feature doesn't exist in this version (I suppose due to the restricted available memory). For some reason, game designers seem to think that more complicaated means more challenging. The whole 'law' system I think is a big downfall. You can make a game challenging without making complicated game mechanics."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT GET THIS GAME","review":"When I first got this game I had high hopes for it but after 20mins. the game play became reptative.

Square's first try at a Nintendo console game in a while is as good as any Xbox/PS2/Cube title. The story behind FFTA, while not as deep or heavy as in other Final Fantasy games, is easy to relate to. The battle engine is as good as FFT for the PSOne. The law system, essentially prohibiting certain actions to be taken while rewarding others, is interesting especially later in the game when you are given the tools to manipulate it. Furthermore this game has literally dozens of possible play hours. You get your money's worth, along with cute, colorful graphics, enjoyable gameplay and solid plotline.

Wow, fun.And can somebody explain to me why I get to CHOOSE where towns are put on the map? That's just weird and is not explained at all.The graphics are pretty nice, but that's about all I can say.

I suggest *Onimusha, Metal Gear Solid, or the Tenchu series*. They all have very good storylines and ALOT of in-your-face action.

It is probably the worst RPG ever. You start off in a snowball fight and you have to have specific rules to fight....WHAT!!!! Why can't you just fight normally? The battles are horrible and that's pretty much all you do in the game. You have to follow specific rules and all you do is move around and get into position and attack. It is boring watching the monsters move around and the snowball fight takes about 20 minutes!!!! No fight should take that long in the start of a RPG!!!!!! This has horrible gameplay and is no fun. But a die-hard fan of final fantasy who likes RPGS might like it but I don't even count this as a RPG. It is a disgrace to RPGS everywhere!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance","review":"I like this game a lot. I do not care much about the rules system but it forces you to think before you act instead of using the best possible attacks. You should automatically receive bonus characters after you put in 100+ hours into the game. I like Disgaea/ Disgaea 2 better but that is for the PS2. I wish they would make a part 2 for FFTA. I still love FF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game it'll occupy your time...","review":"THis isnt an RPG but more like turn based squad combat. It's fun, many different classes to toy with, lots of secret stuff to find, and the graphics are sharp. The set-up dialouge is kinda childish but hey it's a game boy advance game, what do you expect? It is worth the $$$ so buy and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Game","review":"Right, so I have a hard time staying focused on one thing for very long. Which is probably why I enjoy blizzard games like warcraft3 and starcraft... my point is this. This game, FFTA, kept me engrossed better than any other RPG I have played. The only thing that bothered me is that I wound up trying to mastery so many of the different classes that by the end I didn't know who I wanted to use for what. You can have 20 people in your party and most battles will allow you to have 4-6 people on your team. There are 4 races and each race has (I think) atleast 7 classes you can choose from, some of which are only released over time. All in all, I spent over 100 hours on this game. Completed 230 of the 300 quests and have very few complaints. When you stop getting more skills for your players is when the game will seem repetitive and boring, so I would highly recommend trading items with other people through game-link. Happy gaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first totema","review":"The first totema may be hard to beat but it is very usefull later on in the game.

Good luck and have fun playing it, I know I am!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy Excels in a New Saga","review":"One of the most common traits of Squaresoft's hit series of games named Final Fantasy is the evolving difference in each game. Ultimately, no two are alike. And with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, there finally seems to be something that will hold true: a band of character races and \\"jobs.\\" However, the name \\"tactics\\" comes into play as the game is grid based. Rather than standing in one place and slashing back and forth, you maneuver your way around to defeat your enimy while gaining judge points. But style is not forgotten in this game. Each class supports new abilities and looks for your characters which adds a whole new enjoyment to the game. Gameplay is simple and easy to get used to. Graphics are amasing with a system that supports three color modes. And the music is almost worthy of a soundtrack of its own. FFTA is definitely worth checking out. But be warned, once you start, you'll be hooked forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Graphics...Addictive Gameplay","review":"Don't be mislead by the cute graphics. Remember Advance wars, how simple they were, yet the gameplay was unbelieveable. Same goes for this. The gameplay is great. The graphics, though 'cute' are pretty great, especially with the special effects like the magic and the summons. This game has got me addicted for hours trying to make an army of summoners, ninjas, alchemist and soo much. Everytime I see a random monster pop out, I chase it down and kill it for the AP Points. If you love strategy games and job classes, this is the game that will get you hooked for hours upon hours. Plus there is the linkup modes which will open up new missions and get you new weapons which you can't acheive during normal gameplay. GET IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Game","review":"I was very disappointed with this game for several reasons. The biggest reason being that all you do is fight. If you like fight only in moderation, this game is not for you because it is all fighting. It takes forever to finish a battle, and it's hard to play and not fun when your characters are weak. I wasn't impressed with the storyline, and, as my first FF game, I expected much more from all the great things I've heard about FF. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think this game was worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"ehhhhhhh.....","review":"final fantasy. always with the crystals. geez. you have are Marche. some kid in a little town that you moved too. you go to a school meet some friends, one of em finds a book, makes a wish, a BOOM! you're in another world. there you fight demons and uncover secrets of soom world. and destroy crystals to get back to your own world. that's it. but it's fun and has a good story line and fighting system is the same as final fantasy tactics for PS. so get it. it's a good game. and become an assassin or a ninja. they're fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"Anyone who knows good reggae already has this album. 96 Degrees is one of the most definitive examples of roots reggae ever produced.

However, I think I received almost the all of the seeds, and I just transferred them to a new ziplock baggie.The dry seeds are smaller and muted in color, but the instructions say to soak them overnight before putting them into whatever sprouter you're using. The seeds grew in size and gained in color, and then were fascinating to watch sprout. To add to the experience, the resulting sprouts had a nutty taste and texture to them.

Its gratuitous violence is right up their alley. Sort of \\"Clockwork Orange on Mars.\\" Except most of the violence takes place on Earth. The only saving grace, I thought until near the end, was the possibility that the anti-hero only had mistakenly thought that he raped and hung all those sorority girls or made that poor mother-of-two eat his handgun before pulling the trigger. At least he felt guilty about it. Then he choked a doctor to death for the doc's boarding pass, and I realized, yup, he probably did the other things, too. So why did I finish it? I think to find out how bad it could really be. Well, it didn't get any worse. There was that. The writing was okay, almost compelling. But, in the end, I realized that I had wasted my time and money. Nevertheless, I like much of Barnes's work, especiallyThe Sky So Big and Black. Buy it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Book I have Ever Thrown Away!","review":"This book is so revolting that I had to throw it away. Yes, I read the entire thing, I kept hoping that the main characters would change. The entire book they went on a rampant spree of wanton violence... rape, torture, senseless killings. I read a lot of sci-fi and the premise of this book was a great one, I just wish that the author had chosen to tell his story differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch. Great Book.","review":"This is a clever, modern piece with shades of Simak and Dick (in 'time-travel' and 'what is truth?' modes), which should probably not be read by those of a nervous disposition, nor by those who care not to get to know characters saddled with intermittent pretty unpleasant character defects."},{"rating":"1","title":"appallingly, pointlessly unpleasant","review":"Ok, technically there is a point, but it's really, really not worth it. Led on by my great enjoyment of the complex and imaginative milieux in _A Million Open Doors_ and _Earth Made of Glass_, I plowed all the way through this repetitively violent book, hoping that the main character would turn sympathetic at some point. No dice. The ending shows some intellectual ingenuity, but nowhere near that of _Doors_ or _Glass_, or even _Orbital Resonance_. A must-miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mother of Storms\\" it Ain't!","review":"Disappointed doesn't even come close to my feelings about \\"Kaleidoscope Century\\" after having read it. Disgusted and horrified come closer. The book is fairly well-written with an interesting view of the future (which saved the book from a 1 rating). However, its main character is an unrepentant bad, amoral, and possiby evil human being. Barnes could have salvaged the book by having the protagonist recognize his mistakes and try to correct them when given a chance. Though it appears that that was where the book was heading, it wasn't.Sure, maybe it's just a personal opinion. But, I don't need to become immersed in the point of view of an amoral person and have that mind-set and his actions rattling around in my skull. Perhaps humanity is essentially bad or evil (which seems to be the implication). Though if it is, I don't want to be a participant via a book as the protagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"KaleiDULLscope Century","review":"I didn't care for this book. Lots of concepts are introduced which could have been explored in more detail and explained better by Barnes. Confusing, because of continual shifts from present to the past. Protagonist is an unlikeable and despicable character. He is a murderer, rapist and a pervert and has little remorse for his actions.This is the only book I have read by Barnes. I probably will not buy another written by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very nice at all!","review":"A cold, soulless book with profoundly unlikeable characters. Furthermore, the female characters appear to have been included merely as exploitative window dressing and hint at a streak of misogyny. This is an opportunity missed, as the promising plot, faintly reminiscent of Jose Farmer's Dayworld series, had much potential. Barnes however can elicit no empathy from his readers and, if there are any redeeming features in the denouement, I'm afraid I didn't have the heart or stamina to find out. It's not often I give up on a book, but by half way through I'd had enough.

But there's the problem (it's not a flaw, because Barnes did it on purpose). The characters are so damned repulsive that by the end of the book you feel unclean. Ugh.

Our hero and his fellow commandos work as mercenaries in the employ of one Meme or another, surfing through life as they struggle to re-create memories periodically lost to them--the price they pay for a secret treatment that gives them eternal youth. Can an all-American boy find love and happiness in a universe where an innocent conversation may leave you infected by a mind virus such as One True, doomed to spend the rest of your existence in its service? Not the tightest or best SF ever written, but a graphic illustration of one possible outcome of meme evolution.--Richard Brodie, author, Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme"},{"rating":"1","title":"depraved violence, no redeeming qualities","review":"I hated this book.

The pecans add a nice crunch in the cookie and the chocolate keeps the whole thing from being too dry.My only wish is that the chocolate was not in there in such big chunks, maybe broken down more to a chip size. So that you get more chocolate through out the cookie and less chocolate in one bite. But that's just a matter of preference. As far as taste the chocolate is excellent, moist and high quality.I love the packaging just as much as the taste.

I was schocked to read it, and even more shocked when I read that the album had been one of the five CDs nominated for the next Grammy Awards in the Jazz Vocal Album category. This category includes both female and male singers, plus vocal groups. So, my conclusion is very simple. There is really a very strong marketing behind Ms. Luciana Souza. And the development of her career is very very strange... Last but not least: dozens of great singers recorded excellent albums in 2003 (Chris Connor, Helen Merrill, Mark Murphy, Manhattan Transfer, Laurie Wheeler) but none of them received any Grammy nominations.

Chega has been one of Antonio Carlos Jobim's most successful and popular compositions.

When she sings Brazilian music in Portuguese language, it's fine. But her heavy accent when singing in English is terrible. Why did she try to record such old and often recorded jazz standars like All of Me and Never Let Me Go? It doesn't makes sense for me, since she doesn't brings nothing new to such songs. The mellow arrangements are very predictable, Luciana's phrasing is uninspired through the album. Jazz ballads? Look for the new albums by such true divas as Shirley Horn, Dianne Reeves, Itamara Koorax and Helen Merrill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Pathetic...","review":"I don't like Souza's tone nor her articulation. Her liner notes explain at lenght Souza's efforts at trying to create a whole rather than merely a pretentious synthesis of her Brazilian roots with jazz ballads. I ask: does it work? Well, most of the time it does not, most of the tracks are too languid, played in very slow tempos. Only Shirley Horn and Carmen McRae knew how do it. And, unfortunately, Souza is no Carmen, no Shirley, no Helen Merril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and very disappointing","review":"A very disappointing album, very boring arrangements.

I unfortunately gave my old Eureka to the friend who helped us move. The thing has very little suction. I have to make multiple passes, so takes me more than twice as long to vacuum than it did with my old cleaner. The head is so large it wont fit under chairs and coffee tables that other machines can do with ease. The whole wand assembly is clumsy and hard to use (though I will admit that it is nice to have all the hose stowed in the machine itself).It it completely made of flimsy plastic and I am constantly worried that I am going to crack something.

Initially it worked ok again, but within 2 weeks the issue started again. Now Dyson informs me they will not repair it. They blame the defective clutch on my berber carpet. That is an absolutely absurd response. They offered us a discount on a new unit and complained this repair cost them $250.

But, after six months, I can comfortable say this vacuum cleaner has become very intuitive and effective. Stairs, hardwood floors and dusty trim boards get the treatment easily.I would highly recommend this.The only improvement I would like to see is a little longer hose.UPDATE January 2013: I was surfing my other Amazon reviews.

Oh and DYSON's response was their vacuums tend to be agressive on some types of flooring. Maybe they should say that in their advertising?

It must be lifted over door saddles. It is loud. It is heavy.Customer service is even worse than the machine. Several phone calls, all lasting an hour or more walked me through some troubleshooting techniques - none of which worked. I finally sent the machine back.

VERY upsetting to get burned like that, so thought I might save your dime. More recently I spoke to a cleaning woman about vacuum brands and recommendations -- she laughed when I mentioned Dyson (\\"only rich people waste money on those...\\").

The Dyson totally outperforms anything I've ever used before. The amount of animal hair, dust, dirt, etc that it picks up it amazing. (You'll understand with 1 use) The Dyson is self cleaning so you do not have to replace the filters often just clean them periodically. With all my indoor dogs I do have to clean the brushes often or it doesn't pickup that good. I highly recommend this vac to ANYONE who has indoor pets that shed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I am extremely disappointed in this product.

The downsides are: The on/off switch is located in a poor place, I am forever bumping it and turning the machine on and off when I don't intend to.

When you buy a vacuum of course they always work fine brand new which most of these reviews are. After one year of basic vacuuming, no dog or cat hair just around the house stuff the suction has been cut in almost half. The rollers have been cleaned, the canister etc...nothing helps. When I first got it I noticed it didnt really pick up fuzz balls or anything light that was really annoying, my hands were full of picking stuff up that the dyson wouldnt by the time I was done. The front is so high it doesnt go under my couch or bed, both of which are higher than normal. I am so dissappointed with the money I spent on this.

I think its an OK machine, but not worth the price or the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the greatest","review":"within a year of having this vacuum cleaner it needed repairs. It wasnt used often. It didn't really give a clean feeling when used on the hardwood floor. For the money and what they advertise i expected more.

I own Dyson DC14 for 3 weeks now, and I am very satisfied with it. So it is more useful to mention potential issues. First, it is a bit heavy but very easy to move around thanks to its nice design and wheels. So, as long as you don't try to lift it up to carry around that is not a problem. Second, using the small heads (dusting brush, nozzle etc.) requires a little more work for this vacuum compared to canister vacuums. Third, it would be great if it had a auto-rewind power cord. In Dyson DC14 you need to wind the power cord on holding bar and it usually comes off as you pull and push the machine around. This may be a standard issue for many upright vacuums though. Overall the item is fairly priced at 280 bucks and it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really dislike this vacuum","review":"I have had this product for 3 years and still hate it. I routinely clean the filter and all the other stuff so that is not the problem. The Dyson does not pick up dirt worth a crap.

It works wonderfully and picks up tons of dirt and dust and pet hair. It is well worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vacuum Out There","review":"It seems like every vacuum I bought in the past lost its suction after a year or two and no amount of filter-exchanging and cleaning ever brought the machine back to full efficiency.So I spent the extra money on the Dyson. I figured the almost $500 would be worth it if it lasted more than five years and didn't lose suction. Well, after four months with it I am quite pleased. No more running the vacuum back and forth over a tiny piece of grime or a thread stuck in the carpet. This thing picks up all noticeable grime with one pass.One small peeve is the extendable hose. Often it does not want to bend the way I want it to bend to clean stairs, for example.All in all a very well made and powerful unit. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy with my purchase","review":"i got this may 2010 and have been very happy with my purchase. this is the best vacuum i've owned (which is only 3 total, so maybe thats not saying much). very good suction on this but i do have a couple gripes with this. one, i don't get why the crevice tool has a hole in the side of it. second, it seems like the wand doesn't get as good of suction as when running the floor part. i don't find emptying the canister a problem at all (though none in my house have allergy problems). it is amazing how much crap and hair and fuzz end up in the canister after vacuuming an area that was recently vacuumed. when we first got this we took turns using it in rooms that it hadn't been run in yet b/c it was so validating and cool to see how much crap got sucked up. i would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Vacuum","review":"I really love my new Dyson. It works beautifully. The only drawback is that I find the hose and wand a bit difficult to maneuver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic parts break","review":"Expensive for breakable plastic. It does pick up dust - until it finds hair, then it jams, and if you don't pull the plug and fix it on time, heats up and the brush melts (about 2-4 seconds, so it's a real problem). Ours only lasted 5 months, and the warranty's only good for selected locations, which is not real convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice vacuum","review":"Being in the hospitality business, I have tried over 30 different types of vacuums. From inexpensive oreck's to very expensive Kirby's. I purchased 4 of these DC14 and DC 33 machines. I couldn't be any happier. Dyson vacuums are great as long as you maintain them by keeping the brush roll free of hair and threads, filters cleaned and dust collecting bin clean. We've had our DC 14 for 4 years and it still works like a champ. I clean the filters every 3 weeks, and keep a spare filter on hand. I also change the HEPA filter every year. Dyson says you shouldn't, but I am using them in commercial atmosphere. The plastic makes this feel cheap, but it isn't. The onboard attachments work like a charm and it really makes it efficient for my staff.The Dyson is engineered very well and it's practical. It isn't the lightest and it isn't the heaviest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacuum #3","review":"Bought one for my daughter, then one for me and this my third purchase for daughter #2.

Right now looking for a power or switch to stopp sucking from pole and start doing the floor. I am getting totally annoyed. I may eventually figure it out. Lots of pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Approach cautiously","review":"My vacuum was still under the 5 year warranty when the mini turbine head quit on me. I called Dyson directly, not to utilize my warranty but to BUY a replacement part. However, their service reps told me, on several different calls, that they had no record of me nor of my properly registered purchase, even while I sat at my computer looking at my online profile on their site with my purchase information. To blatantly lie to me was inexcusable.That being said, any vacuuming done with the hose part of the vacuum works quite well, although the mini turbine head is rather loud. The other part of the vacuum has never possessed much of any suction capability in its life, so the remainder of the vacuum is useless and therefore overpriced.This is my only Dyson purchase, and although initially I desired to purchase another, smaller style, after my experience with their fictitious warranty, I seriously doubt I shall do so again."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you pay for a name, sometimes that is all you get!","review":"My wife was bubbling over with joy when I relented and laid out big bucks for the Dyson DC-14. We got it home and she just couldn't compliment it enough. I on the other hand just finished vacuuming my office with it. It did an average job... But then I didn't pay 'average' money. I paid top shelf money.Mobility-average, speed-average, suction-slightly under average, construction average.Nothing about this says high quality other than the name.

TWICE!!!","review":"Read a lot of reviews and decided to take the plunge and spend the money on a DC 14. Went into Best Buy, and bought a \\"demo/open box\\" for $309. Returned home happy with my purchase and immediately started vacuuming. No Problems on the hard wood floors, I transitioned to the carpet and almost immediately heard a loud crackling sound from the brush housing. Looked and noticed it had cracked and warped at one side. Figuring this was the bad luck of a \\"demo\\", I returned to Best Buy, returned the \\"demo\\" and paid $399 for a new one. Returned home and returned to vacuuming. This one lasted all of 5 minutes before I heard the same dreadful crackling sound. Low and behold to my utter horror and dismay, the same piece had cracked once again! It is absolutely ridiculous that a vacuum at this price has such a pi## poor design.I would avoid this model like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vacuum Ever","review":"I have had this vacuum for over a year and I have not had any problems with it. I have a Golden Retriever and a cat that does shed and my Dyson has not clogged up ever!!! The only problem I have with this vacuum is the noise it makes when something gets hung up in the rotation but that is a small issue and wouldn't give it up for the world. When I need a new vacuum, which I do not believe will be anytime soon it will be another Dyson. I have had many other vacuums and this one really is the Royalty of all vacuums. The price is high but in the long run you will save on not only bags but also the purchasing of vacuums every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dyson's SUCKtion - lousy customer support","review":"I just got off the phone Dyson's customer service dept.--for the second time. I purchased my DC14 from Home Depot in 2008 (2 years ago). It came with a tag on it stating there was a 5 year Warranty. Recently one of the belts broke (of course the one inside that I can't get to). I called because I don't have the receipt and the first time I called them, they told me a Serial Number would suffice if I lost the receipt. The second time I called, I was told that the vacuum was made in 2006 according to the serial # and was no longer under warranty since in 2006 they only came with 2 Year Warranties (even though the tag on it said \\"5 Year Warranty\\"). Basically I was told I was S-O-L and I would have to order parts and pay to have it fixed. Dyson needs to have better support if it's going to charge such outrageous prices for its products. I will NEVER by another Dyson product."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER-PRICED & OVER-RATED","review":"I hate this vacuum. I don't find that it really picks up or maintains suction better than any other vacuum. It's too light weight so when I detach the handle to use the hose feature I have to \\"trap\\" it between the chair and table so that it isn't constantly bumping into the back of my heels. The hose attachment is not well planned. The handle (that you'd use while upright) gets in the way when you are trying to reach into corners and the hose kinks, causing it to loose suction. It is very easy to empty the basket; which is the only good thing that I can say about it. I HATE HATE HATE THIS VACUUM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty expensive for how long it lasts","review":"Bought a $550 Dyson three years ago, fair performance (though constant shocks when the beater brush engaged) since purchased but now the beater brush doesn't engage at all and is now useless at picking up anything. $550 for three years. I would have been cheaper to get a $79 cheapie every year, or even every six months.I can accept that we live in an era of disposability and cheapness so long as you're paying a cheap price.

I have 3 dogs and I had to empty this canister 8 times, yes 8 the first time I used it. I had to take out the trash when I was done. My house is small, it took me an hour to vacuum. With my old vacuum I thought the normal 15 min. was sufficient. Boy was I wrong, I couldn't believe how much stuff was in there and it is sooo easy to empty. I would recommend this to everyone. Especially if you get it for a decent price. I've used it 4 times total at once a week so far and even had to empty the canister like about 3-4 times each use (I do have 3 dogs).

Two words GET [IT!!!!!.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best game ever.But before the rest of my review let's get one thing clear there are only 386 pokemon.Now then this game is awesome with the ability to snag and purify.This game is a must have for newcomers and pokemon veterans alike.Oh and before you go crazy about being able to catch all 386 pokemon don't because you can only catch 44 pokemon within the game I repeat within the game (except for when they evolve and Espeon and Umbreon who are the two you start with)the only way you could catch the rest of them is to trade between the other pokemon gameboy/gameboy color/gameboy advance games but you in the basement of the pokemoncenter in Phenac city.But you can only do that after you beat the game.If you want more tips just ask in your next review."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is cool!","review":"I've got this product already, but I'd like to tell you that this product is also in Canada now!

I was hoping for another amazing pokemon game (I've been playng pokemon games since red was new... in '99)I finally get the game, so I pop it in and after only a few minutes, I'm on the brink of screaming. I was so BORED! This game was nothing like the REAL pokemon games, like red and silver. All stratagy is completly gone, and even though I have to admit the graphics were nice, who cares? Everytime you attacked, you had to watch some tedius little sceen play out, repeat. That was your battle. Nothing. I recomend you stay away from this game and try to get your hands on a copy of red or silver, even saphire or ruby would be good. This isn't pokemon.p.s.

There is no other way to play multiplayer.I can't believe the greed Nintendo is showing by forcing their customers to purchase all this unecessary hardware. A stand-alone multiplayer mode such as the one in Stadium for the N64 should've been included. I like GBA connectivity as an *option*, but not when it's forced down the consumers' throat. This is a spit in the face of their customer base, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems nice","review":"Yup, another stadium game finally came. I've heard this game has also an RPG mode that everybody's wanted. I've heard you can steal pokemon(including pokemon you couldn't get in Ruby and Sapphire) and get them in your game.

Anyway, the stadium's 5 stars with me! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pokemon Madness","review":"The Pokemon are back and stronger than ever. The new Ruby and Sapphire pokemon are here to stay. They have awsome graphics and great battles. They love to make these games. The point is to snag, that's right, snag pokemon from other trainers. Then to purify them to their full power. The game does have its disadvantages. The pokemon take hits but insted of standing there for light hits they recoil at everything!

I'm not buying a Gamecube jst to play this game. I have to admit the story is quite good. Evil pokémon are taking control of the world and you have to defeat different people and all that and you can also move around easier but I wouldn't my money on it.

I miss the days of the GBA games being the only way to battle pokemon, the way not every trainer gets a Latios, or a Rayquaza, or some other UBER Pokemon on his arsenal ... no, make that EVERYBODY in colloseum has at least ONE Uber Pokemon at their disposal.This game stinks, it's a lot more worth it to save your money for other things than waste it on Colloseum, trust me I wasted about 50-60 dollars on a guide ... the game ... and the bonus disk.

What happened to the commentary during battles. While the graphics are generally ok, they are some pokemon that have not been rendered very well at all. Transfering pokemon between this game and the gameboy games is not easy at all. And finally the Pokemon are so soundless (as is the whole game) you might fall asleep trying to stay interested in it.

Quinn Peterson is the FBI agent in charge of the killings of a serial killer dubbed The Butcher - the serial killer that Miranda escaped years before. Miranda's past haunts her - most of all her escape when her best friend died at his hands. With Miranda's knowledge of the local area and the help of the local sheriff, Quinn focuses in on the clues left by the latest victims, despite his feelings for Miranda surfacing painfully. Meanwhile Miranda is facing the same problem - she's trying to ignore Quinn and her painful past so that she can catch the man that tortured her and killed her best friend. Interesting stories with good plots - a little heavy on the romance for a mystery, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I absolutely adore Allison Brennan's books. Although I have not read one if a very long time, they were always page turners, suspenseful, and I could never put the books down. I enjoyed her way of having the books suspenseful mysteries, with a little romance thrown in with the hero in the book, whether it was the cop, detective, or other hero in the book. Some of her books spooked me out a little, and I can only describe it as me making sure my back was against the wall, and that I could see every inch of the room I was in. Great books, great reads, great author, really recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I was in the thinking that this was a romance/suspense/mystery book. Yeah, it had suspense and mystery but it failed majorly in the romance section. And the characters weren't well developed either. Miranda, who escaped the killer years before is really annoying for many reasons. It's hard to get into the book when you don't like the lead character. I felt bad for her because of the things she survived and I wished I could have liked her but it didn't happen. That combined with the horrible romance triangle, I was inclined to skim through most of the pages. And I did.If you are tempted by the summary like I was, do yourself and favor and don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Fan","review":"Normally I love a romatic thriller/mystery, however, I found that this book was too graphic and abrasive in the crimes. This is the first book I have read by this author and my dislike of the book could have something to do with the killer's absessive mutation of women. Spoiler: Rape and incest never turn me on to a book. The lack of humor to compensate for the violent depressing tone made me want to pick up a comedy just to get feeling good again. Reading this author, you can see her writing has a talented flair and gripping story, but I will not be buying another of her books. Maybe the others are different but I enjoy a little smile with my story.

I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased history","review":"I looked forward with great excitement to receiving this book. I find American History very interesting, and was curious about the lives of Presidential children. I was very disappointed, however, by the subtle (and not so subtle) bias in the writing. Wead uses this platform to bash children of Democrats and praise children of Republicans. Statements along these lines are cheap shots, and totally unnecessary. To my view, this book actually does a disservice to Wead's bosses--the Bushes. The partisanship ruins what could have been a great book, and a wonderful addition to the real history of our nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Inside Look at Presidential Families","review":"This work has two great strengths. First the material is fascinating and includes stories that have been rarely told before. Second the author clearly has an insider's knowledge of what life in the White House is like.

I highly recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-educational and an inch deep","review":"I'm reading this book, published in 2003, in late 2008 only because it's a 2009 selection for my book club. What a shame that is, because what a silly book this is.It's semi-educational, meaning that I trust the author got the names of the Presidents' children correct. But it's about an inch deep, meaning that the author's commitment to his thesis (the US Presidency is an immutably destructive force blunting the development of all but a few Presidential children) is too strong to be blunted by any facts that don't support it.The author, an active apologist for compassionate conservatism, the Bushes, and Amway, has fashioned a book that reads like this:1. Here's my theory.2. Here are the facts I've selected to support my theory.3. See how the facts I've selected prove my theory.Sheesh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph and Tragedy","review":"I enjoyed the book.

Wead did a nice job examining the presidential children throughout the years. He is correct in how many fall into common catagories. The problem I have with this book is the numerous references to George W. Bush and how he avoided this trap, or overcame this situation. The fact that Wead works for \\"W\\" becomes very apparent. In Wead's mind George W. Bush is the next best thing to sliced bread and can do no wrong. I have read other books on first families, and the stories are much more compeling when the author remains a 3rd party. I would give this book 6 or 7 stars if Wead had been able to stay non-partisan. Despite this problem, the book is interesting to read and I would recommended it too others, with a warning to be prepared for GWB worship."},{"rating":"1","title":"strangely disappointed","review":"I found this strangely dull.

The central lovers played by Paul Le Mat and Dianne Hull are appealing. Los Angeles has never looked more effervessent as lensed here by William Fraker. The soundtrack, particularly the contributions of Elton John whose songs act as a Greek chorus, is terrific. The problem here is the direction, or over direction, of the film by Floyd Mutrux. The film just seems too...busy. The sights and sounds of the movie overwhelm the main story of a boy and a girl on the lam from the law for a prank that goes tragically awry. \\"Aloha, Bobby and Rose\\" is a good film that could have been a great one. On a side note when are they going to release Mutrux' \\"American Hot Wax\\" on DVD? A new VHS copy of the film goes for over $100.00.

Kelly Singer tells the story of a woman named Lissa who inherits almost one million dollars and a house from her grandfather. She invites her best friend and son to move in with her, hoping for a new start after her divorce. All seems fine until her best friend's son meets an ominous little girl named Samantha. The problem is, Lissa is the only one who seems to think that Samantha is anything other than a normal, sweet ten year-old girl. First Impression is downright chilling at times, and will make you want to keep reading just to find out what is really going on with the little girl. A fast read and never a dull moment, First Impression continues to build suspense until the very end. Definitely recommended. ~~ Laura Pfalz, author of \\"Going Down Memory Lane\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"This is an absolutely terrible dvd. While I think Irina very graceful and a great dancer, she lacks any ability as a teacher. Most instructional DVD's show you a move, at least once or twice, break it down, and then show the move slowly and then half speed, tempo and double time. Irina does absolutely NO instruction! She shows the move as she is doing it...with voice over I might add. Then the tempo picks up. I have had at least 4 or 5 beginning belly dance classes, so while I am NO expert, I know the basic moves. I found this very difficult to follow and keep up with. I wish I could return it. You could learn more on FitTV Shimmy. I am going to ask my belly dance teacher for a recommendation because clearly these reviews didn't help!

Sound quality is decent at low volumes, but they just can't fill even a small room with music. They also developed a bad connection somewhere, so I have to adjust the volume knob just so so that I get sound out of both speakers. They are really nice looking, though.If you're buying these for a dorm room, or need some nice looking speakers for basic computer sound and nothing more, you could do worse than these 2200s. If you want to play enjoy music from your computer - spend a little more on some speakers with a little more juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little set of speakers - that also look good","review":"Certainly not the most powerful speakers you can get.

I turned them on one day and it started to make some hissing sounds and then eventually started to make sounds like when you lose reception when listening to a radio station. Eventually I couldn't use them at all and I had to throw them away.They are extremely light, so I'm pretty sure they aren't built to last. I would look around for something more solid if you plan to keep your speakers for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like them...","review":"These speakers have a great form factor and look great. The sound is alright, about what you'd expect for the price point. However, I've been having the same problem with the right speaker (the one with the knobs). When I go to adjust the volume there's a large amount of static suddenly, and one or both speakers will cut out unexpectedly or lose most volume. Messing around some more (sometimes for like a minute) will usually get the volume and sound in both speakers back where it should be, but that's still somewhat ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"just \\"OK\\"","review":"They sound fairly good when connected to my laptop.

Being a bit of an audiophile (but not expecting such from pc speakers, subwoofer or not), lackluster is pretty accurate for these speakers. My five year old Harmon Kardon's (still kickin'), that came with my first Dell have more depth than these things. If you're into sound at all, be warned, the sound from these speakers is murky, muddy and flat with no depth or soundstage, yuk! Bass? I think not, at least that's not what I'd call it. It's not even distinguishable to define it. The Labtec 1070'sLabtec LCS-1070 Spin 70 2-Piece Computer Speakersare a better bargain particularly as they are older and you'll probably find them for cheap, I did, just bought a pair from Amazaon.

Believe me I get better performance out of cheaper ones. When I first got these they sounded great. The bass levels were perfect. It was the perfect pair of speakers for my desktop. Then after awhile the power/volume button started to short out. Whenever I needed to adjust the volume or turn in on/off I'd hear a static sound coming through. Then one day the left speaker just shut off. So I checked them with my mp3 player. Same problem. So if you want to spend money on something that'll last don't get these get the cheaper ones by creative. Those little 2 watt speakers are perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"First the tone went, then the right speaker","review":"I use my speakers on rare occasions. I listen to light music, and I never set the volume above the halfway mark. I also keep the setting at about 25-50% on my computer. So, after a few weeks, I was very surprised that I started receiving problems with this speaker set.At first, the tone adjustment started having problems. When I turned the knob a little past the half way point, the speaker started to make a loud even tone. It would not stop until I turned the speaker off, and back on again. Finally, I set the tone back to the center and stopped messing with it.A few months later the right speaker just stopped working. This is the main power speaker, so I know it's plugged in properly, and receiving power (the light is on, and the left speaker plays fine).I would not recommend this product to anyone, and this experience will make me think twice about purchasing another Creative Labs product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"I bought these about a year ago. They sounded good for the size - however the price/performance is not stellar as some other reviewers will have you believe. I thought they were still worth it for a decent pair of good looking speakers.However these have issues with reliability - I had the same issue as another reviewer where changing the volume produced static noise from the right speaker. After that the left speaker produces buzzing all the time, so I can't really use these anymore. It has been less than a year since I bought them and they haven't been used very heavily or with high volume either - not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run. Don't buy.","review":"The Creative Labs I-Trigue 2200 2.0 Speakers are fine, just like the free cell phones you get when you sign up with a cell company are fine. So, if some one is giving you a pair, they come free with some promotion, or if you can get them for the cost of shipping, then go ahead. Don't pay money for them. Anybody under 75, who likes even a little bit of volume with their music, should avoid these speakers. They are tinny and can't handle their own wattage. They are also ultra small compared to what is perceived in the marketing photo. If you are looking for something for your laptop, maybe I would recommend parting with 10.00 for them. For anybody who likes a return on their money, almost any other brand will do you better for the 50.00 dollars or so they are being sold for. Creative Labs is a hype name.

I'm typically a thriller/mystery fan, but this book got me interested in reading historical romances - who would have ever guessed? The writing is superb, and the character development hooks you from the start and keeps you interested throughout the book. I would have sworn the author was British!

I knew this before I got it since I had read one just before this and figured it can't be that bad. Yeah, it was that bad. If you're not religiously-inclined, you may want to avoid it. It started out great but quickly petered out and there was just too much preachy stuff to keep it enjoyable to me. I mean, I usually don't mind some references to religion/God/prayer but I hit my limit when they prayed for silverware. That's a tad materialistic, no? Also, I should add that I had to keep reminding myself that this book is supposedly based in England because it sounds so American."},{"rating":"1","title":"call a spade a spade","review":"Great writing style, extraordinarily accurate detail describing Victorian life, but be real.

But the book drags on and on, with nothing interesting happening. The writer gives almost an hour-by-hour accounting of the lives of the people involved, but it went on so long that I just couldn't care. It was also almost completely historically inaccurate, which made it hard to enjoy as well.

Any book which contains mammoth amounts of religious rhertoric should be labeled so that readers know what they are getting into. Aside from the proselytizing, it is badly written as far as historical pieces go. There are turns of phrase used that would not have been at the time and place this story takes place.

Her \\"research\\" on 1870s England seems limited to watching \\"Little House\\" on TV and (perhaps) glancing at a map of England. Anachronisms abound. I did read to the end, but just to laugh at the blatant inaccuracies.If the author had set this book in 1870s USA, I might have given it 3 stars. It might have made 4 stars had the evangelizing been less clumsy. The story is also very predictable.I gave this book the second star because the author is quite good at characterization and it was reasonably well written with relatively few errors in grammar. I was being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't know was\\" Christian \\"literature","review":"Story line was weak, but I am not a fan of the Christian literature genre.

It is interesting to read the reviews of others. Although this may not have been totally historically accurate, I seldom find much anymore that is, from novels to news commentators. Myself, I was into the story line from the first chapter and never getting bored with it! There are many times when I felt a break between paragraphs would have been helpful since it does jump from one person or place without indication. Also, it introduction of another character and his family midway though was unexpected and from that point on it was predictable how it would end but the getting there was . . . . fun. Also the gospel message was presented in a simple yet applicable way.

The story of life in a small town was really well done. The people were varied and believable except for their overpowering need to bring their faith into everything. They prayed for things like silverware and the right words to say when talking with someone. This is a gentle and interesting story but be aware that it will preach to you. I believe when there is this much religion in a book there should be some indication of that in the description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I really tried to read this book. And it's rare that I dont finish a book. But- I just couldn't get into it. I stopped about two thirds into it. It was just too boring!The writing was ok, The characters were undeveloped, and the story was a bit cheesy. It was very predictable and situations were unrealistic.There is a \\"hero\\" or \\"love intrest\\" who isn't even introduced until more than halfway through the book. And it comes from nowhere. You're plodding along in the story and suddenly it switches to a whole new viewpoint- a new person. It's extremely confusing. After about a chapter of this new person, it's very clear exactly where this story will go. There will be no surprises.If you like books that are slow, low on romance, with a lot of preaching, than this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Widow of landslide I.","review":"It was a wonderful story.

Ok, you have that one.but seriously. the plot is extremely cliche. i remember one part of the game where it actually TELLS you.The big deal about this game is the multiplayer. I heard it's great when you have friends to play with, but no one I know owns this game.to be honest...i found this game difficult too. and im talking about playing with yourself. by the second stage i quit because it became frustrating. not really, but it became boring and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?!!","review":"This is possibly the worst game I've ever witnessed. I have no idea why Nintendo is getting hooked on this dumb idea where you must have four players to beat the game. The idea has already ruined that Legend of Zelda game. Also, the controls are so confusing to where I want to break the disc in half, which I almost did. Getting back to that four player thing, WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE FOUR PEOPLE TO PLAY?! Nintendo never thought of that and probably won't. I just wish that Nintendo wouldn't make games like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy; Crystal Chronicles","review":"Final Fantasy is a deeply diverse series that has evolved for generations. Now, it makes it's return to Nintendo with Crystal Chronicles. Final Fantasy is an amazing series, and the new game is no dissapointment. It may not have extreme graphics, but neither did the classic FF and Mario games, and people still play them. If you can look past the graphics, then you'll really love the plot and new twists. But if you don't like the series or have never tried the others, you may not like this game. Its a must for RPG fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have finished it if the controls were better...","review":"From what I played, I did enjoy it. The one thing that got me so frustrated was the controls, which is why I never finished the game. I'm glad that they have improved that for the DS sequel (Ring of Fates). My hope for this game is that they make a Wii version and reformat the control system (like Nintendo has done for Pikmin). Or if they made a DS version of this game too, I would be happy with that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misused Potential for a great game","review":"First off, this game was designed explicitly for multiplayer, and if you want to utilize multiplayer you will need a GBA and GBA Link Cables for each player other than player one. Someone will have to carry the chalice as well. This game is fun, but when playing solo you are constantly reminded of how much better it would be if you had friends with you. Thanks to a gimmick this game falls far from greatness. It's worth five bucks or less (I paid less). For RPG afficionados it's worth a look, but the interface is clunky and not for people who aren't already interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I preordered this game and took it back a week after I got it. The story is contrived and the gameplay is unfriendly. My friends swore it was better when you played with others, but I found myself just as bored. I especially didn't like using the Gameboy Advance with it; the GameCube controller is much more comfortable. On the plus-side, the sound and graphics are decent, but that doesn't make a game, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating.","review":"I'd always wanted this game, but never got the gumption to buy it. I eventually purchased a used copy and was severely disappointed. as the Game Informer review says, gameplay is 'frustrating' and the plot was completely lacking. When I played i saw no point. There was no saving the world, no powering up awesome weapons, just running around in a bubble. I expected more from a game from square."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only negative stars could be given!!!","review":"yeah, this game sucks various parts of a donkey's anatomy. I advise anyone with half a functioning brain cell to avoid it like the plague! You may ask why this game is bad well the main reason is this: THE BUCKET! Yes thats right a bucket, you must take this bucket with you since it protects you from a deadly fog. Oh my God its fog, run away (sarcasm)! I would advise the reader of my informative unbaised review to play a real game such as shenmue or skies of arcadia, you can even play superman 64 ,yes even that is better than this crystal suckacles (note my clever misspelling). ha ha ha I winnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"This is a bad game and when i say bad I mean It Sucks! This game has really bad graphics compared to all the other Final Fantasies and terrible gameplay. I was expecting something really big when I heard it was coming back to Nintendo but I was wrong! The best part about this game is creating your character at the begining. That is about all this game has to offer. You mine as well play the Super Nintendo FF! And if you have already bought it... I feel very sorry.. and for those of You who were thinking about buying it, I hope I have saved you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a well developed game","review":"I was looking forward to finally having a Final Fantasy game on my Gamecube, but I was very disappointed in this game. About the only good thing is the graphics. The game itself gets repetitive, all you do is carry a bucket around year after year through the same level. Soon it'll feel like your not getting anywhere in the game. I didn't even bother finishing the game, I gave up in the middle and moved on. Another thing is that the way the charecters move in the cutscenes are like the way the charecter in Zelda for the N64 move. I don't even understand why Nintendo even decided to have a Final Fantasy game like this. they should have compared this to all the other Final Fantasy. So I think you should save your money and buy something worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game made me hate Final fantasy until I had played others...","review":"Seriously please do not buy this game. It's literally terrible. My ex bf loved it and he was stupid and mindless, however EVERYONE ELSE hated this game. Its boring, easy and pointless. Also to have multiple players you have to have multiple game boy advances and wires. So I had to go half and half to buy game boy advances to get my 3 friends to play with me.I hated Final Fantasy assuming they were all like this until I played 9 then 7 and LOVED those, they had a story...there is no story at all to this game it's just stupid little battles here and there and you have to carry a chalice. I don't think there is an end you play \\"years\\" and fill said chalice then restart all levels again for next year.This is only good if your a kid and ever played a video game before."},{"rating":"2","title":"ffcc review","review":"This game is the first final fantasy game to go on any other system besides playstation and gameboy advanced.

The game play is really good but some what dull at the start but when you get used to it its a blast. Take it from me Im 13 I love this game.

It should be called Final Fantasy: the Crystal Losers Chronicles. all the final fantasy fans, expected a big game, and because Square Enix begins again making games for Nintendo, got all of the Final Fantasy Fans excited. The game is totally lame, has a serious lack of story!!! Seriously!!!!! You get to pick the name of your town, your character, gender, etc, and then, your on your own, you meet other caravans(but nothing big) and you fight monsters,(SPOILERS)and when you fight the Final Boss, you discover that it's all based on memories,(END OF SPOILERS)and the end is a big piece of crap!The multiplayer version, it's the same, but you can play with your friends, and it's almost impossible to play, cause every player needs a nintendo advance, to play, and to do the spells is very hard!!I just hope that the sequel isn't as lame as this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Twist","review":"I've been waiting for this game for what seems like ages.

Don't get me wrong, I love Gauntlet, but when i want a FF game, i want a final fantasy game.This is all speculation, who knows the game might still be cool(praying with all my heart). Also, to play multiplayer you need four gba's and four link cables. That is fantastically gay.Give us a real GCN FF game please Square, or maybe kingdom hearts(yeah right)."},{"rating":"2","title":"say it with me ... awesome","review":"This game rocks i'm telling you if you have a game cube there are 3 games you must have super smash bros. melle, pokemon colleseum ( ...) , and ff crystal chronichles. even though the camera sucks and if you or pet isn't carrying a bucket you lose life and you have to carry it wich really sucks when your fighting a boss but overall this game is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to Final fantasy games standards","review":"Well as many already know FF:CC strays away from the style of the current and older final fantasy games.Which i think is horrible because they changed what we all know and love about are Final fantasy games.But ill be fair and list the pros and cons of this game.Pros: Beautiful graphicsyou get to make your own characterthe sound quality was very goodMultiplayercons: Almost no real plot depthlack of character developmentThe style of the map is kind of cheapnot much character interactionyou have to go to a diary and read what happens to your character instead of seeing it in actionOverall FF:CC is not an rpg but an adventure game that gets boring and repetitive after awhile.

Batchelor is very clear and honest with his prose. Books like this just show the resiliency inherent in Buddhism. While my preference is for the 'stripped to the bone' quality of Zen, I frequently enjoy the rich and colorful practice of Vajrayana. It's all good, until somebody loses a (third) eye ;->.

The book seemed confusing and when I finished reading it, my knowledge of Buddism was not expanded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking insight","review":"Buddhism without karma or rebirth is like a car with no engine and no wheels...it's not going anywhere. The author kept calling for creative ideas to keep buddhism relevant in the contemporary world but brought very little to the table himself. I kept thinking perhaps he was saving his inspiring thoughts for the last chapter but this never happened. The material is dry and overwritten and in my opinion the author is at a dead end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddhism on its head","review":"'Buddhism Without Beliefs' represents, some would argue, a radical existential view of Buddhism: There is no true reality--only my experience. If we accept this, Batchelor calls on us to dump rebirth and karma, since we have no experience of them, so that we are faced with an \\"existential, therapeutic and liberating agnosticism.\\" But this is only playing with words. Batchelor is really marketing a radical acceptance of one's ignorance and suffering which, in effect, turns Buddhism on its head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beliefs Without Buddhism","review":"A better title would be Beliefs Without Buddhism. In the West, especially the USA, many \\"Buddhist\\" have adopted \\"Buddhism\\" to be free of their traditional religions, not because of the message of Buddha. Even worse, when they have not experienced their own Enlightenment, they make unenlightenment their dogma. I have studied extensively with Zen Masters in the West and East, those in the West have the system and verbage, but not the Heart of Insight (except Cleary!). This book does a great disservice to Buddhism, missing the essentials. Anyother book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I think the author is confused about what Buddhism is. I think if this book was just written as a personal experience without religion connotations it would be good. But it had little to do with Buddhism.

Unfortunately I wasn't inspired by it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good with a few problems","review":"This is a generally good book with a few problems. The author doesn't seem to realize that agnostic and skeptical thought are related to each other. Skeptics don't discount every thing, they just want you to provide evidence for your claims. I liked this book though and am surprised at the vitolic rantings of some fundementalist buddhists at this site. One person was so offened by the book that he reviewed it twiced as though he hope's we'll look at that little star meter and not purchase. I'm more concerned with whether it's true instead of scriptual. Can't he realize that buddhist can make mistakes too? All in all a fine effort with a few problems. You'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The cassette is not a verbatim reading of the book.","review":"Loving the book as much as I do I was initially dismayed to find the cassette version was different. However, I came to realize this difference is an addition to, rather than a repitition of, the book. Hence, we get an expansion of Batchelor's ideas. Perhaps the author chose this occasion to add to and expand what he said in print. While the book tops my list of explications of understanable Buddhist thought I find the cassette version to be a different, but contiguous, expression of the same ideas. It is as if Batchelor took this opportunity in making a tape version of the book to add what he left out of the printed version. For those of us who experienced wonder and satisfaction at reading the book and dismay that it had to end I strongly recommend the audio version. Plus, hearing Batchelor's voice, through which his intelligence and commitment come through, lends an added air of familiarity and fulfillment to his insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"good explanation of basic buddhism","review":"Buddhism is often confusing to people because there are several branches of it.

Well written and good introduction to those not very familiar with the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Dogmatists And Check Out This Book","review":"If you look through the bad reviews you will see that most of the naysayers trumpet their vast Buddhism libraries. They also refer to the author as being incompetent despite the fact that he was an ordained monk of Tibetan Buddhism for twenty years before he left the order to go on his own path. Could it be that faced with the reality that Buddhism does not depend upon zealous adhearence to invented orthodoxy and vain accumulation of obscure texts and knowledge these naysayers are trying desperately to cling to the trappings of their false piety?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste","review":"Many are fond of Batchelor's, um, interpretation of Buddha'steachings.

He is a \\"talking head\\" blithely listening to his own intellectual drone, while basically denigrating and scoffing at those who do have experiential knowledge of the tenets of Buddhism. The beauty of Buddhism is that it is a practicing religion. If you want proof of its ideas, including life beyond the body, that can absolutely be verified through direct perception of the mind..but NOT through listening to the mind's chatter of discursive thought. Note that Bachelor was NOT published by any reputable Buddhist publishers such as Wisdom Books or Snow Lion, but by a imprint of a major commercial publishing house that is purely profit-oriented. Maybe he will believe in Karma when he experiences the fruition of misleading and fooling the gullible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly NOT worth clinging to....","review":"Westerners seem to demand the same thing from 2500 year old wisdom as they do their magazines, movies, and fast food - quick, self-serving satisfaction that forever shifts and morphs to meet their fickle and ever-changing preferences.

Since the book I read was borrowed, I wanted to buy a new for my library. Well, the new book I received via Amazon was a very poor quality version of the one I had just read. The printing was faint.

At first I didnt like the idea of two characters riding in one kart but once I played my mind changed quickly. There are now different karts to chose from depending on waht characters you pick. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because I thought the courses could have been better. The ones in MArio Kart 64 are better in my opinion, but there are still some pretty cool ones. Also if you beat all the cups on 150cc you can unlock a cup with all the races in it. So I would say get this game because it is fun and you will play it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"the cpu doesnt cheat","review":"what are u talking about if anything the cpu is too easy i beat this game in less than a week its so simple, u just either suck at racing games or cant figure out how press A. mario kart double dash is a great game to me, the only fault is it could of been more difficult because after u get gold on everything the only fun is racing ur friends but dont get me wronng that never does get old"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Children LOVE this game!","review":"Fun game for kids of all ages.

I have a SNES system pretty much just for the original mariokart. It's great, it's something that challenges everyone and can be enjoyed by kids and adults. Double dash is so infantile it sickens me! The battlemode options are terrible! Who wants to play on top of a gamecube? That's the most uninspired thing I've ever seen! And other venues such as cookie land? I wanted to see sequels to the original, advances in the game but the same basic concept. This game is for kids much like the N64 version, look toward the gameboy DS for a better mariokart. A serious let down. If you liked the original at least rent it before you buy it just to see if I'm telling the truth here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sequel to some awesome games","review":"Mario is back with another great racing game. Even though we can't give an honest review because the game isn't out yet, I still think this game will be so much fun to play.

Another great advantage to this game is now you have 2 people in the car at the same time. One has driving duties, and the other provides classic Mario weapons to fire at the other drivers.

This opened up a flood gate of awesome that Nintendo has been trying to match, but in my opinion has been unable to do so.DD let's you race two people per kart, one driving and one firing off items. This creates a great sense of team work and coordination that I don't even see in shooter games. I highly recommend Mario Kart Double Dash, it plays on the Wii as well as the Gamecube, so don't let that stop you. You will have to buy some GC controllers, which puts this one game at a higher price probably, but it is so worth it in the end. I'd say don't even buy the Wii Mario Kart and just buy Double Dash with a crew of game cube controllers.Did I mention that Double Dash is awesome?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Kart: Tokyo Drift!","review":"A fun sequel to Mario Kart 64.

No.- Is GC broadband compatibility worth $50? No.Face it, this game is not a sequel, it's an expansion pack. Moreover, single player is no fun at all.

The first was one of the most popular games on the Super Nintendo. The second was an early Nintendo 64 game and the third came out on Gameboy Advance a couple of years ago.

The tracks aren't quite as Good as the other Mario Kart games, like Mario Kart 64. The graphics and sound are really nice, but could be slightly improved. Unlike most Mario Kart games, your skill can always overcome items thrown at you, you just have to be really good at the game. That is a major plus for this game. In conclusion, everything except the tracks to race on (they're still pretty good) is of excellent quality. I rate this game 91.5/100."},{"rating":"2","title":"best kart game i've played","review":"this game's multiplayer mode is just as good as it's inidividual mode. this is the best gamecube game i've played not to mention i've always been a mario kart fan. i loved all of the courses and the fact that you can add a partner is bloody brilliant. i honestly didn't think i'd like this game as much as a did. it separates itself from mario kart 64 but it still stays true to what mario kart is about. once you beat a cup you win a new kart. the fact that you can even choose different karts... i am amazed at the brillance of this game! if i were you and i wanted a great multiplayer game i'd go out and buy this game now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't understand why people don't like it","review":"Mario Kart: Double Dash....While it's not Mario Kart 64, and it takes a few hours to completly get used to the control (hell, the sliding system is more difficult to use properly than 64's incarnation of the move), but I like a lot of the game. The levels, for the most part, are pretty fun. The weapon system, while cheap sometimes (whenever I am doing very well, they will whip out the Blue Shell on me...) is a very cool addition.Another fun part is trying to find a decent team that works for you. I am quite fond of Toadette and Paratrooper in Toad's Kart.And the multiplayer levels aren't that fun until you unlock the Luigi's Mansion or Tilt level (can be VERY intense when in the heat of the moment). I'd like it if you could edit how many balloons you had, but that's only a minor detail at this point.All in all, it is a VERY well done game, with beautiful visuals, and impressive overall gameplay experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Kart Double Dash Is By Far The Best Racing Game Ever!!","review":"Awesome!

Not only is it not good, it's actually BAD. It's downright annoying and painful like someone just randomly strung a bunch of notes together and called it a day. I honestly can't get over how terrible it is. There's also so much crap in the peripherals of the screen that you can barely see half the course! I wish they'd give you the option to turn that stuff OFF. The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because some of the levels have nice graphics. But who cares!

Yes, I did pay 50 dollars for this game which is a little much for me, but if you find this game cheaper then I enthusiastically advise you to buy it. And that doesn't mean that I'm not advising it to you if the cheapest you can find it for is 50 because it's still a great buy. The only reason that this game isn't perfect is because you get bored of it after a while but I'm sure to play it again.

But just because of Mario and those cute Nintendo characters, I bought a gamecube with Mario Kart. My first impression was \\"what a simple game it is!\\" . But as I played the game more and more, I just got addicted to the game and finally I found myself angry and shouting in a saturday night becasue I didn't win a race due to that Donkey Kong and Bowser pair. If you never played this kind of game before, I highly recommend this game. It's very funny to play alone and also multi-player mode is 3 times funnier.The only missing point is it's too short and too simple(but still it's gonna take more than a month to unlock the hidden map.). I hope next time Nintendo will come out with just a little more sophiscated Double Dash with more maps.BTW, the last rainbow racing course is beautiful and the jazzy game soundtrack is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"ok, i wanted to like this game. i almost liked it for about 1 minute, and then it got sooooo boring. i was ready to return it after 5 minutes.

The batteling arena is very small, and the only enjoyable (Which saved this game from 1 star overall) batteling segment is where you throw bombs at each other.- The replay isn't good.

Hopefully i can do as much as is in my power to ease the life's lesson on my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Waste of Money","review":"This video was very dissapointing. I was expecting a fairly high quality lesson from a fairly intelligent teacher. Boy was I wrong. Its filmed with a camcorder in some stoners garage. Hardly worth the twenty bucks I paid for it. One of the most annoying things is that he never tells you the names of songs so half the time you don't know what you're playing. And, it only teaches you short little licks that arent really too useful. I can't imagine anybody saying: \\"Hey, I can play five seconds of a seven minute song! Cool!\\" This guy isn't even a great guitarist. Many of the things he plays are innacurate, uses slides when none are used, and his timing is terrible. He's also a bad teacher. Personally, seeing someone play something, then seeing him play it again only closer and slower(again with bad timing)doesn't really teach me anything. Anyway, I think that you get the idea that this video is a piece of crap. So whatever you do, DON'T BUY THIS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the style of Pink Floyd","review":"Quite a sorry display, I thought...

Curtis Mitchell shows you only a few licks of many different songs, leaving the player lost in learning the rest of the songs.

He shows only a few licks from the vast collection of Floyd songs and the licks that he shows are also not played like the original. They are played with the worst variation that Curt could probably think of.

It came without the tabulature (if you can call it that) yet I still found it as equally worthless as the Beatles Curt Mitchell tape I have WITH the tabulature. Hes not fooling anyone with his lavish box with no picture of the band and EXTREME CLOSEUPS in bold print. This basement tape was most likely made for under $100. As you know he refers to the songs as \\"Riff 1, 2\\" ect. Its as if he is avoiding the songs name and playing just a few measures to avoid copyright laws. I have many favorite parts such as \\"Its a late 60s stratocastor, actually I dont know what year it is?\\" he says with that pateneted Curt Mitchell Dumb stare. He is poorly groomed and to be honest quite pathetic. Yet again my high hopes were dashed by the best 3 second riff player ever, CURT MITCHELL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for the Money","review":"Some reviewers want a $10,000 education in a music tape...this is not it.

What happened? Well, an earthquake (of decidedly magical origin) swept over all, and the place became a symbol of hopelessness and treachery. Needless to say, the brave adventurers aren't told the whole story... and once they find themselves underwater, facing seawolves, sahuagin, sharks, and worse, they'll learn the horrid truth when it's least inviting! If you enjoy watching your players desperately think their way out of the worst of predicaments, you'll enjoy unleashing this one on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Soccer Game Ever","review":"This game is terrible. The difference in difficulties is way too drastic, you either win 16-0 or every game is 0-0. Also when on offense you cannot manuver through tackles, either you avoid the defense or you don't score. If you like to look at pretty stadiums then buy this game if you want a good game go for Winning Elevin 6 or 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"this game sucks. it's so unrealistic. there are specific locations on the field and you know that 9 out of 10 times you are going to score from these locations. also after a member of your team passes the ball he stops for like a second; so if it was a bad pass and your opponent intercepts the ball, you cannot use that guy to get the ball back from him. there are so many small things like this that are so annoying. another example: you cannot go near the goalie when he is kicking the ball. And also the announcer's words are exactly the same as it was in FIFA 2003 which was terrible. I just wish that they really work on FIFA2005 and I really would like to see a FIFA Street game. That would be awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor, and rent this first!!","review":"I absolutely loved FIFA 2003 and was eagerly anticipating this one, all I can say is, what were they thinking?? The single aspect of this that drives me F*@%ING crazy is player speed, it is considerably slower than '2003, and has literally ruined this game for me, the players look as though they are out for a jog in the park! the smartest decision I made was to rent it first.

However, there is no World Cup in the tournaments which is pretty weak! EA Sports should add Holland and Japan to the national league. Otherwise, good graphics, alright gameplay, awesome career mode!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad :-(","review":"Bad, bad, bad. Not worth the money. It seems that each edition of FIFA is worse than its predecessor. EA Sports should focus on game-play and graphics rather than on graphics alone. In FIFA 2004 the players are sluggish, the passes slow, and the off-the-ball command is horrible. On top of that, the online version of the game doesn't work properly. All together, I'd say that the release of FIFA 2004 was a big disappointment, which is very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely TERRIBLE.","review":"I don't think this game even deserves one star. This is by the far the worst soccer game I have EVER played in my life. The controls get worse every year, the gameplay slows down every year, the realism was non-existant 5 years ago in FIFA and ceases to exist now. Everyone who gave this game 4 or 5 stars know absolutely NOTHING about soccer. This is the last time I have bought an EA soccer game. I wish I lived in Europe where they have a lot more realistic soccer (football) games. Europeans rule! If they were the ones behind the production of this game, I gaurantee that it would be a masterpiece. I'm getting rid of this nonsense tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest","review":"I've bought and played many soccer games and this is the best. I have bought most of the other Fifa soccer games but this outdoes them all. The buying and seling of players is a real winner It is a great game for soccer lovers like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"baffling...","review":"this is a real step backwards from the 2003 version, which was tough, but manageable. I don't mind difficulty, but the difficulty isn't realistic. Scoring should be harder than it was in 2003, but I can't figure out how I can have Ronaldo with 2 steps on a 3rd division defender and get caught from behind every time. The \\"freestyle\\" move is worthless, so you've got the greatest stars in the world and no ability to beat a lead-footed defender one on one. Off the ball control is unusable, as by the time you coordinate everything, you've surely lost the ball. The career mode is way too involved for someone who just wants to play a season and I can't imagine why FIFA can't have a World Cup or Champions League-type tournament. I'm sorely disappointed. No wonder Americans hate soccer - they've managed to even make its video game boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAME DOESN'T DELIVER ON IT's PROMISE","review":"I bought the game mostly for the online play. I thought that would be in itself a good enough reason to buy it. Since over the years I have enjoyed playing FIFA from EASports. Saying that, the online experice stinks. Hard to connect to players, there's always a lag, and it seems that EASports doesn't care about it's customers when it comes to the FIFA game. It seems that this problem also affected Tiger Woods golf, but it was fixed right away.I'm also a fan of Winning 11, and now more then ever. Can't wait for the latest version coming our next year in the States. And will no longer buy FIFA from EAsports. I've been a fan since the beginning, and will no longer be since they don't care about me."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad game","review":"I have been a fifa player since 98 and must say without a doubt that this is the worst version yet. The controls are so slow I thought there was something wrong with the game. The players are not responsive as in 03. The crowds are great, the graphics are cool, practice mode is long over do. I bought this game on blind faith because ea has never let me down. I am very disappointed with this version and am getting rid of it ASAP. I was really trying to like it but couldn't. It's like they rushed it out without proper testing. There is no flow to the game, the players seem like they are stuck in mud. Don't waste your money on this game, 2003 is still the best version yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Rubbish","review":"Wish people would try games before writing reviews. This is an utter waste of 40 quid. So its got the licences but what about gameplay? The controls are so unresponsive I thought the cmputer was playing itself. Unforgiveable slow down at critical moments, replays that often show no ball (or players). It crashed twice within ten minutes. A career mode that lasts only 5 years. Eh?. Most British teams have been going for 50 - 100 yrs. And I can still beat Brazil 7-0 in the first half when I'm playing as Scotland. Is one star the minimum I can give?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!!!","review":"OK, i'm not one to jump on any bandwagon but I have to agree with alot of people in saying that KONOMI'S Winning Eleven series just beats out EA SPORTS and has the better footbol (or Futbol, that is) game. Thats not to say that Fifa should be easily passed by. I found the game actually pretty good and realistic to the game. The new controls are a little confusing and sometimes dont work in my opinion. Graphics are great as usual, and so is the sound. But Winning Eleven 6 just has the edge though with exciting quick matches, great on-the-pitch gameplay and endless options. Fifa 2004 is good but Winning Eleven comes out on top still."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fifa will always be a runner up!","review":"As long as games such as winning eleven 6 (or in europe: int.super star soccer pro evolution 3)exist there is no way for this game to sell.

Especially with three of some of my favorite players in the world on the cover and with Madden '04 being better than Madden '03, i expected something better than at least any Fifa game before '03. I mean EA Sports could've came out with soccer game more fun to play. I guess I'll stick to '03 which is more user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way cool","review":"I got it yesterday. Spent six hours with it. The game is much more realistic now than ever, particularly from the defensive side of things. You can actually produce clean sheets consistently with this, unlike FIFA 2003. Many of the features like the end-to-end camera with zoom and height controls have returned from FIFA 2002 which were missing in FIFA 2003.The play is realistic. The UI still stinks (hence the missing star.) It is confusing sometimes. \\"Waiting for Away Team.\\" Still have not figured out how to get the away team to show up! But the career feature is great! You actually get to earn money, and prestige (not sure what that means yet, but sounds interesting.) By earning money for your budget means you can improve your club over the long haul. In FIFA 2003, you were give X amount of dollars, and that was it. This makes it more interesting.Hopefully Hull City will extend my contract next season after I get them out of the third division."},{"rating":"1","title":"It deserve a 0.. a total dissapoint, Buy Winning Eleven 7!!!","review":"What they produce it's not soccer!!!, I bought fifa 2004 just for the online play, (another disappointment the online gameplay) but just like others fifa's games, a complete dissapoint. It's seems like your game it's a merge of soccer and NFL, NOT soccer at all. Everyone who played real soccer... at least once in it's life, could tell you that fifa series it's not soccer, or it's what EA team think soccer it's.. or should be, but not way of play. Fifa have good grafics, but you don't feel the emotion of the soccer seen graphics, soccer it's passion, not graphics and tactics of NFL games. I won't purchase any fifa game ever!. See what Winning eleven 6 or 7 does, or Word tour soccer 2005 does whith the gameplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another year, another lame FIFA","review":"and another attempt by EA to take our money wowing us with eye candy while trying to slip by us the fact that this is essentially the same garbage as last year. Off the ball control is unusable and a joke, there is no difference neither among players nor among teams, as you can take on Real Madrid with Yeovil and dominate, for example.

I PLAY SOCCER EVERY WEEK-END AND WHEN I AM NOT IN THE FIELD PLAYING, I QUICKLY IMMERSE MYSELF INTO THE GAME. IT IS AS IF I WAS PLAYING IT LIVE. A FRIEND OF MINE CAME TO VISIT ME ONE DAY.

The songs are long and based on traditional rara beats from the voudoun religion brought over from West Africa. This is Hatian roots (\\"racines\\") music and once you hear it you will be hooked. Songs here like Ke'm pa sote and Se Kreyol Nou Ye revived Haitian music and culture by simply revelling in it. Gone was the slick production of the Kompa records and the allure of cosmopolitan expatriation, Boukman Eksperyans with Voudou Adjae created a new earthy, natural and (unavoidably) political brew. The rhythms are infectious, the melodies are sublime, the lyrics poignent and the politics downright heady. After more than 15 years it is still a joy to rediscover.

The few but very well chosen topics and the straightforward yet deep way they are covered make the book engaging, thought provoking, and easily followed by upper level undergrads and beginning grad students.

Within a day or so noticed soreness in joints of hands and knees. I have a sensitivity to nightshade family and especially tomatoes.The source of the high dose of lycopene in these vitamins is tomatoes. I took a few days to trace the source of inflammation to the the vitamins but was glad upon discovering the link.

I will note that they are supposed to be gentle on your stomach, but i get sick if I don't take it with food. That might just be my sensitive stomach and not the pills fault. Not a big deal since I usually take it at night after dinner. I do appreciate the all natural aspect of the pills. The price on amazon is fantastic (as it almost always is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but you have to get use to the taste","review":"These vitamins are very good. I cannot drink coffee because my stomach problems so this gives me some energy similar to the hot drink I guess is from the load of B Complex. It also has probiotics which is good for the stomach. Vegetable juice complex, and Men's Strengthening blend. They are also naturals. The only bad thing is that they taste bitter, but if you take them fast it's OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wish I had purchased a small bottle instead of 150. I hate the smell . . . trying to figure out a way to get them ingested each day without smelling them. Purchased them because they are not suppose to upset your stomach . . . not true . . . I can count on an upset stomach about half the time. Will not get them again once they are finished. And I am sure no one wants to hear about the yellow urine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't give me energy","review":"I think these vitamins are really doing their job, because (and sorry if this is TMI) when I urinate after taking these vitamins, the urine is a bright neon yellow, which means that your body has been able to absorb nutrients. The only letdown is that these vitamins do NOT give me energy like they say they do.UPDATE: I don't know if the formula has changed or what, but with the most recent bottle I bought, each time I take these vitamins I feel EXHAUSTED within about an hour. These vitamins never did give my energy like it claims, but for them to make me exhausted now is just ridiculous. I've tried just taking them at bedtime, but even then I feel groggy in the morning. I hate to throw out the remaining vitamins but each time I take them I'm wiped out and I've had enough. I will not be buying them again. And if you think it's \\"all in my head\\", read some of the other 1 and 2 star reviews that say the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Men's Natural Multi Vitamin Available-Rainbow Light","review":"Rainbow Light Men's multi vitamin is packed with essential natural ingredients.

I would definitely recommend this and very good value as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me nausea","review":"Most vitamins and meds don't mess up my stomach. The only way this didn't mess up my stomach was if I was completely full. A glass of milk or a small breakfast wasn't ever enough.

Their prenatal vitamins were good but not these."},{"rating":"2","title":"All natural and mostly complete","review":"Overall, I like this vitamin. I like it being natural and it has a host of ingredients a lot of others leave out. Like mentioned elsewhere though, don't take it on an empty stomach. I've learned to take it after eating my breakfast. It also doesn't taste very good and is a big pill, but that's all right. It's a small price to pay for a 100% natural product."},{"rating":"1","title":"careful with one of the ingredients","review":"Ok, first of all, this multivitamin is very complete, it even has things others don't, which is really good. the problem is that it has too much of some things. If you look at the ingredients, you'll see that these pills contain saw palmetto which is a plant used for prostate health. Some people claim it also helps hair regrowth. However, one of the side effects of it is that it can cause erectyle dysfunction! Believe me, I personally experienced this while taking these pills. I completely lost my sexual drive. In addition to that, it also caused insomnia! Do your own research and you'll confirm what I'm telling you. I could not even finish the bottle. Be careful with saw palmetto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source of viatamins for men","review":"This is the first time we have purchased Rainbow's Men's One Multivitamin, but my husband has already liked it so much! It took out his headaches and gave him a good source of energy. Since it is food based and has a VeganGuard sign, we do not have any concerns for animal products as well. Nice product, and would suggest everyone. The only drawback would be the size, but believe me it is still smaller than the Women's Just One, and also who cares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidney Stones","review":"I have had kidney stones in the past, but haven't had any in over a year.

I tried the dissolve test mentioned in another review. After a full hour in vinegar at ~100 deg F, the pill was not fully dissolved.

I will update my review if they do anything to remedy the dissolving problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my husband throw up...","review":"Twice. That's how we know it's them. Could be from the heat during transport since they are whole food vitamins. If so, we always pay more now to get probiotics and vitamins that have been kept cold during transit.

I had watched it immediately after coming back from a wonderful trip to New Orleans and was desiring something that would remind me of New Orleans. The acting in this movie was mediocre. What really made this movie not very enjoyable was the fact that the storyline was very hard to follow. Most murder mysteries are supposed to have their share of twists and turns, however this movie went way beyond that to the point of complete confusion. I gave this movie a 2 star rating because at least the New Orleans backdrop and the Cajun Zydeco music was nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless.... well, almost","review":"I have been a fan of this movie since I was a teenager. There are not enough words to describe what a great movie this is. It has everything: action, romance, and the right amount of humor to mix it together to make one hell of a Gumbo! The music and the location are exquiaite! My only complaint is how it ends. it's too abrupt. Other than that, you can't go wrong for a perfect \\"date night movie.\\" I did come across a clip on Youtube concerning a deleted scene that is apparently included in the European releases of the DVD. Not to spoil the ending but it takes place after the final shootout and the final scene. Added back in to the movie (can you say \\"extended cut\\" DVD?) would make more sense. I have watched this over and over, and have even got some of my friends introduced this classic. they sure don't make em like this anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't I find a man who will call ME \\"chere\\"?","review":"This is the perfect couple's movie. Guys will like the police action (chases, gunfire) and the mystery driving the plot. Women may like those elements too, but they'll surely be hot and bothered by Dennis Quaid's Remy McSwain, singing to Ellen Barkin's Anne Osborne and dancing sweetly with her even though she's \\"got a mad on\\". When she confesses that she's never had much luck with sex and he assures her that her luck's about to change...well, what woman's heart doesn't melt? Watch it with the one you love, then turn on some Cajun music and create your own steam heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"MPAA - Give us a break!","review":"This is a favorite midnight movie for my 30something generation. Problem is, this is only half the film it ought to be. There is an alternate version (which you might be able to track down if you have relatives living in Greece) which is a WHOLE LOT BETTER.Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin have a relationship that you care about, several odd continuity glitches suddenly make sense (once you realise what they had to cut out).DVD was made for putting movies that got hacked apart back together. Even if the missing parts just get offered as 'EXTRA MISSING SEQUENCES', they ought to be there - especially for Zone One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex in the City","review":"With these stars and N'awlins as a backdrop, what isn't to like? Quaid's accent is a bit suspect, but the music is great and the story keeps you involved from end to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steamy And Spicy!","review":"This is a terrifically original crime caper. Dennis Quaid gives his best performance as a corrupt but well-meaning cop. The underrated and extremely talented Ellen Barkin is also dynamite as the uptight DA assistant. The chemistry by Quaid and Barkin can light the screen on fire and they create on of the most attractive couples in movies. The plot is good, but it is the romance and comedy that leave the impact. Hilarious at times, great Cajun soundtrack. Good supporting cast with Ned Beatty and John Goodman as stand-outs. A Very good time. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Easy DVD","review":"Another movie I wanted for awhile. It is a great movie about New Orleans law and order. It is also a love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short changed","review":"This movie is so good that even cutting the hospital scene from the ending didn't ruin it. Didn't help it either. You really need to see Remy in that hospital gown! I've kept my VHS version until I can find a DVD version with the better ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I've never been to New Orleans, so I can't vouch for the accuracy of the film in that regard.

Very enjoyable to watch, keeps you guessing who the good guys might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action filled adventure!","review":"I read this book with my young nephew in mind and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it myself. There are word plays that will be over the heads of young children but keep adults entertained as they read. Three children stow away for a day's adventure but get more than they bargained for as they search for hidden treasure. Many lessons are learned - how to deal with a bully, the importance of teamwork, the value of friendship. The children visit a fortune teller, see a two headed monster, are given a treasure map and practice magic spells as they find their way home again. Characters take turns stepping forward in the story to help each other, each with a different area of strength. I particularly liked the way the girls were shown as strong characters. This is a quick and entertaining read, should fascinate both boys and girls around age eight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and exciting!","review":"I was familiar with the northern neck of Virginia and wanted to know more about Richard Henry Lee, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.

It states that Richard the Immigrant had a son William, aka Col. William C. Lee, that never married. Not true. He married Alice Felton in 1675 in Manchester, Hillsborough, New Hampshire, and had four children. 1) Richard Lee born abt. 1677 at Surry Co., VA. 2) Mary Lee 3) William Lee 4) John Lee. Our family comes from Richard Lee, son of Col. William C. Lee and Alice Felton. This information comes from multiple sources with slightly differing data, so it is not from all a single source, and easy to obtain. Alice died in 1675, and is possibly the daughter of Thomas Felton. I had hoped the history of the Lees of Virginia in this book is researched better than this, but maybe not. I probably will not trust it entirely. I certainly hope the rest of the history of the Lees is accurate in this book.Other sources state two other wives for William C. Lee as Ann and Mary. No children listed with those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Not Include Everything You Need!","review":"For parents or other gift-buyers like us, take note: This plane does not come with everything needed to fly.

It just takes much more of an investment than we initially counted on to get it into the air.You can find the completion package at Hobby Zone, but even that is not complete, as the receiver isn't part of that package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought provoking but too speculative","review":"This book may well be valuable to those with a keen interest in Julian of Norwich - provided it is not the first, or the only, work on the topic which they consult. All that is known certainly of Julian's life is that contained in her books, and Kenneth Leech, perhaps in an attempt to relate her work to the 20th century conditions, is rather too speculative. (Perhaps, once upon a time, it seemed important for some to believe Julian had been a Benedictine nun - but is it so important, now, that she had to have been a married lady? The fact is that we do not know even her true name.)Best not to place this on the shelf of anyone with an interest in Julian, unless it is one of at least five works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time learning a little part of a song!","review":"This guy teaches you only one lick from various Skynyrd songs. On average about 10 seconds of the song. That's great if you just want to be a show-off, but most people will want to hear the whole song. Why bother learning just a snippet. Infact you will have to be a pretty comptetent guitar player to learn anything from this DVD. The instructor goes fast and you have to have alot experience playing guitar to catch on. I watched it once and put it aside. I prefer to spend my effort to learn an entire song. Maybe if you know the whole song but just can't get that signature lick down this might help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"Wow this is bad, I'm not the best player, but they could at least get the notes that he plays to match the tab.

Great for gate check!","review":"I bought this bag to protect my Chicco Keyfit 30 snap-n-go stroller and carseat when gate checking. The two items both fit in the large bag together (snuggly), which was great! We practiced beforehand to make sure, and we figured it out so that we didn't even have to remove any wheels or anything. The bag isn't padded at all, so I probably wouldn't feel comfortable checking it all the way through, but it did it's job for the gate check! I read previous reviews and removed the shoulder strap, but the handles made it easy to carry down the jetway without issue. The bag held up well both ways of our trip, and we will definitely be using it again in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not make it through one leg of a plane trip","review":"I recently purchased this bag for a trip to Florida. We gate-checked the stroller and car seat in this bag. When we arrived to Baltimore to change planes the bag already had huge holes in it.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulky but does the job.","review":"This is a HUGE, heavy duty, black stroller travel bag which does the job it's meant to do; however, with a baby in tow it requires two persons to properly place the stroller inside the bag and close the zipper. There's room around the stroller to add other items if you don't mind the items coming into contact with dirty stroller wheels. I'd recommend this only for full size strollers and not for umbrella-type strollers; you can probably easily fit two umbrella-type strollers inside this very large bag. It offers very good protection for the stroller and cuts down on the possibility of contamination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with BOB stroller","review":"We used this bag for our BOB single stroller on a recent flight. It is a big bag made of a medium strength holdall material. There is no padding in it so it won't protect from hard knocks but will protect against general abrasion or wear and tear i.e. it will protect the fabric of the stroller but not the frame. It worked well for us on this flight so fingers crossed for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Airline Travel","review":"I purchased this item for our trip to Disneyland.

My toddler isn't a frequent flyer, so the $$$ bag seemed like overkill.This one did the job. The construction is fine for an occasionally-used bag. I figure, you don't want something too rugged or it will be a pain to drag through the airport. This one collapsed down enough that I could stuff it under the stroller for rolling through the airport (along with a bunch of other stuff), and the we were able to fit the stroller (we had to take off 1 wheel) in there with plenty of room to spare. Room enough for me to sneak a pack of diapers in there too, actually. Heh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for the price, but....","review":"This bag did not last one leg of a trip from CA to HI though it got my expensive stroller there in one piece (so I guess it did its job).

Thanks so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for air travel","review":"I got this for use to hold the stroller on the airplane. The zipper was messed up when I opened the package.

I wish the sides or maybe just the bottom were hard, but for what I want it for, I think it will be just fine. All in all, I like it.*** Update! ***The shoulder strap broke during our first flight using it. We just used it to carry it from the gate to the plane and vice versa.

It will fit (with both seats in) with plenty of room left. We mean to check it plane-side on a trip next week. I may add a few paddings (yes, room for paddings) and a luggage strap in side so the stroller doesn't come undone by accident. It's a near 40lb stroller, probably needs a fragile tag on it as well.

Their newer stuff is more like Dying Fetus, not necessarily a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Groundbreaking effort","review":"One of a hanful of certified classics, this LP forever changed deathmetal, and spawned a countless number of similar sounding bands, all trying to copy Internal Bleeding's patented sludge filled riff-o-mania."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lord, this sucks","review":"When I rented Disney's Hide and Sneak, I wasn't expecting much. However, I did not expect it to suck this much.The first problem you will probably notice is how boring the gameplay is. There are a few puzzles that a braindead person could beat, and there are stealth parts that nobody can lose at.The only good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics and sound is OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midsomer Geek","review":"It continues to be a very entertaining series.

The price for two discs and only 4 cases was a bit on the expensive side. I have the first year and you received a lot more discs and cases.

This one brings one step closer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as expected.","review":"As i have written several reviews for this series, i will say first, i will continue to collect them until i have them all because they continue to impress me and dumbfounded me. That is, out of 36 hour and half shows, i've have only come close to knowing who the crimal was three times, and i am someone the pays attention to every detail including whether or not the shadow matches the clock.The other is that to my surprise but not disappointment, they occasional throw in a zinger like 'maybe ghosts are real'. i would normally take a dim view of such, but since it is a rare ocurance and a brief snippet, I find it acceptable. It certainly doesn't detract from the fact that this is the best mystery show i have seem yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mystery Series","review":"I will really miss John Nettles as Inspector Barnaby.

We enjoy the \\"Britishness\\" of the language and are saddened that John Nettles won't be on many more. I understand they'll get a new chief and go on .. I'm sure we'll be right there. It's a drag to wait for something that's already available in Britain, but then again, it gives us something to look forward to. Good luck to John on pursuits in the twilight of his career!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Question","review":"While the crimes stories are always disturbing, we buy this show for the quality of the production in general. The scenery is beautiful and the stories are usually very interesting and the relationships somewhat funny. It just isn't your average crime story. I don't know weather to buy any further sets of this show or not. I found sets # 16 & # 17 to be very gory when compared to most of the previous sets. The gore overshadows the otherwise quality production at this point. Just because a crime is committed doesn't mean that they have to film every last drop of blood. If I wanted all of that and more, I could just watch Law and Order SVU. My question is, does the relentless gore continue in set 18 and beyond?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Rare Stokowski","review":"These recordings are truly rarities. The originals were made for the now defunct United Artists label. Some years ago the master tapes were purchased by Angel Records (USA) and languished in their vaults for many years. With pressure exerted by individuals and the Leopold Stokowski Society of America, this set was finally released. Many of these pieces were never recorded by the Maestro at any other time. In my opinion, the gem in the set is the Shostakovich Symphony # 1. At the time of its original release it was hailed as the best recorded performance ever of this piece. I have never found another I like better. It is superb. Stokowski also brings out the very best in all the other numbers as well. It is an outstanding testament to the man and to a great orchestra. These recordings may never be released again. Get this set now while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff","review":"This works great and is a nice light scent, I have allergies to scents, but this one is not strong at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for non-professionals as well","review":"I am not a professional masseuse,but I like to give massages to the women in my life.They all love it and usually request that I bring this with me.

Everyone has different musical taste, and just because you dont like it doesnt mean other people cant. Whatever Blink-182 is (music genre-wise), I love all of their music. Now on to the review. Great song-writing, Great instruments, Great vocals (Tom can get kind of annoying after a while...). Overall great CD: Stand out tracks: Pathetic, Dammit, Waggy, Untitled, Apple Shampoo, Emo, Josie, and A New Hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"Someone not giving this band 5 stars is out of there mind.

Theres only one reason that this did not get 5 stars. Alot of the songs sound too much alike. Some good tracks are Dammit, Josie, Pathetic and Apple Shampoo. If you like bands like Sugar Ray or Offspring you will probably enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album f***ing rules!","review":"My friend told me about Blink two years ago. I bought it that day and have been listening to it ever since. They are not just another three chord band like most today. Their lyrics have a lot of purpose and meaning.

The songs are original, filled with kicking riffs, and hard drums. Personal Favorites: Dammit, Josie, Apple Shampoo, Pathetic. If Green Day and Offspring are up your alley, get some B 182. If you like Dude Ranch, make sure you check out Chesire Cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great CD!","review":"Ive had this CD for a long time now and I am not bored with it.

The music is great and so are the band. I love punk and I think more teenyboppers should listen to this. The music is high energy and fast pace.

I thought this would be a good cd. When i got it i was very disapointed. The songs just dont sound musical. The way they picked the chords its more noise than music. The lead singer's voice is kind of annoying too. The only song i like is Damnit (growing up). Don't spend your money on this.. it will give you a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"this is a great CD, I like Enema of the State a lot more but this is still a good one. Dammit, Degenerate and Josie are my favorite songs. this CD has a lot more between tracks comedy, and its a good one so get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly Bad","review":"I like punk, so when i got this for a mere 4 dollors i figured it would be worth it. The only advantage the blink-182 has is that they are mainstream and easy to find. But there are good punk bands that are easy to find too. Take MxPx NOFX for example. But to go back to a normal subject... blink-182 is simply obnoxious, you can stand it the first listen or two, but after that you just want to puke. Avoid this and all blink 182 stuff, i suggest... Suicide Machines, Propagandhi, Digger or MxPx. Buy them, no blink-182!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They had it . . . until some mula $ was waved in their faces","review":"I'm browsing around the cd store, checkin out some new punk bands, and I stumble across Blink 182's first album, Cheshier Cat. \\"I'll have to try this out\\", I thought to myself. I listened to it on the way home, and loved it. Already I was seeing big things ahead for this band. When I heard they were coming out with a new cd, I was first in line to get it.I was sorely dissappointed.This is living proof of what a band is willing to do for money. They completly changed their sound, they lost their \\"edge\\". Now you're seeing them on MTV and in movies.This is sellout material if I've ever seen it. They had the potential to be one of the best punk bands around, but they decided to come out with this junk and turn our music into a mainstream mocary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Music","review":"Punk I can respect: Sex Pistols, Dead Kennedys, maybe even Living End or something new. But this one is really, really simple, mindless and bad. maybe that's why people like it. But the fact is I don't. So ONE STAR (pity I couldn't give it a zero star). Lucky it's my brothers CD.

A New Hope)In fact, all of the songs on the CD are good if you think about it, except tracks 2 and 13 which are kinda corny, because knowing Tom DeLonge's high annoying voice he can sometimes get carriedaway! So 13 of the 15 songs on the album are good I have to still give props to Blink for this album nice job guys!- Blinkdog"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest cd!!","review":"This is the best cd ever!!

They don't know how good Mark sings, how FINE Tom is, or how many peircings Travis has. I think that Blink's next album chould show there true punkifunkiness.

It's a much better, punkier CD than Enema and you should stick to the popular stuff.If your buying this CD because you like Punk, or because you like the older Blink stuff then get this CD for sure. I own all Blink 182's CDs and Dude Ranch is easily the best. It's loud punk, it's funny, it is just a GREAT CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink's last great album","review":"I bought this album in 1997 and couldn't believe how great it was, I've never been able to deny that this has to be one of the best albums i have ever bought.Blink suck now and could care less about making a half way decent album. Enema of the state is good but super slow in comparison to this album. They must hae given in to the pressure of being a punk band on a major label. There is not one bad song on this album except for maybe Dick lips and thats not even too bad it just gets annoying after a while, This was Blink's third album and they basically did a great job on it if your not a big fan of Blink now I can totally understand but 5 years ago Blink was the new Green day. Thank god that Green day is back to being Green day again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink-182 Dude Ranch","review":"This album is good becuase all the songs are equally good. It was the last album with the drummer, Scott \\"Mad Dog\\" Raynor. Though Scott was a good member of the band, the drumming was not up to his full ability like in other albums. This album is better than Chesrire Cat. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard skaterock.","review":"There isn't anything particularly wrong with this music, but I have a problem with people labeling this sort of stuff as \\"punk\\". Blink have no message, and with all their guitar wankery they end up sounding like a cheeseball Van Halen cover band trying to play pop punk. Blink really aren't much different from most other newschool bands, so anyone who hates this band for \\"selling out\\", yet listens to Lagwagon and MxPx, is an idiot. Check it out if you're into super-happy-go-lucky newschool skaterock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Radio Friendly For Me","review":"This album is just to poppy in a radio friendly way for me to enjoy it.

No rules, going against the norm, and most of all..original. This, is the exact opposite. The whole album has the same bass lines and drum beat with slight variations from song to song. Also, it sounds like every other modern punk album out there (i.e., mxpx, nofx, etc.). Everytime i hear this album i get a headache. And if you don't take my advice, and decide to purchase this album anyways, please do your friends and family a favor, and listen to this album on headphones so the rest of the world won't have to hear this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH HELL YEAH","review":"THIS IS THE BEST ALBUN I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO. THEY ARE MORE THAN JUST THREE CORDS LIKE OFFSPRING AND OTHER PUNK BANDS AND THE USE OF CYMBALS, DRUM ROLLS, AND OTHER STUFF IS GREAT. THEY SING SONGS WITH MEANING TOO. I HAVENT GOTTEN SICK OF THE ALBUM YET, I HAVE HAD IT ABOUT A YEAR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Indy Pop-Punk","review":"This album is Blink 182's best album simply because they stick to their original indy-label style. \\"Dammit\\" and \\"Waggy\\" sound more like their newer stuff, while everything else sounds more punk-ish. But the last cut scene thing at the end of the last song is a VERY cheap rip off od Adam Sandler's \\"World's Longest Pee\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"Dude Ranch is definitely the best album I've heard by Blink 182. The combination of songs on this album is great. Mark's vocals are great when Tom is playing the guitar, especially in my favorite song, Dammit. The bottom line is, if you're looking for the best Blink 182 album, get Dude Ranch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOT Better than Enema","review":"Yes, Enema of the State was good, but it simply does not compare to Blink's earlier release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest album of the decade","review":"Blink 182 has made some of the greatest music ever, and this is defenitely the album to prove it.

They were fresh, young, and full of energy. And Dude Ranch is proof of that. Go out and buy this CD now!

Just go out and buy it!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOA!!!","review":"Possibly one of the greatest full-length albums to just sit back and chill to. I really enjoyed this album at its fullest. Favorite tracks include Enthused, Josie, and Waggy. I listen to this CD and I start to feel good about anything. The simplicity of the songs and catchy choruses really make this album one of my personal favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This cd didn't eally change my opinion of blink 182, i still think that Travis is a better drummer. Anyway, most people say that \\"Dammit\\" \\"Dick Lips\\" \\"Apple Shampoo\\" and \\"Josie\\" are the best songs on Dude ranch, and they are very good, but i think that three songs were overlooked, i my opinion. \\"Pathetic\\" is really good, and i'm used to the version on the Tom Mark and Travis show so this one was a surprise. The other two are \\"Voyeur\\" (my personal favorite) and \\"Boring\\", which reminds me of Greenday's song F.O.D. (around the middle part of it.... the beginning of F.O.D. is slow). all in all, this is probably one of the best blink 182 cds, although their new one hasnt come out yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good....","review":"Alright, this is Blink-182 second album, pretty much the album that sent them to fame, mainly because of the song \\"Dammit\\". Other than the song \\"Dammit\\" there are many good songs, even great ones.The album blasts off into \\"Pathetic\\", a really fast but melodic song, I really liked this one. Then \\"Voyeur\\" kicks in, this one is really good too, well all the songs on the album are good. Then you have the hit \\"Dammit\\", I actually really liked this song, the lyrics are cool and song isn't what you would call forgettable.That is pretty much the album, every song is really good, even though I only went into about 3 songs, and those songs don't really sum up what the album is, their some of the best songs on the album. Other hits on the album include \\"Dick Lips\\", \\"Apple Smampoo\\" and Josie (the other single on the album besides \\"Dammit\\".So yeah if your'e into punk rock, or pop punk, or music that has funny lyrics, you'll love this. Go check it out, really it's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"early work","review":"Much better than more of their later more mainstream work, this disc has great drum beats and fun lyrics.

They've got the chops (their playing is always competent, and occasionally impressive), they show a rare glmpse at good songwriting, and they can bring it all together (as they show quite well on \\"Dammit\\"). But they don't do it enough - too many of the songs run together in the generic \\"I'm not OK\\"/\\"you're not OK\\"/\\"he's not OK\\"/\\"the world's not OK\\" mode written from a teen angst point of view, which can get just as boring as the Backstreet Boys \\"you know I love you, girl\\" mode. I wouldn't bother reviewing this except songs like \\"Dammit\\" make it clear that they can do it so much better. This one's best suited for 14-year-old pre-punks of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the #1 cd of '97.

Well, this cd made blink the main event of the Warped Tour but this year they weren't in it which subtly means all other bands and punk authorities are kicking them off the bandwagon. but if you want great guitars, awesome bass, and great drums fitting perfectly together in a great package with the lyrics, this is the only cd from blink that will that to you. i have their live album too and they play some songs from this cd and sound awesome!!

This is paint by numbers buoyant teenage pop music with guitars.When I go on a discourse about how 'blink 182' are an abomination the argument associated with dude ranch is \\"well it was before they were popular\\". HA. popular or not, \\"dude ranch\\" is the same diluted boy band + instruments who put out \\"the rock show\\" and \\"all the small things\\". stop fooling yourselves, kiddies. their musical basis is rehashing the same melody and ear piercing vocal hook over and over again at different tempo and with different wordsthis album is lame, and this bands moronic fans are lame"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's good - but it aint that good","review":"I bought this having heard friends rave about it but since 'enemy of the state' was released it has stayed on the shelf. This album doesn't really compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn it","review":"This is the epitome of a bad album. I won't even try to even convince you that this is bad seeing how everyone else on here seems to love it. Every song pretty much sounds the same. Sometimes that's good but in the case it gets tiring listening to some guy sing like some kid who just hit puberty. About the only song that can be called GOOD is \\"Josie\\". But only because it's a cute song about how some guys feel about their girlfriends."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS BAD PUNK ROCK","review":"For all of you who may think that Blink 182 is a great and original punk band, you're wrong. Without Green Day they would be nothing. Who do you think paved the way for them to become so popular? Their sound rips off Green Day and makes it more poppy. And they're not funny either. Just compare the two bands live and then you will be able to tell what is real punk rock and what is merely an imitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"paint easily comes off this toy","review":"Normally I am 100% satisfied with all the Sassy toys I have purchased, but this one I am not happy with. I found after several months of play, the paint on the fish has come off. As babies put everything in their mouth, the paint peel can be very problematic. I ended up throwing the fish away. The paint on the butt of the net has faded slightly, but has not literally peeled off as has happened with the fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT NET","review":"My daughter loves this net. She uses it in the tub everytime she takes a bath. The fish do not however appeal to her as much as some of the other toy fish we have so they go unplayed with. That being said the net alone was worth the money for as much play as she has gotten out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I disagree with marsneptune, who only gave this 2 stars. I think this is a fantastic album...I'd say it sounds exactly like what would happen if Brian Eno and syd Barrett produced a Warren Zevon album, or if Joe Walsh had Pink Floyd backing him: a beautiful blend of folksy simplicity with incredibly tasteful and brilliant production, moving vocals, intelligent lyrics. It's right up there with \\"Another Green World\\" in my book, and that's saying a whole heapum lot.This album will definitely appeal to fans of early Roxy Music, Bowie, or rock musicals like Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Rocky Horror, and Velvet Goldmine. An essential document of the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previously Unreleased, probably for legitimate reasons","review":"Though the musicianship is facile, this album doesn't have the same power to wrap around the brain stem that his other solo albums have.

It has a totally different style from ordinary Japanese monster movies such as \\"Godzilla\\" or \\"Gamera.\\" A maniac soldier in combat suite VS 50 feet space monsters! This is wired, but interesting attempt. I was really entertained. In the movie, 3 different monsters show up in each 3 episodes. A poor businessman transforms into green gigantic reptile creature in episode1. In episode2, combat suite fights against giant chicken monster. It was very funny image, but why chicken? In episode3, the evil space power possesses onto another combat suit, and it creates a bio-mechanical monster. I enjoyed a variety of monsters. Somehow it reminds me old dynamation creatures which created by Ray Harryhausen. This is dark, but still funny movie. I can't wait to see next episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch - very ouch...","review":"I tell you what folks - I love Godzilla and Specterman as much as the next guy, but this is just brutal. There's no real good guy, everyone is just varying degrees of evil. We have the battlesuit pilot; a drunken, chilly and abusive bastard. The mechanic, who's not a bad guy, but is constantly being wailed on by the aforementioned pilot. And of course, the monsters - an alien substance causes normal people to mutate into odd creatures, including a 50-foot chicken. Yes, he said CHICKEN! With no really likeable characters, and special effects that would make the crew of Dr. Who groan, this was mostly a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"its just terrible","review":"im not even gonna waste my time with a full review its just terrible.please dont waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"This book will almost get you further than the text book itself.

I searched for the text, and ensured it was the correct edition. There was an option provided by Amazon to add the workbook, which I also wanted. However, the workbook was for the previous version of the text, and I wasn't paying attention for the differences. At the time of this review Amazon did not offer the current version of the workbook, but other sellers had it available.

It was in good condition and packaged well. However it was nearly two weeks late due to problems with a backorder of the book. Plus, there was no picture of the book online, which had some hand in the ordering of the wrong edition. I don't blame Amazon.com for sending the wrong edition, because I clearly ordered it.

I got a class set (30) of these dictionaries. If you will use them just to look up a words, they are fine. However, if you want to teach your students how to find out the conjugated forms of irregular verbs, this is the worse dictionary! The irregular list of verbs has a HUGE mistake. It lists the \\"Pres Ind\\" twice. So instead of the \\"Past Ind\\", the dictionary has another \\"Pres Ind\\". My students have to guess what forms belong to the present or the preterit. Even the \\"Pres Ind\\" is used for verbs that are only irregular in the preterit! I called Amazon when I found out this mistake (one of my students did) but the customer representative couldn't help me because I already had written my name on all the dictionaries. No a good experience at all!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Actually, I'd probably give this 3.5 stars. While you're taking the ride of reading \\"Fortune's Daughter\\" it is great, but the end leaves something to be desired. It did not satisfy me as much as I thought it would. Lila and Rae are great characters, although Rae's devotion to her boyfriend is pretty sickening. I guess I would reccomend reading this, but if I had to rate all of the Hoffman books I have read, this would be at the bottom. Practical Magic and The River King are about a zillion times better, they are probably Hoffman's masterpieces. If you do read this book and are disappointed, you should still read other books by Hoffman, because this is not the greatest represtentation. But I'm not giving it enough credit- it's not a bad read, and I do suggest that anyone who likes Hoffman should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story just stops","review":"This book was interesting enough to finish reading, but it just left you hanging. There is no ending. It is as if she was tired of writing the book and just stopped at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depression's Daughter","review":"I adore Alice Hoffman, but not this time. This book is completely depressing, the characters so needy and selfish that you want to slap them silly, and the ending was bizarre. Granted I'm from the south and never could understand the so-called New England stoicism that alienates others and just causes more damage to the individual feeling the pain, let alone the others surrounding her.I have three words for the women in this story: \\"Get a Life!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystical","review":"Fortunes Daughter is about Rae, a young, unmarried girl who is awaiting the birth of her child and Lila, a fortune-teller with no interest in the future who lost her child when she was a young, unmarried girl.Rae and Lilas lives, fates and futures intertwine as each tries to make peace with the past and become a better person for the future.Not knowing the what the book was really about, Lilas fortune telling, visions, nightmares, spirituality stuff was different then what I would normally read. I didn't like how Lila was so emotionally torchered all her life and never fully found peace.Without spoiling the storyline, I can say that as an Adoptive Mom I REALLY didn't like how one element of the book was treated. At all.All in all, it was an OKAY read. I read it in a weekend and like all of Hoffmans other books, she pulls you in with her ability to turn everyday events into enchanting words."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Decline Of Shelley Winters","review":"In the second half of her career Shelley Winters seemed determined to make everyone forget what a fine actress she once was (A Double Life, A Place In The Sun, Night Of The Hunter, Diary Of Anne Frank, Alfie, to name a few of her memorable films). Her post-Poseidon Adventure filmography is a list of forgettable films with forgettable performances, and Poor Pretty Eddie is no exception. Leslie Uggams finds herself stranded in a southern redneck town (are there any other kinds of southern towns in movies?), with a population whose collective IQ barely gets into three-digit territory (are there any other kinds of redneck populations in movies?). She is being held prisoner by a country singer/Elvis wanna-be, and is subject to repeated rapes by her captor and repeated humiliation by the townsfolk. If this is your cup of tea, then by all means go for it, but otherwise just avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really a reference work, but a bit of fun","review":"I enjoyed this book far more than the other two (thus far) reviewers, although my expertise on theology is lacking. I'm just a woman who gradually turned into a conservative evangelical Christian over a 40 year period.I did find that there were many things missing in the book...I was hoping for an entry on Walter Martin, too, for example; but I appreciated the guidance through the history of the church in America.My favorite entries focused on the culture that we've surrounded ourselves with. For example, take \\"Just.\\" Now, you might think the article accompanying that would have to do with justification, or judgment of a just God, or righteousness....but no. Balmer is referring to \\"the most frequent adverb in evangelical prayer\\" as in \\"Lord, we just thank you for giving us this time for coming together, and we just want you to know that we just appreciate your world and your love for us, and just worship you and just.....\\" etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"breakage","review":"just finished my last kimono off from a 12-pack and lo and behold, it broke. nothing fancy done, just some straight missionary and afterwards i find the condom broken and wrapped around my base like a c-ring. nice. i should have expected this from something that has such a \\"grippy\\" feeling lubricant. water-based is right, it feels like water and has about the same lubricating principles. to top it off it does smell very rubbery.i'll stick to me tried and true durex ultra thin and ribbed condoms. plus, they come in a nice shade of red :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking AND funny at the same time","review":"Most films about the Nazis and the holocaust are unrelentingly depressing and hard to watch (although we need to). A few are ultimately uplifting. But this one is the only one I can think of that is both heartbreaking and funny at the same time. That's what puts it far above the rest.The \\"moral\\" of the story -- that we must help each other survive through the hard times -- is never heavy handed, but it a natural extension of the situation the characters find themselves in. The ending is a treasure and one that doesn't feel contrived or unnatural.The only fault I could find is that the first five minutes seem somewhat irrelevant, since I never could figure out for sure who the people were in the \\"pre war\\" clips.

Do not let the fear of English subtitals get in your way of a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"United We Stand","review":"This film is one of the best of all time, and certainly one of the best kept secrets among film buffs. It deals with a childless Czech family during the German occupation of World War II who at great personal risk hide the son of their former Jewish employer. What develops is a story that mirrors the Gospel account of the conception and birth of Jesus, but is presented as entirely plausible, despite the delightful slapstick. Not even the collaborators and turncoats are portrayed without compassion, though their foibles (as well as those of our heroes) are gently mocked in a truly universal and life affirming way.

However, about an hour later, after bobbing against one's skin (particularly those of us with oily skin, I suspect) they look like a completely different pair of earrings.

Overall this just ins't a very good game though the graphics are good"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"i haven't played this game but i know from experience (i have 2003) that this probably sucks. let me take a guess and say that yao ming and lebron james aren't even in the game. as far as the dynasty mode goes, you realize that the averages per 48 minutes are completly out of whack, such as when i played tyson chandler for 40 minutes a game and he still had only 6.0 rebounds a game when simulating(the same average for when he played 19 minutes a game). he should be averaging at least 10.5. the rookies provide stats that are less than encouraging, nen had 9 points and 5 boards per game in 38 minutes!!! also, where are the foreign players to be found in the rookie draft (they make up practically half of the first round). for the gameplay, the only exciting teams would be sacramento and dallas, yet the knicks offensive scheme is strictly run-and-gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"nba live fell way off","review":"nba live fell way off the charts with this game here, its not even close to 2003, if i would have known it sucked this bad i would not have bought it, dont waste your money, maybe next year they will make a hotter game, dam and i love the legacy of nba live since the days of sega genesis man, dam this really hurts. lol. words of advice go back to the camera angles from 2003 please get more dunks. better post plays, i must say i like the announcers marv and mike, i loved the jump shots from 2003 go back to that please. im out i could write about this game all day, ps thanx for putting vince on the cover. let me guess lebron next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"why bring out a game with no meaning . d. tyree italy","review":"it only as very little good features realtic play of players and different sytle colored courts for each city but nba live 2004 is a big down fall no defense you can't drive to the basket like 2k3 and it's hard to have control of your players with the joystick because you have very little choices to pick from. game makers need to sit down with nba superstars and let them judge on how the want there fans to see them and how they want it played if vince carter really saw and play this before it was made it never would have been put out on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Game!!","review":"EA Sports did a great job on this game.

One improvement from last year is that with the freestyle mode last year if u used on offense once, u'd blow by the defender every time. This year it takes a bit more patience and work. I really dont notice the \\"10 man freestyle\\" so the gameplay is pretty much the same. The graphics are pretty good but they arnt much improved.

The collision detection is the most frustrating thing. The ball WENT THROUGH my players time and time again. I can't pick up a rebound unless I'm directly on top of the ball (the players refuse to put their hands out and grab it even if it's an inch away).The players turn their backs to the hoop frequently (and what looks like randomly), which makes it really hard to do ANYTHING (offensively). Cut sequences suck. Draft sucks (not enough information to make informative decisions)I used to really like EA, and hoped that they would out-do NBA 2K3, but unfortunately they haven't. I was really excited about this release, but now I'm not sure.

Therefore, if you like the sound of this album I also recommend the following albums, composed by various performers including some on this album: Blow the Man Down; Sailors' Songs & Sea Shanties; Shanties & Songs of the Sea. These albums have a great mix of emotion in them, from rip-roarin' drinking songs to inspirational working songs to melancholy tunes about ships that were swallowed up by the sea.

It didn't really deal with politics as much as it talked about poverty with a few other political issues tacked on for the last 70 pages or so. Also, you would think that a book titled \\"God's Politics\\" would rely heavily on scripture and pull on lots of verses. It's surprising how few verses are mentioned in this book, the few references that are made to scripture are sometime taken out of their original context. The book felt more like Wallis standing on his own soapbox giving his views of poverty than actually engaging in a serious discussion of how Christians should engage in politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blown Opportunity","review":"God's Politics is sketchy on the former and mostly one-sided on the latter. Jim Wallis chose a great title and had a wonderful opportunity to pull off what he set out to do. But because his biases ring out in nearly every chapter, he was the wrong man to attempt this project.Having read the book and having led a small group discussion on it with both conservative and progressive evangelicals, I have to say that God's Politics is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. Wallis could have done so much more by really bringing out the best of the ways the right and the left look at key issues. Instead, he settled for trumpeting his own 11th hour non-solution attempts to hold off the Iraq War.I honestly hope that someone with fewer tendencies toward the rhetoric of the left will attempt this kind of project again in the future. But after reading Wallis' attempt, I am more convinced that anyone attempting to speak the final word of God on politics will be similarly humbled in failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polite Homphobia","review":"This author may indeed be well meaning, but nonetheless, like most religious rightwingers, his true colors are revealed when he discusses gay marriage. Gays don't have the right to marriage, the author says matter-of-factly, implying that gays are less worthy than good God-fearing souls like himself. He also says that gay civil rights are not nearly as important as other people's civil rights, implying that, again, gays are less worthy than others.All in all, not the most hateful book by a religious writer, but nonetheless quite hostile towards gay Americans. Why is it that no one who claims to love his fellow humans due to his religious beliefs can actually do so?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Prophetically Correct\\"","review":"Wallis' book is essential for anyone who is searching for a Biblical foundation as an evaluative tool in the face of our political, cultural situation today. To be \\"politically correct\\" is seldom the same as being \\"prophetically correct\\". Wallis invites us to \\"re-image\\" our approaches for effective solutions to the \\"evils of the day.\\" Independently of applying them to the specific political parties and politians of the day, I found the principles stand on their own as \\"touchstones,\\" articulating the vision that focuses on the \\"common good.\\" It is only a unified striving for this common good that can help us pull out of the morass sucking us down into destructive greed, power, control, individualism, violence, and all that shatters any hope of being a community of justice and peace. \\"God's Politics\\" is a light beaming in the darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"While mildly thought provoking, this book is a waste of time. You could get a better idea of what this guy was trying to convey by reading the beatitudes from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.Instead of outlining what the author thinks God's politics would be, he constantly harps on the errors of the two major political parties. The author does not offer any viable solutions.I cannot recommend this book to anyone.To get a better idea of God's politics, open your Bible and put God's words to action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too good to be true","review":"I was excited about the premise of this book, hoping that by reading it, I would be exposed to an intelligent way of reconciling biblical truth with the political environment (not sure there is a way, after looking at the interaction between Jesus and Pilate or the Apostle Paul and Felix). I appreciated the observations that the right had co-opted God; that is so true. My expectations were a bit disappointed, however, when the author's sympathies seem to play in support of pro-gay, pro-choice, and anti-capital punishment agendas, not positions that Scripture endorses. Wallis gives everything a prescriptive harmony, but does it by marginalizing the Bible. It is political peace without substance, holiness, or justice, therefore the politics of this book do not end up being God's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great title, insufficent follow through","review":"I have followed many of Wallis'writings and generally found his conclusions about the state of the nation to be in close accord with my own. However after reading this book and trying to ignore the many replications (the book seems to have been largely a compilation of various talks and articles published elsewhere and hurriedly thrown together) I find little logic and discernment in its entirety. I am still left with the question: \\"How can I discern God's politics?\\" If the book had been less wordy and more analytical, and with a less lofty title and by-line, I would have appreciated it more. It seems more like a diatribe against the present administration (valid in my view) than a new way of looking at politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"C. E. Lawrence","review":"Do not be misled by the title of this book. It is not, as I expected it to be, a scholarly treatment in Christian Appologetics addressing the manner in which God would have politics work, according to Biblical teachings, in our nation and the world. Instead, this book monotonously espouses a so-called \\"progressive\\" approach to infusing politics with ultra liberal attitudes toward morality, throughout an agonizingly long and redundant diatribe against George W. Bush and those holding a true Biblical Worldview. This \\"progressive\\" attitude has no basis in Biblically based Christian theology. If Mr. Wallis is an Evangelist, at all, he is clearly not a Christian Evangelist. If you are a liberal, and particularly if you are an avid Bush-basher, you will like the book. For those truly seeking to know how God would have us conduct politics, however, don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why it's all George Bush's fault","review":"If you hate George Bush, you'll love the book.

He doesn't seem to let facts get in the way of his conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manifesto for Christian Socialists","review":"This book is marketed as a balanced view of the clash between fundamentalists Christians and secularist liberals. Do not be deceived! It is purely a front for him to spout his clearly leftist views of government.He implies that socially concerned Christians must inherently be politically liberal and be in favor of government/welfare-state solutions for problems of poverty. This is ridiculous. There is no conflict in being a socially concerned Christian and also a strong proponent of market-based solutions.This book is an insidious attempt to recruit politically ignorant Christians for the Democratic Party by using the language of faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Religion Has No Place In Politics","review":"...or political decisions. Political decisions should be made on the relative merits of our society's needs. The best question for any politician should be, \\"What is best for the greater good?\\" The question should not be, \\"What is best for the greater good, considering my religious convictions.\\" This book, like the vast majority of American politics, subscribes to the answers of the tenents of the former question, rather than the latter. The death of secular politics is writ large in this pathetic surrender to the Right. The more I read, the more I understand why GW is president."},{"rating":"1","title":"His non-solution to the pre-Iraqi invasion by Bush","review":"Wallis discusses again and again in detail stressing the terrible deeds performed by Saddam Hussein while the latter was head of Iraq. Fine and this is good but he proposes (while using other quotes) no real solution. He talks about using a UN protectorate forcing more sanctions on Saddam's Iraq rather than conquering it by military force. This never could have worked! In former Saddam aid Georges Sada's own book (available on amazon) he discusses how Saddam was collecting a superpowerful superfortune through smuggling Iraqi oil outta neighboring Iran. Iran would have been no help in the UN sanctioning Iraq heavier. Syria probbaly wouldn't either. Invasion was the only way to get Saddam out, as Bush did in 2003. Point is moot now anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"God's Politics?","review":"Want to know God's politics? Really know them? Then read the Bible. Wallis gets some right, some wrong. He picks and chooses the parts of the Bible he likes & leaves out the rest. You cannot embrace and honor only part of the Bible; you either respect it as God's divine law or you don't. Therefore, the moral laws, politically correct or not, are just as important as the parts that discuss helping the poor and needy. All of God's Word is worth reading. I have nothing against Willis, who has his opinions, but I'm saddened that people feel that they need someone else to tell them what God's politics are; He has already done so. Pick up a Bible and see for yourself. The true point is knowing Jesus and His love. If you know this, the rest of it will fall into place, regardless of the voices of political parties or authors.

This is just left leaning BS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social Activism As Religion","review":"A bit dated electoral politics wise but that part can be viewed historically. The book is written for Christians by one but I am not and could appreciate the basic premise. The author sees poverty and war as issues all religous persuasions should be addressing. He does a good job of challenging right wing assumptions that they own God and left wing assumptions that social issues are separate from spiritual ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and important","review":"I'm a politically active Australian and this book gave me an improtant insight into my own thinking and of others.

The author gives a concise and detailed account of contempory American politics and social forces. This tome could easily be a textbook (although more interesting then a typical textbook) for any student of the politics and political influences of the American electorate."},{"rating":"1","title":"God's Politics","review":"I found this book a bit of a weak rehash of theological principles held by the author. It focuses on a pragmatic theology and contains old correspondence to back up his thesis...which, in light of Lakoff and others, skims many issues. In short I think this book was glued together in light of the 2004 election results and the popularity of post-election analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"The motto for the book is quite deceiving: Not What You Think","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I got it on my campus for 2 dollars on a book sale and I really would not recommend it for a Republican because the author is obviously biased and thinks that Democrats have it all right. It just made me really angry as a Republican. He's also a Bush-hater which upsets me tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivers a subtly hateful, elitist message","review":"The subtitle of this book is incredibly misleading; it should be \\"Why I hate Bible-believing Christians.\\" Wallis is unrelenting in his construction of inaccurate strawman descriptions of politically conservative Christians and tearing them down with dismissive, \\"progressive\\" rhetoric. Wallis says he wants to communicate an authentic Christian faith, but what he communicates instead is how little regard he has for anyone who disagrees with him. And above all, he wants you to know what an important guy he is, how great a husband and father he is, and how many important people he has hobnobbed with. He is long-winded and provides very little insight. All in all, a colossal waste of time. Two stars is almost certainly too generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is a Tool of the Evil One","review":"I can't believe so many people are deceived by this book! It is alraming how gulible folks are. We shouldn't be concerned with the politics at all. We should be reading our Bibles (Dake Study Bible is #1!) and listening to righteous music (U2) and doing whats right.People, this book leads you down a wrong path. Don't go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring of Books","review":"The prose is dull and the author lacks an ability to get his points across without boring the reading to an almost comatose state. For those that can't get rest at night this is the book for you.Jim Wallis has some good ideas, but as a writer he does inspire! This book would be best used as a good paperweight"},{"rating":"1","title":"God's Politics","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but was sadly disappointed. I heard Mr. Wallis on the radio and thought to myself, wow, this guy sounds pretty good, so I bought the book. I never finished it. It was more a book about what the Democrats need to do to get back in power and what the Republicans are doing wrong to us. As a Libertarian I think it is up to the individual to decide where their money goes, whom we would like to help, not the government. Mr. Wallis say's again and again how the government should take care of the poor. I was hoping for a balanced effort to show how religion, which shouldn't have a part in politics anyway, works in politics, not a bash fest for the right and a lesson for the left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just more liberal propaganda","review":"This book presents itself as an unbiased Christian view of American politics and I was really looking forward to reading it but I was disappointed to find that there is nothing unbiased about it. It is just another leftist, anti-American screed that masquerades as Christian thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"Everyone who is unhappy with the current political situation and mess we have made, not only of our country but also of our so called values, should read this book with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great perspective!","review":"This two party society is really ready for a new, more centrist party. Read the book and you will agreee. The questions it raised for me is how do we get there and who will take us there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging for both sides","review":"As a devout Christian and patriotic American tired of having my faith and patriotism challenged by conservitive loyalists and seeing bleeding heart liberals neglect faith and the dangers of this world, I was thrilled to read this. I feel he offers fair criticisms of both sides and finally a strong voice from a well-known Christian against the ungodly policies of an administration who has strayed so far from the faith we thought we were possibly getting, and standing up against those in the left who want to remove this same faith from all facets of society. Very well done and thought provoking and I hope and pray that canidates from both sides read and apply what is being said in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"made me feel less alone","review":"Wallis's writing isn't outstanding (I'd rather give the book 3.5 stars). He's a classic example of why good speakers aren't always good authors. The book is uneven and occasionally repetitive, but it does fill a void in the American political landscape. Those out there who are Christians with progressive leanings can appreciate the difficulties of trying to find a home when the overly secular ivory tower liberals are suspect of theists and the folks at church are suspect of anyone who has anything nice to say about any Democrat. As one who fits that description, I found the book to be a comfort. Here was a man who was writing many of the things that I was thinking! In a common-sense manner, he lays out how progressive politics naturally emerge from Christian beliefs and how both the left and right (although he does aim most of his prose at the right) do a disservice to those of us out here in no man's land who aren't entirely comfortable with either's excesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!","review":"This book is a must read for all Christian and nonChristian people, especially moms who want to raise moral kids. Finally, a person who inspires everyone to listen to their gut about middle of the road wisdom. Great read and motivation for all of us. Share your insight with everyone after you read it and recommend the book as much as possible. God's Politics rocks and enlightens the soul.For Moral Moms with kids ages 2 to 11, I also recommend Mommy-CEO, by Jodie Lynn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Wallis speaks for me","review":"Finally a view of Christianity that is desperately needed to be heard. In a few short years our nation has moved into the dangerous and scary territory of blind patriotism, merging God and country and narrowly defining what are \\"moral values\\". Wallis addresses these issues and more. Sadly, many pastors do not dare speak the truth as Wallis does, I believe, for fear of stepping on toes and losing members. As one of the Mennonite faith I am eager to include this book in our church library and maybe raise a few eyebrows. There is some repetition but with so much to gain, that is forgiven. Especially good are the chapters on dangerous religion and economic justice. Another book many may find equally helpful is \\"The Scandal of the Evangelical Conscience\\" by Ronald Sider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"This Reverend understands the difference between speaking \\"religiously correct\\" and true morality.I highly recommend this book to anybody with an open-mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"God's politics-----a man's bias","review":"This is the most one-sided, leftist reflection of current events masquerading as religions thought I have ever read in my life. There is some real helpful insight in these pages. But, it is so obscured by partisan rhetoric, that even a thoughtful individual would have great difficulty reading it. My Sunday School class has been struggling to discuss the chapters. Even the liberals are turned-off by the slant. His use of scripture is generally good, but the bias gets in the way of almost every point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timely Subject - Secular response","review":"While the underlying theme of Wallis' book is timely (that is, religion and politics should be discussed together), the author is entirely disingenuous throughout the book. It's full of false generalizations which reveal his liberal view of the role of politics. Chalk Wallis up to another person who mistakes \\"Freedom of Religion\\" to \\"Freedom from Religion.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"God is a Liberal Democrat","review":"Take the Democratic Party platform, add some rhetoric about how Christianity requires whatever liberals are in favor of this week, mix in a big dose of utopian expectation that everything will work out the way the left wing wants, because after all that's God's plan. Shake until addled. Then pour it all over the floor, because this won't convince anyone to vote Democratic who wasn't going to already.As a Republican, I very much approve of this book. I hope all Democrats read it and follow its advice. It will give us another big victory in 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Wallis is just another liberal who doesn't get it","review":"I had high hopes when I picked this up that maybe he would encourage Democrats to embrace Christian ideals. I was quickly disappinted and eventually disgusted but kept reading out of morbid fascination at an ideology continuing to drive obliviously and self-righteously off a cliff. The author's premise is basically that by using buzzwords and claiming Jesus stands for their values Democrats can trick Christians into voting for them.The problem is that Christianity is not a collection of buzzwords or a bunch of kids rocking back and forth chanting and memorizing the Bible all day. Christianity has a millenium-long tradition of rationalism and reasoned debate about morality. Christians don't vote Republican because they think \\"that's what Christ would want,\\" they vote Republican because it's the rational, moral thing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"we don't want it","review":"People who are \\"liberal\\" are usually also secular and wish religion would go just away. We don't \\"get it\\" because there's no point. Why do we need a book that tries to tell us that we need to pass over to the dark side and give up the truth of a scientific worldview?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and sometimes even contradictory","review":"Jim Wallis seems well-meaning, but his book is so full of contradictions that you can't follow his logic. It also seems like he's doing his best to please the Democratic Party in order to carve our a place for himself in their ranks. He claims to be a \\"Christian\\" but his confusing position on abortion makes me wonder. He writes that Christians should not vote on just a single issue like abortion. So what we don't vote on the one issue of murder? I could see his point if we were talking about taxes or highway building, but not murder. I wonder if during the Civil Rights movement, all those people who voted solely on the issue of Civil Rights were also misguided?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Boring","review":"You know if God was really kind he would not have allowed this book to be published. Jim Wallis has most of Christianity wrong and his biting tone is hard to believe. I object to the book because it does not represent what Christ taught and it is mean spirited toward believers who don't have a liberal slant. When I say liberal, I mean really liberal. Save your money and your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book by Deceitful person","review":"This book is just trash by someone out to bash Christians for daring to participate in the politics of out Republic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nonpartisan","review":"Wallis pitches his book as an attempt to show that Christians can be Democrats or Republicans, or whatever presumably. Here, he is correct. He also pitches his argument as being nonpartisan. Here, he is mistaken; it doesn't take too long to figure out his idea of nonpartisan is liberal Democrat."},{"rating":"1","title":"for uncritical leftists only","review":"Wallis uncritically accepts all Democratic party lines. Tax cuts are for the rich, poverty is growing, the Third world is poor because the US is mean to it, Al Qaeda can be stopped by police investigations, the UN is the most moral agent, etc. The book is extravagantly repetitive. Perhaps his publisher required him to only have one idea in each chapter and forgot to tell him it shouldn't always be the same idea. The only function of this book is to comfort left wing Christians. He assumes all conservatives are motivated by greed, racism and lust for war -- ignoring the richly developed world of conservative thought as can be seen in Commentary magazine or First Things."},{"rating":"2","title":"big and funny tasting...","review":"If you leave this in your mouth too long they taste funny.

It removes any lingering stink from diaper changes, cleans spit-up off skin and leaves a nice fresh scent, removes macaroni and cheese and chee-tos from hands and faces, not to mention kool-aid, chocolate, spaghetti sauce residue. . .you name it, Physiobebe cleans it up.

I read other reviews on different websites about people using this to bathe their newborn so I gave it a try. I just put some on a wash cloth and wiped her down. She has pretty sensitive skin as do most newborns I'd assume and we did not encounter any issues when using this.

This is the second album in line following Mistress Music, which in earnest ushered in a new sound from Burning Spear. On Mek we Dweet Burning Spear takes this \\"lighter\\" more upbeat, more horn-driven sound a step futher focussing once again on more \\"concious\\" lyrics as compared to the preceeding Mistress Music album. Tracks such as African Woman, Elephants, My Roots make this album a modern classic and one that to me particularly emphasis visions of Africa. This album can certainly be recommended to newcomers to reggae as well as the more avid roots reggae fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST BOND GAMES","review":"I just recently bought a PS2.

The missions are great. The graphics are very sharp and realistic and the real life voice acting is great. However, the game is a little too easy. But don't worry, they have plenty of challenges, such as achieving Platinum medals in 00 Agent, and 33 missions.

Character abilities, character movements, and excellent \\"movie quality\\" cut scenes make the single player missions very entertaining.HOWEVER, if you are looking for a multi-player game with a battle mode similar to other Bond titles this is not a game to buy! Multi-player battle mode is also played in 3rd person, and there is no split screen making the battle mode very boring and pretty much not worth playing.But, there is an option for Co-op missions with 1 other player that is very similar to the single player missions (it is played with split screen) and is very fun.Overall, if you are looking for a game to play by yourself or play cooperative missions with 1 other person it is a must-have.

My best friend and I just love to play multiplayer on Nightfire; specialy having us on one team and bots on the other, plus there are so many choices on Nightfire. So, after that game , I'm pretty sure this will be THE BEST 007 GAME SO FAR.If this game is as good as I think it will be, then it's worth EVERY, SINGLE, PENNY.

As it is, this is a passing fad where we've chosen to celebrate a teen who can put a commercialized web site together instead of recognizing the students in our world who are making lasting impacts through overseas and local service projects in their communities. If Ashley gets the spotlight simply because Sprite.com is a sponsor, I have to wonder what we are really encouraging - a meaningless chase after the wind?

All the press on this girl may lead one to believe that a lot of what she's created was for self promotion. This book sets the record straight, from her point of view. It also allows Miss Power the ability to compare elements within her life, too what most teenagers go through on a daily basis. She's pretty down to earth and you can see where this book would be helpful to any teenager struggling with their own identiy in the teenage kingdom and yet maintain a relationship with their family also, which seems to be a high wire act Miss Power and her family have overcome. But not without a few learning experiences. Interesting reading for teens and parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soon to be a favorite around the fraternity","review":"A collection of songs that sneaks up on you like a good beer-buzz from a English stout.

Saw this book at the local public library and decided to read it.The book, written by one of the best players ever, contains several colorful illustrations (usually drawings of Nicklaus himself) of how to hit particular shots, stances to use , mental preparation, etc.However, as stated earlier, I believe the book is better suited to the more experienced golfer. Still, a good read and I will refer to this title more as I play longer.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!! Misleading picture !!!","review":"!!!

As soon as the Twinlab capsules were available with Prime again, I ordered those and did not finish the bottle of Rainbow Light. Everyone is different and these might work well for someone who only suffers from some slight digestive troubles, but for my problem, I needed something better.

The Turn of the Screw is the most boring story I have read in quite a while. I cannot watch scary movies or read scary books because they keep me up and give me nightmares and generally mess with my mind, so I was leary of The Turn of the Screw. But even with my hypersensitivity to horror, I was not remotely frightened, my spine not at all tingled, by any one of James's tortuous sentences. The story is indeed ambiguous, but I was too bored to bother seeking its deeper meaning. Even James didn't care much for Turn of the Screw. If you want to read a good story by James, try \\"What Maisie Knew.\\" You'll still get all the repressed Victorian allusions to sexuality and children, and you won't hate James when you're through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed and Confused!","review":"Huh??? I've just finished reading this story and feel as if I've wasted 3 months of my life! Normally, I enjoy this particular genre, Victorian and Gothic settings, etc. Not this time. I'm still left with two questions. First of all, were the \\"ghosts\\" real or a figment of the narrator's imagination? Secondly, I was dying to find out what the young boy had done to cause his expulsion from school. Also, the narratives were drawn out way too long! After the first ten pages, I was bored to tears! I'll give James one more chance before I cast him aside for good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a classic?","review":"I'm being genrous with two stars, because it's a classic, but I really had to struggle through this turgid text. It's short (my copy runs at 104 pages), but it took me nearly a year to read it. I kept putting it aside, reading other books in between.I agree with those who say that NOTHING HAPPENS, and that the text is so WORDY and CONVULUTED. I too had to reread sentences several times to figure out what the governess was trying to say.I don't mind old books, and I can accept that in previous centures customs, attitudes, and phrasing differed. That might still allow for a great story. But this is STILL a boring convuluted book.Mary Shelly's FRANKENSTEIN was written nearly a century before TOTS, yet FRANKENSTEIN reads well, is interesting, and says important things about life and philosophy even if the views of people 200 years ago are not our own. So just because TOTS was first published in 1898 is no excuse for its dull convuluted telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Interpret, and a very undesirable plot","review":"I had to read this book for a college English class, and I found myself struggling to keep awake. I don't know what Henry James was thinking when he wrote this book, but it is definitely a book to read if you want to go to sleep. Meanwhile, it brought my English grade way down; Thanks alot Henry. The whole situation with the governess doesn't make sense to me at all. In my opinion the other people were trying to deny what the governess was seeing because they were frightened by the sight of the ghost. I don't see all the psychological theories that they many reviewers are interpreting. Maybe if the book explained itself a little better, I would agree, but for now I still think the book was a real snoozer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a 'refreshing' way to deal with humanity","review":"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the book and thought that your method of dealing with our errant civilisation to be a great and well thought out story. The premise that we always adopt in most science fiction is the gung-ho idea that there is always actual violent intent directed from any alien life form to us 'poor' humans. It was refreshing to see you deal with just about all of humanities problems and as a result most of wildlife's problems in such a relatively peaceful manner. In short I thought it was great.

The book gives the reader a true perspective of the shenanigans by owners who are looking for the \\"easy money\\" of professional sports and how they will stoop to breaking the hearts of thousands of loyal fans just to fatten their wallets. Not only does it cut to the quick about the move of the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore; it also touches off on that fateful winter's night when Bob Irsay packed the beloved Colts onto the Mayflower trucks and stole away the heart of a city. A great read for Clevelanders and Baltimoreans alike; both of which can take small consolation that the heartbreaks of '84 and '95 will finally be resolved when the Browns return next August."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome account of the sport and business of the NFL","review":"Since the Colts left Baltimore in 1984 I had pretty much forgotten about football. I had paid little attention to the trials the city had gone through to obtain a replacement for the Colts, and even less attention to any other city's NFL problems. Until I read this book.By the time Baltimore convinced Cleveland Brown's owner Art Modell to abandon the city he had made into a football dynasty in favor of a more lucrative deal, they had already spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build the Orioles a new stadium. The author details a highly entertaining story of how it all happened, complete with backroom details and public embarassments.Jon Morgan does a magnificent job of relating seemingly unrelated events. He somehow ties together team owner's greed, urban decay, baseball football rivalry, Baltimore's loss, Baltimore's theft, fan loyalty and stadium economics into a fascinating well-told tale. And best of all - it's all true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely useful!","review":"Thanks to this book, I was able to arrive in Delhi at midnite, go to the taxi stand at the airport and not wonder where I would end up for the night.

For that alone, this book was worth every penny to me.I would recommend reading it before you go because some of the places/people to be contacted must be done ahead of time. and you may find that contact information can change sporadically in India (one of the many beautiful challenges you'll find on your travels there)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, one of a kind, should be updated!","review":"This book is a godsend (pun unavoidable) for anyone with a spiritual bent traveling to India.

The only issue is that now it is 10 years old and so naturally it may not be up to date. it doesn't have websites.

Camenson knows nothing about economics. If someone is writing career books for a living, chances are that they are among the worst people to be getting career advice from (unless you want to write career books). What's worse, the vast bulk of this book does not even pertain to economics. Instead it offers examples of sloppy cover letters and \\"methods of self assessment\\" that have been simply rehashed from the other books of this series.

One of the sleeves does rotate smoothly but the other doesn't. The problem sleeve rotates smoothly for about 80% of the rotation then it encounters resistance which stops it. Yes, if you apply some force it will rotate over this part - but it isn't in any sense of the word smooth. It may be that with use this will eventually change and loosen up.

Finally, the info about lights out to be printed on the case so that losing the instructions doesn't render the unit totally useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy with mine","review":"i'm extremely happy with my steripen. I just returned from a six night camping trip during which i used it for the first time. Having read reviews here before going out, i was worried about it going through batteries too fast. I put 2 new cr123 batteries in it before going out and took along 2 as a spare; ended up not needing the spares at all. It purified all the water for 2 people, including water used for making coffee/tea and cooking, for 6 nights on one set of batteries. I have no idea how close the batteries are to being spent; after the entire trip, it was still working fine with the original batteries. The user manual said it will purify approximately 5 gallons per set of batteries, but i'm almost positive it did significantly more. I was very pleasantly surprised. We were camping in warm weather, mostly dry, although it did rain on us one night. I highly recommend it and honestly would not go camping again without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for many reasons","review":"Backpacking across Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia and did not have one day of sickness.

Its so much easier than pumping and filtering and takes up less space in your pack I always carry back up batteries but never had to use them.

So I also carry the instructions so I can show them what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, but a little cheapy.","review":"Excellent price, especially considering the original price, but when they came I was a little disappointed.

Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"batteries","review":"I have had this watch for about six years now. The batteries died just after the 3-year warranty expired. You cannot just get a local jeweler to replace the battery. The battery runs $ 40+ and needs to go back to Seiko to have it done. I had a local jeweler change the battery rather than ship it. The second hand moved in 5 second increments and the perpetual calendar is gone...there is no calendar. The second battery just died again this weekend. Not going to throw any more good money after bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless watch that's been great for 13 years","review":"I've had this watch for 13 years. It's been awesome. The battery will die in less than 10 years. I'd recommend getting the battery changed after 5. I'm a do-it-yourselfer and changed my own battery. You can get one easily from eBay or Amazon. The battery was completely dead, but by downloading the instruction manual for the watch, I reprogrammed the perpetual calendar. It wasn't too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seiko SLL086 JUNK !","review":"My wife bought this for me as a gift. She paid over $300 6 years ago. It worked fine until the battery died after about 4 years. I went to several Jewelers but none could replace the battery. It had to be sent to the Seiko Service center in new Jersey at a cost of $30!A few weeks later I received the watch and it was keeping good time but the second had jumps every five seconds.

The gameplay and the player graphics are pretty good but the attention to detail present in NCAA Football is nowhere to be found. Genric schedules, generic stadiums, generic and incomplete rosers. The menus and their load times are pathetic. There are no automatic saves for Dynasty and User Profile. The favorite team feature has to be set each time you power up. The list goes on and on. I played this game for three days before I traded it on Madden 2004. Maybe next year EA."},{"rating":"2","title":"best basketball game ever","review":"This game without a doubt is one of the best basketball games I have ever played. Usually I don't like basketball but I tried the college one and it was the best basketball game around. The only thing frustrating about this game is that in the start of the game when you have to pick a team I tried to pick a high ranked school (Duke) and they sucked! But anyways I would really recomend that you buy this game, first rent it and see if you like it and then if you do then buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this game blows","review":"This NCAA game blows major apples. The game isnt good because you dont have the alaska tournament shootout or the preseason NIT or the post-season NITtournament. You only have the Maui invitational and the NCAA tounament. Plus your ratings fall each game. I was playing with UCI and i beat maryland, wisconsin,georgia tech and kentucky and i still wasnt ranked. i was 21-0 and i still wasnt ranked. You creators at EA Sports need to fix up this game for a better one next year. You need to put all the Conference tounaments and every other tournament at the right gym. Also you need to make all the gyms the way they are in real life. NCAA March Madness SUCKS. Create a better one next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for a Great College Basketball Title","review":"Although this year's March Madness is a step up from last year's version (it now includes many more teams, like mid-major Creighton, etc., and it fixed some of the tournament issues), I'm still sorely disappointed by gameplay and features.Gameplay is relatively intuitive, and the ability to juke and set plays are decent, yet the game lacks imagination and creativity in its setup.Problems with the menu are particularly troubling -- you must load your \\"favorite team\\" each time you play, as well as your saved dynasties and settings. Recruiting is a tiring task, which is disappointing since I truly enjoy this feature in EA's football series.The game is a bit buggy, with the announcers calling out the wrong team's name (I was up by 40+ pts, and had scored 12 straight unanswered points, but Dick Vitale said my opponent was \\"on fire\\".) :-)I would not recommend a purchase -- either buy it used, rent it, or wait until next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated game!! Don't buy this game!","review":"First of all, if anybody on here claims this game is amazing is automatically an idiot. Second of all, NCAA College Basketball 2k4 makes this game look silly. The first thing I noticed is that this games graphics are subpar and the 3 dimensional aspect of the arenas are terrible. I also noticed a choppiness among the gameplay when a lot seems to be going on. I am not sure how the XBOX version handles this but the PS2 version sucks. The Dynasty mode is the only bonus going for the game but the actual gameplay which is what really counts is terrible and very arcadish and isn't certainly worth any of your hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a break","review":"i like this game i've been waiting years for a decent college game though the graphics could be bettter the game brings a lot of college intenstey.the players could look a little more better though it ticks me off that ea sports puts more into nba live 2004 then it dose college because to me college is way better but overall the game is awesome"},{"rating":"1","title":"way too expensive","review":"buyer beware: there are only 8 small packs. i got such \\"8 packs\\" at $2.79 from a nearby store which usually sells at a high price because it's the only grocery store around the campus area. i naturally, but mistakenly, thought the \\"8 pack\\" here means 8 packs of one small pack (i.e. 64 small packs). i am still at a loss to understand why it's more than 3 times the price of the usual cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree.

And zero 2 was my introduction to the series. Its a tough game but I like the fact that it sort of adapts to the players level of skill without a difficulty option, the better you do the more challenging the bosses become.

The gameplay is fun though it'll take a little time to get used to the chain rod but zero moves pretty smoothly otherwise.

Ed plays JB's actual guitar and carries forward his great slide guitar and blues boogie tradition. Lil Ed's vocals reveal a big voice from a little guy. Willie Kent is known to blues fans as the leading blues bass player today.

It's a coming-of-age novel in the Salinger vein, following a Young Bright Man (too young for the Beats) and his midadventures. This is only Cohen work that could be optioned for the movies (and succeed as a movie, too). Not as heartbreaking as Cohen's other work, more straightforward than Beautiful Losers, The Favourite Game is arty entertainment that's worth taking on the train or to the beach. (And cheap, too!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guide to Men","review":"As a woman in her mid-twenties this has been quite a revelation for me. It has opened my eyes in so many ways with regard to men and their nature, and I mean this in a kind and tender way.

A must for any passionate of human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Potent","review":"What a genius Lenny is! Having struggled through the wild magnificence of Beautiful Losers, this novel was a breeze... Each sentence is amazing. Not a single word is wasted. This IS the essence of Leonard Cohen.

It is art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leonard Cohen, Great Poet and Songwriter; Mediocre Novelist","review":"I love listening to Leonard Cohen's music (even sung by others)and his poetry is an intriguing synthesis of the accessible and the cryptic. This novel, however, within which there are genuine flashes of insight and poignancy, ultimately falls flat. The central protagonist doesn't change much -- which I suspect is Leonard's point. But, this we get right away. Also scenes with the protagonist's Jewish mother are way over the top -- but they do anticipate Philip Roth's Sophie Portnoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality and value","review":"I was unhappy with the quality of the Craftsmen offerings, so went online and found this one with good reviews.This unit is MUCH better quality that what Craftsmen sells anywhere near this price - to get the equivalent you'd have to pay 2x-3x more.I'm VERY happy with this purchase; it's a high quality tool chest that looks like it will last. And reasonably priced.As other reviewers have said, the boxes it comes in are very heavy. That's because the metal is thicker and it's better made. If you need to move the unit up stairs, take out the drawers first - then it's not too heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Excel tool boxes are a great value.

I found bette's version of the song so mouth-wateringly tasty and came to love the music once again.And, as a big fan of Sean Connery, I was immensely excited by this George Martin's final production, \\"In My Life\\". I had never heard Sean Connery sings before. Well, in that sense, the outcome of this album was not what I expected, but certainly not dissatisfaction. Far from it!Robin Williams' cool \\"Come Together\\", Goldie Hawn's jazzy \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", Jim Carrey's powerful \\"I Am The Walrus\\"...

If Asia is not the stimulus than the blundering Federal Reserve will be. I disagree. Most successful companies are already making plans to address the global overcapacity. Asian countries cannot continue to devalue currencies in a vacuum since devaluations cripple the local populations. The author essentially assumes that the forces of the world will stupidly and blindly force deflation. While many of the world's leaders are far from perfect, the critical leaders fundamentally understand that good economics is good politics. Bad economics might be good politically now (e.g. deficit spending), but ultimately the situation crashes and the politican suffers (i.e. Asia's leaders).

It was almost exactly the same as medal of honor frontline. The only difference was the levels, which were even more boring then frontline's levels. The storyline is so stupid that I skiped the in game movies. If EA wants to make a good and different war game than I suggest they make a war game about either the revolutionary war or the civil war.

It seems too easy to play compared to the others, but the BIGGEST letdown is the length of the game! At what should be about the halfway point of the other MOH games, this one rolls credits!! I thought at first it must be just an intermission, but no, the game was in fact over already! Be smart...rent it, finish it in just a few hours, and save the $50 for a game you can buy and feel you got your money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money","review":"This game is a rip-off! Its unbelievably short: I beat the game in one afternoon. There are only a few levels and its WAY shorter than MOH Frontline.This game is also incredibly unrealistic. I felt more like Rambo in this game than an American soldier. You kill the Japanese, move forward and get ammo, and keep killing. You don't have to conserve ammo, you don't have to worry about getting hit because theres always health right there.The only part of the game I remotely enjoyed was the very first level where you have to shoot down some incoming planes. After that level, though, its all downhill. The levels are small and narrow. There is very little room for you to manuever.This game is REALLY, REALLY short and REALLY, REALLY bad. I'm so thankful that I rented it instead of buying it. Don't get this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Frontline was a fun game! This one isn't even half as fun.

Anyone who reviewed this game as hard is either 4 years old or only has 1 arm, if they do not fit into one of these categories should immediately give away their game system, this is the easiest FPS I've ever played. Even on Hard the Japanese are such bad shots you can run up to them from a hundred yards away while they are shooting at your and club them down with your rifle. If they happen to hit you once or twice don't worry, there is health about every 50 feet in this game. don't buy this game, bad plot, bad levels, too easy, too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what happens when $$ matter more than quality","review":"I am a huge MOH follower but this game is nothing short of a rip off. First of all it is too short I finished in one weekend, the graphics leave a lot to be desired with dead soldiers that seem to float. This game would have been worth $19.99 but at anything over that it is a rip-off"},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down after Frontline","review":"I'm not a big FPS games fan, but I got hooked on to MOH Frontline which I thoroughly enjoyed. So I bought MOH Rising Sun expecting it to be even better...what a let down it was! The game was way too easy and when it abruptly came to an end, I was very disappointed. The storyline and missions are not bad, but the level of difficulty and the dumb soldiers are ridiculous. The graphics are mediocre. In the single-player missions your comrades sometimes get in between you and the enemy, and your enemy can still shoot at you but you can't! I think two pluses for this game - it now costs only 15 bucks or so, and the game has save points all along the various missions (a big improvement over Frontline)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game in Years","review":"EA did a horrible job on this game. I cannot believe a respectable company such as EA Games, released such a disappointing product. Not only did they fail to scratch the surface of history regarding the pacific battle front, the parts they did attempt were vague.

The graphics are improved from Frontline and the music, as usual, is awesome. The weapons are basically the same except you don't get to use the BAR, which i missed, or the Colt .45, but the absence of those two guns is made up with the shotgun which is by far my favorite weapon in the game. There are only two drawbacks of this game. One, there is a certain Japanese character that comes at you with a sword. He runs at you and weaves and is very hard to shoot. If he manages to get you twice with his sword, your dead. And second, the game is very short. There are only 8 levels in this game but they are very in depth. The makers left a lot of questions unanswered. The whole plot of the game was for the main character trying to find is captured little brother, in the end of the game, he is never found and his status is unknown. But aside from those drawbacks, I would reccomend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product","review":"got the video game sooner than expected, was in excellent shape, exactly as described. will definitely order through Amazon again soon.

Compared to the others this is horrible, in every way. From the sound, the graphics, all the way down to the main menu. It is just not in the same class as the others. So if you liked the others I recommend saving your money if your expecting this one to be similar. Its not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I already own all of the other MOH's and this one is even better than them.

They have made several prestigous games, but this one is certainly laking. The game play is fun, but it is far to easy for the average FPS gamer. You would be much better off renting this game at blockbuster because it can be beaten in under three days by someone playing for two hours a day. When comparing this game with Call of Duty for PC there is no competition. Rising Sun is deficient in all catagories compared with Call of Duty. So save your money and by Call of Duty, because you will enjoy it more than Rising Sun. Overall this is a flashy game with good graphics and guns, but it lacks in every other catagory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel like inside the movie","review":"For those who love War Games, the Rising Sun is a great game.

After all, who doesn't like playing the same event (World War 2) 25 times?Anyway though, \\"Rising Sun\\" is an example of how a company can get away with making trash, and still have it get decent reviews, and have it sell well. \\"Rising Sun\\" is a horrid game, and is considered a letdown even to most Medal of Honor fans.\\"Rising Sun\\" does absolutely nothing new, with a series that had already been around for years, upon years. At the point of \\"Rising Sun\\" Medal of Honor was already considered an established series for Sony.Anyway, when it comes down to it, Medal of Honor's \\"Rising Sun\\" game is a disappointment on all levels. The gameplay is linear, and is often totally ridiculous, and the story is well.....nothing new either.Only pick up \\"Rising Sun\\" if you want yet another horrid first person shooter, with nothing special in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Stars of Single Player; 1 Star for Multiplayer","review":"Multiplayer for Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is absolutely a joke. Movement is horrendous (basically forward, backward, left, right with very little variation). Aiming is virtually impossible; one must just \\"pray and spray\\". The maps are extremely small and confining.Expecting multiplayer to be like SOCOM or SOCOM:II? Forget it. Try DOOM for PC circa 1995. In fact, the multiplayer is so bad, you can load up a game just to amuse your friends with how bad it is.Another thing: First Person shooters are, IMHO, better on PC platforms anyway. The aiming and movement with mouse and keyboard are A LOT more precise than with analog sticks and D-pads.For die-hard MOH fans only (of which I thought I was one...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more gameplay options...","review":"This game is just all right. We enjoy playing it on 4 player & teaming up. I wish there was an option for auto target or an option to see your man but there's not. The boards are a lot smaller on multiplayer.

The game is very short, for $50 price. I am a dad who only plays part-time and I completed this game with ease. The enemy seems to just stand and reload while I shoot them. There was not many levels, and they were easy to figure out. I would suggest spending your time and money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo HISSS","review":"This game STINKS... We have the first 2 Medal of Honor games, and with this one, they rearranged all the controls. And not for the better. They managed to make everything harder than necessary.The controls are very unnatural to use. They make no real sense. EA should have kept the old controls and concentrated on the gaphics. The graphics in RS are pretty good, but the whole game play makes little sense. All in all, if you havent played the first 2 MOH, buy them instead, if you have played the first 2, you will most likely be disappointed with Rising Sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half a game should be half price.","review":"Rising Sun is a pretty good game--except it's short. How short? Well, there are only eight missions here compared to Frontline's NINETEEN, which makes it half a game. Or actually less than half a game. I could understand if EA Games was up against the clock and had to push out a premature release, because like I said, Rising Sun (what there is of it) is pretty good. But they shouldn't be charging us full price for it. If they had released it at around 25 bucks and called it \\"Rising Sun--Volume One\\", then the reviews would've been a lot more positive. I also wish that the Pearl Harbor mission itself could have been longer, more involved. It lasts less than ten minutes and the game is in control of your movements nearly the whole time. My advice, rent it or wait for a price drop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly one of the worst games i have played","review":"week upon week i traveled up to the local video store hoping to get the new MOH and onee day it's there so i put it in the ps2 and it's kind of like the terminator... kill kill sometimes have a hard mission, the AI sucks the japs do nothing there accuracy is horrible even on the HARD difficulty level the extremely anti-climactic ending. WAY to easy i beat it in 1 day and took it back, no re-playability. back to its to easy, way to easy soooo many surgical packs and medicine cantines even a 8 year oild could beat this game..take my advice dont even rent this game,find a friend who has it and borrow it, i dont think they'll care it's so bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"What The !????","review":"I, too, waited a long time for this game to arrive and WOW, was I disappointed.

Very bad graphics by a first person shooter. Ugly, bland enviroments with bad atmosphere. Seems they went bachward from the first one.

Seems like EA simply wanted to pump out a follow-up to the hugely successful Frontline before people forgot about it (and in time for Christmas).

Although the graphics and sound score are great, using the controller on a PS2 is incredibly awkward and frustrating. I've never played a game even on a console where one thumb/joystick is for you to look up and down and the other one is to look left and right. Not to mention the reaction time is slow and unless there is an ability to increase the sensitivity of being able to strafe left and right faster there really is no point. Using a mouse on a PC allows you to use your whole hand to direct your line of fire rather than relying on your thumb. I feel robbed paying $50 for a game that I don't want to play anymore. If you have played Frontline you may like this game but if you are mainly a PC gamer like myself I'd wait and save your money until hopefully they put this game on the PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP","review":"Me and a friend of mine played Frontline for 2 weeks and couldn't put the controler down.

After about 6 or 7 levels, the game is over with a terrible climax. In MOH Frontline, you find the Nazi which you've been chasing for most of the game and kill him toward the end. However, in Rising Sun, you end up chasing this Japanese guy and never actually get to him. To me, it's obvious that the makers of this game were more worried to get this game out by Christmas time than to actually make a quality game, and rushed the end. Also, to beat this game, it takes absolutely no effort at all, even on hard difficulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"big mistake","review":"Don't even bother. I was so disappointed by the first two levels that i quickly resold it.

If you like shooter games buy SOCOM 2 for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Frontline is my all time favortie PS2 game, so I had really been looking forward to getting this game. All I can say is that the only thing this game shares with Frontline is the name \\"Medal of Honor\\". Boring game with lame levels and storyline make this game a terrific waste of money.

Six hours on an FPS is laughable. Half of that prblem is the AI. I don't know about you, but when I need to reload I try to take cover. Instead \\"they\\" go to an open area, stop, then start reloading. That isn't AI at all. The walking fungus in Mario was smarter.The weapon selection is a bit on the short side. I know it took place in WWII. I also know there was more than FIVE guns (a fire extinguisher doesn't count). Yeah, I can mount guns. They look a little different, but feel the same.

So if you're still crying about how short it is then either you don't have a life or you've been living under a rock. I just bought my copy for $19.95 at EB Games and that's a fair price for what you get.Another complaint that's often repeated in these reviews is how \\"stupid the enemy is\\", always running toward you. THAT'S WHAT JAPANESE SOLDIERS DID, you idiot! There not running toward you to shake your hand--they're trying to impale you with their bayonets! Get a clue.If you're a fan of World War II games (especially historically acurate World War II games), then Rising Sun should find a welcome home in your collection. It may be shorter than it's predecessor, Frontline, but the graphics, sound (THX!) and multi-player are definately an improvement. So get off your high-horse already and buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good- but too short and too easy","review":"ok, this game to me is very cool, as at the beggining you get to shoot down Zeros, cool graphics at the beggining and great sounds.i bought the game for 30 and so far i think it was worth the money. i bought it 3 days ago and im already on the 7th level.The japs are un-real, they run up to you and swing their sword at you, pull put a grenade and blow their heads off :)WEll, your team mates are stupid, The japs will control a built to the ground machine gun miles away. and your team mates would just stand there and shoot wi th a pistol. silly.great weapons, but you only get to use like 3 of them in 1 level so you do get bored of them. MOH frontline was good, but i think this beats it by a whisker :)multiplayer! good old multiplayer! 2 players - GREAT! 4 - players - you need glasses, the crosshairs are so small you need to be like 5cm away from the screen. i havn't played it online, and im not going to.i think, you should buy it, not sure? rent it then buy it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"best ive seen in a while","review":"medal of honor 2, is great there are a couple of hard levels othewise its crazy especially with the m1 garrand"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS GAME IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There is one level were you have to be stealthy and not get heard or youll get caught, well, I took out my loud gun and just started shooting all over and nobody came to fight me!!

But after that the game got bad. Mainly due to the fact that they pumped you up so well with the first mission, and then the rest of the game was quiet and slow.And, they continued the quiet and slow theme. Overall, even multiplayer doesn't redeem this game, too few people playing together, no co-op, nothing...Don't waste your money.Also, to kyle on this page with the big long review, there is no D-Day because A: it was in Frontlineand B: This is the pacific theater, not the European. D-Day took place on the shores of France, no where near the pacific islands that this game takes place in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rent it!","review":"After playing and loving MOH Frontline for many many hours, I could not wait to get my hands on this game.Unfortunately, it was a big letdown. Not that it's a bad game, it's not. It's just that in comparison to the last MOH game it comes up short. Gameplay is clumsy and awkward. The jungle folliage is frustrating to navigate.It's obvious that EA didn't spend the time they needed to in order to work the bugs out.I also agree that it's way too short and way to easy.Play it, but rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medal of Honor: Rising Sun","review":"This game was a big flop!!! It did not live up to Frontline. The enemies are truely idiotic. They will do suicidal charges, which are really annoying.You also have to shoot several times before they die.The graphics look pretty pathetic.

You even can shoot down planes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good","review":"This game was not nearly as good as FRONTLINE. When you get shot, it takes away more health than necessary.

I had high expectations due to its predecessor, Medal of Honor Frontline. This game was a huge disappointment to say the least. You start out sleeping in a bunk below deck on a naval ship in Pearl Harbor. The Japanese attack, and you need to get to the top of the ship and fight them off while you escape. So, the beginning of this game is not too bad, and I was mildly interested in the gameplay. Then things went downhill. I can sum it up with one sentence: Before I knew what was happening, I was done with the game. Yes, that is right: this game is so short it is not even worth the $ price tag. I beat it in about 7 hours, and that includes taking bathroom breaks and eating meals.Summary (out of 10)Graphics: 5Controls: 5Story: 3Gameplay: 2Overall: 3If you want a good military shooter, try Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Medal of Honor Frontline.

So I bought it on the day it came out. That is when the trouble began. I would get halfway through a turn when the game would crash. I waited until the first patch came out and downloaded it with no improvement. So then I posted on the tech support forum at the game website and got a pretty quick response that my sound card was too outdated and wasn't supported (in all fairness that part was true). So I went out and bought a brand new SB Audigy 2 sound card. When I tried to run the game I would get completely through the first turn and it would crash at the end this time. So when I posted to tech support again they told me that I shouldn't have bought a Audigy 2 sound card, that they have issues. So I sold the game on Ebay. Buyer beware...."},{"rating":"1","title":"So close","review":"I really wanted to like this game but it's just too slow and limited. (Read the other comments on this.) If you're an utterly diehard wargamer who doesn't mind sitting there while the AI makes all manner of moves might be OK will this. This can't be overstated... following every turn you could eat a meal while waiting on the AI to do its thing. The obnoxious thing is unless you sit and watch you might miss something critical. I couldn't imagine what it would be like with one or more human opponents. Plus as other comments have stated there are the built-in scenerios and that's it. The game's just not worth learning to hack alternatives.This game should've been so much more. Even just having an option of fast turns with end-phase balloons with blurbs of what happened in each area even would've been enough for me.Two overall stars for being so close and the work that must've gone in to create it.

We have used it many times since then and I haven't had any issues with anything falling apart as some other reviewers said. It seems to have stood the test of time well.

We have 4 pieces of Hey's luggage and over the course of 3 flights in one year 3 out of the 4 pieces have broken. We wrote off the first incident as rough handling on behalf of the airline. The retracting handle was bent, kinked and unable to retract. Second incident was a huge dent in the corner, and a crack. Now just having returned from another trip, our third piece has had the retracting handle broken. The polycarbonate around the handle shattered, and the mechanism in the handle broken. And yes the polycarbonate looks sharp but is very susceptible to scuffs, scratches and marking so don't expect your shiny new luggage to look that way for long.If you really need ultra lightweight luggage this may be the way to go but the trade off is too large for me, what's the point of lightweight if it cannot stand up to the rigors of travel? 3/4 over 3 trips is just too high of a fail rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst customer service ever","review":"I have had to replace both my sets of Heys luggage...more than once. The single handle bar is not strong enough to take the stress of more than 30 pounds of luggage. The handle will break. The suitcases crush in when handled by airlines. The stitching will rip apart. The knob used to depress the handle will stop working. And Heys will tell you that the damage is not covered by their 5-year replacement warranty, after you have driven 40 minutes to one of their authorized repair centers. Then they will offer to wholesale you a new suitcase, which would be a waste of money, considering that this luggage is designed to break. When the company actually did replace on of my six suitcases purchased from them, they sent me the most hideous bright orange case, to clash with my pink and blue sets. This company is a nightmare to deal with.

The author makes several false statements in the first few pages and when he makes the ridiculous claim that the F-15C can accelerate to supersonic speeds in a vertical climb, I am forced to doubt every statement he makes in the remainder of the book.

It's basically a collection of quotes from newspapers that play up India's prospects in IT and software--that's all.

It will have to go on the shelf with one of my favorite albums of all time. Musically the songs jump around a bit, but there is a common thread of background sounds and gorgeous drums march us through the land of Dani Siciliano's smooth/harsh/soft/sharp soulful-poppy-spooky vocal shifting, a bit reminiscent at times of Roisin Murphy's vocal style(s). I'm not going to say \\"who came first?\\" I am just saying, this CD is similar to work in the same bloodline, such as that of Roisin Murphy and Moloko and Matthew Herbert and if you're into all that, you'll be way into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste.","review":"If this album had never been released - no one would have been worse off for it. Ten seconds after the CD came to the end, I could not remember one note of one song from the entire album. What I do remember - is eagerly expecting for the CD to end.

I have found no better chair than this one for all the work that I do at my desk. This chair allows me to stretch all the way across and around my desk with ease, quickly shift position for multi-tasking, and keeps my posture correct. I first thought the lack of a back on this chair would be a detriment and I would hate it, but almost immediately I fell in love with the way it put me into the correct seated posture. By keeping my legs at a lower angle, rather than the typical 90 degree angle of regular chairs, it pulled the pressure away from my back and put it on the hips where my seated pressure needed to be.I highly recommend this chair to any who can afford it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The series just keeps on getting better and better","review":"The seventh and final book of the Jonathan Argyll series by Iain Pears comes after his success with the complex historical thriller 'An Instance Of The Fingerpost', a book totally different from these art mysteries, and far more ambitious. This is not to say that the Jonathan Argyll series is not excellent: it, in fact, keeps getting better and better. Weaving a traditional flair for crime writing with considerable knowledge of the history of art, Pears writes an effortlessly intriguing mystery.This particular volume takes a turn when it appears that Flavia's boss, General Bottando, may be involved in the latest art crime swindle himself. The book is not predictable and keeps you guessing and is very enjoyable if not as spellbindingly clever as 'An Instance of The Fingerpost'. Well worth as read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is also an excellent history book","review":"Ibn Khaldun was not always remembered as a historian, but anyone who reads Muqaddimah will surely be surprised.I recommend this book for those who are starting to explore the halls of Islamic legacy since it gives a solid foundation on the philosophy of history itself. He will recite numerous historical events around Ifriqiyyah (Northern Africa) and Andalus (Islamic Iberian Peninsula) in the medieval era. What's more is that each event will be given a socio-scientific comments that add up to his unique historical framework.The historical details are termed to be the first with encyclopedia-scope and his approach is considered multi-disciplinary in time where speciality is rare.Buy it and you'll be amazed by how much you didn't know about Ibn Khaldun."},{"rating":"2","title":"anthropology and sociology","review":"This is a must read for individuals interested in sociology, anthropology, and history.

After reading Ibn Khaldun, I found that in fact it was he who came up with theory four centuries before Mr. Laffer. I believe all the economics text book should make necessary changes to acknowledge Ibn Khaldun's work. This book remarkably illustrates the Islamic philosophy behind the State Management and Decision-Making. Ibn Khaldun's original work in over 1200 pages.

There is no risk when you hit a power shot...there's no reason not to always drive w/ the power shot on. The 3 click swing penalized you by making the margin for error greater. 2004 just lets you bring the joystick back and then foward. Why would they do this? It's totally ruined. Tiger Woods 2001 for PS1 is better. Any child can pick up this game and score a -7, putting is quite stupid as well.

The research, attention to detail, sense of place and characterization are as usual top notch. He takes you \\"there\\"; you can see, hear, smell, taste, feel ... his descriptive powers have no rival.On the negative side this particular outing is hindered by a rush ending; I guess the book was getting to long or the deadline was approaching. But in the last 50 or so pages ten years go by and the story abruptly ends. Also in recent books and this is no exception the violence and sex scenes are becoming more graphic and numerous.

This time I couldn't wait for it to end.I suppose it is fortunate then that Mr. Smith simply gave up in the last 50 pages and rushed through 10 years of history with all the skill of a high school author. At least the pace put a quick death to the lingering illness of the first 300 pages.Unbelievable characters, absurd sex scenes and unlikely meetings amongst the protoaganists and their always faithful, never wavering, long suffering but still ebullient slaves make this the worst of an otherwise impressive body of work by Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was not like new.

To me he has been an excellent story teller. But this novel is among his worst if not the worst he has written. Among the many flaws are poor character development, improbable plot twists and gratuitous sex scenes that lend little if anything to the story. He, his editors and publishers let us down on this one. It is not worth the hardback price, or even the paperback price. Wait until it comes to your local library. In the meantime you are not missing a thing. What a disappointment to loyal fans who have in the past revered most of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a triupmh","review":"I have read all of the family of books and this is the weakest. Poor character development, minimal suspence in the story line and the ending seems to be that Wilbur got tired and stopped writing. No where near the quality of the earlier stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of Wilbur Smith's best efforts","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers , this is certainly a very pathetic work of literature by an author that i have always held in high esteem . I have read and reread every one his previous books , but never felt so badly as this one .this book failed to evoke any excitement , a lot of the outcome seem to have been a foregone conclusion . there really was no great climax and the surprises were really nasty ones .I dont think this book will endear this author to his demanding readers ."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best ever","review":"I just immersed myself in the story. Smith is at the zenith of his storytelling skills. I was involved with the characters and gasped at each new horror they had to endure. I groaned with dismay when bull elephants were slaughtered. And I hated it all to end. Can't say I felt that the ending was rushed as some readers did, but I'll have to consider that. I did appreciate the epilogue where he wrapped up lives of the historical and fictional characters seamlessly. Write on Wilbur!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"This historical novel of the battles between the English and Arab tribes for the Sudan in the 1880s is wonderfully written. While this is a weighty tome, it does not drag. Smith has a wonderful way with words and is not hesitant to describe extreme violence or sexual scenes in detail, so this is not a book for the squeamish on either of those counts. The plotting was tight and the characters were wonderfully drawn. My only criticism is that the ending is a bit rushed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph of the Sun","review":"Absolutely gripping from start to finish.

From the entire 3/4+ of the book taking place in a matter of months, the last 1/4 of the book spans an indeterminate time, but it seemed like at least a decade.Overall, I think Wilbur could have found a better way to end the book than that strange time warping way.I also found it unusual that the two main male characters must have married young girls 1/2 their age - I know that people married younger in the old days, but the girls age and gap seemed extreme to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"from the uncle","review":"this was a very good book with lots of facts about Elvis. this book is written by uncle vester so I know it is true. it is a fast read because it is hard to put down once you start.

Lots of dumb teenagers named bought my record and were upset when the rest of the songs weren't punk rawk at all but friendly, unoffensive poprock. Now here it is in 2003 and the hot new thing is garage rock and emo so I think I'm going to put out a new single that sounds like garage rock, cut my hair and wear a Thursday shirt in the video so people know that I'm really \\"down.\\" Buy our record.

I was expecting American Hi-Fi's second CD to evolve much like Incubus did in their second album, Make Yourself, but I was dead wrong. \\"Flavor of the Week\\" was just another bubble-gum punk song, and \\"The Art of Losing\\" is no different. Am I really supposed to believe that just because there's swearing in this album the band has grown up?? Gimme a break. This band should change its name to American Douchebags.

I read in the Amazon review that one of the songs contain lyrics from Stacey Whatever concerning an attempt to get his My Bloody Valentine, and Pixies album back. Please dude, don't write about real bands any more, you totally discredit them (what with your apparent extensive music collection it makes me believe you are spreading everything thin, and you've completely missed the essence of good music). Oh yeah, why are Top 40 bands such as this (see also Good Charlotte, Sum 41, Blink 182, etc.) being called Punk? I'm not usually negative, but this is such a blatant capitalistic commercial business endeavor preying on impressionable young minds, it makes me sick and deserves to be called out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but great","review":"American Hi-Fi's new album, The Art of Losing, is definitely a different sound than their first self-titled CD. However, it's a good different; the songs are catchier and more upbeat, and the variety is better also. If you liked the first CD, you won't be disappointed with the second... the tunes might be a bit more raw, but the same AHF feel is present under the new changes.

My favorites on this particular CD are \\"Art of Losing,\\" \\"Breakup Song,\\" \\"Nothing Left to Lose,\\" \\"The Gold Rush,\\" and \\"Built for Speed\\" (when you have that many favorites off of one CD, you know it's a good one!). Their new CD \\"Hearts on Parade\\" will be released by Maverick in April 2005 - and I highly recommend that one too (based on a pre-release EP we bought at the show).

Every song made me even more a fan than the one before. Now, with their release of their second album \\"The Art of Losing\\" the mind blowing continues. With their first single titled the same as the album, catching on airwaves Hi-Fi is back in business. You have your slower songs like \\"This is the Sound\\" and the go happy sounds of \\"Nothing Left to Loose\\" which takes a turn and almost makes you want to laugh at the whittyness of their humor, as you rock out to the beat. Then you come to \\"The Break up Song\\" and \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" which seem to be everyone's favorties including mine, and I can see why. How can you not love them.

This CD combines the personalities perfectly in a completely infamous, unparalleled mixed.Tracks are split into equally divisible intervals. At the time, properly queueing the tracklist was impossible so dense was his mixing. Maybe that was just superstition, or marketing.

After reading the book, I wish it was available ten years ago when I started handicapping. The book covers many aspects of handicapping from both handicapper and owner perspectives. The book's treatment of trainers and claiming race conditions is good. Other books like the aforementioned books by Ainslie, Quinn and Mitchell are good, but talk about races at the highest level. The author's use of races from a smaller track, EmD, makes this book relevant to the 90% of American race going fans who follow smaller tracks and lower level races.

I bought it, listened to it - and simply laughed (really!!):It sounds like a parody, something like Peter Sellers's version of \\"She loves you yeah-yeah-yeah\\" with a German accent. Imagine a dignified English lady singing about the cotton fields in \\"Summertime\\" right in the middle of her 5 o'clock tea. This is exactly how Kiri sounds like. The matter is, that she does it seriously, on her part (so it seems; there was no allusion to the opposite).If you ask me, leave Kiri to her unforgetable Schubert (Ave Maria), Canteloube (Auvergne songs) and Villa-Lobos (Bachianas Brazilleras no. 5), and leave Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\" to the unforgetable Louis and Ella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bland and representative at once (3.5 stars)","review":"The New Zealand soprano brings out the Gershwin music how it was supposed to be. That's nice. The great composer wrote his numbers for theatrical shows and this CD captures that mood perfectly. True, the interpretations of Dame Kiri sport a certain level of sameness, yet I dare say the spirit of Gershwin is captured in all its vibrancy and vigor, mostly in the tunes like \\"Things Are Looking Up\\", \\"Love Walked In\\" and \\"I Got Rhythm\\". Certainly, this is no Ella Fitzgerald, whose interpretations once and again probed large depths of the beautiful melodies. But if you are going for a Gershwin in a musical, Broadway kind of mode, this will fit you almost certainly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money back?","review":"Sure...you'd get the natural feeling, BECAUSE THEY BREAK!

The huge building he talks about opening is still not open eight years later despite the Dream Center accepting millions in contributions. It was Phil Aguilar, not Matt Barnett, who came up with the name Dream Center and created the Adopt-a-Block program (the most important Dream Center program).

The artwork is detailed and much action is hidden in the pictures for those who look carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinity book","review":"Actually I did not buy this book for me but for my grandson who is 12 and his mom who is a math teacher. I was not intrigued by it enough to even finish reading it --my husband read it and said he thought it was not very useful to him as he didn't need any help in understanding the concept of infinity. When I showed it to my grandson -he immediately sat down and read it through. I told him that I intended to return it but he thought it was cool and took it home with him. So I guess it might be useful for middle school kids or maybe a school library. There really isn't much to it; at least that was my impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsuitable for any age","review":"I was really disappointed by this book,and I've never felt the urge to pan another's work before.The author has written some fine books in the past, but this is a tiny production with 60 small pages, including title page, table of contents etc, mostly bizarre drawings (someone must like them, I guess),and mainly large print of such sentences as \\"Number One Million Two Hundred Thirty-Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty-Six moves to Room 1,234,567\\" which take up a large proportion of the text on some pages. And the single concept of the entire book is Hilbert's hotel with its infinite number of rooms. It seems to be adressed to curious 6-year-olds, but I can't imagine them reading it. Don't buy this book without looking at it closely first. (I am over thirteen!

In reality, the coast is a pretty dull, straight-line affair, pounded by surf that makes it difficult to paddle too close to shore. (I prefer the craggy coastlines of New England or the Pacific Northwest.)

The only somewhat fun part is the bonus features you can unlock by collecting the way too numerous light crystals.

I have twin boys, so I need double the bottles no matter where I go. Basically, long story short, when the desciption said it would fit \\"standard\\" bottles, I figured I was using the right type. Apparently, Avent bottles are not \\"standard.\\" This cooler wants tall, skinny bottles, but unfortunately I (and everyone else I know) use short, stalky bottles. I think this product was designed a long time ago when tall, skinny bottles were popular. If you use Dr. Browns, I'm sure they would fit (although they might be too tall), BUT... if you use Avent, Tommie Tippy, etc... then look else where. I'm pretty disappointed. I will continue my search, I guess. On the up side, the price here is cheaper than Babies-R-Us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case","review":"Been using for about a month.

It holds 5 bottles for us -- we are right now packing two 9oz Avent bottles, and three 4oz Avent bottles every day -- so we lay one of the 4oz bottles on it's side. We use this in tandem with the Medela Ice Pack and it works like a charm everyday.The only complaint is that the zippers get stuck once in a while on the puffy white inside linings, but just be mindful so you don't get the zipper stuck or accidentally rip up the white lining/insulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a decent bottle cooler","review":"I got this cooler so that I could pack 4 nighttime bottles for my twins. It claims it can hold 6 bottles, and while that is possible there is NO room in the main compartment for any ice packs when doing that. The makers of this cooler expect you to ONLY put ice packs in the top zipper compartment. However, that won't keep the bottles cool enough in my opinion. So since we only ever pack 4 bottles we stick an ice pack on the bottom of the main compartment and stand an ice block upright in the middle (with 2 bottles on each side). This works perfectly to keep all 4 bottles cold throughout the night.We have used 4 oz Dr. Browns standard bottles and 9 oz Playtex Ventaire bottles and they fit fine. However, 8 oz Dr. Browns bottles may be a little too tall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for daycare","review":"This bag is perfect for my two-month old baby's daily feeding at day care. I put my pumped breast milk bottles in there (6 five ounce-bottles) and the cooling gel on top or in between the bottles. I can also add two or three more bottles if I lay them on top. I looked everywhere for something practical, given that I also have a toddler at daycare, for whom I tried different types of bags that would smell as soon as milk would get in the bag... I would recommend it. The strap is long enough that I can carry this bag, the toddler's milk bag, the two diapers bags, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"My go-to bag","review":"I've accumulated quite a few bottle bags, from buying a breast pump and two diaper bags. This one beats them all. The height and width works great for my Dr. Brown's tall bottles. Best of all, the liner is easy to clean and won't leak.

Initially it was difficut to get a clean signal, but opening the case and turning up the output (see other reviews for instuctions) fixed that immediately. It's still not CD quality sound, but hey, it's an FM transmitter, it's gonna sound a little radio-y. Turn the laptop and stereo volume about halfway up and adjust the transmitter input level dial until you get good sound.

I didn't even hestitate or have to think twice about buying them for my son when he reached the 3rd grade. There are times when parents can't convince their child that other kids have the same problems they do and that's where Blume's stories can help. She reaches out to kids on all the biggies; divorce, religion, obesity, popularity, etc. and she does so in a light hearted manner, nothing too heavy.As for P. D.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Young girls","review":"I thought that Judy Blume is a great writer, I loved her style, and the first time I read one of her books was: \\"Dear God, it's me margaret\\" Judy put into words all the stuff that some parents find hard to discuss with their kids.

I loved this boxed set, and so does my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"I read all these books when I was younger, and I have to say, they still hold up. Blume writes honestly, openly and humorously about things we've all dealt with -- growing up, family problems, moving to a new town, and making (and breaking) friendships.

It is filled with self-promotion (there is a reference to buy her \\"other\\" book in almost every chapter) and random anecdotes about her own life, but very little tangible information to help its readers. It almost seems as though she's using the pages as personal therapy. Don't be fooled by the number of pages listed for the book either--many of them are taken up by exceedingly similar (and some are actually repeated) one-cell \\"comics\\"; when you take away the blank pages and other wasted space, there is very little written material in this book. Even then, much of it is regurgitated information from other quoted sources. If you really want to read this book, borrow it from your local library or university, as I did.

The basic hallmarks of an EA game are not there - graphics, animation, gameplay.It's a pity because the game had promised so much - and in terms of having the licenses, teams, players etc it is a fantastic update of the first rugby game. Unfortunately it is unbearable to play. The players look wrong and move unnaturally. The control system is frustrating. It is hard to co-ordinate your team. I could go on.I'm sure with some more time, this could have been an excellent rugby game. My view is that it has probably been rushed through to be in the shops in time for the world cup.Here's hoping that EA will be back with a decent stab at a rugby game in the not too distant future.

Not worth the money. It did nothing to moisturize my hair, and is only useful as a perfume.

I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product.

However, I didn't see any changes in my daughter's hair after using this conditioner. NONE. It is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly.

By eating compatible foods, one naturally reduces acidic wastes and balances body pH accordingly. What I like about this approach is that it provides a nice compromise between those authors who tell us food combining is unnecessary and those who want to have 6 different categories of foods that can't be combined.

Just watch the movie \\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\" I think it was inspired by this book.Lastly, there is a quasi-scientific attempt to explain how a rapid and drastic change in the global climate could occur. This would produce a global storm of biblical proportions that could usher in a new Ice Age. This would happen in a matter of months and not years (or decades).Mildly interesting but, keep in mind: neither of these authors has any real credentials.

Taken purely on a fictional basis, I would still give this book one star. The book is filled with glaring grammatical and stylistic mistakes that are not acceptable in a published work such as this.The book is also infuriatingly repetitive. The authors run out of material around page 100 and resort to beating their point into the ground for the next 186 pages. In all honesty, I do not recall a single new idea presented after the 100 page mark.I was very disappointed with this book and do not recommend it, unless you decide to read only the first 100 pages and conduct your own research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the nearest library?","review":"Being a storm lover, I eagerly anticipated receiving and reading this book.

The premise is global warming is melting the ice caps sending fresh water into the world's oceans and adversely affecting the ocean currents which in turn cause the earth's climate to change. Mr. Strieber and Mr. Bell are not scientists and it shows. Facts are in very short supply in this fast-reading book. There are no references or bibliography to support their case.

But his doom and gloom prophecies based on psuedo-science is a tad bit overdone as of late. Now that I see that Y2K has come and passed without a hitch I have now become completely disenchanted with the whole END OF THE YEAR stuff! ENOUGH ALREADY! Art Bell has juiced us enough with his apocalypse scenerios and this book should be the last chapter. If your an Art Bell listeners you might enjoy this book, but if you're tired of the whole y2k, buy gold, baygen radio, and can goods then don't take a look at this book, rather check into the Urantia Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pseudo-scientific dreck","review":"This book contains all the hallmarks of the worst pseudoscience: no references or clear citations, misnomers galore (the Sphinx is NOT a monolith, which implies it is made of a single (mono) stone (lithic), the works cited are by well-known and thoroughly debunked authors like graham hancock. (they make me give it one star -- no zero option)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I enjoy a good \\"wacko\\" theory book as much as the next person, but this book is a travesty. Arguments and assertions are made and never followed up. Veiled hints are made but never proven. Planetary cycles are alluded to but never stated succinctly. The writing is slack and there is no intellectual rigor. Even the layout of the book is a sham -- the already thin text is heavily spaced between lines (leaded, in book trade lingo) to fill up the pages. If you're looking for a good alternative science book that piques the curiosity -- Could this really be true? -- you won't find it here. Whitley Strieber and Art Bell really ought to be ashamed for foisting off such as poor effort as \\"a book.\\" If you're looking for a fascinating volume on possible climatic change, try \\"The Change in the Weather\\" by William K. Stevens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable fiction, but not good science","review":"This book takes yelling, \\"Fire!\\" in a crowd to a new level. Using a combination of vague references to unknown writers, clearly slanted style, and half-science, this book is clearly commercial in intent and seeks to capitalize on the \\"Sky is falling\\" mentality that was so evident before Y2K. The authors are more interested in making money than real science, so save your money unless you just want a provacative story about what if the weather really did go crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction or Non-fiction?","review":"Though this book is fascinating, some of the content poses questions. For example, on Page 24, the authors refer to a terrible ice superstorm in Australia with temperatures of 12 degrees celsius. We double-checked and confirmed this is about 64 degrees farenheit. Pretty warm for an ice storm! Without being too picky, the balance of the book is balanced between describing catastrophic storm scenarios and cautionary warnings based on historical events taken out of context."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL RESEARCHED, BACKED BY EVIDENCE","review":"I found that Bell's and Strieber's use of historical eras to show when, where, and how past ice ages and climate shifts have happened supports their hypothesis rather well, especially their use of scientists and meteorlogical data showing how the ice caps have lost nearly 40% of their surface since the 1970's. It clearly shows that this could take form given the right set of conditions at the right time. Only time will tell if the nations of the world will take action against this burgeoningthreat to humanity's welfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling, but it's still fiction, folks!","review":"I just love this kind of stuff! It's so exciting to read all this information brought together to support a scenario, but then, it never really turns out the way the book said it would. Remember thirty-five years or so ago when African Genesis and Territorial Emperitive (I think the author's name was Robert Audrey) came out? It was a long time ago but the facts brought together were so compelling -- and over the next couple of decades it was repeatedly bashed with some saying it had been debunked. The problem with these kind of books is not to accept everything as accurate until some period of time has passed and the thesis played out a bit. Of course according to this book, many of us wouldn't be here any more! But Mr.Bell and Mr.Strieber have written a very, very interesting and readable book and I congratulate them hearily on their success."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War Within","review":"The War Within was the best book i have ever read.

If you are looking for multi-player action then look for something else.Pros: I guess the music would be the only thing that would be a pro would be the music, but even that didn't catch my attention.Cons: This game doesn't really have any depth. The Japanese visual effects are not very pleasing and give it a very cheesy look. The multi-player leaves nothing to be excited about since it has only one mode.Result: If you want a multi-player party game, you are still going to have to get games like WarioWare and Mario Party 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I got it as a Christmas present for someone but I already know it's a great game & it came right away. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the arcade version","review":"This game is nothing like the arcade version.

Therefore this is probably not Wado Ryu Karate as you have seen it before (it wasn't to me). With due respect to expressions of individualism, please mark the book so readers will know.

Anyone who knows a little bit about what the Okinawan pinans look like, will tell you this is false. Thompson still uses the Wado versions of pinan shodan, yondan and godan but his versions of pinan nidan and sandan resemble shotokan moves.Inadequate- For example, how he describes the cat stance. In the book he states the weight distribution should be 60% back leg but the picture shows Thompson doing a different type of cat stance. In Wado, there's side-viewing cat stance and normal cat stance, but the reader would never know that because the book doesn't state the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"For A Relaxing Night Time","review":"Warm and cozy sound with Paul's sax fits especially in a relaxing night time.All instruments sound warm and together with a little slow tempo, it must soothe you when you need a comfort in times of stress and feel a lack of energy.Or it also help you slowing down when rushing into something."},{"rating":"2","title":"paul desmond \\"pure desmond\\"","review":"this is paul desmond's ABSOLUTE BEST album. all cuts are excellent. one will never get tired of listening to this album. a must have in your collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot to learn about the great Woman here.","review":"It is without doubt that Ms Hughes is great historian, knows her subject as well as it is possible to do and has researched Elliot thoroughly from a range of complex and interesting sources.I would have personally expected the book to be a little tidier and to have greater flow and life than it does.

Still you cannot fail to learn much of this great Woman and the inspiration for her great works, from this weighty work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is the most horrible book for teaching math I have ever seen! It is totally without any merit as a reference for the children to follow when trying to work at home and relies heavily on teachers knowing the subject and being able to teach it to ALL students. There are NO building blocks much less any explainations as to what the kids are supposed to be learning in it or how to even perform any of the requested tasks. I do not recommend this book for ANY school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great product its better than going to your doctor where people know and will judge you.

It's not a bad album, but it lacks the edge, the attitude, the wildness of records like \\"Ah Um\\", \\"Blues & Roots\\" and \\"Mingus, Mingus, Mingus, Mingus\\". You can clearly hear that this is Mingus' compositions and arrangements, there are some decent solos too, but it just doesn't have the... the... soul, go and joyful wild attitude that, to me, is what Charles Mingus is about. It feels a bit like \\"Mingus goes easy listening\\" or something... Way to clean and sort of laid back for my liking!I'm not a jazz expert in any way, but Mingus is the one who brought me in to it, and this is not the Mingus I learned to know.

I fell in love with the characters and was enchanted with the story line. I could not put the book down. What is more is the new understanding of broken, biracial families I have recieved after finishing it. The only downfall I found when i read this book was with the ending.

Other than that, it was excellant, and I would recommend it to anyone with interrest of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"biracialism","review":"This excellent novel provides insight into issues of race and biracialism, of particular interest in this presidential election.Barack Obama has addressed some of the complications--there is much more to be said.I read a library copy for my book club, but ordered this for a neighbor, who has just completed her junior year of high school, whose father is white and mother is black (British).

This is one book that doesn't gloss over that."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent first novel.","review":"I thought this book was fantastic, its a smooth read and is extremely interesting.

However, this book was one of the most boring books I've ever read. No one else in my book club even bothered to finish it.

One positive comment: I did grow attached to the little girl who narrates the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah, right","review":"I don't care what the reviews say. This book was totally unreadable. The language is so simplistic and contrived. I mean, let's talk about Elemeno.

Get real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional. This is her first novel? What's next?!","review":"I couldn't put it down. It was so real...all the things you notice about your parents, their inadequacies, and in this case, their prejudices...the distancing as siblings grow up, how racial issues so completely permeate the lives of young children so quickly, despite the best efforts of some. And then, toward the end, a choice. How did Cole and Birdie choose to define themselves? For Birdie, her definition was her family, and that ultimately made for a good ending. I cried like a baby when she found her sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book --a must read.","review":"CAUCASIA was one the best books that I have read in a long time. As a person who lived in the Boston area during the the 70's, the author provided me with so many windows and mirrors of what was happening during those years. I couldn't put the book down. I couldn't wait to finish the book and then when I did, I wanted more. This book should be on every high school's reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So book","review":"I had to read this book for a class and it was a complete waste of my time. The author mixes up the historical facts she tries to highlight as important and does not end the book. It is very clear that this was a first effort and the book had a rookie editor as well.If you don't care about technical details being correct and don't mind a very childish writing style, you should like this book. Just don't expect an ending, because it is not there in any shape or form. And as a bi-racial person who grew up during the times portrayed, I was very very disappointed. As a scholar, I was even more dismayed that this is being passed off as well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"(...)","review":"This is the best book to explain and understand family values and realitionship between the family members. Danzy clearly illustrats the bonding between two sisters, and how important it is for the family to stay togather while childeren are young. This book also describes the problems one had to go through if a couple was of two different races just a couple of years ago. And how difficult it is for the childeren to adjust to an enviroment of hte school where you are the only white. Later in the book Danzy also tells how difficult it is for a young a child to hide its idantity from its friends, and tell them you are somebody that you are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, From Start To Finish!","review":"This book was unbelievable! I have never given myself so fully to a novel. The experiences amoung the characters were trully, realistic. Senna spoke up for all of us 'mixed kids' out there. With the weight of two worlds on our shoulders, this book has become a documentary on what its like to live in that situation. Thank You!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Storytelling","review":"I have to give Ms. Senna respect for this book. For it to have been her very first book the writing was brilliant and the storytelling was captivating. This is truly a coming of age tale that shouldn't be skipped out on as a reader. I felt a lot of times I was right there in the moment with the characters in every setting. The Birdie Lee character really touched my heart in more ways than one. She was the perfect survivor and I'll go as far as saying a heroine. My only knock on the book I'm use to many reads of mine having a resolve at the end. When it came to Birdie's mother I would had liked to know what she was running from. However I'm sure the author wanted to leave that open ended for the readers to decide for themselves why Birdie's mother went on the run. Other than that, I would highly recommend to all individuals, particularly those who take sociology course(s) in college or reading for the pure enjoyment. It is simply one hell of a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the disco cd I thought it would be!","review":"It is pretty standard Christmas fare with a disco beat backing it up.

When it hits the glass, you hear a clank on the glass rather than a thump. The players look 100% genuine in realism, and the gameplay is about as close to virtual reality as you're going to get.

I have most of the EA games before this one and I really like them. So I rented this one, and thank God I only rented it. I hate this game. It wont save settings, passing in the game is incredibly stupid, and it will edit your lines automaticly if you sim any games. Plus the controls suck something fierce. If you like hockey than stick with NHL 2003 and pray that NHL 2005 is a lot better. Plus I only gave the game one star because there was no option to give it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why??","review":"ok, why would they make a hockey game like this. Sure the graphics,and music are good. And thats about it. And i know that we all like a hard hitting hockey game but this sucks. You cant skate 2 feet without being dropped, which really pisses you off. and the passing, its hard. And if you want to set up a one timer you cant, your guy will just skate on by it. And the controls are ok, but if you want to go a different direction you cant and youll just start going in a circle. Well the only thing left is i hope ea makes a better hockey game next year because getting hit in the head with a hammer is more fun than playing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me NHL '95 or '97 on Sega Genesis over this...","review":"I rented this because I accidentally thought it was the NHL2K3 series which has turned into the ESPN hockey series. I started to play and notice the extreme lack of control in the game. The basic ICE camera mode stops about 20 feet away from the goalie so scoring is kinda rough in the beginning. Comparing this to last year's NHL2K3 is pathetic...2K3 is smooth and total control when this one seems more graphics oriented but no playability. I live and die with the playability and this lack makes me want to play NHL 95 or 97 two of the best Hockey Games ever because of ... you guessed it , the playability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I always wait for the EA NHL Series. How disappointing!!! The use of the analog stick makes it ackward and very hard. The defense on this is horrible. I will never out shoot the other team. The least EA could have done was to leave the player controls in the D-pad. They made this game very tiring and frustrating to play unlike the old games, which you didn't seem to be dominated every time even against weak teams.Better luck next year EA and get rid of the analog control."},{"rating":"1","title":"NHL 2004 controls are crap!","review":"I have purchased NHL 2004 for the ps2, the graphics are great the special features great. But gaming controls suck!!!!in one hour of game play using having to use the analog, I have spranded my thumb. Also the players are too slow, for example if you playing the computer player, they move 50 times faster than you. the best i could do in one hour of play was get 4 shots on net and thats shooting from center ice and the computer in the ps2 has like 80 to 120 shots on me per game!! It was the biggests waste of money I ever spent. Buy ESPN Hockey 2K4."},{"rating":"2","title":"My disappointment grows","review":"I have been a long supporter of EA sports and their hockey franchise. I wanted them to create a more challenging game which NHL 2004 is, but htey did the one thing I wished they would never do, they changed the control system. My biggest gripe, YOU HAVE TO USE THE ANALOG STICK. Now I as an old school gamer has lived and died by my directional pad. This one alteration made it very difficult to control.Number 2, the supposed advanced control setup, when you set up one side of the puck's control's, it alters the design for the opposite side and when you try and fix it, it alters the other side again. I just found these changes absolutely damaging to the franchise that has prided itself on easy to use controls. It is a decent game for those who like the analog but I rarely use it and to be forced and have no choice, turns me off to this game, hence why I only gave it three stars.Later,IsleStyle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Hockey Game Ever - EA Sports SUCKS","review":"I recommend Sega's ESPN NHL Hockey over this game.

The controls will drive you insane, EA needs to learn that more controls does not nesscarily make a better game.Second the gameplay has actually found a way to be worse then 2003. Slow and erratic movements, impossible checking make this game just as bad if not worse then 2003.

I felt that it was time for \\"medium\\" mode. I played a few of exhibition games on \\"medium\\" and managed a win in one out of three. The New York Islanders was the only team I could beat. I figured that if most of these games would be nailbiters, I'd be fine with that, so I plunged into Season mode. Here I cannot score a goal if my life depended on it. For a \\"medium\\" setting, it seems like it's on the hardest setting. Your entire team, when not under your control, plays like they're from the minor leagues: they skate away from loose pucks, they skate away from obvious passes, your goal-tender is a gimp when compared to the computers. Meanwhile the CPU controlled team just beats the crap out of you, and scores easily, even if you're working incredibly hard for puck control and out-shooting them. It's just a bunch of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Game","review":"This game is good because it has a lot of things to do. You can also make seasons and play games with your team. The graphics are very good and there is also a very good separate fighting mode. Another reason this game is good is because the controls are easy so you do not get confused with the other controls. Out of a lot of hockey games this would be one of the best. Overall, I think this is a very good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"below average","review":"this game is below averge....some aspects of this game are good (i.e. the fighting mode, soundtrack,online mode) but most are very bad. the graphics arent that good and the gm mode really sucks.If your team isnt a top 5 team in the nhl right now dont count on getting to the playoffs.I platyed for 11 seasons and put out all-star calliber players and didnt make the playoffs once. whats up with that. and the oppnents poke check works every damn time they put it on u, no matter where they are positoned!my advice is to check out ESPN NHL hockey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This game sucks for the first ten minutes. After you learn the controls, figure out how to change the settings and manage your plays and players, it gets a lot better. A lot better. Checking is realistic. 989's Faceoff games let you lay out some one on almost every attempt. Dynasty mode is fun, but unrealistic and just there for the heck of it. My only problem is at the medium setting you can score almost everytime on breakaways. Graphics r great.Most important is the game is addicting and a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.

In 2004 they make the gameplay more &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; which kills the game. The passing is impossible to get it to the person u want to. I think the gameplay itself is terrible. NHL 2003 is so much better to play. ya i admit NHL 2004 is better for dynasty modes and stuff but the gameplay has gone way down from the year before.

I first read this book before I had started my doctoral work, then re-read it the year I graduated, and learned new information for success as a scientist. While some of the information seems to be common sense (such as the invaluable skill of networking), I have seen many a postdoc with their eyes on their lab bench and a \\"leave me alone\\" attitude, then they wonder why they can't find a \\"real\\" job...

This book strongly cautions against the assistant professor position. The arguement is that the fight for tenure can be circumvented by gaining experience in industry and then coming over as an associate professor. It makes one feel incredibly naive for pursuing a direct route to academy.I don't believe the decision is as clear-cut as it is made out in this book. I have worked in industry and academia and many of the concerns outlined in the book occur in both places. Office politics, fighting your way up the totum pole, and the scramble for funding are facets of both types of jobs.

But the blood also has to soak through to fill 100% of the reverse side too. Even after 3 needle pricks from the drug store lancet, I couldn't get enough blood to fully soak through.

X1 was just such an amazing, outta-nowhere title that is damned hard to dethrone, and as it stands X2 should just be considered the next, awesome chapter in an equally awesome franchise. X2, for what it's worth, kept the same elements afloat (Heart Tanks, Sub-Tanks, Armor Capsules, Ride Armor), only really coming alive by way of pre-32-bit graphic effects, great level designs, the introduction of the Land Speeder bike, and powerful bosses and weapons, not to mention the introduction of the X-Hunter sub-bosses and the return of the unstoppable Sigma, but in the end X2 only really treaded water.

On top of that, the book helps you decide if you need a low, medium or high structure classroom and gives suggestions on seating, guidelines and rules based upon the structure type.There are forms to help you track misbehaviors so that when you are conferencing with a student or parent, you actually have a leg to stand on and a way to help correct them.

The only criticism I have is that the title might put off some readers, thinking that religion is the main theme.

The idea of telling the history of American Jewish women by writing a series of biographical sketches works very well. For me a great part of the pleasure of the work was in reading the stories of people like Emma Lazarus, and Mary Antin whose work I had known in some way but did not know the real stories of. One strong element in this work is the relating of the hardships many strong creative Jewish- American women suffered as women. The work tells exemplary tales about pioneering women who opened up new areas for women, while suffering because of this in their own personal lives. One is given in this work a sense of how truly remarkable many of these women were.I enjoyed reading the book and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st birthday present","review":"This toy is sturdy and appealing to both adults and children.

Although he couldn't figure out how to turn it around on his own, he loved racing from one end of the house to the other. Now, a year and a half later, he has passed it on to my 1 year old. Sure it has suffered a bit in a year and a half of heavy use (he still played with it well after he walking on his own), but nothing a little wood glue can't fix. Initially I had purchased a Radio Flyer push wagon for my son to use (a LOT more expensive), but it turns out he likes the alligators MUCH more. It's nice and stable and it doesn't move too fast the way some of the lightweight plastic walkers do. The only drawback it that it is hard to turn with it, but that seems to be true of all the heavier/more stable walker toys I've found and I'll trade manueverability for safety and stability any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddily Made","review":"First of all, the holes for the handle part did not line up with the holes in the main part it's supposed to be attached to.

Furthermore, the blue paint is terrible. It gets everywhere. I have blue streaks on my walls (where he bumped the walls) and hardwood floors after he used it just a few times. Although my son loves the \\"clacking\\" sounds it makes and the spinning shapes on the handle, there is a real safety issue when using this and I really don't have the patience to scrub all the blue paint off my floors after every use.

However, I only had the toy about three days and both back wheels popped off! We barely even used it. So unfortunately I would not recommend this toy. I may have just gotten a random bad model, but it was not worth the money I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, disappointing","review":"Within two days of receipt the glued seams began separating. The wheels, which were warped from day one, stopped rolling and just slid accross the floor. Consequently the alligators stopped chomping and clacking. Trying to put this thing back together to a point where it functions correctly takes more time than it is worth. Our 22 month old has moved on and enjoys pushing his big plastic baseball bat around the house more than playing with this heavy wooden dust collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"We bought this for our then nine month old daughter and she adored it from the beginning. She'd played with a similar toy made of plastic and had a hard time using it because it went too fast and she couldn't keep up with it. This one is perfect for babies who are just getting the confidence to stand and walk with assistance. At eleven months old she is about to start walking on her own, and still loves this toy. She can now really PUSH it, and the fact that it doesn't speed off is fantastic. She also likes to pet the alligators and spin the wooden beads. The best version of this sort of toy I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Walker!","review":"My son is a slow bloomer as far as the crawling and walking goes... he is crawling, but now he is starting to walk at 14 1/2 months along things, he got this for his 1 year birthday and at first it was a little hard for him only because he wasn't used to it, but now he walks all over the place with it!! It goes very slow now that he knows how to use it! It is the best walker i have seen!! I love that is goes so slow so he doesn't get hurt, and I can walk away to do something and not have to worry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His favorite walk-a-long toy","review":"I purchased this walk-a-long toy to help my great grandson get his confidence up to walk alone.It is the perfect balance for help from an adult to doing it himself. Most toys are too heavy for a little one to turn or adjust his walking path."},{"rating":"1","title":"the wheel came off and will not stay on","review":"I bought this walker for my Son's 1st birthday, and it is really cute. But it only lasted for a dozen or so pushes around the living room before the wheel fell off! I have gorilla glued it two times now and tried to nail it back on and that was very difficult. I think there is better out there and for lot less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed- Dangerous!","review":"I was happy with this until the top bar came loose just a few days after we bought it! My 20 month old fell forward and landed with his neck on one of the vertical parts. It was terrible, and all because their glue didn't hold. If you buy this, please screw the top bar in place so this doesn't happen to you. This is not the only Melissa and Doug toy we have had glue issues with. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clack Clacker","review":"Great toy with one exception, the rubber support on the tires came off after about two weeks of the purchase. My granddaughter pushes it all over the house. She has wanted to start walking so much and this has given her the confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alligator clacker!","review":"My daughter's first walk down our road was with this gem. We threw a pinecone into the works to keep it from going too fast for her. She got it for her 1st birthday and at 21 months old she still loves it and chomps feet and giggles. One of the back wheels fell off at one point but a little glue and an overnight set and it was as good as new. She also learned how to get her feet unstuck from it, because she used to walk all over it. That could be slightly dangerous if someone wasn't right there to help out. She likes to stick her teddy bear on the back and give him a ride around the house. It's hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to assemble - poor quality control","review":"Received this cool-looking toy today after my wife and I had \\"stalked\\" it for months in our local toy store. Unfortunately, we were unable to assemble it because the embedded nuts in the base of the handle were off-center (by about 1/8\\" on one side, a bit better on the other). As a result the bolts would not seat properly in the nut and were difficult to turn (probably cross-threaded them). Anyway, after attempting to get the bolts in for twenty minutes, the hex tool bolt heads finally stripped out... GAME OVER. I'm tempted to throw a couple lag screws in it and call it a day, but I may just send it back on general principle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"Just a quick note, although we love this toy and it's one of my son's favorites it is not meant as a learning to walk toy. It's definitely made to be used after they learn to walk. That being said once he was able to use it he loves it and so does any other kid that comes over. I love that it's wooden and the alligators make a cute noise when they click clack. It's a super fun classic toy! Also I was pleased the the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chipped wood","review":"This item looks great, but within 3 months of use by a calm 10 month old 2 pieces of wood chipped off in very dangerous choking-hazard sizes. I do not recommend and am hoping for a refund. We'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy for 18 month old","review":"This toy is nice looking and built with quality, but that is its downfall. A child cannot turn it easily when pushing or pulling it because there is no steering capability. This toy is probably more appropriate for a two or three year old. I would not recommend buying this toy unless your child was at least thirty pounds or if your child is two or older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My Grandson loved this toy. He is 10 months old and was pushing it everywhere. Two of the alligators broke the first weekend that he had it. He still loves it but I was disappointed that it broke so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant migraine","review":"We borrowed this alligator push toy from a friend. My daughter (20 mos) loves it, and it seems to be well constructed.I hate it!Every time she goes to push it I cringe. The thing is so loud, it's unbearable. Maybe my apartment is extra echo-y. I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loves it!","review":"Length:: 0:41 MinsOctober 6, 2011 - We passed this down to a friend and her daughter LOVES it too. She was walking in no time. I love how stable it is. It keeps them from going too fast and flipping it over. Still love it!May 6, 2010 - My 9 month old daughter LOVES this toy. She is so amazed to be mobile. Right now, she can only manage to push it in a straight line. It seems hard to maneuver for beginning walkers. Luckily, we have an open floor plan so she can go right from the living room through the kitchen into the dining room before she has to stop and turn around. I can see her using this for awhile though... putting dollies on it and pushing them around. She wants to play with it every day and gets upset when she can't.Durability: So far we have had no problems. I read reviews that complained that the handle bar comes unglued. The version I received has a screw holding the handle bar in place. We've had it for a month and no defects have come about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous! Poorly consrtucted.","review":"I was happy with this until the top bar came loose just a few days after we bought it!

If you buy this, please screw the top bar in place so this doesn't happen to you. This is not the only Melissa and Doug toy we have had glue issues with. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous due to poor quality","review":"We bought this for my daughter's first birthday and she loved it during the first week she played with it. However, wooden slivers from the plywood side panel began flaking and breaking off almost immediately. Each broken piece is about an inch long and incredibly dangerous. We have taken it away from her and will be returning it as soon as I have time. What a shame. I previously loved Melissa & Doug products."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy has broken twice...","review":"My mother in law bought this toy for our 1 yr old daughter and one of the side alligators broke off almost immediately. We returned the toy, and got a replacement and the same thing happened with the center alligator. I can't understand why this keeps happening, but we will ask for a refund instead of a replacement. Although she likes pushing it around, this toy is bad news on functioning properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous! Spent the morning in the ER because of this thing","review":"My son loved this toy when he saw that he could walk with it. It was so cute and he was so cute pushing it. A simple trip and he hit his forehead on the sharp edged spinning fish and left a gash right between his eyes that the Dr said would leave a scar! There was blood everywhere! I see from the reviews that this has happened to others and I can't believe that they haven't fixed it by rounding off the edges since it's a known issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action-clacked Fun","review":"What's more fun than watching a baby learn to take his first steps on his own? Watching him laugh and take delight along his path with some truly chompy friends... he even helped assemble the two bolts to install the handle. Very gratifying for everyone. His first walking toy, he is now ambling about 8 to 10 steps without assistance. Thanks, again, Melissa & Doug for a very imaginative, original, NON-TOXIC, NON-PLASTIC and affordable toy that will endure for nostalgia and purpose. Fat Brain Toys had excellent shipping, service, and receipt documentation. Thanks to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and unsafe","review":"I had been admiring this toy for so long and was thrilled to get it as a gift. When I took it out though, it seemed rather flimsy. Initially it went too fast for my son. He prefers a plastic one that we got as a hand-me-down. It surprises me because I think that this one is so much more fun. The big issue, and the reason why I have put it away, is that he was investigating the alligators and got his finger completely stuck in the place where the mouth of one of the aligators fits into the blue base. I am still not sure how he did it. I was unable to get it out and he was screaming. My husband ran to help and finally just yanked it out. It was very traumatic. In the end, his finger just was scraped and bruised, but I wouldn't want it to happen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Bought this for my daughter's first birthday and I wish I would have got it sooner! She loves it! We take it to the park and everytime another kid wants to play with it too. It's definitely a hit for the kiddos! I would reccomend it to my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STURDY PUSH TOY!!","review":"My son loved it the minute I put it together, well he couldn't wait for me to put it together as all the colors and spinning toys had him already amuzed an entertained while I was putting it together. It was a simple assembly less than 5 minutes. This is so worth purchasing and a keeper for after he starts walking too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"Bought this for my nephew for his first birthday...It is his favorite toy, my sister travels and takes this with him everywhere, including his daycare. Read the reviews on durability and have not had any problems for three months and my nephew is rough on his stuff. My sister claims this is a keeper.... I would definetly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for practicing walking","review":"My one year old loves this toy. It is sturdy and makes a fun sound. He used it a great deal when he was practicing walking (well, actually running, I think he was waiting until he could run to give up crawling) and will still grab a hold of it and push it across the floor. I gave it a high educational value because I am considering improving gross motor skills to be educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Way to Save $25 if You Want to Keep Your Rugs","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was starting to walk, and it is a nice-looking thing; wooden and retro and the alligators are very cute and all that. However, I just don't see how this can be any good unless you live in, like, The Overlook Hotel or some big modern loft with smoothly carpeted or concrete floors. Because this thing just does not work in a little Craftsman bungalow with wonky hardwoods covered in oriental rugs. It gets caught on everything (especially fringes) and causes baby much frustration with steering because of the wheels, you see. I've found that my daughter (who walks well on her own now) much prefers to push around a $5 plastic laundry basket which has the added bonus of providing a place for her to ride when I push her."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for promoting walking","review":"my baby loves this walker toy it helps him walk around and the noise it makes he loves it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"14-month-old has basically loved it for a few months now","review":"This is a very durable, colorful toy that entertains my son on occasion throughout the day. Before we received this for his birthday a few months ago, he was enjoying pushing the laundry basket around the house which is obviously much lighter and easier to turn than this heavy thing. That's the biggest issue my son has with it: he can't turn it around and go the other way. He'll push it across the hardwood floor, reach the wall and then complain because he can't turn it. It's also very loud, so be aware that you may get a headache if your kid really like this toy. He only mildly cares for the butterflies that flip around on the front bar and when he gets bored with it he likes to grab and pull on the alligators themselves. All in all, it's an okay toy...just wish it was a little quieter and easier to maneuver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it","review":"My kids love it, but it is loud! It is really sturdy and the rubber on the wheels makes it much easier to push than the plastic versions for my 11 month old son. It does its job well as a walker, but beware if you like peace adn quiet in your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China !!!","review":"I was So dissapointed to find that this, and now I've learned most other toys from Melissa and Doug, is made in chinaIt lost 3 stars just for that.That being said, my son loves it already at 5 months. He likes watching it when we push it or playing with the Gus on the back when he's sitting next to it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please be careful with this toy!","review":"i never put reviews on these things but my son was 13months old & went to push this toy, slipped & his face hit the handle........busted his lip & it required 5 stitches by a plastic surgeon. this toy is dangerous in my opinion. we threw it out immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loved it, but it could be a little more durable","review":"My son received this walker as a gift. He loved it from day one. He would walk up and down the sidewalks in our community and wave at people like he was in a parade. I think it would be perfect with a few improvements: 1) It could be more durable. One of the wheels would repeatedly fall off. My husband would use some wood glue to put it back on, and it would still work fine - but that should not happen. 2) I would like to see the handle bar be adjustable for height. My son is in the 75-95 percentile for height. He had to hunch over a bit to really use this well and I worried about him falling forward and hitting his face on the walker or the cement, so we kept a close eye on him. But, I credit the walker with really helping his development. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute and unique toy","review":"My son received this for his first birthday and he loves it! The alligators' mouths open and close and make a non-annoying clicking sound when you push the cart. My son also loves to spin the little wooden pieces. This is a very well made, cute, and fun toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what it's supposed to do","review":"I'm kinda indifferent about what to write about this particular piece. My little man LOVES playing with it, and it's very manageable. Unlike other walkers that I've seen at other stores, this piece doesn't have smaller pieces that could get lost or broken. It's very sturdy and one piece. The only issue that I have with it is that the wheels are hard to turn on certain carpets. Obviously, if you have shag carpets in your home, this won't work at all. It will just get stuck and your little one won't be able to use it. From what I can tell, short carpets, hardwoods and tile floors are best for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Craftsmanship","review":"I was so excited to buy this walker for my 11 month old son. When it arrived I was very pleased to see it only had two parts to assemble! But due to poor craftmanship we couldn't even screw the screws into place. My husband had to take it out to the garage and \\"fix it\\" so we could actually assemble it. After it was assembled we noticed that 1 of the 3 alligators that go up and down wasn't working.However, my son does LOVE this walker. And I do like that it is made out of wood and not plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid push toy","review":"Love Melissa and Doug products. The chomper doesn't disappoint.

Unfourtuantely it means when they are using it you hear this very loud clacking, like they are banging wood on wood. As they get older and run faster it is unbearable! We were constantly hiding it. It was in the closet more than it was out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great push toy to help learn walking","review":"This toy is great and is helping my daughter learn to walk. It is shorter than I expected but that doesn't seem to bother her at all. Its pretty loud when she goes full speed, but I think that is something that most babies/toddlers like even though the parents might go crazy. It is very sturdy and safe -- very high quality.

It is good to know why you are angry but knowing what to do with the anger you have now is more important, I think. By reading this book I learned what to do when I get angry. I learned alternative behaviors. I learned that anger is a part of life and we all have it and some of us need to know what to do when we are feeling it.

The main attraction was the projection clock so that my wife and I could see the time projected on the ceiling if we woke in the middle of the night, wondering if it was time to get up. The clock was also supposed to set itself using long wave radio signals containing the official US time. However, the time zone on the clock kept resetting itself so that we were never certain whether we were looking at our time or time in some other part of the US. Resetting the time zone was a lot of trouble, with lots of things to toggle through. The clock face was difficult to read during the daytime and could not be seen at all at night. After struggling with it for months, I went to target and got a $20 projection clock that is easy to read, sets itself like a dream and has worked flawlessly from day 1. This clock is not worth the money and I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arthx Relief seems to work","review":"I have been taking these capsules for about 4 months and I started noticing in the 3rd month a difference.

There were whole sections of the movie in which there were no subtitles at all, which only made me feel excluded from what I thought was a truly wonderful movie. So many great actors and such a valuable social commentary--from what I could understand, this movie really moved me. I understood the essentials; I just wish I could have had more subtitles, so that I could have been admitted further into the tragic, but ultimately heroic world of these Indian women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware-no sub-titles","review":"The copy I received has no sub-titles and since most of the film is Indian, I could not watch it at all.

The scene was about a second visit by women on the week-end, at which time the government lackey also snuck on board and learned that the ship was barely seaworthy. It's a shame the scene wasn't there, as it would have helped things make sense when the ship later got in distress. Why was it cut, I wonder?

These generic conflicts and characters could have been transplanted into just about any era and pretty much any situation: these \\"wacky,\\" \\"carefree,\\" \\"quirky\\" \\"freedom-loving\\" \\"nonconformists\\" might just as well have been frat rats, Hollywood types, soldiers, or college kids on spring break--nothing but stereotypes distinguishes them or links them to the Sixties.

I credit O'Brian for introducing me to many of my favorite books and writers.When first published, few of the authors discussed in O'Brien's book were in print. Thankfully, with the resergence of interest in noir fiction in the past decade and a half, books by the likes of Jim Thompson, David Goodis, and many others are easy to find.

It is the best $10.00 you will ever spend on your game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"I purchased \\"The Fundamentals of Hogan\\" by Leadbetter at the same time. I'm glad I did. While Hogan has written an excellent book which I'm sure will be a classic read long after I'm dead, Leadbetter was able to put it in perspective. Hogan explains the swing as it worked for him. While many of the fundamental aspects of the swing are applicable to everybody, trying to implement some of his techniques can really mess you up if you don't understand how the golf swing can be different for different people. Leadbetter gave me this insight. I would recommend buying both or if you only have money for one or the other then buy Leadbetter's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for beginners","review":"\\"Five Lessons\\" is one the classic books that every golfer should own if for no other reason than the excellent illustrations. There's a wealth of information here. That being said, I don't think it's a good book for beginner golfers. The problems is that there is so much detail on the second-by-second mechanics that it could (and does) very easily lead into paralysis by analysis. For the beginner golfer a much better book would be something like \\"Swing the Clubhead\\" by Ernest Jones (if you can find it) and any book by Harvey Penick (just to appreciate the joy of golf if for no other reason.)

Ben Hogan describes 5 lessons that can help you become fundamentally solid with your golf swing. He not only shows you what to do but he tells you why certain things happen mechanically. Some people find the illustrations old school but they do a great job of enhancing Mr Hogan's lessons and showing where your pressure points and emphasis should be. I read golf digest and watch the golf channel often but if you abide by Mr Hogan's lessons then you should be on your way to playing much better golf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best golf instruction manual ever written!","review":"When published this book was regarded as the finest instruction manual for golfers, ever written. This is still the case some 50 years later as befits its author, for me, the finest ball striker of them all. Not just my opinion, it is shared by many eminent professionals, not least Jack Nicklaus.

Highly recommended for new golf beginner like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tips from a golf master.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It is very intuitive and encapsulates the fundamentals for a beginner into a few short and easy to remember tenets. However, upon to taking some lessons, it turns out the swing methods advocated in this book are a bit outdated. In fact I was taught diametrically opposite techniques. So, something to look out for. It seems this swing as taught by Ben Hogan assumes you are already in great physical shape and have some body flexibility honed by years of practice. Which is not true obviously for a large fraction of players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool","review":"I got this for my hubby for his birthday and he really seems to enjoy the read.

The instructions are concise and to the point and still it is a joy to read. The illustrations have a classic look to them (which I think are cool), but are very accurate.

I read it at least once a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Learning Tool But Dangerous In The Wrong Hands","review":"Ben Hogan's Five Lessons should be a must in every golfer's library. However, I believe this book can be dangerous in the wrong hands. Hogan appears to have been ahead of his time on some issues discussed in Five Lessons so there is a lot of good information to take away from this book. However, not everything he discusses is appropriate for every player. It takes a discerning eye to figure out what would be beneficial to an individual player and what would be detrimental.The book is an easily read book with very good illustrations and there are five different main lessons which I have listed below...* The Grip* The Stance & Posture* The First Part of the Swing* The Second Part of the Swing* Summary & ReviewWhile I highly recommend this book and its lessons I can't overemphasize the benefit of a) getting fitted for your clubs by a qualified person and b) actual one on one instruction from a professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"this book is a paper back edition.

Upon finishing this book and heeding the instructions, the first time I went out I shot 1 over after 3 holes. Then my back went out, but I still shot below my average round. Most exciting was the feel of hitting drives that start low and gradually rise just like the pros. I am a slicer by trade, but found with my new swing I had a slight draw. I would highly recommend this book for learning the most important part of golf, a good repeating swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars Does Not Do This Book Justice!","review":"Quite simply the single most valuable book a golfer looking to begin or master the golf swing can read. I have read the book three times and look forward to the fourth. It is a no nonsense instructional guide with detailed drawings and precise text.

A must read for any serious golfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Instructional Book","review":"Even though I work hard on my golf game, and take a fair number of lessons, I rarely read golf instructional books. They are usually way too long, and too detailed about minute mechanical things. This Hogan book is short, to the point, and argues almost exclusively for techniques that are critical to the golf swing, and that most golf teachers would support. If one really could incorporate all of his teachings and build a repetitive swing around them, one's golf swing would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Lessons Book","review":"The Fundamentals of Golf book was in great condition as described and arrived promptly.

Its clear and concise guidance make it the premier golf instruction book. If you buy only one golf instruction book this should be it. Study it cover to cover and practice Ben Hogan's precepts; it will most assuredly help you to learn the game or to become a more complete, better golfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes hard work, but you can come away with a more productive golf swing.","review":"I'm not sure the 5 Lessons in this book are all-inclusive for developing or reworking a golf swing. Many years have passed since its development and publication, but it does offer great tips for anyone tinkering with or completely rebuilding or even learning a golf swing. Yes, it take hard work to implement aspects of these 5 Lessons, but it seems worth it. You do have to check what some other, especially, contemporary teachers/golfers have to offer regarding the golf swing. But these lessons do hold up extraordinarily well when compared to most of today's instructions. Hogan is clear and the graphics are excellent. A definite classic in the golf instruction genre. I am very glad that I pruchased it and have enjoyed trying to absorb and implement the 5 Lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated book...always was","review":"Hogan was perhaps the greatest ball striker ever.But,he was always a poor teacher of golf.This book has made tens of thousands a slicer for life.Perhaps more gave up the game for good.Cults are never healthy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its time has passed","review":"This book is one of the classic golf instructional books.

I was so serious about it that I transcribed large parts of the text to disk as an exercise.The combined result of these efforts is that after a few years I have acquired a golf swing that looks and works as it should.Not only can I perform the swing, I understand it and can explain it.Ben Hogan's book played the most important role in the process.I highly recommend the book, to study it with perseverence, to take professional lessons, and to analyze the swings of the pro's using other sources, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Hogan - Five Lessons","review":"The author goes to great lengths to describe the method to improve each part of ones golf game.

In addition to very well articulated explanations on grips, stance, and swing mechanics, Ben Hogan's Five Lessons also contains many superbly hand drawn and detailed illustrations that permit one to easily understand each lesson. Repetition of the fundamentals will always prove to be most critical factor in any sport (meaning you have to get out there and play to make it work); however, unless you are already at a professional level of play, utilizing Ben Hogan's advice provided in this book will certainly improve your game...as it has mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd will not play","review":"I bought the Blu-ray copy of this movie a few weeks ago along with a few other titles. I just tried to watch this movie and it will not play past the preview section. I tried and tried to get it to work but it will not. It's a good thing this was so cheap that I am not out a lot of money. For the price, it is not worth the hassle of getting it replaced from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb.","review":"I was hoping for a creepy slasher film with a decent story. What I got was just plain dumb. It starts off in the similar slasher fashion. Some horny 20 somethings on vacation in New Orleans to get plastered and laid. One of the guys just can't get over his ex so he decides to take a haunted swamp tour. The tour doesn't happen quite as planned and hijinx ensue.My major gripe with the film is the antagonist and its back story. I thought it was just something stupid and thrown together. There were definitely funny moments, but any redeeming factors were usurped by the ending. If you really wanna see it, either rent it or check it out on one of the movie channels."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Slashers of recent years!!","review":"Like Michael, Jason, Freddy, and Chucky, this new killer, Victor Crowley will make horror film history!

This film is nothing but a boring, bad acting and high cost-low budget mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatchet (Unrated Director's Cut) DVD Review","review":"Let me start off by saying that you really can't compare Hatchet to a lot of other horror movies that are being made right now. Most horror films being made right now are meant to scare, suprise, and shock people. Hatchet seems to try and make people laugh and show ridiculous splatter effects. If the purpose that you are trying to accomplish is different, you can't really compare it to movies like \\"Halloween\\", \\"The Descent\\", or \\"Saw\\". I happen to like horror movies that set out to scare and suprise you, so this horror movie was just not something I like to see.If you like movies like \\"Dead Or Alive\\" or \\"The Reanimator\\" then you will probably love this movie for what it is supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"Please don't waste your money or time on this movie. It is by far the worst horror movie I have ever seen. Very stupid, horrible acting, and bad story.

Except for Hatchet. Is it a perfect movie, No. However, it is a pretty good slasher movie. It follows the typical slasher formula, but has some pretty original kills. It's not groundbreaking or original, but it is better than 99% of the horrible, poor excuse for the slasher movies that has been coming out lately. As far as the Blu-ray goes, this edition is great. If your not a fan of the movie, this edition isn't going to change your mind. If you do like the movie, there is plenty of stuff here to keep you busy for awhile. If your on the fence, I say give it a shot. If you hated the movie, then I don't know why you would be reading these reviews anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody and brutal killing scenes. Overall, it's not worth watching.","review":"This movie is bloody. It contains brutal killing scenes. In some scenes, the killing is over the top and terrifying. For example, the killer grabbed the two legs of a victim and torn him in halves. In some others, the special effect looks cheap. Especially, it looks like the deformed killer is wearing an inflated plastic suit. The plot and the dialogue are like bad jokes. Overall, it's not worth watching unless you like gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a zero star option","review":"This film was complete trash. The acting was sickening, the set was horrific and the dialogue was a disaster. Was this supposed to be some sort of Wrong Turn remake? This film was a complete waste of four dollars and I wish I could take back that eighty minutes of my life. If you are looking for a decent horror flick, try Wrong Turn.Pass on this garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How do ideas like this get the green light?","review":"There are already some highly detailed reviews out there so I'm going to keep it simple. There really is no reason to watch this. I knew this already but I saw it at a friends house with a group of friends. It says \\"old school american horror\\" on the box, what's there idea of old school???To sum it up, mixed group of people (you already knew the ones who were going to get killed) go in the swamps, meet psycho, psycho kills them. The killings are also very explicit and very over the top, but maybe that's the audience Anchor Bay was shooting for, people who NEED to see blood and gore to be scared or think it's \\"cool\\". I think it's safe to say there will never be a horror movie that can also be considered a good film also ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, but funny.","review":"At first I want to say that I'm from Denmark, so I'm NOT good at english. Sorry for misspellings.This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen, even a 7 year-old can see it without getting scarred. It's boring, ridiculous and funny. And the funny part isn't meant good. Do not buy this movie, if you wan't to spend your money in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hatchet+Adam Green+Horror+Comedy+Gore+Nudity = A Damn Good Slasher Masterpiece!","review":"Joel David Moore (DODGEBALL, GRANDMA'S BOY), Tamara Feldman, Deon Richmond (SCREAM 3, THE COSBY SHOW), Mercedes McNab (BUFFY, ANGEL), Joleigh Fiorevanti, Joel Murray, Parry Shen (THE HAZING), Richard Riehle (OF MICE AND MEN), Patrika Darbo, Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger), Josh Leonard (THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT), Tony Todd (Candyman) and Kane Hodder (Jason Voorhees) star in Adam Green's masterpiece; HATCHET.

I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"80s my A$$","review":"Like (almost) everyone else, I was *sold* on the idea that with Hatchet, we would be given a truly honest throwback to the classic years of Slasher films.NOT!I had even signed on with the Hatchet - brigade - or whatever it was called before the film came out...I would go so far as to demand that these Filmmakers ask those Legends of Slasher films for an apology for using their (films) memory as a marketing ploy - because if you didn't grow up on 80s Horror and you think Hatchet is it, you're sadly mistaken. It was never about the funny, and that's all this film tries to be: about the funny.There's nothing good about this film - not even the breasts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A re-telling of Friday the 13th.","review":"Hatchet's tag line of \\"Old School American Horror\\" intrigued me, especially since the films the genre has been putting out for the last 15 years have been mainly about shock rather than true horror. Unfortunately, the tagline likely refers to the fact that Hatchet is basically a rehashing of the originalFriday the 13thThe basic premise is that a group of people go into the woods on a boat tour, hear a story of a boy who took a hatchet to his deformed face and then became a ghost. Of course the boy has grown into the killer and proceeds to attack them. The only thing different between this and Friday the 13th is that the killer doesn't wait until they're alone to attack.hatchet isn't a horrible movie, and if you've never seen \\"Friday the 13th\\" you might enjoy it. But for everyone else it will just seem like a cheap rip-off that doesn't add anything to the original story."},{"rating":"1","title":"wating for the good stuff.","review":"Had my hopes up for this, nice looking cover and other recomandations. But, even when I turned of the lights and try to get scared, the movie dide't cut it. Low dialog, low edeting, low acting and wierd bad dude.

Bad start to finish !"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is meant to pay tribute to 80's slasher movies - I think NOT","review":"I turned this off about half way through as I just couldnt stand the utter stupidity of it any longer.

So if you like slasher films that reminds you of the good old days of slasher flick??, then this film is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gore for the sake of it, but great special effects","review":"This was reviewed by my daughter, as I am not into horror films. My 17 teenage daughter, her female friends and some teen boys watched this film. It was an overtly grotesque, gory and bloody film. The boys seemed to like it, the girls not so much. The gore and such seem more enjoyed by adolescent boys, which according to my daughter, seems what the movie is aimed at. She is into special effects, therefore she did appreciate and enjoy the detail and realism of the scenes. One adult male watched this film and said if he were 15 again, he would probably enjoy all the blood and over the top death scenes, but he to felt it was over the top and horribley bloody for the shock factor. Some of the scenes were so out there as to be laughable.If you are a teenage boy or into blood and guts in a story line that is nearly non-existent, snatch this up and grab some popcorn. Otherwise go for a classic like Halloween."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad... Very Bad....","review":"How can you say this is an old school slasher movie. I was so damn bored that I had to start fast forwarding the film. The movie is more of comedy then anything else. Bad casting... Bad Dialoge... and even bad storyline. Nothing happenes in this film for the first hour or so. Then we get to see the deformed monster and then we get a hand full of boring dialoge and then another kill scene by the deformed monster. I gave it one star just because the monster is the only cool part about the movie. Its to bad everything else was boring. If you want to make old school slasher films, I highly suggest that the filmmakers watch some TRUE slasher films and learn how to develope a slasher movie... Not a comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hatchet lives up to the hype!","review":"This film is a gift from slasher heaven! The perfect mix of horror and humor with buckets of gore! Hands down the best horror film of 07, maybe the best horror film in the last ten years. What makes Hatchet so great is that it embraces old slasher conventions and leaves out all the twist endings and sub-plots... A refreshing break from the torture films and pretentious \\"psychological thrillers\\" that have been flooding the horror market. Those looking for the grueling terror found in films like the origional Texas Chainsaw Massacre may be disappointed... Fans of Chainsaw 2 will be in heaven. If you like your horror slathered in black comedy and gore this is your film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a spoof of a movie genre that is already a spoof of itself","review":"Granted, Hatchet has quite a few unnecessary topless female scenes, making it a perfect replicate of most classic slasher films, but the value of this film pretty much stops there. I find it surprising that investors were willing to put up money for the making of Hatchet since it is meant to be the epitome of a slasher film and therefore a spoof of the genre, however the genre itself is generally a spoof of itself, making Hatchet become just another redundant slasher film. A group of people wander into the woods and get chopped up by a mysterious being one-by-one until no one is left. Been there, done that."},{"rating":"1","title":"No..no....this is all wrong.","review":"THE GOOD-Gore for the sake of gore-Robert England-No CGI-Nudity for the sake of nudity-Tony ToddThat's really about it.THE BAD-Everything else-Nickelodean should not make horror film's-The acting-The digital camera makes it look like a made for tv movie-The music stinks-It's not evil, dark, or scary-It's cheesy-It make's Not Another Teen movie seem cool-It's not funnyOverall it just felt like a Disney movie with gore and nudity thrown in. The great thing about the slasher's from the 70's & 80's was that they were unintentionally bad and funny. You can tell the maker's of Hatchet are completey aware of how bad it is, which really take's the fun out of the whole thing. The death scenes are good, but even that can't save this mess. 1.5 Star's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that human culture has hit bottom","review":"Let's see...dumb guys, topless girls and a rumored killer who haunts the New Orleans Bayou. The kids get lost, the madman appears, and you know the rest. Advertised as a horror film that's \\"in on the joke\\", I saw nothing to back up that hint of satire. Instead, the film reminds me of half the stories I used to read when I taught middle school writing. One positive for the film deals with the good use of the budget. The special effects aren't bad, and the film has a crisp, haunting look to it. But the acting is awful, and the story is worse. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, the play was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane Script, Incompetent Direction - and those are the strong points.","review":"I've wasted enough time with this tripe, so I'll keep the review brief. Fleeting moments allow some acting talent to shine, but it's all overshadowed by incompetent direction (one need only view the prologue for evidence), vulgarity rather than wit, and pointless gore. For violence to work in a movie, it must be staged correctly. As a joke requires construction - a set-up and a pay-off, so also do scenes of horror and suspense. We don't get anything that like that in this film. Lacking planning and direction, it offers little impact beyond gross-out visuals. Contrast with the best sequences in Psycho or Halloween or Evil Dead, where one can deconstruct a scene down to thoughtful storyboards, this film clambers like an amnesia patient, apparently having learned nothing from fifty years of the specific filmmaking heritage (horror/suspense) that preceded it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible excuse for a horror flick","review":"I took precious time out of my day to watch this movie, and was utterly disappointed. The plot in this movie was pretty simplistic and unimaginative in my opinion, as well as totally unbelievable. The acting was atrocious, as though this film were put together by a team of ninth-graders at a local high school. Sure, there is a whole lotta gore in this movie, but it is merely gore for gore's sake. Gore-hounds will get a kick out of Hatchet. Otherwise, it is a very crappy and crummy film indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all, really...","review":"Do yourself a favor and rent this instead of buying it. You will not want to watch it more than once, as it is not really good at all. The characters are annoying. The situations are annoying. The dialog is annoying. The action is annoying. There is nothing about this movie that I can honestly say that I liked.You are supposed to want the main characters (good guys) to win in horror movies. You are supposed to want them to win, or at least live, because they have been portrayed as someone you can relate to or would like in real life; you are supposed to feel empathy. I felt nothing but disdain for every character in this movie and just wanted them all to die. You will feel the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"I went to play the dvd and when i pressed play it started out fine and then it stopped playing.I repeatedly try toget it to play it did the same thing.Not happy at all about this. returned item and requested a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total.. TOTAL waste of time","review":"I wanted Hatchet to be good. I read all the reviews, paying special attention to the bad ones. I waffled before buying it, and I was finally swayed by how vehemently people praised it. This movie suuuuucks. It's cheap, it's stupid, it's poorly acted, horribly written, and it looks like it was made as a school project. A few minorly interesting kills do not a worthy movie make. If you've seen the head ripping, you've seen the best part of this pile. Despite the number of likable actors, many of whom have a nice history in horror movies, you will not enjoy this movie. Please don't waste your money or time on this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gory but ultimately forgettable","review":"I have a love-hate relationship with this movie. On one hand, I appreciate what the director was trying to do...sort of like a homage to old school horror flicks like Friday the 13th, Pumpkinhead, Nightmare on Elm Street etc. and the results are beautifully gory and violent. But on the other hand, the plot makes this movie highly forgettable. It will not stand beside the classics it was trying to pay homage to.I highly recommend this for fellow horror afficianods...esp. those who are willing to sacrifice plot and acting in favor of B-grade horror and special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huh, so you can teach an old dog new tricks ...","review":"I love it when a movie makes fun of itself and actually pulls it off!!!

I was raised in a time when slasher movies were the norm and so they have been engrained in my soul. I wanted to like Hatchet, I felt I could like Hatchet, except for one thing. It's a comedy and it doesn't try to hide it. Old school horror was not trying to be funny on purpose.

He kills somebody so the group runs 50 feet and then stops to talk until the Elephant Gladiator catches up with them and kills another idiot so the group runs another 50 feet and stop to talk until Elephantface kills another!

Other than that, the film flops on every level. Badly written, horrible art production, an ineffective idea to make a horror film a comedy...it's not the kind of classic old school horror film I grew up loving. I need a heart stopping scary character, girl-next-door female B-actresses who take their clothes off, good dialogue, and at least a decent set of movie-making skills to make the production watchable and enjoyable. This film didn't have 9 out of 10 of the required elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"gore,gore,gore","review":"Hatchet is a movie that most people will either love or hate.but i for one feel this was a good movie.it revolves around victor crowley played by kane hodder of jason fame.the blood and gore in this movie are just awsome and the kills are very creative.the store is a little lacking in the depth department but its forgivable since the movie is fun to watch.it has cameos by various horror movie legends like tony todd and robert englund.the movie is funny at times but in a good way and it dosent slow or lag in any way.onc eyou start watching this movie you will want to see it through all the way.but this unrated cut is NOT for the sqemish because like i said before the kills are very violent and grusome but if your like me this will be a plus.overall worth checking out if you like horror and gore in excess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gory slasher flick, wastes a decent cast","review":"This film takes place in New Orleans around mardi gras time... an assortment of folks end up on a swamp tour of death, entering the domain of \\"hatchet,\\" a deformed killer who will ruthlessly slash and dismember his victims. The cast do a decent job within what they had to work with in this gory, unoriginal tale. The film is relatively short and the plot is focused in the 2nd half on who can escape the swamp before being grotesquely slain by the killer. There isn't really that much in the way of surprises or clever dialogue except for a few spots such as when a few of the characters are revealed as having been less than honest about themselves. Thus, if you like bloody horror films then you may enjoy this, but otherwise you'll probably want to pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's mildly entertaining","review":"i bought this dvd because mercedes mcnabb had some nude scenes in it. in fact, the dvd box states \\"eye-popping nudity\\". should of known better. the nudity was non-erotic and done in the first 15 minutes. this isn't a bad comedy/slasher movie. they definately had a budget to work with. special effects good, cameo appearances by big stars, etc. problem is, balancing the line of horror and comedy. it usually don't work because you're catering to 2 different audiences. i don't want comedy in my horror movies. if i wanted comedy, i'd buy comedies. as far as mercedes acting, she has none. her character seems to be not that much different than her buffy/angel character, harmony. there is no depth to her acting. overall, hatchet is an okay movie. in the extras, there is a talk of hatchet 2. i think i'll pass on that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not scary, but bloody, but still kind of fun","review":"Well seeing the panel for this at Comic Con, I was really excited.

I especially liked the classification of the designs as Easy, Intermediate or Advanced although I made the cover quilt which was classified as Intermediate but which I thought wasn't hard at all.

Usually science and religion are in a game of tug-of-war, with truth being the rope. The author's writing is so clear, it is easy for a novice of astronomy to understand the theory of relativity, the big bang, and even black holes. The book then goes into a religious aspect of these phenomena. And with the amount of degrees and education the author has, according to the introduction, I found his grasp on science credible. The book is quite short, so you and zip right through it. Even if you don't believe some of his conclusions, it is great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stopping shingle roof stains with zinc strips","review":"If you have mold stains on the shady side of your roof, you will find this product very useful. It leaches a bit of zinc onto the roof in each rain storm and kills mold and lichens that try to adhere to the granules on your roof shingles. It works great, but you should plan on one strip at the top of the roof and another halfway down, or else you will have stains on the lower half. The recommended installation method is to lift the shingle edge and nail the strip in place underneath it. If that makes you uncomfortable you can stick it in place with caulking. I have found that works well and avoids making more holes in the roof. It performs as claimed, is unobtrusive and keeps ugly stains from building up and lichens from eating into your shingles. You must clean your roof initially if stains have built up, using bleach in water, but after that the zinc should keep it looking clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"I installed these strips on my shop 3 years ago and the moss has continued to grow every year.

The compartments are nicely labeled, easy to open and close, and hold about 5-6 large capsules. They shut fairly tightly. Unfortunately, one spill off the counter snapped off two of the doors.

The problem is that the labels on the compartments are upside down in relation to each other. In other words, if you are looking at it with the row of PM compartments facing you, the PM labels are right side up and all the AM labels are upside down. If you turn it around the other way, the AM labels are right side up, but then the days are in the wrong direction, going from right to left. I find this bizarre. It's visually disturbing to someone with any sense of symmetry and order. The only thing I could do was to cover up all the labels, AM and PM, with duct tape, and write the days and the AM/PM notations on the duct tape. So now the AM compartments are on top, where they should be, and the PM compartments are on the bottom, going from left to right, and the words are all right side up. Dumbest design I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"This Pill organiser is Super. It has enough space to put enough pills in one section for the morning and evening pills.

I bought this because it had the dual am/pm design. My previous one was a single and I had to use 2 and remember which was am and which was pm.

I did not get sick once. This product is one of the best modern-technology investments i have made, and I highly recommend it to anyone to use for overseas and backpacking/hiking trips. It helps save the water supply, and helps prevent the overconsumption and waste of plastic water bottles.

One of the challenges with scout trips is that everyone wants their water to be treated, but they don't like the taste of iodine and hate the work involved with pumping. The Steripen solves both of these issues!It's really only effective for locations where the water is fairly clear to start (ponds, lakes, streams). As others have mentioned, is not poluted with chemicals or oil (urban flood water).The only down-side is that the unit is quite fragile and I've already broken mine once. Fortunately, a replacement bulb can be installed for $27 by the manufacturer. But, if you break the bulb on a trip (like I did), or the batteries die on you (which has happened too), make sure you have your iodine tables as a back-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"Took this item to Thailand.

But common sense will tell you how to set it up (All brawn, no brain to whoever wrote the manual).A tip, Count all the screws, nuts, washers, every accessories provided. Then separate them and named each piece the number as the manual. That way might save you time.Another tip. Is that when setting up the stand, make sure you don't lock the nuts tightly. Also, use the washers provided. After all is set, then screw all the nuts tightly. Otherwise, you will have a hard time setting it up, specially the pull-up bar.The machine does wabble a bit, but is not that serious. I'm 5'4\\" and weigh roughly 160 lbs.

The problem with the IR Tower (hardware - not software) is very annoying. The biggest culprit tends to be ambient light. Remember \\"IR\\" stands for \\"infa-red light\\". We have seen the most difficulties where florescent bulbs are present. Their light signature and flicker rate confuses the IR Tower & unit receiver. This is also true when the product is used near other electronic equipment such as TV's and computer monitors (gulp!!).The best tactic to incorporate is to block out any ambient light source. Get a dark towel / blanket (anything to block out light) and place it over the units. Then try your upload/download to the brick.This will usually solve the problem but you must be patient. If it does not work, keep trying different materials until you find one that truly blocks out the light; even cardboard boxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"A friend of mine mentioned that she uses Mindstorms for intro. engineering classes at a community college.

That allows movement. This brace seemed nothing but cumbersome during the few try-on moments before I returned it. It did apparently help others. Was I using it wrong? Who knows. The promised instructions weren't really inside after all.I think I'll end up going back to the physical therapy hand specialist to have a brace molded specifically to my hand.

Brace is hand washable and the support is a thin metal bar this slides into a pouch aligned with the thumb. A tab of Velcro wraps around and secures the thumb along with a band of Velcro which wraps around the wrist. Had it for a month and appears to be well made. It will take a bit of experimenting to determine how tight to warp the thumb section I notice if I wrap it too tight the thumb will \\"fall asleep\\" or become numb.

The only thing spoiling this album for me is the last track which ironically enough is a cover of the Cure. They should have skipped it and given me another of their own tracks. What's singular about this CD is the subtle undertone of angst and I don't know... menace? There's a fine complexity to it. It reminds me a little of the first two Police albums in this regard.

Author Bob Reed covers a wide range of topics, from the beginning of the Reformed tradition to modern worship practices, including deft (albeit exaggerated) illustrations of typical churchmembers' personalities down to what color car Presbyterians should drive. Reed's text is highlighted by clever observations of the fictional Percy T. Presby, a 300-year old parson with a keen eye and a sharp tongue who has something to say about creation, prayers, confession, women, and just about everything else. A clever and informative book that should please any Presbyterian, or anyone who ever wondered what the Reformed Church is all about. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Committe Jokes OK","review":"I got this book expecting humerous explanations of Presbyterian philosophy.

I give it a \\"thumbs up\\" and expect it to provide years of quality service.So if you need any tube amp work done, I can help.

The orginal band on my Seiko Aquamatic lasted only a few months. Great watch,lousy band. It was polyurethane and my experience is that polyurethane bands will crack and break. This was advertised as a rubber watch band. Real rubber will last for years though I haven't seen real rubber watch bands lately. I ordered this as a replacement and in a year or so it also cracked and broke. I replaced with with one I made myself from nylon webbing.

This product has some pathetic attempt to make it look like it expands. The part that really ticks me off is there is an oceanic stamp on the strap - not a Seiko Trademark, but has been synomomous with every authentic Seiko dive watch I have ever owned.

The quality is markedly worse than the previous replacement. The material is not rubber, the strap is longer and does not have the flexibility of the earlier version. Also the clasp is a cheap chrome plated material that does not match the body of the watch like the one on the original strap.

Every other day I may need to add a little air to it, but no unexpected deflation problems or holes (I do use a ground cloth under the product). My two little ones just love it (ages 2 & 4) and they are pretty rough on it. Overall I would say it's a pretty decent splash pool for little ones. It holds about 6- 8 inches, maybe a bit more, water in the pool end (I think it would have been better with more water), but like I said, the kids love it. take a chance and you may find quite an entertaining splash pool for your little ones as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this","review":"I thought this would be GREAT fun for my daughter; however, it was broken staight out of the box...

The story of Willie's family, his ancestors all the way up to his parents and siblings, is a sobering one that explains how families can be \\"doomed\\" when they remain outside of the mainstream and do not have access to opportunity or given any hope.

The main problem is the harebrained script that can't decide if it's a farce or a caper flick, or both, or neither. Borgnine is amusing as usual in a bit part, Quinn and Coburn are wasted in their roles, and the weak tv-grade actors like Brolin and Davison match the script for ineptness; the whole thing looks like a weak tv movie from the late 70s.The plot has endless holes, the direction is spotty, and this just feels like the sort of thing you'd watch on late night tv for five minutes and then give up on. But, cinematic masochist that I can sometimes be, I stuck it out to the end and was rewarded with one of the lamest and least plausible denouements imaginable. Or rather unimaginable.

As the first Inspector Rebus Novel, it serves as a great starting point for a very edgy series. Rebus is a really interesting detective, with a bit of an odd side, as evidenced by his procurement of rolls and milk for breakfast one morning (you'll have to read the book for further). Just enough tension in this novel to keep things interesting. Rankin is a gifted author who keeps the pace quick and unnerving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent start to the series","review":"This was a top start to the Inspector Rebus series. Ian Rankin wrote an excellent little book that I found to be highly interesting and readable.It was the kind of book that one can read and while you know it isn't a masterpiece in the vein of a Michael Connelly or James Lee Burke, you can see that the author has all the makings of being a top writer.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected.","review":"Generally speaking, detective thrillers seem to be full of unrealistic characters (supercops and supervillains) with too many neat coincidences and twists of fate in the plot. Rankin avoids the characterization problems through the use of a flawed hero and a well balanced cast. The concidences are still too neat, and the fates too twisty for my taste, but the plot is basically sound.Not a great book, but a lot less cheesy than the average thriller. Rebus is a fun character, and the shortness of the book suits the simplicity of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently good read","review":"I've now read almost all of the Rebus novels and find them a very reliable read. This is the first in the series and I would recommend that you read them in order. This book gives a lot of back story that only gets briefly covered in later books. I've also watched all of the TV adaptations, and while those are enjoyable they are now where near as good as the novels--often covering only one aspect of a book that usually has several interwoven plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross my heart, you'll knot be disappointed","review":"I have been looking for a good mystery series for months.

With a lush, and a smoking fiend who's greatest accomplishment is the amount of self-loathing he holds. As for the mystery. ...I saw the killer shortly after his character was introduced. It was like trudging though sludge to arrive at the end if he book. Maybe all the hype added to my disappointment, but if you're looking for a good mystery I suggest you continue on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much grit & grime","review":"The author is so busy trying to portray the grit & grime of the seamy underside of Edinburgh that the story line gets lost. I lost interest in poor inspector Rebus about half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid start to a brilliant series","review":"I read a lot of mysteries (too many) and Ian Rankin's Rebus series is probably my favorite. As the first entry in the series, Knots & Crosses is essential reading. And while it isn't as good and rather more conventional than later entries (Hide & Seek, The Black Book and Mortal Causes are outstanding) it has all the elements of a solid mystery -- a very human, even damaged, detective, well-developed subsidiary characters, a fast-moving plot and a surprising resolution. Best of all is the atmospheric setting--the dark, sleazy side of Edinburgh tourists don't see.The Rebus series belongs to the more hard-boiled school of detective fiction, and so may not appeal to those who prefer \\"cozies.\\" But these books are so well written and Rebus is so compelling, I can see Knots & Crosses and the rest of the series appealing even to people who don't usually read these kinds of books.

This book is about a serial killer who kidnaps and strangles young girls. The genre appears to be crime mystery.As John walks home at 4 in the morning he steals pastries and milk that were just delivered and sitting outside a grocery store. Apparently he did this often for breakfast. Since I did not read the whole book I don't know if he made good on that. He knew the store owner had been reporting thefts.

However, based on readers' opinions and the chapter inclusion by Amazon, I had purchased this book. The inclusion by Amazon had made Ms. Howard's story sound fascinating, scintillating, and eerily mysterious. Upon my reading of the first novella within this 3-novella book, however, I was extraordinarily disappointed. The writing lacked sophistication, and the plot did not make logical sense. Even within the realm of fantasy, the characters and their perceptions were not believable and rather silly. I do not believe I will read another novel by Ms. Howard again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rare Talent/ low, common book","review":"Linda Howard has a rare talent. She can write with sensitivity and humor, and her character and plot development are often great.I have read all her books once, and many of the older ones, many times.In writing this book Ms. Howard has betrayed her talent.

This from a woman who wrote\\" Duncan's Bride\\", \\"White Lies\\", and\\" Sarah's Child\\".Since I have followed Ms. Howard's writing career from the beginning, it seems to me as if she has really lost something since she has moved to the NEW YORK TIMES bestseller list.

Surprisingly, the weakest story is the first by Ed Greenwood about the clan patriarch. It is by no means a bad story; it just lacks the strength of the others because it seems like an introduction (probably not far from the truth and it serves that role admirably). The best stories detail a part of the lives of the matriarch and the butler, and thankfully WOTC has realized this and already released the second book with the Butler as main character.

I think that the thing that I liked less is the Sembia location and the characters that here take life. I think this setting is not fantasy after all, it is more a kind of 18th century Europe mixed with fantasy elements that don't fit well together at all.

The trial against Paul Merker in the East, which had as its background East Germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated Jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things Nazi in the GDR. But both of these arguments completely ignore the Marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the East German leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. Moreover, they totally eclipse the East German cultural discourse on the Holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the West and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in Western academia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much headroom.

This philosophy was bornduring his Ditch Trilogy period. Essentially, he attached his early success andfame to one-sided explorations. For example, one can easily hear Heart of Goldand imagine that John Denver might have written such a lightweight song.It might be interesting to perform an experiment in which a subject is exposedto a medium and then asked to select from a group of expensive objects or cheapobjects. Perhaps Shakey's reaction to his success was to challenge this conceptby daring an audience to follow him in to The Ditch, as he called it.

From the moment that one learns that the heroine works at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, the conclusion is obvious to anyone with a passing interest in New York (or American) history. The pointless inclusion of imagined anecdotes of Freud and Jung's visit to America (presaging the Holocaust) and narration by a dwarf add nothing but self-indulgent prose to a weak melodrama.Jewish gangster meets nice girl. Said gangster gets into a deadly dispute with another gangster who just happens to be the brother of said nice girl. (Capulets and Montagues anyone?)

When I was a teenager I was given the opportunity to work a carny for a summer. There I met the seal man, the hairy lady, the alligator man, Popeye, the snake women and others. I assisted in small ways and got to know the performers whose features and disabilities would have them sent them to institutions rather then allowing them to make a living, performing. Backstage is never glamourous but can be a rich experience. It took me back there a little. Although written about the turn of the century when carneys were much tougher and life was difficult (think Gangs of New York) it is not aimed at the seedy side, rather the living adventure of a time without government control. A time of invention and discovery. A time of hope and especially the building of Coney Island Amusement Park"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glorious Mess!!","review":"Read this book if you have eclectic tastes, love saucy descriptions, and want to revel in the work of writers who clearly love their work. It's rare that I read a book by someone and think, \\"I'd love to meet this guy.\\" This is one of those times.The historical details of Coney Island, New York, and the labor movement in in the early 20th century are masterful, not only in their (mostly) accurate portrayals, but in Baker's ability to keep it lively, centered, and completely entertaining. I wish this book would have spanned twice the page count.Only four stars because there are lots of loose ends here and some scattergun artistic license (especially in the end), but I dare you to not have a good time with this book. I know I did, and I can't wait to read \\"Paradise Alley\\" next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Read!","review":"It is not often that a reader can be entertained and informed at the same time. Dreamland performs both tasks magnificently. Set in the early 20th century, Dreamland presents the underside of New York City. Baker's plot flows nicely, and the setting is extensively researched. The reader will visit places where men bet on brutal battles between rats and a dog, and laborers struggle to survive in horrific working conditions. Baker develops his characters brilliantly, providing a context for their current plight. While I will not disclose the ending, I do compliment Baker on leaving many questions unresolved. Life doesn't always work out like a nice, neat John Grisham novel. I highly recommend this book- I think you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible name, but great movie","review":"If you liked the original Alien, you will like this movie, it is not a clone or rip-off, but the story, pacing, and atmosphere are similar. For all intents and purposes the villian(s) could have been replaced by zombies, robots, or mutant bugs, it isn't about the monsters, but about the building suspense and tension.The supermarket is a great settings since the small rooms and isles are claustrophobic and dark.

Hopefully we will see a sequel/prequel the performances by cast and crew here certainly warrant it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien Raiders","review":"I saw a preview for this movie and it looked good.

It did not disappoint---it's a brisk 85-minutes with action, suspense, some tense moments, good storyline and acting. I'd definitely rate it above those special premiere movies-of-the month that SyFy usually showcases.

After all, some people (not a majority) actually voted for George W. Bush, on purpose! I think this level of mystery fluff is for them.Rather than spoil the nutty climax (I have worked in hospitals for years, so I ain't buying it) I will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words: \\"...life is one big, savage joke; not funny ha-ha, but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began.\\"I became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began (where did they go to kindergarten?) that I almost missed the rest of the chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick at C; what will it be by Z?","review":"Though only the third book in this continuing alphabetized series, the plot formula is already old hat, leaving little mystery in this mystery.

I thoroughly was enjoying it right up to the end. The last chapter is very clumsy and does not really make sense. For those who have read the book, why does Bobby give his friend the red address book? It has the grave number of a corpse that has a gun hidden it. But if Bobby knew where the gun was, why write it down? And why give it to a friend who has has no idea what the numbers mean?

Kinsey is a single, middle-aged private investigator. In her newest case, Kinsey meets Bobby Callahan. He asks for her help in finding that tried to kill him, and left him with a bad memory, unable to remember many of the details of the accident that left him crippled and killed his best friend. Soon, Kinsey is in the middle of three mysteries, and asking questions that may put her life in jeopardy. The suspense is so thick that towards the end of the book I found myself skipping passages just to find out what happened next. Compared to the A and B books in the series, C was the most gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinsey's back!","review":"Kinsey Milhonne can't help but notice Bobby Callahan, the young man who works out at the same place she does. Although only about 20-years-old, he shows the physical effects of a terrible car accident he has endured. He is convinced that the accident was someone's attempt to kill him, and he feels that the person is still pursuing him. He hires Kinsey to find out who that person is. As she investigates, Kinsey finds out some surprising things about Bobby, but above all she feels admiration for a man who is battling to regain his memory and return to his normal physical state. The investigation takes Kinsey through high society and wealthy people in the medical community where secrets begin to unfold to her. This is the usual well-written Grafton mystery which has just enough twists and turns to make the ending interesting and satisfying to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This early story in the Kinsey Millhone series shows the promise that this author has consistently lived up to. Kinsey's character isn't as fully developed here as in later stories but it is still interesting to see the early influences on Kinsey's life. As with all books in this series, this story is most highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mystery","review":"Sue Grafton keeps the story moving. She always adds extra detail.

I can't wait to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I bought this book thinking, for some reason, that it was about alternative birthing (gentle, natural, low-technology).

Some Jaguar parts are interchangeable with Ford parts. OEM Jaguar parts typically cost more, so I was elated to see this Ford filter advertised as being able to fit my 2005 Jaguar S-Type 3.0. When I got around to installing it a few weeks after it arrived, I found that it did not fit. It is narrower and longer than the OEM Jaguar part.

Spirit Sensitive, a 1979 collection of ballads that features Cecil McBee on bass, John Hicks on piano, and Billy Hart on drums, with appearances by Don Moye on drums and Jay Hoggard on vibes. Very mellow, yet very intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't sleep on this EP!!!","review":"Whether you're a fan of east or west coast hip hop, you should pick up this EP. Don't be fooled by the fact that these cats hail from the west, cuz they do posses lyrical power, and most of all, flows for days. Each MC flows in his own distinct way, with each having a unique voice to match. Especially Keek Tha Sneek, who's rapid fire, word splitting flow sound fresh in a market full of run-of-the-mill MC's. These MC's are definatley in a league of their own and the only comparision I can make is that they sometimes sound similar to The Luniz. The only drawback of this EP is that it tends to rehash the same subject matter that 1 million other west coasts rhymers spit (gunplay, pimpin' and slangin' drugs). While 3Xkrazy still innovates this overused material, I would rather see them take on fresh subjects, from which they could really shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it-- get \\"Worms Eat My Garbage\\" instead-","review":"Mary Appelhof's book is the superior introduction to vermiculture.

While there are some unique ideas in this book (using sprouted birdseed to aid in aration is one), there is little else in here not covered by Appelhof.

This book will make you spit bullets. Your Grandpa and your life insurance salesman friends will not like this book. Try to be understanding of them. They have been trained to think buying insurance is like buying a car; why would anybody want to lease when he could buy? But if you have read and agreed to \\"The Millionaire Next Door,\\" you will agree that you have little need for permanent life insurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Wrong With Your ife Insurance","review":"I purchase this book for my husband and he said it was full of helpful information that he will be using in his new Primerica business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"These bulbs took a bit to warm up and come up to full brightness which was great in the morning when my eyes were adjusting, but inconvenient any other time.

The ballast (a switch built into the base of fluorescent bulbs) seemed to go out. One of the bulbs would go on and off if you thumped it.

The imagery is merely gross, the jokes old, the witticisms tired and vacuous, the quality of imagination on a par with the last schoolyard cliche. Venokur's work is neither haiku nor poetry but it does get high aces for achieving a kind of ridiculous waste of paper and ink. The same energy could so easily have gone into a collection of real merit (and of other poets' work), turning kids on to the world around them as only haiku can do. . . but that is another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for reluctant poets","review":"I did a poetry unit with my 7th grade, and some were not interested at all in poems. Many did enjoy this book, however. It is gross, but that's what 13-year-old boys like. We read several from here aloud and counted the syllables, and it really drew some students in.

I picked up this book as a quick read for a brief introduction to the Alamo and got exactly that; however, I was disappointed to find out the book reads at a third grade level with below-caliber writing from Robert Penn Warren. Because the book was originally published pre-Civil Rights Movement, the book reeks (especially at its beginning) of anti-Native American sentiment (still portrayed as savages and uncivilized) and occasionally dipping into the anti-Mexican (I guess this one is obvious because it was the Americans versus them). If it weren't scribed by Warren, this book would have been lost a long time ago. I wouldn't even suggest giving this to a child to read because its view points are very biased.

The whole plot was laughable with it's little subplots & \\"inner turmoil\\" of Vanessa, the fight at the end was too easy and very anti-climatic, the book in general was poorly written, and knowledge on the subject matter was poor.

Deep down inside, most of us are lucky enough to have had a relationship with a special someone, who touched our soul. That incredible person and first love defined every relationship throughout the balance of our lives.

Though this episode could be considered by some as filler, this was definitely an important episode. It helped to illustrate a bit more of the Avatarverse, both Earth (with the sandbenders and traders) and the Fire Nation with a circus. The man who tries to train Appa is a cruel man, but there is a kindhearted boy who reminds Appa of Aang, and this episode was another one that helped to illustrate that there are good and bad people in every group. Overall a must-see episode which also featured Azula and the Kyoshians."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes","review":"Normally, I do not like filler episodes, but this was actually a good one, a nice break from the main story. You have several short stories about our characters in Ba Sing Se - Aang helps some unhappy zoo animals, Katara and Toph have some fun girl bonding time, Sokka gets into a haiku slam, Zuko has a night out, and Iroh collects a few items and has a memorial for his son. Overall a great episode. Even Momo has his own story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm","review":"This is a heart-wrenching episode that shows one of the few times where Aang becomes angry enough to trigger the Avatar State. And he had every right to be angry, since some dirty desert people stole his beloved companion Appa, putting the kids in dire straits as they are now stuck in the desert. The humor mainly comes from Sokka after he gets high from cactus juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everyone","review":"I found this show when my nephew and I watched tv to pass some time. He is five and I am twenty and I can honestly say there is nothing on tv that enraptures our attention in the way this cartoon does.

I have picked up all the dvds that have come out from this show and I actually started letting my boss watch them as well.

I'm 16, and just ask my family - I'm pretty much in love with this show. The mix of dramatic and comedic elements are brilliant, and even for those who don't prefer fantasy or cartoons will love Avatar.

Avtar on the other hand really pisses me off somneone should sue Nickloden for all this copyright they are doing. Pepole will probley be appeled to it at first but will slowley stop to watch it and pay more atintion to Naruto as with the secound season. If you are looking for true anmie watch Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT (Sometimes show Uncut) Naruto (Uncut verson realsed in july) or Full Metal Alchumist( shown on Adult Swim after cartoon network beacuse of it's viloince and language).

And at $12 for four episodes out of a twenty episode season, thus $60 at this pricing structure for Season 1, it's just too expensive.

While it predominately focuses on far east religions, this series can relate to most everyone. There is love, war, fighting, action, humor and many qualities that appeal to a vast number of people. For people who are closed minded as far as religion, I recommend watching it with small children to answer any questions or concerns they may have. For open minded people, this series is one you can sit your kids or your loved ones or yourself and really have few worries.

Readers will smile, cry, and become angry, as each of the stories unfold. \\"The Love Story of Lottie Johl\\" is a haunting story which relates the full spectrum of the human condition, and relates how humanity can be so incredibly cruel to others, those individuals that were simply trying to make a way for themselves in the west. The lives of many women were explored in Soiled Doves. The stories were tastefully written and a delight to read. After reading Soiled Doves, one develops a different, more forgiving, view of prostitution and the ladies who were employed in it during the 1800s. Soiled Doves is a \\"must read\\" if the reader has an appreciation for American History and the role prostitution played in its development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic, poor writing.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I was distracted by the numerous and glaring typos and felt like I was reading a book written on the 4th or 5th grade level.

Anyone who has read first hand accounts of pioneer women in the 1800's knows that NONE of them had it easy. Lawfully wedded wives were subjected to loneliness, abuse, death in childbirth and the same diseases that afflicted the prostitutes of the day. And drug addiction was extremely common among 'respectable' women as well as the soiled doves through opiates legally available at any drugstore as well as alcohol.

If you'd like a little trivial fluff about some famous prostitutes and dance hall girls, go ahead, click the buy button. This is mostly a tabloid-type overview of the sensationalized lives of some (in)famous hookers. It reads like a very rudimentary senior thesis on the topic and borrows most of its substance from other books. The bibliography and resource lists for this book are far more useful than this book. Interested in the subject? Get the books that Seagraves used to research her flimsy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good history, easy reading","review":"This was an interesting book. I can understand that someone would be disappointed if they were looking for a sociological study on the pros and cons of prostitution. The photos are interesting but of course they are old, black-and-white, smileless and toothless. Still, you can look at some pictures and imagine that the men would pay for their company. Others you wonder just how hard up they were (I'm sorry, that's not PC). Some photos are lazily captioned as in \\"a lady of easy virtue\\". There is not much detail about prostitution itself. You will not get any details about the specific services performed. This book may be about prostitution but the movie would be rated PG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"If you're looking for a basic overview of prostitution in the Old West, nothing too in-depth or scholarly, then this is your book. The author uses outdated terms such as \\"Orientals\\" and \\"white slavery\\", and wavers between portraying the prostitutes as hookers with hearts of gold and disease ridden tragedies. Her tone is often condescending towards the women she writes about. Instead of examining the women as a whole, Seagraves tended to stereotype them. Something to read over a slow weekend and then sell to used book store. Not even worth keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you are looking to gain a scholarly, in-depth understanding of prostitution in the wild west, look elsewhere. This book is G-rated. The book is poorly organized and falls short on technical details.
