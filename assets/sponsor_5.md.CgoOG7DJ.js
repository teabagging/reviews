It shows what missionairies and Soviet converts, residing in the Soviet Union face. As Americans, we might sometime get too settled with our surroundings. We must remember that we have a cross and it is not meant to be lite. We don't realize what other Christians around the world go through so that they might reach others and live for Christ. It can cost them much to do that. As I read this book, I realized that I do not suffer at all for Christ. Christians that have it easy can not have as good as a relationship with Christ as someone who bears the pain and suffering. Vanya was terrific example of how Christians should act.

I have been using dryers for years and they normally last 15 years or more. So I moved and I needed to buy a washer and dryer and bought this. It dried fine. But then I started to notice little pin prick holes in my clothes. I am saying to myself maybe these were here and I just never noticed . My mother was very sick and I was her sole caretaker she had died and I just moved. So I might have missed them because I was stressed. But no I brought new clothes and there were holes in them too. Next thing was to figure out if it was the dryer or the washer. It was the dryer. I called repair and he mentioned that he is getting calls like this all of the time. I called Frigidaire and told them people are complaining all over the internet about the same problem and the repairman told me he has been calls to. Mind you he said not just Frigidaire dryers but other brands too. Frigidaire and me came to a amicable agreement.

However, the theory presented is in my opinion the most solid approach to SEO, and it took me years to learn what this book has presented. It relies less on \\"tricks\\" and more on long term, solid strategies to get keep you successful for the long run. It isn't extremely technical, which makes it great for the beginner, but its not so basic that it can't be useful.If you are in the least bit serious about being a webmaster, whether you have one site or many, this book needs to be on your shelf.

The first Korean Kaiju, it's quickly established that this was made to cash in on Toho's success with only a tiny fraction of the budget. While amusing at times, the cheap production often gets in the way of doing something that rarely adds much to a movie's cost - good writing. It's just not that good.Now the newer version, also known ( and shown on Sci-Fi Channel) as \\"Reptillian\\" is a much better film - dispite some of the worse gajin actors since the international version of \\"Gamera the Invinceble\\". With it's own glitches being much more entertaining than the original, this is a remake that delivers and is worth getting.Kaiju people have their own way of rating films and are usually very forgiving of compromised production values, the original \\"Yongary\\" just isn't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this DVD, get the Orion VHS!","review":"There really isn't much to say about the film. If you don't know it already and like it you probably won't buy it anyway, because it's just an obscure Korean monster flick. But if you want it, here's my advice: Try to get one of the old Orion tapes and just forget about this DVD.

It's probably three levels below the weekly Ultraman shows that was available in Japan during the same time period.On top of that, there's an ugly and dislikable kid (much like the \\"Kenny\\" of the Gamera movies of the same time period) which pretty much makes it unbearable to anyone over the age of 8.This movie should have killed the Korean monster movie industry (and almost did).

Not for the microwave!","review":"These dishes chip VERY easily! I've had my set for a year and nearly half have a chip on some edge. Also these are NOT good for the microwave! The plate heats up much quicker than the food. For example, I would typically microwave a hotdog for 45-60 seconds. Even after this short length of time, the plate is too hot to touch bare-handed. I cannot plate my children's food, heat it in the microwave, then give it to them because the plates are too hot. I had Pfaltzgraff for years and never had either of these problems. Looks like Target wasn't such a good deal after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic KX-TG 2238S Battery","review":"Why the battery vendors do not publish the Amp-hr rating for their product?

When it arrived I realized that there was no way that the DVD was new. It was tapped closed (not with normal security tape) and when I tried to remove the tape it ripped the whole cover off. Then, when I got the package open the plastic prongs that hold the DVD in place were broken and the DVD was scratched. So, I am really happy that I paid full price for an obviously used item. Thanks! The only reason I am giving 2 stars it because I love the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD. 17th april 2004.","review":"It is a good film, and it is based on a girl who's mum never treated her with her best simpathy when she was younger. She is grown up now, and sidda meets her mum again after all that time. It keeps going back to when she was a child. I thought of it as been one of them films that it may not suit everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a review, but I had to get this out of my system.","review":"I tried to read the book when it first came out several years ago. I got about one-third of the way through it before giving up and donating it to the church rummage sale. Hated it. Wouldn't watch this movie on a bet.The appeal of the whole thing escapes me. Maybe a lot of women approach it (mistakenly) thinking it's some kind of life-affirming sisterhood female bonding thing.It showed up in my recommendations for some reason, that's what set off this rant. Thanks for letting me vent my spleen. I would've rated it zero stars, but that doesn't appear to be an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best Movies I have Ever Seen","review":"This movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time. It has humor, sadness, and a story and could be labeled a gal flick but I think men will find it good as well. The story unfolds using the characters all the way through and all their quirks. Very good - I can't wait for it to release so I can buy it and watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The southern woman is revealed","review":"This could be a story about any Southern woman in any decade.

Very dark humor about alcoholism and abuse to treat manic depression. Not how the movie was promoted. Where we were the whole audience left feeling uneasy from what they saw. I think this move went a little too far. If you wish to be depressed from a show - Go see this movie.About 30 minutes of the movie is wonderful and gracefully turns into a Hollywood nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen it all before!","review":"This is the kind of film you go to because you want to have a feel good movie watching experience. Unfortunately after about 20 minutes you'll be checking your watch to see how much time is left. The secrets revealed in Ya-Ya are nothing new, in fact they are not even interesting. Sandra Bullock plays a successful working woman who complains just a little to much about her mother who lives hundreds of miles away. Sandra thinks her mother is crazy, but in a funny and goodnatured way, little does she know that the secret the movie is all about is that her mother IS really crazy. Ya-Ya is a lot of talk and no substance, you feel nothing for any of the characters, except for maybe poor James Garner for being trapped in a movie his character is not needed in and appears not even to be wanted in. My advice to is to go rent 'Fried Green Tomatoes' and see a better movie, and save yourself a buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good chick flick","review":"This isn't bad for chick flick. Sandra Bullock and James Gardner were really good in this movie. Maggie Smith was pretty funny as Caro, the friend. It's a touching story to watch. It's also very moving too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I rented this movie, hoping it would be kinda Steel Magnolia's all over, but I was sorely disappointed. All the older actresses had these horrible southern accents, and Sandra Bullock couldn't remember if she was from Louisiana or the Midwest, and kept bouncing back and forth between the two accents (and yes, I am southern, and have lived in the south my entire life, so I can spot a fake accent). All in all, a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"mothers and daughters","review":"Roger Ebert hated this movie, but I liked it as a story of the young woman Sidda (Sandra Bullock) who comes to grips with her strained relationship with her mother through the help of her mother's three lifelong friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZ Looking for a storyline, here . .","review":"If you like contrived, surrepetitious, and lazy stereotypes . . you'll love Ya-Ya.

Symbols and experiences of femaleness run throughout the book -- from tarted up Holy Ladies to time-stopping rides on a (female) circus elephant. What images the movie does take are either masculinized (turning the elephant into a phallic airplane piloted by a man!) or diminished and cutesified (the girls flashing their bras at a local police officer rather than floating in a mother-bath under moonlight in a watertower).Read the book instead, or listen to Rebecca Wells's terrific reading of the abridged version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine","review":"The hilarious Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood is a gem in the world of chick flicks. I normally do not enjoy movies like this, but this one had me laughing out loud. Ellen Burstyn is amazing, and Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd are marvelous as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"ya-ya, yeah, yeah...","review":"If you've read the book, do not see the movie. Miss-cast, miss-directed. Take an endearing story of women of strong character, and replace the layers so carefully revealed in the book with strident screaming women with acting about as animated as a wooden puppet on steriods.If you haven't read the book, you may enjoy it as complete fluff. But only if you really beleiuve Sandra Bullock is the next Great Actress. Wait for the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll never get the time back!","review":"I love Sandra Bullock, but I hated this movie. First, the timeline doesn't seem right. These women are too old to have a daughter Sandra Bullock's age, but too young to have been old enough to attend the premiere of Gone With the Wind. Second, Ellyn Burstyn's character is selfish and hateful. We are supposed to feel sympathy for her when we learn how her childhood was, but it really wasn't made out to be that terrible. The Ya-Ya's take alcoholism and insanity too lightly, and are just annoying. I guess they are good friends, friends from childhood, but they don't seem to be in the picture when she is having her breakdown(s). I found the film to be pointless and boring with very few funny moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run men! Run!","review":"I watched this movie because I am a big fan of Sandra Bullock and this is just about the only movie of her's I haven't seen. The Ya Ya Sisterhood is just WAY too much of a chick-flick for me. All the women in this movie are nuts. You're left wondering why in the world the two guys in the movie stick around. The guys even look like they hate being in this movie. It's not even funny. The flashbacks are often boring and depressing. Women will love this but if you're a guy just stay away. The worst part of the movie is the use of the \\"Ya Ya\\"s. That alone was incredibly annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched, wretched, wretched!","review":"This was soooo awful. Nothing makes me angrier than movies like this, which remind me that Hollywood thinks women want to see saccharine, schmalz and overdone emotional histrionics. Even though I didn't like the book, for some dumb reason I thought the film might be able to improve on it -- especially with this great cast. But no. The first ten minutes give you a pretty good idea of how dumb this is going to be: the adolescent ya-yas' irritating secret ceremony, followed by Bullock and Burstyn screaming at each other over the phone and then smashing their cordless phones against countertops. As one of the other reviewers said, to call this a \\"chick flick\\" is insulting to all chicks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya-Ya's Unite","review":"I caught a sneak of this film last night & really, really enjoyed it. Sandra Bulloch, Maggie Smith (she should get a Best Supporting), Ashley Judd (hello, Oscar?)and Ellen Bursten are particularly wonderful in conveying \\"the Southern way.\\" I think everyone in the audience could take something away at the conclusion of the film. It's poignant, funny, happy, sad...just a wonderful product from Bette Midler's production company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Packing Problems","review":"I had ordered lots of movies for Christmas presents. They all came in one box and 4 of them had damage to the cases. The center plastic stabilizer that holds the DVD in place was broken and the DVD was sliding all around inside the case. The cases are no longer usable as the DVD won't stay in place. I was not happy with the packaging and the lack of protection. Several of these movies had been banging around in transit. I am most upset by 3 things: 1. I can no longer use the original case to store the movie. 2. The movies were scratched due to being loose inside case. 3. I have never had this problem in ordereing from Amazon before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy, Great Service","review":"I couldn't beat the price or the service.

Very happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, crappy movie","review":"I liked the book this movie is based on. I like most of the actors involved with the movie. Except for a few of the flashback scenes starring Ashley Judd, I hated this movie. The plot is complicated by the ludicrous and entirely invented kidnapping premise. Terrible. Terrible. The one star here is for Ashley Judd who is beautiful and perfectly cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be.","review":"A real downer that goes nowhere good.The commercials made it look like a comedy, so I watched this movie on tv tonight. Well, it's anything but.It's a hodge-podge of reminicenses about a woman who lost the love of her life early, never gets over it, becomes an alcoholic... while her siblings (hence the sisterhood), subsequent husband (a boring self-appointed martyr) and innocent children suffer right along with her.Ashley Judd gives a good performance, but it's not enough to save this film.My rating: Skip It"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Close!","review":"This is quite possibly the worst book to movie translation. There are so many unbelievably HUGE differences that make the movie absolutely nothing like the book. One of the worst movies I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies in YEARS","review":"I seem to be one of the few women on the planet who had never even heard of the book before this movie came out, and I am a voracious reader. It does give me the opportunity to review the movie on its own merits. I am ordering the books from this esteemed web site, and I'm sure I will deeply enjoy those as well. Experience has taught me it's always best to see the movie first if you can work it that way.I do not remember ever being so emotionally engaged in a movie in my entire life. I was laughing, crying, or both throughout most of the film, exhausted when it was over, and could hardly wait to watch it again.While I have picked up several foreshadowings and other tidbits with repeated viewing, I did not find the flashback format at all difficult to follow.The casting is superb; what an honor to see such a crew all in one place!Get this movie and schedule a slumber party!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blah Blah Sisterhood","review":"With a cast like this bringing a book like this to screen, I was hopeful that this would be a great movie experieince...and was thoroughly disappointed.The film version was not able to, or just plain didn't, capture the complexities of the characters as a whole. And the acting...Maggie Smith, one of the GREATS, is reduced to Lifetime TV fare with her BAD southern accent. It's a shame to see a woman of this calibur talent wasted so horribly. And Burnstein plays her imbalanced character too over the top to be believable. Bullock isn't challenged much in her role, making her again trapped in a part that makes no use of her screen presence or talents.Overall, rent this movie if you must see it, or better yet, wait until it comes on cable or something...but seeing this movie and paying good money for it are two entirely different things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another POS","review":"\\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\\" is one of those movies you'll see and wonder why did I rent this? Hopefully you didn't take the extra step and buy it before viewing it. Buyer's remorse to the tenth power! The movie is about a mother (Ellen Burstyn) and daughter (Sandra Bullock) who have disowned each other and a group of older women's attempts to bring the two together. The movie goes back-and-forth with flashbacks from the 60's and present day. Hitting the phone has never been so much fun! Blast those things for being so loud! The movie tries to make you cry and it works! I was crying so much because I had wasted three dollars for the rental! A terrible movie and one of the worst of 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD was damaged","review":"the price was great; however I returned the DVD because it was scratched and it would get stuck when played."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"To say that this is a \\"chick\\" movie is insulting to chicks.If you like stories about gals from the South who drink like fish, talk too much, and act like fools then I guess this is the movie for you. It bears slight resemblance to the book, except it has the same characters. The jumps in time are confusing, the situations the women find themselves in are contrived and implausable, the characters are outrageous, but if this is what floats your boat, and it obviously does some people's, then pop some corn and let your mind go numb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed DVD replaced right away","review":"The DVD had wavy picture and static.

I order with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too close for comfort","review":"I've not seen this point of view mentioned so at the risk of annoying those who love this movie, I have to throw out a little caution. I am the oldest daughter of an alcoholic who had not read the book first. Parts of this were very hard to watch and still prey on my mind. Given that perspective, I guess it's not surprising that I did not enjoy this movie and could not feel any affection for its characters or satisfaction at its ending. What I AM left with though is admiration for Ashley Judd, Ellen Burstyn and the actress who played the young Siddalee, they were amazing. Sorry to be a wet blanket, maybe I need a visit from some Ya-Yas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poster Girls for Bad Behavior","review":"The problem with Shepp is that he wasn't Rhett Butler.

I really like Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd - but not in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of good talent. Forget about it. Read the book.","review":"Because I had read and enjoyed the book several years ago, I was curious as to the kind of film it would make. It was billed as a comedy but turned out to be a bad soap opera. And any real similarity to the book were just on the surface. It seemed to follow the plot outline, but jumped around in time much too much. And the characters all came out as caricatures.Basically it's a mother-daughter story, with Sandra Bullock cast as the daughter, Sidda, and Ellen Burstyn as the mother, Vivienne. What a waste of good talent! Ashley Judd is the younger Vivienne and does a pretty good job. But the audience hasn't a clue as to why she abuses her children and has a mental breakdown. It all seemed staged and not a bit plausible.As for my recommendation: forget about it.

I put my 3 year old in it for a test run and strapped him in. Something caught his eye and he sat forward, and completely ripped the straps of the 5 point harness clear off the back of the stroller. My kid is not large, nor is he exceptionally strong. All he did was lean forward, and that caused the straps to rip. Shoddiest construction I've ever seen. My cheap $50 stroller has held up far better over the years. The damage is fixable... but now I have to sew the straps back on. That's not something you should have to do to a $350+ stroller before you even get it out of the driveway.

It has potential, really! But what i just watched was almost humorous. The music, the acting, the dialogue...was disgusting. I'm almost positive that i could gather some kids out of a high school drama class, and produce a better film than \\"pumpkin\\". I laughed after Tennis-Star \\"Kent\\" drives his car off a cliff, plunging 200+ feet into the mountainside. The next scene shows kent with not a scratch on his body - but thats ok - he's paralyzed. Right. Christina Ricci provides no real emotion in any scene at all, in my opinion. This movie is not dramatic, its comedic. Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Right up there with the perfect storm, or spy hard, for that matter. Whatever you do - avoid this movie like the plague. Honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to hard to be \\"indy\\"","review":"As another reviewer below said, I gave up on the film in the EXACT same spot she did....when Ricci's character is walking through the campus and gets disgusted by the garbage, rats and a dead bird.There is a point where some indy films decide that quirky scenes make up for a lack of plot or character devolopment. Many, MANY things in this film felt rushed, the plotting bordered on schizophrenic (the filmmakers seemed to have a clear vision of \\"point A\\" and \\"point B\\", but no clue how to drive the \\"car\\" between the two points) and even though you can tell Ricci's character is trying to redeem herself, you have NO clue WHY she is doing so. A few minutes spent with her \\"special\\" charge is supposed to make her entire life turn around? I just don't get it, and after 45 minutes I didn't want to anymore. (and isn't it interesting two people both gave up at the exact same time?)Save your money, and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie-Nast language","review":"I saw this movie on TV and evidentally it was edited. I have an autistic grandson who loves the girl actress in this movie so I ordered it for him. Well, needless to say, for a movie for young people, this one was trashed because every other word was a slang word...the 4 letter kind! It was so appauling that the swearing took away from the movie. The story itself is wonderful. I was so dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it Just Bad, or is it Funny?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was not at all what I expected... it was much better than just a tear-jerker coming-of-age film about a sorority girl and a \\"challenged\\" man. It is all satirical and pokes fun at sororities and even itself. The parts that seem really bad are hilarious if you go into it realizing that it is intentional. The car crash scene cracked me up. The actual footage of the car bursting into flame was obviously from some other movie or just stock footage. I think that the people who reviewed this movie poorly just took it too seriously. You have to laugh at these characters. If you thought that they seemed like real people and not exaggerated stereotypes, then you missed the point.

I could almost feel my brain melting... that's how bad of a viewing experience it was. When we rented this, I was excited to see it because I like Christina Ricci as an actress, but this was SUCH a TOTAL MASSIVE LETDOWN. Not heartwarming at all. The characters were cold, flat and unlikeable. It also seemed rather insulting/offensive to disabled people.

It's a sweet, and thoughtful movie. It's just very strange, and it's a different kind of movie to watch. You wish that the characters weren't so naive and odd. But it's just the way life is for them. So it's about perfect girl Carolyn who falls for a mentally challenged athlete who she is supposed to mentor. Instead, she finds herself falling for him, and in the process, she realizes what it's like to have a life full of pain and sadness. It's a good movie.

I heard some great things about Pumpkin and I was excited to see it but it was not what I expected at all. Yes, I knew what the concept of the film was, a young sorority girl who falls in love with a mentally challenged student. This film was just too stereotypical for me, it wasn't funny or that witty. I was extremely disappointed with the outcome of the film, too bad Pumpkin wasn't something special, two hours of nothing, that's all it was to me. I'd skip this one, what was the point of this film anyway, to make fun of handicapped people? Avoid this at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment for Christa Ricci fans!!!!","review":"I would not recommend this movie in a thousand years.

I was completely disappointed. Being \\"independent\\" doesn't automatically make a movie worthwhile. This movie lacks any real punch, in the dramatic, comedic, or stylistic framework it attempts to fill. First of all, Christina Ricci is hard to believe as the girl with the \\"perfect\\" life. She is much more suited to her former darker and more naturalistic roles. The plot is far-fetched (not always a bad thing...but here it is), at times offensive, and repetitive. I watched the entire movie hoping that somehow the end would justify the means but the end seemed to hammer that last nail in the coffin. I give it two-stars because it made me smile or chuckle once in a while but mostly I just shook my head. May pumpkin rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced, but still somewhat watchable","review":"Pumpkin stars Christina Ricci who is as good as usual in her role as a sorority girl. The movie should get some credit for trying to be a satire, I guess I respect any movie that attempts to shed some light on appropiate targets. However, it misses the point entirely, and is incoherent and unfocused. The filmmakers actually started on an interesting premise and didn't know what to do with it. And a sub plot with the smothering mother of Pumpkin involving the almost exploitation of her son with the \\"Special Olympics\\" type games should've been developed to fruition."},{"rating":"1","title":"She looks REALLY GOOD. The rest of it doesn't.","review":"Hard to know exactly what made this one fall apart: the writing, the direction, or the editing? My guess is that it's a little bit of all three. What is admittedly an interesting premise gets pretty much ruined by a completely botched pace. Everybody's sense of right and wrong does a complete 180 at the same moment, but I'll be darned if I can say why. Oh well. It beats Desert Blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most unusual romance","review":"Christina Ricci excells in this as the initially snobish college girl who is compelled to take a physically and mentally handicapped young man under her wing. All too true to life; to say more would be to reveal all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten Pumpkin","review":"For the first 2/3 of this film, it wasn't bad. Christina Ricci was interesting to wacth, as always, and any film with Brenda Blethyn already has a few points in its favor. However, the last fifteen minutes of this film contained the absolute worst dialogue and situations I've ever experienced. For example, the vain star tennis player drives off a cliff, his car burst into flames, then he is next seen in the hospital, unscathed, but paralyzed. Within a month, he is coaching the very special needs individuals he loathed. Hmm. Don't waste your time or money on this drivel. Sorry, Brenda. Sorry, Christina."},{"rating":"1","title":"revolving genres","review":"Christina Ricci, whose performances I normally enjoy, couldn't save this movie from its' shattered existence.The movie centers around Ricci's perfect, shallow, sorority sister character, who falls in love with a mentally challenged young man. Filled to the brim with jokes about \\"retards and minorities,\\" the movie tries, but falters. A satire? Sometimes, but most of the time I felt this movie struggling under the weight of what it was trying to do. In fact, I'm not quite sure the directors knew what they were doing. I found myself questioning the intent throughout.Approach with trepidation.If you're interested in seeing these risque ideas played out in a more effective manner, rent Storytelling instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?!","review":"I think this movie actually lowered my IQ. It was so dumb! How did Pumpkin go from barely being able to stand up to running and dancing?! The other characters were underdeveloped and wishy-washy. Overall, the movie just creeped me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have never in my life spent so much time discussing how awful a movie is...that is until this one. I was never sure if I was watching a comedy or a drama. This movie would have been really funny if it didn't take itself so seriously. The comedy billing was accurate though...this would make an excellent Mystery Science Theatre 3000 feature.Suprisingly enough, I don't miss the 2 hours of my life I spent watching it though. It was like a car accident, you shouldn't watch it, but you can't look away."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA HA HA!","review":"If I could reveiw this movie lower I would have. Whoever liked this movie must love horrible dialougue and acting. The [things] she say's is embarassing. If I were Ricci I'd stay out of the movie buisness until this one blew over. I'll just put it this way, it blowed bad, way worse then I could even imagine. I won't waste anymore time writing because I wasted too much time watching the awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Directors need to go back to sch & pay attention this time!","review":"An absolute horrible waste of time. I never did figure out what the author and director were trying to do. I spent most of the film feeling sorry for the actors for getting caught in such a badly written, totally out of touch, non-funny, non-poignant, piece of garbage. Total lack of character development, a plot that at times could be understood only by someone who grew up in southern California, complete inability to bring any intensity to the camera from any of the cast, these guys (the Directors) need to go back to school and pay attention this time!Don't be caught up in the idea (like I was) that the plot could be marvelous....it's a good idea very badly done. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN \\"REAL LIFE\\"!!!!","review":"WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH ALL YOU PEOPLE GIVING THIS MOVIE A GOOD REVIEW????

This is NOT a comedy. I thought it was suppose to be a drama. It is a comedy? How much was the Washington Post payed to say that. I'd like one review to name 3 funny things in this film. Name 3 things that made you laugh. Otherwise, I may have had a second chuckle.The romance is not great at all. She feels sorry for him one minute then they want to get marry.Later, the guy changes so much. He starts nice, then goes mean, then nice, then mean, then nice again? What is going on with him. Pumpkin was alright. I felt sorry for him, but he improved a lot over the film.Not that great. Not funny. Not real plausible(believable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"please don't watch this...","review":"I stared in disbelief for 95% of the movie and now I have an extreme headache. What on earth could the script have looked like, and why would they portray the disabled like that, and why would Christina Ricci want to be a part of this, and why would Belle and Sebastian lend their music (and Mercury Rev and...), and why would it go ON AND ON AND ON?This is one of those films where it's so bad you can't help but finish it.

I want to see the other one","review":"I read the reviews before renting this DVD and it had mixed reviews.. I was wondering is there two versions. The version I seen was predictable. shamefully poorly directed. and I was thinking 1/2 hr into it \\"Glad I didnt waste 8.50 at the theater\\"I believe this is what happens when banks invest in movies instead of stocks. There is always a buck to be made regardless of how bad a movie is. .. well i digress.. anyway this is yet \\"ANOTHER\\" coming of age movie.. and the funny parts are predictable.. so much so they fail to be funny anymore. Very little in the way of character developement.. so muckh so you can start watching the movie at any point and pick up on it. The movie is entertaining enough to be a made for tv movie.. This is definetly not a movie for the collection...maybe the trash collection. Keep your cash or rent something funny like Sorority Boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not waste your money on this movie","review":"This was horrible. I don't know how it got rated as hysterically funny or even in the comedy category. Stupid? yes. Funny? NoThis movie was insulting to handicapped persons and overweight persons (of which I am neither). It was insensitive, stupid, poorly filmed, whatever a movie shouldn't be, Pumpkin was. What Pumpkin was NOT was entertaining.Please do not waste your money buying this movie. Don't even waste your money renting it (like I did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was Christina thinking?","review":"Bad, bad, bad. I have never felt compelled to write a review of a movie before. However, after watching Pumpkin, I felt that I had to let the viewing audience know that this movie sucks...really bad. First off, I am a huge Christina Ricci fan, but what was she thinking when she agreed to star and produce this film? I couldn't even finish the film for I felt that if I did, bad karma was going to hit me. The producers should be pelted with garbage for their complete exploitation of developmentally disabled populations. To the film crew, you suck and so does the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I have ever seen","review":"Not even worth one star. I have never been so discusted in my whole life. I am in shock that anyone could think this movie is either realistic, touching, or meant to be taken seriously. It wasn't funny, but I found it in the comedy section. If I hadn't rented it I would have broken the disc and thrown it right in the trash. Please do not watch this movie unless you want your intelligence to be insulted by this extremely sickening movie. The story might have had a small chance of being pulled off, but the people who produced this film have managed to create a disgrace, and the acting was so pathetic I wanted to scream!!! Nothing in this movie was believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something here?.........","review":"I read on the cover and it says is hystaraly funny?

To the idiot who said if you dont laugh youre lame, shut the hell up cause if you sad films like this funny than you have no taste in movies.

If you take this film and the love between Caroline Duffy and Pumpkin Romanoff literally, you should justifiably be offended and disgusted. The metaphor in a nutshell -- Pumpkin represents pain. When Caroline is finally introduced to pain and embraces all it has to teach her, she sheds the vacuous shell of a person she was and begins her evolution into a truly thinking, feeling, and enlightened being. That's my kind of love story. Oh, and did I mention it's hilarious?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written & hilarious!","review":"I don't understand the bad reviews - this movie is HILARIOUS! It skewers so many dominant paradigms - the college Greek system, \\"special\\" games, college staff, issues of entitlement and perception are all fair game. It had some \\"you must be kidding me\\" moments and overall I really enjoyed it and found it very amusing.

It's a riveting story of personal transformation and courage in the face of unrelenting persecution by authorities, and a reminder of how fragile and how precious are our civil liberties. Anne Braden is a heroine-- dedicated, single-minded in her pursuit of civil rights, but compassionate and always interested in individuals. There's plenty of bombings, arrests, and HUAC subpoenas to keep you turning pages,and lots of quotes, oral-history style, from major figures from the 50s and 60s. It's well-written--Fosl is an expert interviewer and very good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I replaced the original pillows that came with my couch with these.

Had I never had that assignment, I never would have read the book and I would have missed a lot. Streitmatter does an excellent job at taking an issue, sex in the media, that is generally looked down upon, and giving it a positive outlook. This book focuses on Americas exceptance and openess of sexuality, and the steps that took them there. From topics such as birth control, so sex in music and The Doors, and from Cosmo to Reality TV. Streitmatter covers them in a very educational way. All these things influenced what the media is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and tender","review":"This is a wonderful book for children whether or not they're experiencing the event of a new baby in the family, The photographs amazingly fit the text.

This book is wonderful for amateur Hopper enthusiasts and presents in-depth analysis balanced with connections to contemporary painters and changes in society.

There really is no science to this at all. There's also no real fizz to the fizz balls you make for the bath. Directions are poor -- to the bath salts you can add any herbs of your choice, but they give no guidance on which herbs might blend well with the lavender or peppermint oils. Then, there's getting the herbs out of the tub and out of your hair....There are not enough ingredients even to make one of each item discussed in the directions. Rather disappointing, actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but could use more \\"science\\"","review":"I liked the idea that my daughter could play \\"mad scientist\\" - she's always mixing up concoctions and experimenting in this way, so this seemed a perfect fit. I wish there were more measuring tools and was hoping for more observational activities. I was VERY surprised that this kit does NOT contain everything you need for the activities and while the extra materials are easily obtained, it was somewhat of a letdown to not be able to play with the kit until we had a chance to go grocery shopping.

The lyrics range from the mundane, two lovers going separate paths, to the more provocative--struggling to affirm life in the presence of evil and suffering. If you like this type of music, you might check out the similar crooning from Magnet, Page France, Ronderlin, Midlake, and Radio Dept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born in the UK","review":"This CD is excellent. When I first put it in, it opened with a weird talking track and it made me wonder what I had gotten myself into.

Thrilling and full of energy, I was shocked that this book didin't make more noise in the book stores.Set in Gitmo in modern times, Secrets Unbecoming shows that rough seas can be encountered on dry land as well as water.

Our students delight in the author's writing style combining humor with substance. In operating our school, I depend on authors like Rod to help equip our students with the highest possible level of aeronautical knowledge which in turn enables them to make sound inflight decisions. I particularily appreciate the exceptional manner in which Rod teaches the proper use of approach lighting systems pursuant to FAR 91.175.Mark Wilson, Owner, IFR Flight Training School, Austin, Texas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst aviation book I have ever read","review":"Having read and enjoyed many aviation books by the likes of Richard Collins, Robert Buck, Ernest Gann, I was looking forward to getting my teeth into Rod Machado's Instrument Pilot's Survival Manual. Unfortunately the actual information on the subject of instrument flying was so horribly interwoven with third rate one-liners that it was impossible to read seriously. Unless you actually like very bad jokes thrown into educational/training material, don't buy this book. It is a real shame that this book was not edited better as there are some very insightful points but the style of writing makes it rather inaccessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod Machado does it again!","review":"With over 25 years of experience in the aviation industry, Rod Machado has a significant background to draw from in his books. He presents material important to the Instrument pilot, and even to private pilots thinking about getting their instrument rating in a straightforward and humorous manner. Rod Machado is never boring and always relevant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Given as a gift to an IFR Rated Pilot","review":"I wish my dad (a pilot) was still around. I'd gift a copy of this to him in a heartbeat. Reading his Private Pilot magazines lying around the study in his house gave me an introduction to Rod Machado's teaching style, flying knowledge and humor. Knowledge is still power. Clear skys to you, Dad, and thanks.Instead, I gave this as a gift to a good friend with whom I have flown several Instrument Approachs. Whomever says they know all there is to know about flying better have wings attached to their body. Anything that helps the pilot stay focused and alert will help them to stay alive. This book is well worth any money spent.I'll get my own copy when I'm good at VFR procedures, and am ready to move ahead in my flight training."},{"rating":"2","title":"head in the clouds","review":"I'd highly recommend this book to VFR pilots that are working on the instrument rating, and I'd also recommend it to instrument-rated pilots that need an occasional refresher. That's what I use it for. In southern California, our \\"actual\\" is often a tenth here and there as we bust up through the marine layer or shoot an approach. There's a lot to remember, and Rod's examples and explanations help me get my head back in the clouds.btw, this second edition adds a chapter on GPS approaches and a weather chapter with lots of cool color illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instrument Learning Made Interesting","review":"I was really struggling with all of the information that I needed to pass the instrument test. I saw Rod Machado at Sun 'n Fun in Lakeland and was really impressed with his grasp of the difficult.I bought his Instrument Pilot's Survival Manual and found that everything in it was clear and easy to understand as promised. The author has a way of explaining things that I had never found in any other source. There were facts and ways to understand them here that no other book had bothered to go through.I was amazed that I was laughing and learning at the same time. Machado has a way of expressing things that make them easy to remember and fun at the same time. The chapter on Thunderstorm Avoidance was worth the price of the book alone.The only down side to the book is that is too short. I wanted to keep reading to keep learning.If you have to buy one book to pass your instrument test, THIS IS THE ONE!P.S.- I passed my instrument ticket with 'flying' colors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not too funny, not too organized","review":"Machado's schtick is funny here and there, but elsewhere is an annoying distraction. The biggest problem though is how disorganized the book is. The chapters just follow a stream-of-consciousness ordering, with nothing to tie them together except for a clever little quip. There are lots of good tips in there, but it's not a *book*."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Breed","review":"This is undoubtedly the best IFR instruction and reference book on the market. It is easy to read -- keeps the reader engaged through mild humor and relevancy. I used it in conjunction with Instrument Ground School and continue to go back to it for an easy to use reference. I've bought and read many books on instrument flying, and for a basic book, I found Rod Machado's book to be number one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Size Does NOT fit all.","review":"These were extremely cute and sexy, BUT..ONE SIZE MY A**.

These are a little whiter than in the pictures, but still look great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thigh high not calf high","review":"I ordered these from the USA as the style and colours were just so much better than all the products in London. Not only did they actually fit but they were prettier and only half the price of the items over here. Even with the p and p it worked out cheaper. In addition one size fits all actually means up to 160lbs which is so much better than the skimpy versions we have here. Well done, I'm sure I'll be back.M"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about bulges","review":"I am not fat but boy these make me look like I am - when you get them up to the thigh, they are so tight that any little whatever above the line just bulges out - kind of work like a tight rubber band, and then proceed to roll!!!

He presents a clear description of a coach's job as well as specific and successful strategies. As in his book, The Mental Game of Baseball, the emphasis is on mental discipline.The second part of the book consists of his observations (arranged alphabetically) on all aspects of coaching that one can consult as one would a dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! The best really","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read. As a sport coach this book is absolutely a must read. Every coach should read this book, as it makes you reflect your own coaching methods, ideas, philosophies (if you have any formally formulated).

To find out out if he does it, you have to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Decendets offer us a real treat in the field of comedy punk. Fun lyrics, catchy songs, party feeling.

It takes less of your time and offers as much - if not more - laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a punk & I'm not a loser","review":"This is one of the best examples of 80's punk music.It's raw, fast, snotty, silly, angst ridden music, for and by, sububan rejects.The guitar is a raw and savage downstroke attack. The bass and drums keep the music tight and melodic. And the vocals; Milo Auckerman is the best punk singer of all time, his raspy and melodic style of singing captures a full range of emotions, from rage to frustration, to heartbreak. But no, it's not EMO, it's punk rock, the way it should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Punk Album","review":"This is my second favorite punk album, my favorite being the Circle Jerks Group Sex. I hate how everyone is so closed minded about music. There's \\"goth\\" people who only listen to Marilyn Manson and Slipknot. Then there is the people who only listen to rap. Then there's those kids that think there punk because they listen to The Casualties which is a good band but the kids think that punk is how you dress and how you have your hair. It isn't its how you think, how you feel. This is real punk rock.Favorite songs: \\"I Wanna Be A Bear\\", \\"I'm Not A Loser\\", and \\"Catalina\\". I strongly recomend this album to anyone who likes punk rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pioneers of Pop Punk","review":"First, to the idiot \\"Music Fan from San Francisco.\\" As most reviews have noted; the Descendents were years before Less Than Jake, and every pop punk band around today (Blink, Good Charlotte, etc) so you obviously haven't been \\"in the scene\\" very long.Anyway, this is a great album. I've always loved, \\"Marriage,\\" probably because of the slow beginning, then, the nice kick in, rockin' chorus. I got into the Descendents in '87 right after they broke up, but fortunately, 10 or so years later they got back together..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the newest stuff","review":"This a Ok album, I say \\"ok\\" cause 2 of my favorite descendents songs are on it (Bikeage and Hope)but the rest isn't all that great, it isn't bad at all but it isn't at all trying to be like Less than Jake or Blink 182 since it was made in 1982, before they were even bands. Some people need to get their facts straight, but according to another review they are just posers of those other bands, thats funny. Over all it's a good album but for a better one go with Somery it's got a lot of what this one has plus about 15 more songs, get Everything Sucks to, thats my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHUT UP KIDS!!!","review":"Okay, first off, I'm well over 18, blah blah blah... next, just allow me to stray from the subject for one minute: HOW DARE YOU BASH GREEN DAY!!! THEY DID MORE FOR PUNK THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW, SO SHUT UP!!! Now, as for this CD...BRILLIANT!! A CLASSIC! All the songs are good, and, in my opinion, this is the best descendents CD. If you like this, check out the ADOLESCENTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disliked this cd very much","review":"This cd wasn't quite like the other cd's. It didn't have the Descendants I knew. After a while it got very repetitive and I ended up selling the cd. I do not recomend this cd at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Ok - it's punk! Woo hoo. Boring, repetitive, uninspiring; it probably did mean something in the past. But the past is over for a reason - for heaven's sake when I was younger I thought that Aztec Camera were good and I've learnt from my error.This is an album for music snobs who like to lecture folks about what is 'real' punk, and like to ridicule those who aren't sheep like losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is lame","review":"I bought this cd because my friends liked them. I hated them. They are the worst and are posers of Less Than Jake and Blink182. It is the worst cd ever. I hate Quincy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget its flaws. This album is too much fun to ignore.","review":"Fitting in; looking for girls; and wondering why they couldn't get any... that's what makes this record such a punk milestone. Sure Milo can be a bit whiney, but who cares! Part of this record's fun is the immature anger and frustration of being a teenager torn between fitting in and wanting to give everyone the finger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the greatest Descendents CD yet","review":"I think this Cd is great. Almost all of the songs are good. I think it is the best Descendents CD out yet and i have most of them.

Totally recommend it. A worthy purchase of any fan of punk, or silly teenage songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greats.","review":"In dark bars scattered across america in the dankest corners where old school punks gather and reminesce about the good old days of their genre this album will most definately come up. Milo goes to college is a top 3 punk album of all time.Right there with the NOFX's Black Flag's and Dead Kennedy's the descendents brought a sense of juvenile angst to the party. Milo auckerman's voice is perfect when this album was made and you truly feel his emotion in songs like \\"hope\\" and \\"jean is dead\\". IF you are a fan of punk rock/pop punk/or emo milo goes to college has something for even the most hardcore.If you do not own this piece of musical history then stop reading this now and hit the order button. It is worth every penny.

They imply that this \\"book\\", which is really an ad pamphlet for the author's software, will teach the reader even a little about \\"technical analysis\\" and \\"intermarket analysis\\". While these phrases are used liberally throughout this ad pamphlet, the author only says that the detailed analyses are performed in a software package that he wrote, the name of which he uses just as liberally but one I won't mention since the dishonest nature of this book's title and description give me an idea of what the author and his software must be like.While I'm glad I got this book for free on as a promotion by the publisher, I truly regret wasting the time to read it and wonder if I can seek compensation from the author for the time I wasted to read it. Unfortunately, there is no rating of negative stars allowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trend Forecasting With Technical Analyis","review":"I think it's safe to say that there is absolutely no useful information in this book. The author should be ashamed of himself for selling it. At best it should be considered a thick brochure for his product and given away for free. It's not even worth the postage. Mr. Mendelson must think the public are idiots. This book is a dishonor to John Murphy who presents good information throughout his own books. I am stunned that Mr. Murphy is happy to have his name this book. John, what were you thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The trade secret is to buy the software!!!","review":"This book dealt very little on ideas and methodologies.

Unfortunately, Mendelsohn's book does not deliver on any of the promises made in the publisher's \\"book description\\" (above). I wish it did - that's why I bought the book. I read it carefully...there's no practical application in there, only hype for why you need his overpriced trading system software.The publisher is actually a certain book dealer in Maryland who markets to traders. In a few months they will be giving this house-published book away as a premium to anyone who orders from them, for only the price of S&H (it's not even worth that). If reading ads for software is worth your time, wait and get it then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! I Want My Money Back!","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It is a marketing piece designed to look like a reference book. It was designed to sell the author's software. As another reader wrote, there is absolutely no valuable information in this book. I contacted the online trading books company I bought this from, it was not Amazon, and asked for my money back. Of course they said 'No', leaving me feeling like I had been stung. There are a lot of books in this 'Trade Secrets Series' that do contain valuable information; unfortunately this isn't one of them. Shame on the author and publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree! Disappointing","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. I bought the book because I wanted to learn more about intermarket technical analysis, but I was totally disappointed. Instead of explaining clearly how intermarket analysis actually works, Mendelsohn just tells you how good his software is forcasting intermarket trends. Save your money and buy John Murphy's Intermarket Analysis instead, although it's a bit outdated. (Granted that his software is very good piece of forcasting tool, I still feel duped reading 120 pages of infomercial.

Unremarkable, because there are thousands of criminals who march to the same beat as Charlie Seiga.His style is very simple, with no pretension or flowery presentation, and is basically easy reading.Overall, it is not unlike many autobiographies by similar celebrity criminals, would probably make a good television script and from the auhors veiled promise, I expect that he will eventually produce a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Colored Glass!

The lid doesn't have a gasket between it and the bottle neck. Also the lid is hinged on a thin piece of plastic that's much more poorly constructed then a disposable ketchup bottle, and it broke on first use. If I had seen this in person I would not have purchased it. I don't know how this received such high reviews, maybe the lid was changed after the good reviews?

This salad dressing bottle allows you to make your own dressing simply by shaking the contents in the bottle - cost effective, reusable, and environmentally friendly. Unlike the Good Seasons bottle which snaps on and slips off, the cap to this bottle has threading which allows a more secure grip of the bottle. Then, with the thumb pressed on the cap, the bottle can be shaken. The plastic lid is unlined and does not have any latex glue or film to contaminate the bottle. It's a good bottle to store all sorts of dressings, sauces, and flavored vinegars for a healthy lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Even with my finger firmly on the cap it leaked while shaking it.

After using it half a dozen times the lid split vertically along the threads. As a result, the lid will not seal (as if it ever did) and it will not stay on the bottle.A glass bottle is great for making dressing, but spend a few extra dollars and get something with a decent lid.

It was both sobering and comforting to get what sounds like a very accurate description. I also see now what I did--both right and wrong--the time a script of mine, a romantic comedy, went out and didn't sell but got me meetings. There is a useful diagram of the Hollywood food chain, descriptions of the different players and what makes each tick, and on a bonus creative note, a seemingly simplistic but ultimately quite useful template for finding and fleshing out new story ideas.

Egglesfield encounters another group of \\"good\\" vampires who he solicits to help him find his woman. Patrick Bauchau is around as some kind of vampire bounty hunter who helps kill the vampires with crossbows. The movie's pace is not kinetic enough to generate any suspense; we've seen the fight sequences done much better in the Blade trilogy, and its climax is anti-climactic, and the ending muddled. Only for die hard vampire or martial arts fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thai Vampires","review":"I got to say I really liked this movie because it has a mixture of martial arts and horror together.This movie is practically about a Kickboxer and his girlfriend travel to Thailand to attend Kick Boxing tournaments, then afterwards the girl gets kidnapped by the head vampire Niran in hoping he would turn her into his blood slave!This movie has lots of action when the American Kickboxer dedperately tries to rescue his girlfriend and teams up with other Thai vampires in order to rescue her.In order for him to beat the head vampire, he gets bitten by a vampire in order to gain super human strength.

The locking pins broke within a few months when folding it. Inconvenient to take on a flight since there is nothing to hold it in fold position. It does fold into a small volume, though.Very easy to push.We are not sure if our child who is almost 1 is comfortable in it. We don't like the harness since it is very inconvenient to strap. The back does recline but it does not look very comfortable. There is no padding in the back and our child is still in a very much reclined position even when the back is in its most upright position. There is also no support for underneath the legs of the child.Despite all these things, we do think it was worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing American Woman in China 1905-1934","review":"This is a fascinating memoir from a woman who spent her married life in the interior or China at the beginning of the 20th century. It was originally written just for her children and thus what she considered an ordinary recounting of her life in China. The difficulties she surmounted and the strength and grace that she demonstrated reveal her as an extraordinary woman. It is a book filled with exciting adventure in addition to descriptions of the challenges of running a home deep in China. Her account of her life as the wife of a YWCA secretary gives a view of the life of a foreigner in China at the height of the missionary effort but it also is a fascinating account of what a woman is capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for yourself or friends","review":"I gave this book as a bridal shower gift and it was the hit of the party.

It faired a bit better in cookies, but still has a funky aftertaste.

Sadly that's exactly what happened to Blackfish, and many other talented bands of the day.\\"Blackfish\\" is a solid album from start to end. The record has a typical party rock feel to it, but it also incorporates some alternative vibes as well. The best track on the album is the opener \\"The Fall\\", it has a feel-good vibe that reminds of days past. The record has some other decent moments as well, but there is also a tiny bit of filler that creeps in as well.I would reccommend this record to anyone that appreciates hard rock from the 80's or early 90's.

Backyard allows one to travel further back and forward in time to understand the motion of the Universe. It also has more stars (supposedly one million, but who's counting).The book(s) is(are) well written and reference the software so one can actually see what is being described. I hope other scientific books follow a similar path. The software is easy to use and lots of fun. My kids and I have spent much time looking at the features and will likely do so for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near-perfect for all levels","review":"I agree with all that the previous reviewer has said, though I should add that 'Starry Night' is also enormous fun to use. Astronomical theory can be pretty mind-blowing at times, and this software helps to illustrate and animate what can otherwise be somewhat dry and erudite concepts. If you have any young would-be astronomers in your household, there are plenty of nifty featues that should catch their attention - the animated solar system is always a crowd-pleaser, as is the ability to take virtual rocket trips to far-flung stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"Rod came in a huge box with lots of padding.

This one, by far doesn't measure up to my previous rod that I bought at a discount store. You would think that with a brand name like this one, it would be top of the line, not the case. The caps on the end are plastic instead of rubber which makes the rod slide out of place frequently. The tension really has to be tight for it to stay in place and hold my 1 panel sheer up.

Not that there was anything wrong with the story, but I thought it was too advanced for the picture book set. I'm not sure if a Revolutionary War story could be told simply enough for the usual picture book-readers, but this was not it.On the other hand, people of all ages can enjoy beautiful art, and this book has that in lush abundance.

It was an inexpensive and poorly applied glue that held the shaft into the handle. Not worth it and an unfortunate waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as strong as I expected","review":"I was a bit dissapointed as this umbrella was a gift and not as strong as expected. It broke on the 3rd use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Not as large as advertised. Plastic piece above spring designed to hold umbrella bows when collapsed split cracked and fell off on first use.

However it doesn't telescope and the whole thing reeks of rubber/polymers and will make your hands and other things smell. You can leave it outside on a balcony to air out, but it won't do much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong color","review":"It could have been a good deal. However, the listed color for the umbrella is black, but what I received is green and white strips! It is really ugly! It works fine, but I hate being duped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Value","review":"Well, I was worried about giving this a try since there were quite a few negative reviews. I have been completely happy with this umbrella though. I gave it 4 stars since I haven't had it longer than a month, but I've used it a few times now, even on windy days, and it's held up just fine.I like that it's long enough to use as a walking stick, or even as a weapon in unfortunate cicumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubber handle so stinky it's terrible!","review":"An otherwise industrial-strength umbrella is rendered absolutely worthless by the stinky rubber handle.

It still stinks and I'm going to have to put this umbrella in the rubbish bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"umbrella","review":"perfect size for the upcoming baseball and football games.

I don't recommend this product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The umbrella broke after two uses under its own weight. The supports are made of a cheap plastic and one of them snapped when i first used this umbrella. The second time I went to use it, three additional supports broke, likely caused from the first failure. This is a good size umbrella at a great price and would be great if the supports were stronger. I will be returning this product for a refund and replacing it with something of higher quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice follow up to Build Book #1: Sick Fish","review":"I bought Sick Fish and loved it. My brother and I waited and waited for Build Book #2, hoping it would be a muscle car. We were a little disappointed that it wasn't. BB2 is still a very good read. The effort and time spent is interesting and the car looks really out of this world, looking like something that came out of the pages of Rocketeer.Good photographs, with excellent lighting in full colour, close up shots of details and good writing make this a must have for any motorhead, customiser, etc. EVEN if you don't like art-deco 30s style cars. Another inspirational Build Book!I'm giving it 4 Stars because it isn't a muscle car. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Watch","review":"This is a pretty good watch for general use and sports (ie running, cycling, etc.). It looks good and the indiglo is the reverse of previous watches I've owned (the digits glow - which is cool).My only problem is the buttons feel a little flimsier then I'd like. I get the impression that they might not last 5 years (the age of my last Timex Expedition, which I lost unfortunately - hence my buying this watch). I also wish you could choose your band. I don't like bands made from rubber and the compass is 100% worthless.If this watch came with a fastwrap strap and the buttons didn't feel flimsy then I'd give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Expedition Classic Digital Watch","review":"Easy to read large display, large function buttons. The miniature compass is useless, but can be easily removed. I would have prefered a watch band in a material other than rubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: can't cycle through saved laps","review":"This watch is very misleading. It has a 99 lap function, but when you split the laps up, you can't go back and look at the times for past laps. So, if you run 3 laps and hit \\"split\\" at the end of each lap, it will take the time for lap 1, lap 2, and lap 3 plus give you a total time. However, you can't go back and look at the time for lap 1 or 2!! This makes the lap feature on the watch essentially worthless. I can't even believe they would advertise that as a feature for this, it is a fatal flaw. If you want a cheap watch that has a chrono that you will not need to do splits/laps with, then this is a fine watch for that. But I rate it poorly because I was duped into thinking this has a lap function, which is does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"mid-size and reliable","review":"I've had this model of Timex Expedition for 6 or 7 years now, the one watch, I've had it on doing rough work in the country and it's gotten a bit beaten up but it keeps working fine. In fact looking beaten up gives it character. I did have to replace the band a couple of times. What I like about it is that (1) it's a good mid-size digital watch: not bulky but still easy to read; (2) it's easy to turn on the light at night: no trying to find a light button on the side; (3) switching between two time zones is easy: just one press and you don't have to look what you're doing (I regularly go between time zones); and 4) the timer and the stopwatch work well. I took the compass off after a couple of years: you had to hold it very flat for it to work okay, but that's a minor point. If the one I have ever gives up I think I'll get another just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"Gud watch for the price offered. The background light is good. I got the watch last month and i use it for gym activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Watch","review":"I ordered the watch on Timex.com and it was about 45 dollars. My brother then told me to look on Amazon so I did. I paid about half the price for the same watch. Came in the original box and all. Great deal! Totally satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice work and play watch","review":"I use this watch for work and play. I like that it is easy to read in both daylight and at night. I did not need the compass so i removed it. I really like and use the 3 alarms and timer features. The alarms are really nice as they can be set for just week days. I would buy this watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste on money for me","review":"Had the watch for two weeks before i went swimming my max depth was 8 feet, far less then the 100m then the watch can supposedly handle. water got in the watch and shorted the thing out and its no good now. the $10 watches at walmart have lasted me longer and have been through far worse"},{"rating":"1","title":"The indiglo never did work","review":"Everything else works well, but the reason I bought this was to see the time at night, without indiglo, it doesn't matter that everything else works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Masterpiece","review":"Ever since I was first tricked by Trompe L'oeil as a child I had hoped to stumble accross more information.

Even with the transmitter and receiver sitting within 2 ft. of each other, pointing directly at one another, with or without anything between them, the signal is sketchy. The picture quality seems ok, when I do get a picture of signal. Any vibration in the house makes screen flicker horribly and the units do not work at all while I use my wi-fi network, portable phone, or when the microwave on the other side of the housed is being used.

I was not able to get the audio going and the resolution was not very good. I consider myself fairly technically adept, but I wasn't able to improve these things no matter what I tried. The distance between the two devices is about 10 ft and I should probably consider devices that directly connect, but since I have a laptop, I thought it would be good so that I could move around a bit if I needed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke On Arrival","review":"I received a similar unit from a different vendor three years ago, and it worked very well with no complaints. That unit was packaged (internally) much better than the unit I received from Amazon.Com. The transmitter was partially disassembled, and the circuit board was exposed. The unit worked very, very poorly compared to the old one that I gave to my kids.

Even if I do get it to stop the water, if something bumps the strainer, it knocks it out of position and I have to fiddle with it again.Alternatively, if I actually want to let the water drain, often the little stopper part twists and falls down, so the water drains only very slowly, and \\"backs up\\" if I'm letting the water run.Awful product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date and unusable.","review":"I ordered this product for my grandson, a budding astronomer.

Some, like \\"Freedom's Promise\\" possess interesting plots, but are written in a manner that ruins the whole effect. (Freedom's Promise was 100% predictable and does not deviate at all from what you would expect it to be).To further support the \\"left overs\\" theory, the last thirty pages of this novel are excerpts from other novels; single-chapter snippets that serve only to fill printing space.Unless you're a die-hard fan of the series, avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product & Good Investment..","review":"A great product that is providing the benefits as to what it was designed to do.

There are bells on clothing. Ceremonial bells. Musical bells. Cow bells. Bells on trucks. Windchime bells. And not just short samples either, most of the recordings are 8-11 minutes.These are the kind of recordings a person into sampling might buy, or a person making a movie soundtrack. They're not even remotely usable as CDs you might listen to for enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 year later- completely useless","review":"I bought this for my husband because we live abroad and he needed to be able to carry coin currency with him. When it first arrived we were both happy with how it looked and how useful it was. Now, one year later the coin pocket is useless because material used in the expansion part of the coin purse has fallen apart (so coins fall out) and id/ credit card section doesn't keep anything separate anymore. In the beginning I could justify the seventy-some dollars spent on this item but now I wish I would have looked a bit longer instead of purchasing this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wallet!","review":"I just recently got this wallet, and I just love it. Very stylish, yet functional. Looks great, and no one I know owns a wallet that looks like it.

The price is pretty good too; I've seen comparable items (leather wallets handmade in Italy) at department stores for a helluva lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallet with coin pocket","review":"If you're looking for a slim wallet that also has a change pocket, this is perfect. I don't carry a lot of credit cards or pictures in my wallet, so this meets my needs. I couldn't find any men's wallets with a change pocket in stores. The dimensions are slightly larger than what I am used to, but it still fits in my pocket and it's surprisingly thin and durable. The cost was more than I am used to paying for a wallet, but so far I'm glad I bought this one. It was nice to read the reviews and see that there are other men who don't like carrying change in their pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I was looking for....","review":"I am very happy with my new wallet--I was looking for a wallet with a coin compartment--and this one is great!

Do not get it if you want \\"kung fu\\" hilarity. That being said, this movie made me laugh out loud a number of times. Stephen Chow plays a desperate extra/actor who can't get a scene to save his life. He works at a Neighborhood Welfare House, and in his spare time, gives free acting lessons. Of course, these lessons are hilarious, as he attempts to teach a young wannabe Triad gang member how to act tough when collecting money, and also an expensive call girl how to act virginal and like she's still in college. There are alot of funny scenes, including a hilarious spoof of John Woo films and a cameo by Jackie Chan. I recommend it if you like Stephen Chow's comedy bits in Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle! The subtitles are a bit tough at times, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as usual for Stephen Chow movie....","review":"Not as funny as movies like 'Royal tramp', 'The God of cookery' or 'Shaolin Soccer', but in the end a good comedy. Stephen Chow is funny and sexy as always (and he is NOT getting old!) and Ng Man Tat does a great job too. They are one of the best 'couple' in the cinema industry (watch 'All for the winner' and '60 million dollar man'). I don't like the character acted by Karen Mok (too nasty for her, I think) but she is one of the best HK actress. A thumbs up for Ceclia Cheung. You can also enjoy a few seconds Jackie Chan's cameo.As for a technic comment there's no doubt this is a well made movie, the picture is clear (no special effects)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Standard Work on Matthew","review":"At first this work might seem daunting given the three volumes to cover the one Gospel, but there is so much information packed into these three volumes that you will often find yourself wishing for even more detail.

Would recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"wearing this today","review":"I am wearing this pendant as I am writing this.

But take these reviews with a grain of salt.","review":"The pendant is beautiful and I think its recipient liked it. It is smaller and thinner than I'd expected but that's my own fault for not looking up the product dimensions.That said, anyone buying this product on the virtue of the reviews should be aware that whenever Gem Avenue receives a positive seller rating, they request that their buyers review the products positively as well. Therefore, the reviews that appear here are skewed to reflect the buyers who liked the product, not those who didn't.I, for one, liked the product.

Descendents at their fastest!","review":"Want intense, get this album, or buy it with MGTC on \\"Two Things at Once\\" which is a cheeper way to get both albums.Now back to the album. It's a short album with only eight songs. It combines the two EPs Fat and Ride the Wild. I will explain both.Fat: The second EP from the band. Includes the classics such as \\"I Like Food\\" and \\"Weinerscnitzle\\", which only clock in at around 17 or 18 seconds.Ride the Wild: The first EP from the band. Includes the classics \\"Ride the Wild\\" and \\"It's a hectic world\\".So, techniqually, if you buy two things at once, your really buying three things at once. The two EPs \\"Fat\\" and \\"Ride the Wild\\" on \\"Bonus Fat\\" and MGTC.In conclusion, if you love fast and angry, even goofy at times, punk rock, buy Boonus Fat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior product","review":"I love this item.

The characters names are completely different and the dialogue is not only translated to more modern language, but has also been changed a lot. This book is much more like Little Pilgrim's Progress than the original by John Bunyan. If you're looking for a story that is close to the original, I would look for another one. If you're looking for one that has turned Pilgrim's Progress into the story of a boy, not a man, then you might like this one. I do like the illustrations I saw and the story is fine--it's just not the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original beauty lost in this adaption.","review":"Bunyan's masterpiece is perfect as-is. Why someone would destroy a beautiful piece of literature is beyond me.

After reading Hannah Arendt's \\"The Banality of Evil\\", i thought i was ready to watch Eichmann go, but [wow]. Eichmann sits impassive while he rattles off atrocities that he allowed to happen, and is thoroughly confused by the fact that he is being tried at all. Eichmann's inability to see his own wrongs is the most heartbreaking and frustrating about the picture. heartily recommended for anyone with any morbid interest in the Holocaust and Eichmann."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might expect","review":"The other reviews might be right about one thing. This is out of the ordinary.That is possibly the only thing positive I have to say about it. It failed to capture me as a spectator. The \\"arty\\" music cuts were misplaced, ill-coordinated and disrupted the dialogue. The dialogue might have been interesting, but looses points on the bad sound quality on portions of it. I don't blame the director for it, but he really should reconsider his ideas on editing. The frequent and sudden cuts disrupts any form of timeline, adding confusion to whatever this documentary has in mind to convey.In fact, it was hard to find out what this trial was all about if you didn't know who Eichmann was and what he did.No, I didn't get the point of this, nor am I afraid to be so unpolitically correct as to say so. It did not make me any more enlightened of Eichmann or holocaust watching this. In short: this is an unecessary waste of time and money. I recommend reading Hannah Arendt instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of laughter","review":"I have not seen the movie. I purchased it for my 4 & 7 year old grandsons to watch in the car.

Lisa \\"I have legs and cleavage\\" Stewart (Shannon Michaels) needs her car repaired after an accident. She keeps a \\"journal\\" which is a composition notebook. She returns at night, overly dressed to pick up her car and becomes a tool for the crew.The film starts out claiming this is a true story that happened in 1994 Riverdale, Ga. There is a most irritating uncredited narrator who pointlessly describes what is in the journal. She takes long pauses while she puffs on a cigarette. The acting was bad and you wanted to see everyone die. The sound quality was poor. One of the mechanics, (Rob Rose) starts out with a Jersey accent and then switches to a southern accent.

It involves far too much navel-gazing. And, for navel-gazing to work, the author has to be a poetic master of language, such as John Banville, for instance. Williams is simply not such a master.The only reason this book is of any interest of all is that, amazingly, the author John Crowley obviously took some of his ideas from it. Lilliputown clearly gave Crowley ideas for what is considered his masterpiece (though not by me): \\"Little, Big\\". But, also, the surname Rasmussen, so prevalent in the Aegypt cycle - which IS Crowley's masterpiece! - is found herein, and nowhere else in literature that I've come across.The novel qua novel is an indescribably boring waste of time. For those looking to do a doctoral dissertation on Crowley and his influences, however, it is a treasure trove indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, lighthearted read - even if you don't have kids","review":"Jared has the ability to write intelligently and yet sound like your next-door neighbor, the one who constantly mutters to himself about weeds in the yard.His stories about his kids are so funny, they seem too good to be true, and yet they are so REAL, you realize no one could make them up.But my biggest complement is I don't have kids, have never changed a messy diaper and am looking to my days as a parent with as much trepidation as excitement, and yet I still enjoyand relate to his column."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly","review":"I totally love this CD.

As a gringo who has always liked hispanics, I found it disturbing to see Puerto Rican characters always regarding white people as rude, calculating, ruthless, and prejudiced. German/Herman's conversion into that kind of person is not so much about the difference between hispanics and whites but rather the difference between, say, a small, family-owned business and impersonal corporate culture.If you want to see some really good movies about Hispanic Americans, try Raising Victor Vargas, Wassup Rockers, Manito, and La Ciudad. (I've heard that Washington Heights is also good, but I haven't seen that one yet.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"I am Puerto Rican.

Yes, there are Puerto Rican, who hate other races... like everyone else... but, you know what? Not all of us are that way... I am proud to be called a \\"Boricua\\", which apparently, the writer of this low rated movie, does not know where that nickname came from...I have to agree with these people, who have written their comments... this movie is an insult to our loving culture, that has whites, blacks, even asian descendants, coming to full circle, in our daily lives.

I wasexcited coz the back of the box says it's in Humbolt Park. The onlyplace in chicago that I am familiar with. I am orginally from NY. So I watched it and man was idisappointed! not only me but my whole family. My mother was appalled to say the least. There aren't a lot of movies out there about puertoricans . And this one has nothing positive to say about Puerto Rican culture. Which is a beautiful and giving culture rich with hertiage.This movie would make anybody that saw it not want to come to Humbolt park. Which from what I have learned is a proud and old neighborhood in Chicago. I have been there every year for the parade and off and on during the year at different times of the day and have found it safe.Overall If I could get my money back for this piece of garbage I would.

I was told by a dermatologist that my acnes was because of a hormonal imbalance and that most acne remedies wouldn't help me. So feed up I did my own research and found these pills. I have to say at first I was a little turned off by them because (as my husband puts it) they smell like an old lady's closet. But after only a few weeks of taking them, my skin has cleared up, my pms has lessened, and my mood has improved. I am also glad they come in vegetarian capsules, which is hard to find.

He's very active in daily yoga classes and sculling on the river near us, and wears it all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading specs","review":"To bad I have to do this, but the case is NOT metal and the crystal is NOT mineral. It is a PLASTIC case and a PLASTIC crystal. A call to Timex before I bought the watch indicated that the case was metal. It is not, but the back, as normal, is. The strap is not just nylon, it is nylon and leather. Come one Amazon. I have to dock all these stars because of this?That said, the set-up of the watch seems to be very intuitive for me with modes actually spelled out. The bezel material is rubber, which I like. The backlight shines THROUGH the numerals, not the background, which I also like. The back uses 4 small screws. I also like that it does not beep every time I press a button.CONCLUSION: Nice menu system, readable, and nice backlight. I think I will like this watch. However, I was looking forward to a mineral crystal like my other expedition. I am mostly docking the stars for misleading advertising. Thats silly and should not have occurred."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk watch","review":"This is a crappy junk watch. Buttons are frustrating to use.

However, I did find it a bit repetitive. By about three quarters through I had the message and it was rather predictable.

It's helped me extend my knowledge on how to overcome aggression and fear/anxiety in dogs as well.

Within a week, the transformation already started.

It felt like I was distracting him more by focusing on me and giving positive reinforcement. However when my dog saw another dog it was VERY difficult to distract him even with treats. I have sought out another positive reinforcement training technique with a trainer in my area. I have already seen my dog's behavior decrease with a quick correction and praise when he follows the correction with the appropriate behavior. Maybe this technique will work with other dogs but it did not work with my chocolate Labrador."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"I purchased this book along with two other publications I expected to be books as well, but these turned out to be little pamplets that are the size usually found in a Veternarian's office to read while you wait and many times are free if you want them. The shipping charges were ridiculous for the amount of merchandise shipped.The book itself gave the impression of being a guide to the clicker control dog training course. This book merely speaks of using the method gives no information on how to use it or where to acquire the clicker itself or what ever equipment is needed. The other two so-called books measure 8 1/2\\" X 5 1/2\\" one has 29 pages the other 14 pages, so you can imagine how much information you will get out of them.

It was a great unit--while it lasted. I had high hopes for Malata--my dad had another China-made DVD player and it worked flawlessly in a high-end stereo system. Well, the Malata arrived at my home just in time to relieve a dying DVD player. It worked great for about 2 weeks, then one day it just quit playing CDs and VCDs properly--it paused for seconds every half minute or so! (...)! Fine, I thought. I had a dedicated CD player--I'll just use the Malata for DVDs. (...), and the Malata is starting to eat my DVDs alive--my wife put in a DVD, and when she opened the tray it was empty!!!

I have only played DVD-R and DVD+R discs and the response time for loading and its ability to start/play the movie have been extremely fast. I like the built in counter/display, which is very useful for monitoring the progress of your movie and this is definitely omitted by other \\"low end\\" players. Even though the loading tray doesn't come all the way out, most users shouldn't have a problem with it. I don't have a single complaint with the remote that has worked perfect so far. The design of the player seems to be of good quality and I love its size. My only concern is the durability of the player in terms of longevity. Only time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"After one month, I'm quite happy with this DVD player: it's thin, reasonably attractive, and able to play everything I've thrown at it, even disks rejected by my other players for having too many scratches. It does come with the worst remote control I've ever used, however, with weak power, tiny and hard-to-press buttons, and a counter-intuitive layout.

This book had the same hapless losers, frustrated lovers of married men, drunk mothers, penny-pinching spinsters, and smug housewives as all of her books. They muddle about riding the bus back and forth to their little village and living their strangely intertwined but not very interesting lives - and then, suddenly, the book is over.

Then I read \\"The Lilac Bus\\". It was very disappointing because it seemed incomplete and unfinished. For a writer who tied up all loose ends as carefully as Maeve Binchy did with the characters of \\"Evening Class\\", why does she leave the chartered bus travelers' histories just twisting in the wind?

The book is really a collection of short stories that are woven together, but not in any meaningful sense. Each chapter relates the story of a character, but at the end of the chapter you're waiting for more, waiting to make a connection with that character, waiting for the story to start. And still, at the end of the book you're wondering what the point was. It doesn't go anywhere. She tells you about the different people, but that's it, she just describes them and their histories.

It's very much like Minding Frankie in that there really isn't any story, just a few outlines of characters who have something in common, in this case, riding home from Dublin every Friday night.I miss the days where Maeve's books had actual stories, and while I loved the fact her characters were intertwined, and often appeared in more than one book, there was an actual plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An other enjoyable read","review":"As always Maeve Binchy gets you believing you know the people in her story, and you are with them all the way through to the endI'm always sad when I finish her books and have re read them on many occations"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Short Stories","review":"Normally I'm not a fan of short stories, but each of the 12 stories in this book seemed to be the perfect length. Long enough to tell a good story and pull in the reader, short enough to leave the reader wishing for more.The first 8 stories are of a group of people who take a bus home each weekend from Dublin. Most of their lives are a bit intertangled, coming from the same small town, some knowing each other from childhood. The last 4 stories are seperate and just stories of life, which could take place anywhere, but happen to take place in Ireland.The only complaint I have about the collection is I felt a couple of the stories were done a bit of an injustice and could have been wrapped up a bit better. But maybe that's because I am always looking for a neat tidy ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eight strangers on a bus","review":"Every Friday Tom Fitzgerald loads up his lilac-colored bus with 7 passengers that he takes from Dublin to Rathdoon. They chat amiably and harbor unspoken feelings about one another, but none of them really knows the others. Each of the passengers, and Tom himself, have secret lives which they wish to keep hidden from the others. In this book, Maeve Binchy uncovers all of these secrets and leaves us to ponder how little we really do know about those we see and chat with on a regular basis. Some of the secrets are noble, but some are not and there is a poignancy about each one. Following the \\"Lilac Bus\\" are four unrelated stories where Binchy weaves her magic with quickly sketched characters and plot. Some end a bit abruptly and leave the reader wanting more, but Binchy fans will probably want to include this in their reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lilac Bus","review":"This is a very good read, it contains the usual Binchy humour and is like all her books very witty. Well recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!?","review":"This was my first experience with Maeve Binchy, and was almost my last. I was so angry when I finished the book!

This is so uncharacteristic in style and performance of Chang Yi. Very poor, lame performance, bordering on stupid. Wang Tao and the great Delong Tam also was out of there normal sophisticated style of performances. I think the director of this movie was very inexperienced and had no depth or conscise story line or screenplay knowledge. Wang Tao, Delong Tam and Chang Yi, in later years went on to do greater movies nonetheless, but this flick does not do them any favors.My idea of a great Chang Yi movie would be Shaolin Mystagogue. My idea of a great Delong Tam movie would be Snake Crane Secret. My idea of a great Wang Tao movie would be Secret Rivals pt.1.

I have tried this workout 3 different times and each time I don't feel like my core is getting the work out I want. The standing routine really works your legs with some really odd ab work thrown in.The Floor segment did work my abs, but I felt that it was more of a back routine that also tried to target the core.

It was absolutely killer! I've been working out with a trainer since January, and regularly do the 8 minute abs DVD, I'm in decent shape, but this takes my abs workout to a new level. I loved it and can't wait to see the results. If you are looking for something more hardcore than what you are used to, this is a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I did this DVD and could feel it working in my abs and other parts of my body, but it's not for me.

I'm sure the video will work well for others, but it's just not for me. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to its title and is highly recommended","review":"Personal Training with Jackie: Crunch-Free Xtreme Abs is a fitness DVD hosted by Jackie Warner, known for her hit fitness TV shows \\"Work Out\\" and \\"Thintervention\\", focusing on how to tone one's abdominals without doing crunches. Instead, Crunch-Free Xtreme Abs reveals two original 15-minute workouts; one can be done from a standing position, and the other is an invigorating floor routine. No equipment other than inexpensive hand weights is recommended to feel the full force of the workout. Best done three times a week to shed fat and improve one's abdominals, Crunch-Free Xtreme Abs lives up to its title and is highly recommended. 32 min."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't feel it then you aren't doing it right!","review":"I saw the review from a disappointed Mandie and all I can say is that Mandie didn't do it right! This DVD is incredible. I had just read that crunches can actually hurt your back and I have trouble doing them in the first place because I don't have too many muscles to begin with but THIS DVD, with Jackie, I CAN do the exercises - not as long as I am supposed to yet - AND I feel my abdominal muscles starting to develop! I just ordered another one of her DVD's yesterday. I like her straight forward style of instruction with no beating around the bush. She has one person demonstrate without weights which is currently my speed, and one demonstrating a more difficult method. Both of her helpers show great form and enthusiasm for doing each exercise to the max. What encouragement! If I can do this so can you! Excellent investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I also purchased this DVD at target.This is my first DVD with Jackie, and it won't be the last. I'm also doing the Insanity DVD's and its working overall. But I really wanted to target my midsection because that is the hardest I'm having in toning and the cardio abs for Insanity is good but I feel it's more cardio than anything else. After doing the Jackie DVD just once, I definitely felt my muscles working, and even more the next morning. I will absolutely be adding this to my routine. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!! LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie vs Jillian","review":"I purchased the Crunch-Free ab video, as well as Jillian Michael's 6 week 6 pack video. I did the first 3 weeks of Jillian's video and felt good about it. Once I moved into Level 2, though, I wasn't feeling like I was getting a great core workout. I then purchased jackie's video. LOVE IT. I can actually feel my muscles working! I've notice quite a difference, but is likely a combo of both. Either way, this video is great and not quite as boring as Jillian's! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Jackie","review":"I have all of Jackie's workout videos, and they just keep getting better. Her crunchless abs workouts have replaced all of my ab work at the gym. The floor workout is very challenging and focuses a lot on planks and plank variations. I like the standing workout, which focuses on a lot of twists and makes my obliques sore the next day! She offers unique moves that are both challenging and fun, and I find her instruction to be spot on. Also, the two women who work out with her have fun personalities that make the video that much more enjoyable. This video has no real repeat exercises from previous videos, so whether you have all her videos or have never worked out with her, I highly recommend this video!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"These workouts are great!

This is a tough workout and I would say that I am pretty advanced. There is a 15 minute standing and 15 minute floor workout. You do one exercise for 60 seconds and then switch to another. You use one or two weights for most moves. Not the usual crunches so it keeps it interesting. Although, I don't really mind doing abs. You may want to check out Hip Hop Abs too if you're looking for toned abs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful of your back!!!!","review":"(not Joe, but his wife) Okay, I'm a Jillian Michaels fan and I have several of her videos. I work out four times a week, and two of those are Jillian videos. So I thought I could handle this Jackie Warner abs one...but there is no attention to form and I ended up throwing my back out doing the standing series! There are a lot of fast jerky movements swinging a weight around (and I only used a 3 lb weight), and I have been in pain for two days. As long as I have done Jillian videos, I have NEVER had a problem like this--I get sore, but not in pain :( Be very careful before you purchase this video! As for me, I will stick with Jillian Michaels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I really wanted to works on my abs- a problem spot for me like most women. I also have a back injury which also make it important to work my core regularly. A friend recommended Jackie and I bought this and another DVD from her. I tried this one first. I hated it. I knew trying it for the first time it would be difficult. I have never seen any of her workouts but after about the 10th time in the first 10 minutes that she said how easy these exercises were for her and how she could do them all day long, I turned it off. Who cares if they are easy for her? Is that supposed to motivate me? She said\\"hate me now, love me later\\". Well I tried it long enough for the first part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company Scam","review":"This company provides a decent product but their marketing is a scam.When ordering the first DVD's the customer is \\"automatically\\" (translation- without authorization) signed up for continued shipments of DVDs whichare debited from their credit card account.

First and fore most, I must say that the quartetes music videos are indeed bizzare rides, full of witty lyrical energy and interesting conceptual premise. Many compilations (as this one) are fast ways for artists to cash-in on previous successes, but what seperates Cydeways from others is that it attemts to delve into what caused The Pharcyde to break up. Initially, the remaining trio (Tre-who has since left the group, Imani, boody brown) show little audacity towards fatlip for leaving but then they paint him as a red faced clown in one of the videos. Fatlip continues to embarrass himslef with his solo work \\"worst case scenario\\" which makes me suspect that he never wrote any of the lyrics on previous Pharcyde recordings.

Except for those shortcomings, this unit would be rated at 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non Functioning Item + No Customer Service","review":"The beverage warmer does not work and my attempts to contact the distributor in order to return and get a credit have resulted in naught.

The Rival that I can no longer find was the best at keeping thick mugs warm but this Norpro is good. I like the thick base and the amount of clearance from the desktop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I'm one of the many people who miss the Dazey warmer--it actually kept your coffee drinkably hot. This one, at 24 watts (the Dazey was 25 watts), was very encouraging. Unfortunately, it works no better than the \\"candle warmers\\" at keeping anything hot. I think it might actually work if the heating elements were in the center where the cup sits, but instead they seem to be curled out in the sides of the warmer. The sides get hot, but the part under my cup, not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good replacement for Dazey cup warmer","review":"My old Dazey cup warmer finally quit and in looking for a replacement I decided to try the Norpro. The Norpro is rated at 24 watts and the Dazey was 25 watts. The Norpro has a larger warming surface and will keep a cup warm with very little loss of heat. The base does get hot so it's best to sit it where little hands can't get to it. It has a long cord and the on/off switch is several inches from the warmer, which works fine for me. This is an excellent cup warmer if you are looking for one and is a good replacement for a Dazey cup warmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of field.","review":"This works great. The bottom of the cup stays too hot to touch so the liquid remains exactly as one might want."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess this is why it's called a coffee warmer and not a coffee hotter.","review":"I've had this warmer for nine months. It's an okay coffee warmer, but it's far from perfect. The main issue is that coffee is not kept very hot. Sure, the coffee's not cold, either, but I keep on longing for a hotter cup of coffee. The switch position doesn't bother me since I have the unit on a motion sensor device that automatically shuts off if no movement is detected in the room. The red light indicating that the device is on is far too dim to be easily discerned in bright conditions.I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disapointing","review":"In viewing the product, I thought the warmer also came with the cup... as most coffee warmers do. The cup was actually the selling point; so, I what I thought I ordered was different than the actual which was only warmer itself. It's a shame, the cup displayed is beautiful. Oh well, live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke Warm At Best","review":"I love my Dazey 1400 and wanted a mug warmer to keep in the living room. I was excited when I noticed this one puts out 24 Watts. Unfortunately, it kept my coffee luke warm at best. I like my coffee between warm and hot and the Dazey does just that, but this one does not.All my mugs are concave on the bottom so they don't lie flat (I don't think I've ever seen any flat-bottomed mugs). The edge of the mug sits directly on the surface so even though this warmer generates enough heat it does not transfer well. It's why the Dazey shines with the slight groove on the perimiter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is my first cup warmer- it was purchased after reading the positive reviews. Just love it! It keeps my tea/coffee at just the right temperature. Living in Colorado and we can have some cold days and nights and this gem really help. Plan to purchase another one for a friend.One Tip if you place a \\"lid\\" on your cup it will stay piping hot for hours. The plastic top from a pint of Haagen Daas ice cream is a perfect fit for my cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my best purchases","review":"I never tried another brand but I know that the USB versions won't work well because obviously usb port cannot provide enough juice. This Norpro 5569 comes with a power adapter, so it gets enough power. It does it's job very well. It won't heat up cold beverage but maintains it, which is want I was looking for. I have been using it for more than 6 months. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good - Better than Mr. Coffee","review":"First purchased the Mr. Coffee warmer. Didnt really do the job. This one keeps the drink much warmer/hotter. The price you pay is that the bottom does get warmer and I use a heat resistant coaster to set it on. This is also a good idea because the feet are plastic and it slides a bit on a desk - you can get little rubber stick on feet for less than a dollar. I also use it plugged into a digital timer which I use as the on off switch. That way I won't forget to turn it off. Highly recommend doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so-so","review":"I ordered this item for my Husband who likes to work in the garage. The garage is in the 50 degree range a lot of the Winter. This cup warmer is not meant to be used in a cold garage. It only keeps the coffee luke warm. It might work inside a house where it's warmer. If I had bought the product in a local store and not on line I would probably take it back. Too bad. The reviews looked promising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my cup warmer","review":"This works great and keeps me from having to stick my coffee in microwave from office to kitchen.You will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"It doesn't work as advertised.

This mug warmer is simply the best available. The switch is on the cord but only 2 \\" from the base. Bright on/off light. Holds a 3 1/2\\" mug. Great value, too. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dangerous Defect","review":"This heater will indeed heat your coffee, but it'll also heat YOU if you're not careful. Two days after I bought it, the red indicator light that lets you know when the unit is on - and hot - stopped working. Now it's hard to tell when it's on and whene it's not, w/o passing your hand over the top of the unit. To make matters worse, the in-line on-off switch is 'iffy' - hard to tell if you've gone one click or two (thereby turning the unit off and back on again).After burning my fingers several times (once pretty severely) I threw this piece of crap away and got a Mr. Coffee brand cup heater, which works much better, has a better on-off button, and a red light that works.Don't buy this one. If you want a mug/cup heater on your desk that's reliable and does what it's suppose to do, get the Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I've been looking for years for a coffee warmer that was stronger than the standard 17-watt products.

I have had several different warmers over the years and this one so far is the best. If you are looking for a warmer that keeps the liquid as hot as it was in the pot you might be disappointed. Don't think any of them will do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norpro Coffee Cup Warmer 5569","review":"According to advertising, this warmer is as good as the Dazey cup warmer which keeps our coffee hot. But I was extremely disappointed that it works just as badly as the Mr Coffee's cup warmer - keeps coffee or liquid only LUKEWARM. I called the seller who contacted Norpro on their second complaint in the week. The Norpro sales rep told the seller that Norpro 5569 only keeps coffee at 101 degrees while at use. The boiling point is 212 degrees. At least a cup warmer should keep coffee at 195 degrees temperature to make it drinkable as hot coffee. Dazey warmer is 25 watts and kept my coffee hot all the way thru. So many people are looking for a replacement of Dazey. If Norpro could work on the product and improve it, it will sell well, because I do like the larger size of the warmer plate."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work as expected","review":"Electric Beverage WarmerThis is the second identical product purchased because I was satisfied with the first one.

I was replacing my old Dazey warmer and this one really wasn't up to snuff. Not even close in warming.It will keep a cup of coffee just above room temperature but not warm by any means.It really heats up the table and the ceramic ring, too hot to touch. But the plate and cup are just warm. I think if the cup had a completely flat bottom you'd be OK, but they just don't make cups like that. They all only touch around the rim.I think we are just stuck with drinking our coffee fast or having it be cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"It worked as good as I could have hoped. Short of plugging in my coffee cup itself, this is the best thing I could find to keep my coffee warm. It works perfectly for me. If there is a con it is that the light can be hard to see if it is on and the switch rotates so you can't look at it to see if it is on. Of course you can just feel the side and that will tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not warm enough","review":"Like others, I like my old Dazey, which I purchased in 1994, and I'm having difficulty finding another one that works as well, with on-off switch on the unit, indicator light, and a temperature that is hot enough. Mr. Coffee failed the temperature test, so I ordered the Norpro. It failed as well, and I finally made an actual temperature comparison. The Dazey keeps the coffee at about 137-138 degrees (measured with an IR unit at about 12 inches), and the Norpro keeps the coffee at only 125-127 degrees under the same conditions. I sent the Norpro back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"After reading a number of reviews, this warmer sounded like is was great. I took it to work, plugged it in, waited for it warm up, put a steaming hot cup of coffee on it. It didn't keep the coffee hot or warm. This item kept my drink tepid at best. I was very disappointed.

However, I read all three books and this movie angered me at parts. I understand that you can't follow the book exactly, but completely changing how people meet or siblings of the girls who have very big parts in the story lines (i.e. Lena's sister Effie or Bree's brother) completely changes some aspects of the movie and the story. I would recommend this movie if you haven't read the books, but I would recommend more for you to read the three books, because they are incredible books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment after the book","review":"As a huge lover of the book I was deeply disappointed in this horrible adaptation. The book was moving, very well written, and an experience you will always treasure. The movie completely changed the storyline and lost all of the magic.

Well, I sure changed my mind; this film is fantastic! The script was beautifully written, which always makes all the difference. The four girls did a great job in their roles, but with such a great story to work with, they could hardly go wrong. I recommend this film to women and girls of all ages, and to boys and men, too.

The four friends, Lena, Carman, Bridget, and Tibby, are about to experience their fisrt summer apart. Unfortunately, before they depart from one another they find a pair of magical pants. Oddly enough, these pants fit every single one of the girls despite the varying shapes. These pants are sent around the world from one friend to another. Though the friends spent the summer apart, the pants kept them as close as ever.I thought this book was very enjoyable. With the variety of conflicts going on, everyone is bound to be relate to one of them. I also enjoyed the author's writing style. It made me want to continue reading. This heart touching story is filled with so much conflict and questions that it seemed like no time before the book was finished.

I haven't been a teenager for many years and yet I felt as though I learned about the person I'd like to be in life...authentic maybe...even though I'm learning from these young girls. In fact, you can learn the most from the 12-year-old character Bailey. I highly recommend watching this movie. It's not just some silly teen movie...it has depth and humor and emotion. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a Made for TV film","review":"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants could have been a well acted, insightful movie about overcoming teenaged adversity. Coulda, woulda, shoulda. Instead, the movie has all the ingredients of a fairly decent TV movie, with plenty of pause spots for commercials.There are many reviews that describe the sub-plots of the four friends so they won't be reiterated here. In quick summary, the two emotional subplots are: parental void (deceased mother, absentee father) and fear of feeling (exposing the \\"real me\\"). These are basic, western culture, female teen age issues, and are exploited to a heightened sentimental degree.The film isn't bad, its just that its targeted audience doesn't require good acting (see hospital bed scene), exceptional videography (entire movie), or meaningful dialogue for it to have some box office success. If it's a Friday night and your 15 year old daughter is bored, you could do worse than rent this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sisterhood of traveling pants","review":"Regardless of high ratings by many people, this book is not appropriate for young readers due to too liberal sexuality remarks.

I grew up listening to rap in the late 70's and 80's and I can still appreciate hip hop today. I gotta tell you that the Unwrapped album is PERFECT for anybody like me who still likes hip hop but also loves jazz and other types of music. I have a 14 year old son who is a die hard hip hop fan and for the first time asked to borrow one of MY cds after he heard me playing what he THOUGHT was Nelly. He actually liked the jazz elements. I plan on playing the CD at my holiday office party next week and I am sure it will be a hit. I can't imagine anyone not liking this CD. I am a big fan of HIdden Beach ever since Jill Scott came out.

The perfect CD is super performances on hit sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Expectations Were Dashed","review":"To be short and to the point, the second \\"Unwrapped\\" CD was a huge dissappointment. I probably had unrealistic expectations, based on my love for the first volume (I can honestly say that I have played it more than any other CD I own in the past 12 months). The concept of mixing Hip-Hop with Jazz is a great ideal - anyone with any sense of music history would admit to the natural bond between the two genres. However, listening to this CD gives the impression that the powers-that-be at Hidden Beach were pressured to get a second CD out as soon as possible, to try to take advantage of the success of the first volume. As a result, this CD will probably turn off true fans of hip-hop, as well as jazz afficionados. Some of the arrangements are mediocre at best, which I think is the CD's biggest problem. I still hope Hidden Beach puts out a Volume III at some point (which they undoubetly will), but I hope they give the third CD the time and effort a CD of this type deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"An in-depth look at interfaith and interethnic relationships","review":"If you're looking for quick practical advice on meeting your partner's parents or what to wear to an Indian wedding, try the \\"Complete Idiot's Guide to Interfaith Relationships.\\" But if you're looking for a deeper, more thoughtful discussion of the complexities of \\"mixed matches,\\" especially their impact on the family and children, this book is for you. It delves into a very astute exploration of the motivations and attractions behind interfaith/interethnic/interracial relationships, and it thoroughly explores the difficulties involved in negotiating differences as they impact the partnership and the family. The discussion on raising children in \\"mixed\\" households is particularly enlightening. This book is heavy on the pyschology, which might be a turn-off to some, but it definitely gets the reader thinking about complex underlying issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size","review":"This product is described as a WOMENS Blazer.

And it's blended so seamlessly that I often wonder what kind of a world it is, modern or fantasy.The characters Sam and Charley go through even MORE transformations in this book, their physical states altered in odd ways. The climax was brilliant, showing how the two girls' wishes intertwine and weave together into a result that, on the surface, would seem almost ideal, but behind the scenes, in the opinions and minds of the two heroines, has it's own problems, like any change and tiral of life.

And even this last book shows the clever and realistic feel for politics that made the series so interesting. Unfortunately it gets caught up in the all-too-familiar Chalker flaws-- obsession with body transformations (even to the detriment of the plot), sexual slavery, and the role of women in relation to their body image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"I haven't used this yet, but I am sure I will enjoy it also.Thank you for a quality stainless steel product.I should have had these years ago.

Buyers should be cautioned regarding their choice of suppliers of these products, however.

Lots of typos, the kind resulting in valid English words, just not the right words for the context. So, the text was definitely run through a spell-checker but I doubt any human professional editor was involved. A friend trying to tell you the plot of a play or a movie he liked, may get excited and wordy about some moments but half-forget or completely forget some others.

He considers his criticism superior to his paintings.His critticism has been forgotten ,but not his paintings.He is open minded in reviewing the art outporings of his last years. Unlike ,Robert Hughes who I think has a prejudice for things English,Porter had convictions about the value of art in a political context.From this book you learn that he was a committee communist.

There was a fire and she could only save Scruffy. Then later, she gets shot by a farmer and dies, Scruffy gets shot and lives. He ends up in the pound.

I am also a sensitive soul (and cried at times) but it was also such a moving book about an animal's triumph over adversity (which resonated with me about having strength and hope and working hard through difficult situations can lead to freedom/happiness). I loved this book and named a neglected stray that we found shortly after I read this book \\"Scruffy\\". (we had her for 15 years!) I suggest reading this book first and then deciding if it is appropriate for your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, heartwarming story of survival and perseverance","review":"I first read this book when I was about 12 years old - that was 30 years ago! I had to buy a new copy about 20 years ago as a dog we adopted ate my original copy! This is a sad, but heartwarming story about a little stray named Scruffy and her adventures on the harsh streets. It is about the challenges she faces as a stray and friendships she makes with thoughtful people, a homeless man and other dogs. It is a story of survival and perseverance.

Valerie Tripp allows readers to get involved in Molly's life, where dad is away and mom is working. Home is not the way it used to be. Valerie Tripp uses real information to verification on the time period. Tripp lets the readers see that times were tough and Molly goes on with everyday life through the war time.

The action progresses well and the historical setting, as far as I can tell, is accurate. Battle sequences are stirring, but all in all .... The entire finish of the book hangs on a monstrous coincidence between nature starting her battle at the same time that the Japanese fire their guns.

I was forced to read it in 6th grade and I thought it was total (...)! It is about the time when Gary Paulson was a dog racer. It starts out with Gary explaining how he got something out of watching a poor Doe being devoured by wolves (horrible part of the book.) The rest of the book he tells how he learns things from his sled dogs. It's so stupid to learn about his dogs personality. Frankly I don't care. He also thinks he sees an alien at one point.If all Gary Paulson can do is just write books that repeat words over and over again, I suggest that he stop writing his [...] books and go play with his dogs. Unfortunatly, that won't happen, because all of his books have a pretentious spirit in them that somehow draws the viewers into trance.

Let's not forget that Ginger haired guy is a pretty fair drummer.What a shame I had not heard of this CD until the death of Irishman Gary Moore, whose guitar and occasional vocals sound great on this album. He (more than a little bit) evokes the tone, phrasing and spirit of Clapton, without degenerating into pantomime. If you love CREAM, you love this and the casual listener might think this is a lost CREAM album.

Same old story line -- women for some reason find this man enchanting, but I especially couldn't stir up any interest in him, nor the other characters. M.C. Beaton must have had a deadline to complete a book this year and this was the effort.

It borders on club/ dance music. I also experienced similar problems with Dillinja and both Bad Company release's although they were much better than this commercial tripe.If you want a decent jungle album, Ram Trilogy's molten beats goes someway to providing a decent album. Blackmarket's compilation and some 1.8.7 tunes are also good but avoid this if you want a hardcore jungle album. Buy if you want a soft-core uninspiring d&b album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift","review":"This book was a gift for a friend. We are both American Sign Language Interpreters.

It is our go-to meal for when we haven't gone to the grocery store and desperately need a dinner.My tips:+ Add the \\"optional\\" butter, you know you want to.+ Personally I find that it needs just the smallest pinch of salt to bring out its flavors+ Some fresh ground pepper rounds it outIf you like this stuff, I also highly recommend the Annie's snack mix (I think also available on Amazon). I believe Annie's makes both products with their patented Bunny Cocaine(tm). The dangerous addiction I've developed is totally worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese. It is just so so in taste.

The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Metal...","review":"I've been listening to these guys for a while now since they've been really big in the Tampa Bay area. They're incredible. I knew what to expect when I heard they were putting out a debut for a major record label. Striaght up in your face metal. I must agree with the guy above me. There is no happy sing along moments for this band. What set's this cd apart from alot of metal cds is to many metal bands are tainted by the hardcore essence to have breakdowns. One of the best aspects about this cd is the guitar work. It's simply amazing. The melody in the fast paced speed they play. I highly recommend any metal fan or hardcore fan to look into these guys more. A few years down the road they're gonna be well known for playing real metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It..

I don't have the time or resources to review each song thoroughly.First off, this album is up to par production-wise. I know this has been a problem for many metalblade releases in the past. This cd sounds great.If you are a guitar player, this album is for you. Every song is littered with tasteful, skillful shredding that doesn't get stale. I don't like most of the current crop of metal guys like evergrey, in flames, KSE, etc., but \\"The Absence\\" is great. They have a real future if they can follow this up with a strong effort.If you like anything melodic and can handle serious heaviness, buy this album right now. The band is a bunch of super nice Florida guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Key Works on Chinese Food History","review":"Published in the late 1980s, The Food of China remains one of the key modern works on Chinese food history. This was the first book I read on Chinese food. That was a mistake, if only because the book is so dense with information that the reading experience was quite overwhelming at the time. So if you are a novice like I was, start with something lighter such as Francine Halvorsen's The Food and Cooking of China before taking the deep plunge with this more academic book. But E. N.

I was making up all sorts of silly activities and reading random scripture for our family devotionals. After running out of plans I saw this book and ordered it. It's very practical for most parents and kids. We love the silly stories and fun bible facts with each devotional. Sections include a story, bible reading, discussion questions, bible fact, game and application section. You don't have to do all of it but we try to. Some nights we get in bed late so we had to skip the book and just pray. My son literally cries if we don't read his devotional, he absolutely loves it. You will see biblical application of scripture in this devotional. Not just cute stories but good foundation for our Children. Topics range from perseverance, humility, faith when all fails, loving our neighbors and the list goes on and on.

The marbles are so illuminating that it is hard to see what all is going on while you are blasting them. I find it hard to catch the extra life medallion things with so much illuminating colors. I always mix up the red and orange they are so close in color. The only thing I like is the sphere that changes the color. If they put that on Luxor 1 it would suit me fine. I think they added TOO much to the graphics. They could of just added the new spheres to the Luxor 1 would of been good.

I recommend it to everyone--both women AND men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zowee!","review":"This movie is like the \\"Persona\\" of spy-chick flicks, the \\"Gone With the Wind\\" of postmodern ironic slapdash cinema, the \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" of Sid and Marty Kroft. You just can't stop watching it. Tina Lee gives a solid, sexy, convincingly blase performance, and that whacky Jennifer Mattern knocks 'em dead as the HARM girls' best-buddy who's always underestimated. I particularly liked the fight scenes. After I left the theatre, I tried a few high kicks of my own, but then I pulled a groin muscle. My boyfriend and I frequently say to one another, \\"That's obsessive.\\" One day, I am going to move to New York and try to meet the HARM girls, maybe even become their friends.

The Japanese release is 2nd time I've owned this (1st was in 94 back when it first was released when living in the UK) This deserves a re-release as its been out of print for far too long.

We've probably used the trailer 15 to 2o times in the last 10 months. The other day I put my son in, attached the seat belts, started riding, and heard a loud pop. The nylon strap that holds the seat up off the fabric floor had snapped. Before I could even get a good look at it, the nylon seat belt in between my son's legs also snapped. I've looked it over pretty well and don't think there's a way I can repair it. We're so disappointed. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for leisure bikers","review":"Since we are not serious bikers, we were not willing to pay big $$ for the trailer. This one fits our budget. It is easy to toll and runs smoothly. The only issue I had was that once I put the trailer on, I cannot put the kickstand back. This is somewhat troublesome because we cannot just stop anywhere we want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, it fell apart on me...","review":"Like many, I was initially quite happy with this product--I couldn't afford a Burley, and this was under $100 at Target. However, the trailer has slowly fallen apart on me. I leave it outside, but covered underneath a porch and in a mild, dry climate (California). The snaps tore out of the fabric after a month, which cannot be repaired. This means that the cover is only held in place by the velco. The front wheel (in stroller mode) is no longer near true, and jams at a 15-degree angle consistently. Worst of all, the 1-inch webbing that runs along the bottom of the seat has rotted through. I consider the trailer unusable now.The only reason I am not giving it one star is that it might hold up better if garaged and lightly used. The price is right, and the design is fine. The quality is simply poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"This bike trailer is a good value for the money. It is easy to assemble and attach to a bike. I would have liked to have seen a sturdier seat inside the trailer itself though. The spring assembly where the trailer attaches to the bike is very flexible, which makes it very nice for hauling. I was able to fold the bike down on top of the trailer with it still attached to the bike frame and still fit it in my Ranger."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sucks","review":"Sure it's easy to assemble and attach, but the company probably spent all their energy figuring out a \\"quick and easy\\" assembly and abandoned any thought on a child's comfort. I bought this for my 15 month old son to ride with my 18 month old neice. she was okay for 2 minutes and then she just wanted out of it. My son wriggled in it and the straps got tangled. We can usually overlook small things, but it was impossible to try and make the seat work well. it's just cheap material hanging from a bar with uncomfortable and difficult straps with no padding. Definitely not a \\"quick 'n easy\\" harness system. There's no structure to the seat and it also lacked padding for back support. If you really want a trailer and a GOOD one, you should look at the more expensive ones (I saw several good ones at REI).I finally decided I'd rather get the iBert child seat for my bike, since I've done my research on it and it has received 88 five star reviews, an award, and recognition on parenting magazine ^_^ ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety issues","review":"I see a major liability issue with the connecting pin that attaches the cart to the bike. It is poorly made and inadequate to do the job. I had it come apart on me while biking. Would you want your toddler in the back of this cart when it detaches from you bike?

I had to take it apart and return it after discovering this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price","review":"We love our trailer but the only thing is, make sure you are athletic and in shape before you purchase it. My husband has to attach it to his bike b/c I get too tired to trail the 2 kids around in it (they are about 30lbs each). I have to say that it is really roomy and lots of fun for the kids! It attaches to the bike easily and is easy to assemble, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product at a good price","review":"I use this trailer for cargo not for babies and it is just exactly what I need.

Would recommend it for cargo or babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I bought this trailer two years ago. that frame is very good and is very light weight. but the canvas has simply shredded. I have a different brand of bike trailer that is 4 years older and has no damage to the canvas I have treated them both the same but the insteps canvas has become a danger as it is falling apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed seating system","review":"The seating system in this product is horribly designed and unworkable for one much less two children. The seat is a sling style hung between a rigid upper bar and a nylon strap that extends between the two sides of the frame under the child's legs. The nylon strap cannot be tightened sufficiently and there is not enough seating material slung between the upper bar and the lower strap. As a result the child ends up sliding forward and off the seat - very uncomfortable and unpleasant for the passenger. If you attempt a two child configuration, you'll have two children smooshed together and sliding off. The actual frame and wheel system seems well-designed, but the attachment to the pulling cycle is sub par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the trick","review":"I am absolutely loving this trailer. It is simple to use, simple to assemble and attach to the bike. There is a small space behind the seat where I put my bike pump and lock. There are a couple small pockets inside for the baby to put her ball or other little toy or small cup. I can fold down the cover on nice days so she can see out without a problem, or I can put up the cover and even the rain sheild. We are all over town now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was worried about the details","review":"I'm not a reader who worries about details--Not like I do when I'm working. I read for relaxation or entertainment and I found this book to be BOTH. Reading it on the train I finished it in about 4 hours and boy was it good. I kinda had it figured out by the end but it was a fun ride getting there. I enjoyed the characters and how they were developed and I really liked the familar setting of the plot. I kept wondering if I had seen the house that the main character lived in. It was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director being lazy, don't buy.","review":"The series expand from the first generation of Teknoman, which was really good. The problem is that it is very short. Their biggest enemy is one Teknoman that defeated Blade and it concentrates on that one person. There is a lot of room for improvements. Seen it once and 9/10, I won't see again, it's more of a Japanese film with this one. Characters are goofy and do goofy stuff which didn't have that in Teknoman. If you're a Teknoman fan, go for it, but if you love Teknoman with a good story, to hell with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it even if it cost 10 bucks","review":"To those that were fans of Teknoman a few years back I gotta say the show doesn't even live up to that. To others that saw Tekkaman Blade in full , don't even think of buying this garbage. ...the Tekkaman designs looked pretty fruity and the entire thing came off as one big power rangers...

The original Tekkaman Blade, you felt the characters, you understood them, and the story was so deep. Tekkaman Blade II is nonsense, it's just more mech battles and about a military tekkeman academy. There was little point in why they were fighting other than your typical revenge, save the world crap.

For Steve Winwood, the perfection of his early career has not been reclaimed.I, for one, will not give up hope. I think the fact that this cd was made at all was a step in the right direction. I just hope the new Traffic cd will contain a bit of the lost magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from good","review":"It was not until after I had wasted my cash on this CD that I understood what was going on here. Winwood and Capaldi, apparently in need of some of our money, whipped out this mess and slapped the name Traffic on the cover. I didn't expect great things, afterall Traffic never came close to the heights of their much more talented but less appreciated peers Family. But being in a nostalgic mood, I at least thought this might be as good as \\"When the Eagle Flies.\\" Wrong.I think the essential problem is that Capaldi sings and plays drums and Winwood sings and plays everything else. (As another reviewed noted, Traffic is in dire need of a reedman to flesh out the sound. A guitarist wouldn't hurt either, and I don't think Dave Mason is doing that much these days.) The result is a well-recorded CD with little spirit or verve. Sort of like a solo album by Winwood. Or one of his commercials...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated the poetry","review":"For a story about an inspired poet, the poetry in this book was mediocre at best. I read it and re-read it trying to gain some insight. None to be gained. The name-dropping was obvious and the \\"secret\\" about Constance's affair with a married man was boring. Nothing happened in this book. No relationships developed. It was just a re-telling of something that had already happened with no present tension or build-up.

I found it on Amazon at a surprisingly low price so I immediately ordered one. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed with the product when it came. The cellophane overwrap was not sealed on one end, the box itself did not look original, and the so-called perfume was so watered-down (or alcoholed-down, or whatever they did to it) that it not only smelled a bit odd, but the scent immediately dissipated in a few minutes of wear. I thought that if I was trying to be \\"cheap\\", I would have been better off getting one of those \\"knock-offs\\" or \\"smell-alikes\\" at the mall. I wanted to return it to Amazon but found out that perfume was NOT a returnable product.

When you change the size, amount, and flux in the air flow it throws the samples the sensor takes out of wack. Usaully you end up burning lean, too much air not enough fuel.I bought Cobb's CPU remapper (AccessPORT) and retuned the computer and everything runs great now. The heat shield is a nice touch and does keep the air flow cooler. The filter itself comes off easy for cleaning. It is sold and fairly easy to install and you get what you are inspecting.

The book had brief descriptions of techniques that I felt should have been expanded further and some of the plans should have had views from different aspects and in higher detail.What I appreciate about this books the techniques for making your own tapered reamers and links to organizations that will help me to further and expand my knowledge on instrument craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not very elaborate","review":"I thought this book covered a lot, and ran the reader through a lot of information.

You can probably hang a bit of lace or plastic from it, but forget it for any actual curtain that has discernible mass. Second, it arrived bent right through the middle. Since the metal is so brittle, attempting to bend it back into shape results in the metal snapping. Finally, even if I *did* attempt to hang something from it, the mounting \\"hardware\\" is a joke.

You will be irritated by made-up words like v-day and t-night (venusian-day, terran-night respectively) from the first page, and the \\"plot\\" doesn't appear until the last third of the book. Plenty of completely random action and imagery are the backdrop for two dimensional characters who save the completely malleable universe from Jorx who for no apparent reason wants to destroy it, or at least remake it in his own image.

It briefly sketches what Rachel would gain by being an American, but not once does it mention anything about being a Jew or what she would be giving up by turning her back on her heritage (which, I might add, she does)! What kind of book does not explore the main problem? I also did not care for the assumption that you cannot be an American Jew--you have to choose one or the other. Having Orthodox Jewish American friends, I know for a fact that this is far from true. Also, I actually prefer a main character who has a personality. Rachel was formulated and predictable--your typical Sunfire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unrealistic","review":"First of all, this book's portrayal of immigrant Jews in the early 1900s was TOTALLY UNREALISTIC! Joshua, a highly observant and traditional 1910 Jew, would NEVER kiss Rachel, a girl he is not even married to, in public. Also, the dialect was unrealistic. (I.e. they would not have said skullcap--they would have used a Hebrew or Yiddush word for this head covering.) I also did not like how it was always Rachel's beauty that opened doors for her. And the book was always talking about how Rachel was trying to choose between her heritage and being an American. It never once attempts to explain exactly what this heritage is or means or what she would be giving up by marrying Nathan. The characters were flat, predictable and two dimensional. Basically, a horrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of your seat entertainment!","review":"One of the best adventure movies I've seen in quite a while!

I thought it was excellent and along the lines of \\"Way of the Gun\\" for you gunhandling folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinners and Saints","review":"For review purposes, I forced myself to watch the entire movie. Basically it is about a cop who is at the forefront of a turf war. With that being said, the motivations for this turf war between the gangs and the mercenaries is unclear. The movie never explains why the \\"big\\" man behind the killings is motivated to kill all the people that die in the movie. We learn why his main henchman is killing. He wants to get a tape that exposes himself to criminal activities.***SPOILER ALERT***The movie was so violent that the violence became the main plot. The acting was poor, and in the end almost every actor in the movie dies except the cop and the head bad guy. Most of the violence was gratuitous. The plot was confusing and the motivations of everyone besides the cop were unclear.This was one bad movie on so many levels.Save your money. Goodfellas has violence, but a decent plot.

A man with nothing to lose. \\"It has everything folks who enjoy seeing torture, mayhem, violence, bullets, blood, car chases in New Orleans. Frankly, the story was muddled and had something to do with a Russian, a war, drugs, New Orleans Police Department Internal Affairs, but the story never really came through in the film and at the end of the movies, despite watching the \\"deleted scenes\\" and \\"making of the film\\" on the DVD, I am no nearer understanding what the film was all about. I also must note that at times I found the background music intrusive and annoying. The film is shot in a color reminiscent of earlier Technicolor times. Most of the acting is credible. Taken in its entirety, I could have passed spending time watching it in favor of something less shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, bad audio","review":"The movie itself was great - one of my favorites, but the audio is horrible on the disc. Specifically the dialogue. All the other sounds are fine (music, sound effects, etc.), but the dialogue is low and distorted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Lovers of Violence","review":"Sinners & Saints suggests a storyline built around redemption. But it never delivers, unless you believe that violence is a solution. This movie is filled with talented actors, great special effects and lots of artistic talent. It seems like the idea was to try to produce the next big action hero a la Clint Eastwood of the 21st century. Our hero even appears to cultivate his persona, complete with Gran Torino (if I'm not mistaken, this was his car). The story is promising but not quite complete. There are threads of building intrigue through the script and images. But it all goes nowhere. The dialogue is difficult to understand with excessive expletives and the need for editing. All of the gratuitous violence results in a wreckage of a movie with no redeeming social value. This movie is a waste of talent to me but if you enjoy mindless violence, you will love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Surprised... One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time","review":"Slow and boring yet gory, Sinners and Saints was so bad that I just had to quit it about 40 minutes into it. Not because something happened that pushed me over the edge, but really because I just decided I would rather go to the bathroom then didn't want to restart when I came back upstairs. I can understand an indie drama about lesbians cowboys eating pudding being this slow, but this was supposed to be an action movie and there just wasn't really anything happening for most of the movie.This review may seem counter to the other ones you read here because for the limited time that there was action is was very in your face (and went out of its way to be gory and \\"shocking\\"), but that was only in the opening sequence. After that... nothing for longer than I was willing to watch. Maybe it got better... maybe it didn't... but you would have to pay me to watch any of it again, so I can't recommend that you spend any money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great Action Movie !!Leider ein in Deutschland wenig bekannter Film.

Having said that this is not a cult classic but it's of the same quality that basic cable channels have been churning out for years. It's a bit more stylish looking with a few notable actors slumming it but it's an unimaginative action romp with nothing to distinguish it.The image quality is pretty good for the DVD--the blown out colors and \\"look\\" of the film is intentional. Audio is very strong.\\"Sinners and Saints\\" is a deriviative movie that, beyond the opening action sequence, has nothing memorable to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliched","review":"I'm not sure if some of the people who gave this movie 5 stars saw the same one I did. It was amateur-ish and cliched. The story was acted well enough, but the writing was just awful. It also had a weird sound editing issue, where you couldn't hear the actors when there was music in the background. Overall, I'd skip this one, it just is not original or interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagine a Dolph Lundgren or current Steven Segal movie","review":"The script was poor, the action was very scripted, and the sets were dull. I expected more from this movie since there were a few names in the credits I recognized. Was it worth watching? Probably best to mow the lawn instead.

The characters dont seem real at all, I'm really into all the Samurai, Middle Age stuff and fantasy books but this one just didn't interest me. The characters don't seem real and their dull. I personnally don't like books that are slow getting of, but these L5R get off to fast, by pg. 100 there ready to hack each others heads off.

The main character, Utaku Tetsuko is not the same character in the card game and RPG.

Next time, before writting for a series, find out what your writting about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow up","review":"After reading 'The Scorpion' I can safely say this book is a worthy follow up and the quality of writing is just as good as the previous book. My only gripes is that a person not acquainted with the L5R universe may not have a clue as to what is going on, such as the false Hoturi, why The Crab are allied with the Shadowlands etc. Also, towards the end of the book, the whole thing feels like a prologue to 'The Crane' since the whole False Hoturi thing is left dangling (Come on, the guy killed Jikkyo and yet Tetsuko and co. don't seem to be pursuing the matter?) Also, as some L5R players may know, there's no mention of the Kolat, but that wouldn't have many any impact on the Clan War storyline. Also, certain parts of the dialogue, especially the 'jokes' ('Don't bother sending them a thank-you scroll, their already dead') seem pretty un-Rokuganese. Overall, this is a worthy successor to the 'Scorpion' and I'm looking forward to starting on 'The Crane' soon....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle Maidens Rule!","review":"I didn't get to read the first book in the series, but I'm definitely going to after this one! The battle scenes were enthralling - I don't always go for that sort of stuff (especially all the gore) but I was totally hooked.

The childish art on the cover of each doesn't help, either. And I admit the lyrical themes in MC are silly in two or three places (e.g. Dragon Time), but it still captures the Vitus feel. The Troll, while a dumb theme if taken literally, I believe is best interpreted symbolically (\\"When I fall down, in the stree,t people stop and laugh at me.\\") I think of the Troll as referring to the dope fiend, or the street person (also, the theme in Shooting Gallery). The songs occasionally approach upbeat (by Vitus standards), but the Troll and Shooting Gallery are sludge delights.

Dr. Bjornerud engaged me with her beautiful prose and funny anecdotes, as well as her ability to tie together the big picture with the small.

Unfortunately the last third of this short book is all about global warming and how humans risk changing the earth in drastic ways. We need to know about this, but that's not what I wanted or expected from this book. Still, I found the book well-written, clear, and interesting. Now where's a book for me on learning to read the rocks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide-Ranging and Informative","review":"This book covers a much broader range of topics than its title (Reading the Rocks) suggests. The various types of rocks and their origin and evolution are indeed discussed early in the book; however, other topics that are discussed to varying degrees include the formation of the solar system and the earth, the evolution and structure of the earth and the atmosphere, the evolution of life, mass extinctions, ocean currents, ice ages, etc. As a result, the book's subtitle \\"The Autobiography of the Earth\\" is quite appropriate. This book is well written and should be read by a wide audience, including geology buffs since there are many details given that one does not often find in books aimed at a completely lay audience. The only drawback is that there are no drawings or pictures of any kind; these would have nicely complemented the text. Nevertheless, this is a good authoritative book, engagingly written and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"thinking the logic of the geo","review":"A brilliant introduction to the world of geology. This book is unique in its attempt to bring a geological and social perspective together to think about sustainability and what it might mean to learn from the rocks. The prose is passionate, inspiring and reminds us that earth is a rather unique place in the universe (well this universe at least). The other thing this book does is to remind us that thinking with geologic time is not all about making the \\"human\\" small, but releases other ways of thinking through current social and political problems that pay attention to a responsibility towards time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really for the layman","review":"This book may not be really ment for you if you do not already know some geology or if you are not ready to study this book and not just read it once over.I hoped this book would be more like \\"The Dancing Wu Li Masters\\" (a book about physics written by a non-scientist). But if you do get by all the new words you will see that the earth is a very special place indeed. So many things have to be just so so right and perfectly adjusted and well balanced for this place to continue to exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the earth is different","review":"A good, thoughtful read. Stays clear of Intelligent Design and other religious minefields to bring home the unique aspects of our planet. Knowing some basic Chemistry and Physics helps to understand some of the drier sections, but it is overall a great primer on what makes our planet the changing world it is and what makes it unique to supporting life. Any Earth Science teacher or student would benefit from reading this book and, given the current interest inn global warming, the general population would find it interesting also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good primer on modern geology","review":"Very enjoyable, non-technical intro to contemporary geological thinking, with an historical approach.

We burned cedar wood to provide heat on the cold winter days. When I burned this morning star cedar, it brought those times back to me very clearly. This is not a heavy, perfume-laden scent, it is the natural fragrance which evokes the sense of a lifestyle in tune with nature and its seasons. I especially like to burn this around the house in the winter time. I do not think this is necessarily the type of incense one would use to cover up an unpleasant scent - the stronger, Indian type of inscense would be better for that. This is the Japanese style - subtle, teasing the brain into a relaxed state. I love this incense and have been using it for 8 years, ever since I first encountered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely any scent","review":"The sticks and the lil holder and the lil box it comes in are all nice but this incense just doesn't do it.I can barely tell whether or not I like the scent.I got this product for its good reviews but I'm just not pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"champagne highs and giddy lights\\"","review":"The Auteurs have a very unique sound. At first I did not like this album but, because it was odd in an interesting sort of way, I kept listening to it and the sound grew on me. It has a very soft, semi-folk, alternative sound; a little like Bettie Serveert (especially the guitar on \\"New French Girlfriend\\") but very posh British. Luke Haines' vocals are a little raw, but quiet and free which suits the music well. The lyrics range from the interesting to the bizarre; for instance, \\"A Sister Like You\\": \\"Two sisters sighed, Said we might as well be lovers, We're so close, Just like blood brothers.\\" The cello and occasional oboe give the album the air of sophistication. My favorite tracks here are the ones that rock like \\"Lenny Valentino\\" (an excellent opening track) and the catchy \\"Chinese Bakery.\\" It is a solid album. I recommend it to fans of alternative folk and very British-sounding music."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for any business library","review":"Love this book. It is right up there with Think and Grow Rich, Strangest Secret, and other classic self-improvement and financial mindset books. It's a wonderful presentation/story and very quick to read.This book has been the inspiration that has generated millions or dollars and the richest men in the world have read it. Ask any millionaire, if you don't believe me. :)The reason it's 4-stars instead of 5 for me, is because I feel books like Think and Grow Rich should come first. That is just me though. This book may be #1 for you. Regardless, it will certainly be up there, I promise. It's an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and spell-binding tale","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The sweet story of Emily Harding, thrown 100 years back in time, to right wrongs made during the Civil War is touching and humorous.

However, most of this stuff is for true fans only. A lot of it is recorded poorly, and there are some very \\"young\\" compositions. Still, the songs have great energy and \\"The Politics of Time\\" material is as good as anything else pre-\\"Double Nickels on the Dime.\\" The fact that all this music (almost 70 minutes) is available for one low price bumps it up to a four star review in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a photo book?","review":"You'd expect a book of just photographs to have good photos, but this one doesn't.

Her insights into the challenges facing a pianist and her reverence for the art form make this book eminently worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality rod!","review":"The rod was bent when arrived so had to carefully straighten it as best I could without snapping it in half. The middle extension piece did not fit easily (much too tight) and could only insert part way without buckling the whole thing. I have it hung up temporarily until I can get a better rod. I think $12 was way too much to pay for this flimsy rod. (it didn't even have the soft rubber guards that fit on the extension ends so as to not snag your sheers) I thought because it was priced higher that it would be nicer quality but I've paid $5 or $6 for similar rods that were much better quality.

I'm only using it for a valance, I would recommend something a little more heavier for larger or heavier curtains. It comes with a screw-in metal hook type of thing to use in the middle for additional support. The curtain rod is the same as the smaller sized one and included a extender.

As an instructor of manuscript writing at a major medical school, I find, however, that the advice in this book does not really hit at the heart of the problems most inexperienced authors face, and sadly, few of them will learn from this book.

I grew up with this TV show as a kid in the early 70s, not unlike many others here, and have never forgotten the timeless messages that permeate its presentation. Free to Be You and Me is for kids of all ages in any generation. One of my favorites is when Marlo Thomas and Mel Brooks are the voices of the babies, but my absolute favorite, which can't be of much surprise, is the New Seekers singing the title track. Between this and most anything Sid and Marty Krofft have ever put out, I feel fairly confident that out-of-date to some people means nothing to small children who just love to be entertained and learn valuable lessons. I love to sit and watch this sort of thing with them, we can have a great time doing it, and we can hope the generation behind us will embrace it and spread the love.

I'd seen it in pre-school and somehow remembered the songs, stories, and humorous skits up through college. And I'm not alone! Others like me are frantically searching for this piece of their childhood, perhaps the only video to REALLY say to kids, \\"Just be yourself.\\" A football player tells boys it's okay to cry, a fairy-tale tells girls they don't have to get married, and Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas approach subjects like gender roles and childcare in four skits that can have even grown-ups laughing out loud. Though the song featuring a young Michael Jackson singing \\"We don't have to change at all\\" is extremely ironic and more than a little sad, the video is a fun experience overall. The book and soundtrack are also both wonderful tools to have in raising open-minded children, but I must admit that as cheesy as it sounds, it's the movie that really helped shape my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of DVD is horrible","review":"Like many before me, I watched this as a kid in school for several years and was surprised to see a DVD release. The DVD has versions of songs not on the CD (a young Michael Jackson for example).BUTThe DVD quality is pretty bad. It looks like someone put a video camera on a tripod and pointed it at the wall showing the old film on a screen (complete with things blocking the view) - I'm serious. They didn't remaster it or even do a quality transfer.This may be the only version you will see on DVD so holding off may not be wise if you have no other copy.

Clearly nostalgia stays strong and memory fades because I had no recollection whatsoever of just how horrible this movie is.For starters, it drags on soooo incredibly long before anything happens with the stamp traveling. It was literally over an hour before any action happened. Everyone in the movie seems to be an avid stamp collector- men on the streets, people in China, Australian mad men...that was so unbelievable! The plot is probably the worst out of any movie I've EVER SEEN!!!

Shows today like CSI (esp. CSI: Miami), the short-lived series Fastlane (still irritated that Fox cancelled it, but I digress), and most dramas are the way they are now due to how Miami Vice was produced back then by Michael Mann. The look he gave was distinct and slick. The background music, from Jan Hammer's trademark theme song and underlying score thoughout, and the use of well-known (and even some obscure) music artists throughout the series. The writing was top-notch, so this show was more than just \\"gloss\\". My only quibble is that I wish they had cleaned up some of the grime I see on transfer, though the quality is much better than the reruns you see, and the use of 5.1 surround is a definite plus.

More disconcerting though is that after playing it a few times, the video would freeze for a few seconds and then skip to where Calderone reaches for the gun in his waistband. I could no longer position the disk anywhere in the skipped area. Reinserting the disk did not fix the problem (this is on a high-end Sony player). On a DVD player from a different manufacturer, the DVD gets a media read error at the problem spot.I returned the DVD set as defective and got another one. The freeze again occurs at 1:22:56.

The show has aged very well. Don Johnson just may be the best tv cop ever. Universal did a great job with this set. (I'm not a major fan of the 2-sided dvd's but that's a minor quibble.) There are three things that separated Miami Vice from the pack in terms of cop shows that preceded it. The constant lack of happy endings, the cinematography, and the music. I'm so glad that Universal released this with the original music and I hope and pray that they do right by the 2nd and 3rd seasons.

It's a wonderful film that makes me feel as though there's a Chihiro in all of us.After seeing this I have rented just about every Miyazaki film we have in our Family Video. And yes, I know doesn't make since that I hate anime,but love Miyazaki's films.I will not try to explain the movie because I can't tell it as good as Miyazaki can. I haven't seen all of his works, but I would definatly recommened \\"CASTLE IN THE SKY,KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE & PRINCESS MONOKE\\" (Only because these are the only ones I have seen so far) I would recommened this to anyone. It's really worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cool!","review":"Spirited Away is my favorite movie! It is rated PG, but only for Scary parts.

It is rated PG for a reason! I'm sure you will enjoy the movie if you see it. Everyone else I knew did. Somebody said when they saw it in the theatre,the audiense stood up and applauded... Yah it is sorta weird, but not weird enogh to make it bad.When me and my cousins saw it ...we where all speechless when it ended. We just gaped at the tv. That is how good it is.

If they had put even HALF of the promotion behind Spirited Away that they did for their own poor quality films such as Lilo and Stich, then they could have made hundreds of millions off of this films! BIG mistake Disney!Anyway, this is one of the greatest films of all times! The characters are full of life and emotions, which is rare to see in an animated film. The artwork is flawless and beautiful and it has the most original story concepts of any movie from the past 50 years. I cannot emphasize how great this movie is. If you are a fan of classic films such as Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz then you will absolutely love this movie. This movie is a classic that will be enjoyed my children and adults. I also recommend checking out Miyzaki's (the directors) earlier works such as Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Beautiful!","review":"This is my first Miyazaki film I have seen, and as a result, I have come to love all his works.

It is a little spooky at times, but it is an amazing film out of all I've ever seen. I do not reccommend it for children under seven to eight years old, yet it is wonderful for every other age. I understood it perfectly and believe that the plot is at the perfect place between dramatic and simple. I have seen other Miyazaki films, but this one truly took my breath away and is amazing beyond amazing. If you want a perfect example of a major motion picture, choose this fantastic movie for you and your family. It's Academy Award is truly well-earned and, I believe, that this is easily one of the best films ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just amazing","review":"I was never really interested in anime but decieded to watch this after seeing the high ratings it got, and I absolutely loved it.

Until very recently I only watched it in Japanese with subtitles. It an endearing story of a little girl who doesnt want to grow up, but is forced to, and emerges as a strong young woman.My two year old was recently going though my DVDs, and asked me if she could watch it. I agreed, and as I dont want to have to read the entire movie to her, set the audio to English. I was watching an entirely different movie from the one I fell in love with. Chihiro was a whiney crybaby who refused to grow up. Lin was turned into a mother figure instead to treating Chihiro as a peer.I was really suprised that the dub was so different from the movie. And even though my little girl loved it (she watched the entire thing -- never moved) I'm not sure I will let her until she can read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Hero","review":"What an amazing imagination this man has!

Really hope he lives a long life and makes more movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it so much!","review":"One of my all time favorite movies!! I've watched it so many times. I admire the way Miyazaki portray's love in his movies. It's more than just passion like chick flicks or tv shows. I almost think his portrayal is more realistic. There's care for the other person and people and creation and work. And then I also love all the creative spirits at the bathhouse! I definitely pick-up on a different one every time I see this movie. There are so many! And there are a love of life lessons in this movie as well. Love, hard work, loyalty, and fighting for what you are convicted is right are just a few examples!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-changing experience","review":"I was reluctant to watch this film, as many people have recommended it to me but never found any interest in it. Until I saw a review online stating that this was one of the greatest films ever made, I decided to take up my friend on his offer.What I witnessed was one of the greatest films of all time. The greatest animated film I have ever seen, it touched my heart. Sen, or Chihiro was the star of the film not for any other reason than because of her pure and generous heart. Her compassionate nature really gave hope to the film, and made a seemingly chaotic world seem beautiful.The animated and epic nature of the film really brings optimism into life that one must watch the film to understand. 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"why is this movie so popular? i dont have the answer. it is really long, and a bunch of strange magical things keep happening one after the other including some stupid things like \\"if you become afraid at all, they can see you!\\". it started so smartly but then went downhill so quickly.i like animated movies and loved shrek. but this is just plain silly movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went to the movies to see it - I shouldn't have","review":"We were young and in love with the art and originality in/of 'Princess Mononoke'.

I think this movie teaches kids such wonderful lessons in humanity, and you need to understand the meaning behind the movie yourself before you can judge it. It might be a little confusing to the lesser educated? My daughter loved it, and we used it as an important lesson about morals. You will never see her eat food left sitting on a counter!! My husband and I also loved the movie. Don't be afraid to let your kids see this movie, it's certainly better than the .... afternoon cartoons they watch on t.v. Although I don't care for anime, this was a REALLY good movie, we have already pre-ordered it for dvd. Put the popcorn in the microwave sit down with the family and enjoy!

Realizing how stupid the reviewers are, giving this hunk-o'-junk a rating of *****, I have more than the rights to give this a *.This film is good, but the reason I gave it a * is because it's over-rated.

Spirited Away is truly a family movie, a movie that everyone will enjoy! Its filled with magical things, and beauitful artwork as you will find with any Miyazaki movie from what I've seen.

This is one of my all-time favourites if not THE all-time favourite. The story to Spirited Away is the most original idea for a movie that I have ever seen, nothing can even begin to compare with it. The movie is about a girl named Chihiro who, with her mother and father are moving to a new home. they get lost along the way and discover an abandoned theme park. While Chihiro's parents eat the food at an abandoned restaurant Chihiro discovers a bath-house. When she returns to her parents they have been turned into pigs! So if Chihiro ever wants to see her parents in their normal state again she must get a job at the spirits bath-house. A place where spirits come to relax... If you're considering getting this movie I strongly suggest that you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The movie is a funny as any Disney movie.

In order to do that she must find work at the bathhouse and soon befriends a mysterious boy named Haku. Haku tells Chihiro that he will help her return her parents back to normal.

I highly recommend \\"Spirited Away\\" even if you aren't an anime fan or, like me, are an otaku (you know who you are).

It has beautiful created animation. Hayao Miyazaki brings us into a strange and beautiful world where Chihiro is the outsider. I liked the part about the river god, that looked like stink monster at first. I believe this is suppose to show us how a river can go from a beautiful river to a sewer if we keep doing things to it, but it can be saved. This DVD had some good special features Nippon Television Special was very interesting, it was nice to see the animators at work and the voices behind the animated features. When I watched it again, I watched it with the English 2 (I believe) subtitles on. The ones that show you what would be said if it was just translated to English without changes. I could see why they made some changes. Also, at the end credits you can see what the end song words are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great experience","review":"Wow what a wonderful movie.

I liked them so much I bought EVERY other movie they released, hoping the rest would be just as good, and they are. After Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is my fave. What I like about it is of course the story, but also the fact that this is one of Studio Ghibli's most deeply/richly colored movies. Ghibli seems to favor the softer more airy and light colored approach, but this has a really deep almost water color look to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this shipped to me in U.S. if I can't play it in this region?","review":"Appearantly movies have different regions they can be played in.

But as the movie progresses you see Chihiro, now named Sen, become more mature. It's a wonderful movie about, I believe, responsibility and love. I think Disney did a fine job dubbing it, as they have with the other movies by this same person. Grant you, I was disappointed in the ending, but if any of you remember Princess Mononoke it too had an ending like this. It leaves viewers to come up with their own idea as to what happened after the movie ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirited Away","review":"Spirited Away did exactly what the title says to me, the movie was crazy! i loved it, it was an awesome story great characters and just a great feeling while watching it, the fantasy and adventure is crazy! whoever thought of this has an amazing imagination! it's a great movie that gives you that feeling at the end like damn i wish it did't end! or whens the sequal coming out!? the DVD's Crazy the movie comes out so good! so so so so so good! recommend it to anyone! i never seen this movie but i bought it anyway and i wasnt dissapointed! get this movie, you'll absolutly love it! Spirited Away Rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirited Away","review":"I am not big on many of the Animation movies with their spin on what I consider overacting heroes, however from time to time I find those films that rise above any cultural difference and truly inspire and illuminate something special (e.g. Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Princess Moanoke). This movie along with being nicely animated had an interesting way of telling the story. A family goes on a picnic and enters a strange world through a path into a walking tunnel. The lessons the young girl learns reminded me of another great story (Wizard of Oz). I don't mean it reminded me of it because they are alike, but because they have great and unusual settings and characters showing you very different perspectives. I think most the family will find this animated story entertaining and educational. Great quality DVD with plenty of replayability.

I strongly suggest that if you like horror storys you might just stomach this otherwise stay away from it! It was made for Japan and thats where it should have stayed!(If you love animation so much that you have to see this film then watch it with the lights on or curtains open and take a break from waching this film for 5 miniutes every 15 minutes and sit outside if you can, if the film is to much for you from a certain point then dont watch any more because the film becomes worse and worse.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"the animation was impressive, but the plot line and characters were very strange.

Does NOT Deserve the Academy Award","review":"There is already much being said about this film that, and I may not be able to say anything that hasn't already been said before. Many give it praise for being a well animated \\"Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass\\" tale. It's good for children that can count their age on two hands because in Miyazaki movies, children are heroes. Kids will like Spirited Away and others such as Totoro for that. As for anyone who ever \\"was 10 years old\\" as Miyazaki says, be more wary. It is at heart a children's film that could have easily been produced by Disney. It's popularity perpetuates the myth that cartoons are for children, thereby making it difficult to take seriously (for most of the general public) to take as \\"higher art.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"odd, weird, and odd","review":"Unless you like movies with parents getting turned into pigs, spider-like humans, a woman with a big pimple on her forehead,giant babys, a cruise ship with human-like things on it and things that don\`t look like humans at all, this movie is not for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated \\"Spirited Away\\", but loved this!","review":"I couldn't stand this movie for many of the same reasons already discussed here, so I won't bore you with that. I can, however highly recommend an anime film, and that is \\"Night On The Galactic Railroad\\".

For one, the animation is crappy -- what happened to the inbetweeners? For two,the film goes on and on and on and makes no sense throughout! For three, the girl is just stupid. Half of her lines in the film are to scream and run forward. Then don't get me started on the mud bath sequence! What was the point of this film anyways!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite anime films","review":"i first saw spirited away when it was first reales in the u.s. at the time, i thought is was a ok film but i was young. it was only a few weeks ago when my friend sparked me back on to it and now i have fallen for it. directed by hayao miyazaki, one of the biggest japanese directors, he takes us on a grand journey to a world of spirits and magic. chirio and her family are moving to a new town but on the way, they make a wrong turn and end up in a abandoned amusment park. here is were chirio's parents are turned into pigs and she is transported to a new world were she must take up a job working at a bath house under the maniacle ubaba. a truley epic film with stunning animation, miyazaki has truley created a movie for kids and adults to enjoy. plus, it even picked up an oscar for best animated film. so, highly recomended for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spirited Away","review":"I have already seen this movie as I own a tape of it that I purchased years ago for a vcr.

I have tried to play the movie in NUMEROUS DVDs and have not been able to enjoy watching it once yet! Every time I hit the \\"play\\" button, it says \\"Playback prohibited by area limitations.\\" I obviously payed $14 for nothing.

Just as with all other Hayao Miyazaki movies.But that doesn't matter, the movie itself is so greatly done, you forget all about the storyline.I have seen the movie about 7 times, and i still always get happy when i see it, the music, storyline (even though its bad, it stil fits the movie) the drawings. Everything is superbly done.You also get a really good idea of what the characters are like.And you can't help it but getting a big smile on your face when the baby and the bird are transformed into little rat and fly, its just looks so darn cute!Its fantasy at its best.Once you are done watching this, you are like: Wow...and then you got watch it again!Truly awsome, a masterpiece.Buy this now!

It is the most wonderful Japanese anime I've ever seen. I had waited two years for the zone-1 version to come out.And I'm totally disappointed by the picture quality of this DVD! It's blurry and desaturated. It's lost all the sharpness and saturation of the original movie. Can't believe Disney did such a bad job on Telecine (the film transfer process) for this award-winning movie.But the problem is, for this DVD, disc 2 (the Original Japanese trailers) is better than disc 1. The first several trailers just look gorgeously crisp and clear with absolutely no blurs, and the color looks vibrant and vivid..So, I think Disney should consider re-mastering this movie or offering a refund program. Watching this DVD, my wife says, is like watching a VCR. Great Movie, bad DVD...what a waste..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dvd","review":"Placed order and received a confirmation the next day(Mon).

A wonderful movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous","review":"Referring to previous reviews, I find it particularly heinous for an anime fan to imply that Miyazaki has a feebleminded imagination. Ouch...that's so unforgivably tacky. Also, it'd be ideal that making sure meaning isn't lost in translation would be the director's responsibility; no such luck, particularly with dubbed anime, and especially with Disney. It's always been an issue that's been apparent since anime crossed over from Japan. That said, Spirited Away is an amazing movie, and while Otomo and Oshi are forces to be reckoned with, so is Miyazaki."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"Even if you hate Disney, like I do, don't make it stop you from buying this. Miyazaki smartly said Disney can't do anything to it which means they couldn't make it into junk. So in the end it's still a wonderful movie to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"what will they think of next????","review":"WEll i really liked the main caracter, Chikiro and her best friend Hahcku -- he turns into a pretty dragon. Then I love the part whne they kill Yubeba! Her nice twin sister Zenaba takes the kids in and uses No Face this black spirit with a mask to sow clothes for Chikiro! Then there's Kamachy the boiler dude and he is Chikiros grandpa. Her parents get turned into pigs and are eated for bacon! Last there is 3 heads that are Yubebas hench people! they're green and bounce around! I like when the paper things cut up the dragon! its so ironic with PAPER--get it, paper CUTS???

Disney/Pixar may rave about how they painfully tried to keep it true to Miyu's eastern version but thats the point IT IS AN EASTERN FILM!!its full of Asian characters and culture it should never have been dubbed.So i implore you,beg you,plead with you to watch this in THE BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN with the subtitles that way you will really appreciate the wonderful world of Spirited Away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!","review":"Typically I don't really enjoy animated films, but this one was awesome! It kept my attention and was really a unique movie. I couldn't even guess what was going to happen next. This is a must-see for both adults and kids.

Some things just don't have the greatest translatability into English, unfortunately. As a person who grew up in Japan, many of the sensibilities of the film are intimately familiar with me, and the in-jokes that Miyazaki plays in Spirited Away makes the story more touching than the script and animation alone can convey. At any price, this movie is a steal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This film is a masterpiece.","review":"This Film is a masterpiece. Forget that it is Japanese. Forget that it is Animated. Buy it now.

Most people won't even get what the movie is about.I'm glad that he finally got some recognition, but it's a shame it had to be with this movie. You're far better off watching some of the older movies from Miyazaki. Laputa, Kiki, Totoro, Princess Mononoke or my personal favourite Porco Rosso... Even the quite old Nausica? holds better than this Spirited Away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have been 5 stars if Disney weren't Disney....","review":"If you've never seen the original or a good fansub version of (ahem) \\"Spirited Away,\\" you will find it to be a wonderful journey into Miyazakiland. However, if you have a decent fansub, you'll probably be happier sticking with it and passing on the Disney version. The translation is not true to the original - I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and guess they had an inexperienced translator working on it. Better that than the alternative of purposely trying to dumb things down/be PC for the American audience. Words were dropped, nonexistent dialog was added and typos abound. The Japanese version ends with the American-version's cast list. I guess Disney figures Americans don't care about the real actors, even though the voices have more emotion than their English-speaking counterparts. Most of what's written here applies, as well, to Disney's two other recent Ghibli releases. Why couldn't they leave perfection alone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"We came, we saw, anybody want it next?","review":"I had not heard about \\"Spirited Away\\" until it won awards. When a relative happened apon a pre-release video copy, he passed it along to us because we are huge Disney fans. My husband, 2 daughters and I love Disney animated movies. My older daughter, who is 6, had to run and hide 1/4 of the way into \\"Spirited Away\\". She has never done that from an animated movie before. Watching the parents turn into pigs was too much for her!The animation is beautiful but the story line is disjointed and many parts are not explained. It is as trippy as the Teletubbies.

The artwork is beautiful, but the story was frustrating and non-sensical. We are both fans of artsy films, but we continuously found ourselves laughing at this movie, and not in an intentionally funny way. Our most common comments were, \\"This makes no sense,\\" \\"This must be for people who like to ACT like they are intellectual,\\" or, \\"Oh my god this is hoakey.\\" I cannot think of a better example of something being over-hyped.

What's three seconds divided by three hours? Answer: the movie was .000277 fun. That iota of satisfaction was dimmed by the resentment one of spending $25 on it, and two of all the glowing reviewers who are obviously unfamiliar with all the cool Anime that Japan has exported here for twenty-odd years.

She ended up being very scared and upset in a very real way. She even had nightmares. It was my mistake. I should have watched it first to see. I am not saying that ALL children would be. But I would definitly say it is for more sophisticated children/older. And yes-classic disney was a bit more scary. But the scene where snow white gets lost in the forest is not quite the same as the feeling and imagery of the this film which does not let up as does Snow White when she says \\"I was being silly to be scared\\" then starts singing.

It is now part of my most precious movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute movie!","review":"This movie is another one of Miyazaki's work that's entertaining and very interesting, to say the least. You can't possibly expect what's going to happen next and even the ending is a little different than you would think. It's semi-scary for small children who might fear odd looking spirits/ghosts or find the idea of their parents turning into pigs with a possibility of being eaten somewhat disconcerting. The story follows Chihiro who learns to deal with her issues, shows that a lack of material greed can be quite beneficial, and who quickly builds the courage to save her parents. This movie has the sweet flavor of a plot with good purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"I got this DVD not knowing if I would like it or not. I heard that it was supposed to be really good so I decided to get it. I was hesitant because I am normally not a fan of anime and movies like that. However, once I started the movie I realized how amazing it truly is. From the beginning I was hooked to the movie and couldn't stop watching it. It is a visual wonder. The animation is spectacular. Everything about the movie is excellent. I would suggest this movie VERY highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"I always enjoy a biographical account of the transforming power of Jesus Christ.

Boring is also a word that can be applied to Kevin Costner who, as far as I am concerned, hasn't done ANYTHING of value since \\"Dances with wolfes\\".

Please, don't expose me to this movie again!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tin Spitoon","review":"Writer-director Ron Shelton's mediocre comedy about golf pro Roy \\"Tin Cup\\" McAvoy (Costner) losing his swing and needing it to be rekindled by the lover of his chief rival (Rene Russo and Don Johnson.)A mediocre screenplay with cheap comedic quips that allude to nothing except the impotence of the male characters and the incompetence of whoever wrote this frivolous screenplay. The story being generic and utterly predictable is the only comedy in this film. The best part of the film is probably Cheech Marin palying McAvoy's friend/caddie, Romeo Posar. Unless you like brainless humor marked by stupid one-liners uttered by jock characters, stay away from this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different game of golf!","review":"Costner does a great job in the movie, as a golfer who doesn't lack talent or love for the game.

Could not use...ABSOLUTELY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Golf is a slow moving sport and Tin Cup was one slow moving movie. Somehow Kevin Costner's character(Roy McAoy) just seemed to annoy me. The club breaking scene was oh so troublesome. And why in the world does Renee Russo's character fall for this guy? The ending was surely odd. I guess Costner's character was loaded with determination. A minor plus I guess.Another highlight was when Roy MacAvoy chipped a shot out of the bar accross a runaway and forced a Pelican to leave its perch. Cheap amusement but certainly amusing.However, this movie is a little too low energy for me. Seek out Bull Durham or Field of Dreams instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"on my list of worst movies","review":"I consider this one of the worst movies ever and am still wondering how to get this wasted time back!

This doesn't compare with the movies profiling the lives of Bobby Jones or Francis Ouimet."},{"rating":"1","title":"for golf fans only","review":"There's a nice soundtrack but otherwise not much to recommend. Costner is constantly obsessed with proving he can make the big shot. How can anyone sympathize or empathize with a compulsive jerk like this.

I am a Very Amateur Golfer, but love this movie. Not for when children are present. Nudity and profanity are common. Still love the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golf Pro/Love Amateur","review":"The subtitle of this movie says it all. Roy is adept and relaxed at golf, but love he's the opposite. The turnaround in both occur (well somewhat the love more than golf, for the risk taker in him persists) with a local psychologist taking lessons in golf, while she gives him lessons in love and mental skills.The acting by lead characters is good, esp. Cheech. There is too much f** words and other language in this for this reviewer, and I know before it's said it's only my opinion and it is.The soundtrack is superb, which I bought and play often since watching this on big screen first.

We all tend to go for the impossible, somehow harboring a belief that we are much better than we are. Hope springs eternal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Romanticlly dull and boring","review":"Tin cup is one of those films that meanders ever so slowly, considering it's centerd around the game of golf, one may find it quite quicker and maybe far more enjoyable to watch an actual entire 18 hole game itself. Costner does he's standard by the book routine of romantic shmaltz (do I sense some Meg Ryan typecasting going on here) and Rene Russo does little else but try and swing a golf club in those tight golf pants. Billed as a romantic comedy one may find it difficult to find laughs amidst all the yawns! . For serious lovers of the game or Costner himself, others may find it far more entertaing finding a movie about love on the croquet set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I remember","review":"I watched this movie the other day with the thinking that it had been a decent movie. I was really wrong. I hated it. I am realizing that I have these romantic memories of movies from the 80s and 90s that cut out all the bad parts and stuff that I didn't like in the movies. This is one of those. The plot was weak and meandering. There's more I didn't like in the movie than parts that I did. For me, Kevin Costner's character was sleezy and not that likeable. Renee Russo's character wasn't that likeable either. I'd definitely recommend that you pass on this one and watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretches the imagination a lot, with Bum to PRO.","review":"Good Theme but a lot of miss hits along the way.

COME ON, get real, Bull Durham it's not, and every Kevin Cosner move tries to recapture that Minor League'r making it big routine.

In the instructions to have the shade fit the window, the roller was adjustable and the shade was able to be torn to fit the roller. It attached then to the roller with double sided tape already on the roller. But the shade was so thin, that just attaching it to the roller, made it rip more. Room Darkening??? No, way....

But if you've ever had any twinge of doubt or confusion in the area of relationships, marriage, romantic feelings, etc, you will not have any when you're done with this book. There is a whole world of possibilities present in this book that you will probably never hear any person talk about, perhaps even if you are a seeker.I can't say much more than \\"read this book now.\\" Thank you thank you thank you Osho!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a must read. Anyone who wants to really understand an intimate relationship and grow within that relationship needs to read this book. This book is not for the faint hearted for it requires enormous committment to follow through with what Osho has to offer, but it is profound. He also speaks about the different types of relationships that we accept in this world. For me, there were certainly some challenges, but at the same time, he makes you think. You don't have to agree with everything that he has to say, but if it takes you out of your own paradgim of thought, even for a while, then I think Osho has achieved something.Dr. Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"If you like Ben Harper...then this is a must have.

Ben Harper is an artist capable of decent and interesting compositions, but this debut isn\`t really promising at all. This album is lifeless, flat and instantly forgettable, and there isn\`t a single worthwile moment to register here.Harper\`s acoustic, laid back and mellow songs make him seem like a male version of Tracy Chapman, but pherhaps even more insipid an uninteresting. Listening to the entire record at once is a task, frankly, and creates a heavy sleep-enducing process due to its bland and sometimes melodramatic songs. All of them are filler, nothing stands out as mildly engaging and captivating.A snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"one time listen...","review":"and i'll probably go and sell it for an unlucky bloke who'll pick it up from the used cd section. waste of my 13 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"good hard science mystery","review":"the book is one part scifi and three part mystery/thriller.

I suggest you take a nap instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost at the top of my movie meter.","review":"I watched this at a party with my friend. It was hysterical! We laughed more than a gazillion times. Dana Carvey was fit for the part of Pistachio Disguisey. And the crude humor was awesome man!But the only reason I am rating this movie four stars is because it needed some more pure action and adventure. If Revolution Studios is going to make a sequel (And I sure hope they do!) It has to has some more pure action and adventure! I know I'm dragging this down with all these complaints on one subject all a little too much. Bottom Line: It was a great movie! Keep the crude humor,keep Dana Carvey,keep the laughing out of your body disguises! Just put in some pure action and adventure PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Master of Disguise experience...","review":"Can be easily captured without buying the DVD.Firstly, rip up $13.Then, beat yourself over the head with a hammer until your brains are coming out of your nose. Then, have Dana Carvey spit on you.Finally, shoot yourself in the stomach.This movie is not funny, entertaining. It does not even have a remotely interesting story. As some of the other reveiwers have said, this movie has the same terrible joke, repeated throughout the whole movie.Avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"I was lucky enough that I got to watch this film on a road trip in someone else's car, as opposed to wasting 90 minutes of my own time (as well as a couple bucks). If you are forced to watch this film, that is probably the only time you should waste watching it. It tries to be funny, but fails miserably. I believe one review I read of it said that it disguised its funny moments better than the main character disguised himself. Sadly, that's the complete truth. Adults, you will find nothing here that's amusing, unless you're really into totally lame, flat jokes. Kids, you will neither find anything amusing in the movie, as the actors are not funny enough to entice any one of any age. The direction was also poor, and the crude humor was (as is in most movies) pointless and dumb. I felt embarrassed just watching it. Skip this movie, and you will miss nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I went to see this movie because i think Dana Carvey is very funny, but this is definetly not his full potential. I've laughed many times at things that Carvey has done, but i didn't laugh one time at this movie. The plot was very dumb, and slow pased, and everything that happened was predictable. It got boring half-way through the movie, and they just repeat the same joke over and over. And lastly the movie was way too short, and when the credits started rolling, they should of stopped it there, and not put in all the stuff after it. I think they could of took a little more time making this movie before they realesed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of Disguise","review":"It looks fine... I didnt play it yet.

I cannot express how important it is that you see this movie. If you're only going to see one movie this summer, or even one movie in this lifetime, it MUST be \\"Master of Disguise!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"bad but not in a good way","review":"Wow, I had already heard how terrible this film was before viewing it, but I had expected it too be so bad its good or something like that. Nothing could have prepared me for how terrible this movie is. Its a complete waste of time. Even Maria Canals looking incredibly hot sporting a huge prosthetic butt couldn't save it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down.","review":"\\"The Master of Disguise\\" by Dana Carvey was a BIG disappointment. I didn't want to give it even one star but you can't post a rating without giving a rating of at least one star. I bought the DVD but I feel I wasted my money. I was a big fan of Carvey's Saturday Night Live days but this movie stinks. It just seems as if he tried to stretch out one of his SNL skits to feature length (but didn't quite make it because the movie is only 1hr and 20 minutes. I think Carvey was hoping to trade on his SNL fame to sell the movie and didn't put much effort into the writing and was siting on his laurels. He is talented performer but his talent doesn't extent itself to writing movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money!","review":"Utterly awful! I went to see this thing that is not even worthy of the title of \\"movie\\" yesterday... Dana Carvey is obviously a gifted actor with some true talent, but the script and plot is so ridiculously stupid that it amazes me. The humor was crass and extremely predictable at best, the secondary acting roles were poor, and the audience response was virtually nonexistant. Maybe if you're a ten year old boy this might have been slightly entertaining. The people that decided to release this film nationally had to have been [crazy]. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever you do, do NOT watch this film...","review":"It was really painful to sit through this film. We've all seen what Dana Carvey can do on Saturday Night Live. So why spend money watching him do it again in a movie? Also, to see Brent Spiner (\\"Data\\" from Star Trek) be reduced to an evil, farting villain is sad. It really gives new meaning to the phrase \\"captive audience\\".This movie is so bad, it doesn't really merit a review. It also pains me to have to give it 1 star, rather than the 0 it deserves. Instead, I'm writing this as a public service to those of you who haven't seen it. Spare yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor. Waste of time. Awful.","review":"The main character is an idiot. The plot is cliche. The execution is flimsy. I had to struggle to maintain consciousness while watching. This film is quite a poor selection for children or adults. I cannot recommend it in any way. The most interesting thing is the title. Do not be misled. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Disguise This Dud.....","review":"Dana Carvey is gone for all these years, and his comeback is this grade-z stinker? It seems like a made-for-Nickelodeon TV Movie, and a bad one at that. Carvey plays Pistachio Disguisey, the latest in a long line of Masters of Disguise. Except he's an idiot. (This sounds WAY too much like Inspector Gadget. The cartoon. Which is funnier, by the way.....) His parents (The intolerable James Brolin and the loathsome Edie McClurg) are kidnapped, and his grandfather must teach him the Disguisey secrets to get them back. The movie is really short. It just SEEMS like it's 4 hours long. And why make a movie for kids, and fill it with long segments riffing on Scarface, Jaws, The Exorcist, and a million other things they won't get? (I got them, but I didn't laugh....) The interminably long outtakes seem to hint that there were whole scenes that were cut out, so I should be thankful for that; It could have been even worse.Somewhere, Mike Myers is laughing......."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This is a really stupid movie. The \\"humor\\" includes the hero disguising himself at a patch of ground in a pasture with a cow pie for a face to the villain repeatedly emitting large amounts of gas. The rest of the gags are about as funny. Target audience seems to be boys age 10-13."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a 4 year old boy, you'll like this movie","review":"It was painful to sit and watch the 45 mins that I did.Even the kids in the theater weren't laughing.I guess if you're a 4 year old boy then you might appreciate it.Sorry Dana, I was disapointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst god damn movie I have ever seen!","review":"If you are even thinking of buying this movie for anyone I don't care what age, don't get this one. I saw this movie over the summer only to escape the heat, and I felt like going on screen and beating the [stuff] out of the entire cast. Dana Carvey you dissapoint me. I respected you before you made this movie. What were you thinking. I am writing this review as a public service, I don't normally write reviews but I can't stand by while people throw away their money on worthless filth of cinema. I hope no one buys this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly funny!","review":"It's just so silly and stupid that it's incredibly funny! Great for kids 12 and under. Fun for parents to watch and re-watch with children.True Reflections (Solo Piano)Lavender Dreams"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for 11 year olds","review":"Although I found this movie to be insufferable, my kids, ages 9 and 11 really enjoyed it. The plot was so tired it is hardly worth going into but, unlike the Austin Powers movies, it was appropriate for pre-teens. There was no swearing, but there were flatulance jokes; who could ask for anything more? (Alright, a decent plot would be nice.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You know it's a bad sign when...","review":"...even the other characters in a movie roll their eyes and look bored to tears at the hero's jokes.Dana Carvey plays a stereotyped parody of a guy from an Italian family famous for the art of disguise. His name is Pistachio Disguisi (get it - DISGUISE-i, get it????), which will give you an idea of the level of humor involved. Over the course of this endless movie, he becomes, among other things, a turtle, a cherry pie, and George W. Bush.My 8-year-old laughed; maybe your kids will too; thus the two-star rating (based on my opinion alone it would be a 1-star movie). But I would be surprised if anyone of voting age even cracked a smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster I despise","review":"[...]I have to agree with one of these other reviewers about the fact that this is an Austin Powers knock-off. All the disguising is stupid like when James Brolin is Jessica Simpson and Michael Johnson. Geeze! And Dana Carvey did a horrible Tony Montana impersonation. And the female lead wasn't that attractive. Horrible movie and the people who decided to make this are the ones who should get dummy slapped. I have nothing more to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed Wood would think this incoherent...","review":"Poor Dana Carvey, once he was funny, and maybe still is, but you'd never know it from this wreck of a movie. After the mildly interesting Pop-up book style credits, the movie has nothing going for it beyond Jennifer Esposito's comeliness. Otherwise, you get endless mugging, scenes paced for comedy if you find \\"Teletubbies\\" intentionally hilarious, and a painfully unfunny flatulence gag every time Brent Spiner's evil genius gives his evil laugh. Every time. It happens a lot. Brent Spiner looks embarassed every time, and I'm not sure it was acting. Supposedly this is for kids, but I can't see it working that way except as a bright, shiny, goo-goo-ga-ga time keeper for infants who have no awareness of the movie's context. In short, the cinematic equivalent of a mobile. Not recommended for anyone old enough to understand what a well-executed fart gag is."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are under 10 years old, it's just OK.........","review":"If you are over 10 years old and someone is paying you to see this movie, think hard before you go. With tremendous potential, they managed to eliminate all enjoyment a teenager/adult could get out of it, leaving the content suitable for only a 9 year-old or under whos parents allow them to joke about flatulence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criminally Bad","review":"Perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. It says something sad about the film industry that this film was ever made. Couldn't they see in the initial concept reviews that there was nothing funny or entertaining here? Couldn't they tell in casting that no one was capable of carrying the roles they were assigned (least of all Cavey). Couldn't they see from the rushes that the film was actually painful to watch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Passing gas, and cow dung","review":"Yes those 2 things in my title are used to get a cheap laugh. This movie is mainly about Dana Carvey doing silly impersinations . The only good thing about this movie is the fact that a beautiful lady is his co-star. But unfortunatley, neither she nor other actors add any humor to the story.If you're looking for a kids movie, spend your money on a disney cartoon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"master of the garbage dump","review":"this movie sucks! It's so stupid that I wanted to bust the disc. I could write every stupid thing, but it's to stupid for me to take the time to do so. This movie sucks. I now hate turtles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master of improv, but over and over?","review":"Now Dana Carvey is widely respected for his comedy, at least in certain circles. Yes, he is a funny man. However, his humor maybe limited to sketches, although many thought that Wayne's World was funny (no comment.)This movie was about a more or less dumb kid, Carvey's character, of an Italian family that have been Master of Disguise's for years. However, the dad of Carvey's character wanted to protect his son, so he protected his son from the family's dangerous legacy. Yet when his parents are kidnapped Carvey, his grandfather, and a recently hired assitee have to help Carvey become his destiny.Now what this movie does is let Dana Carvey do a lot of impersonations. What this movie does not do is develop a good enough plot to keep those impersonations in a good flow. A few lines are funny like \\"turtle, turtle\\" but overall the humor is just lacking or mindless or both.Carvey could have done a really good movie with all of his talents, but this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kids Just LOVE It!","review":"Our Sons just love this movie.

I can't even look at Carvy anymore after watching this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, He Cheated Me","review":"Complete waste of time. NOT FUNNY AT ALL! I had to force myself to watch the entire movie and hated it the whole time.I can't express how shocked I was at the quality of this. You expect SOME laughter, right? I spent the first half of the movie in utter dismay at how bad it was and the second half squirming in my seat for the ending. The level of humor may be on a child's level, but there are some things in the movie that are not intended for children.Life is short, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"Dana Carvey's latest movie is THE MASTER OF DISGUISE. A fantasy plot insues in which Carvey's character has the ability to transform himself into anyone he wants to, right down to their voice and actions. This is a family secret that his parents tried to keep from him. So of course there is some ridiculous, childish comedy which ensues during the movie. Some of which is laughable, but perhaps the funniest thing about the movie is how bad the script and plot is. This is just your typical run of dime movie with the girl he ends up with at the end and ridiculous humor. Might appeal to some, but not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot funnier than I thought it would be!","review":"I completely agree with the reviewer who said that the professional critics missed the point about this movie. See this with your kids and watch how much they enjoy it! That said, the movie also has some hilarious bits that will fly right by children. The Al Pacino \\"Scarface\\" character is a scream and dead-on accurate. I went into this movie with low expectations and ended up laughing out loud through the whole thing. It isn't sophisticated, the \\"Pistachio\\" character is often a little too sappy, and some of the characters (Pistachio's mother) seemed miscast, but overall I enjoyed this movie and will surely watch it again (given how much my daughter loves it). Note to Dads: if the slapstick comedy doesn't keep you interested, Jennifer Esposito will. Major babeage! Give this movie a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bunch of dry jokes!","review":"I couldn't believe I paid money to see this tripe!

It turned out to be a loose string of skits that went on way, way too long. The supporting cast had nothing to support with -- trite dialog and the same tired old gags over and over again. The few cameos became the most interesting parts of the movie. When groups of people of all ages leave a movie, that's a sure sign it stinks. Save your money.

These are my 3 year old's favorite books. The pictures are great and really help the children to see what life was like in the old days.

I am a huge, huge fan. I was super excited to get this game. So, believe me when I say that this game is just not that good. It's not challenging, and two adults can complete it in under 15 minutes. I know this because every time I've played it, it's taken only that long--and I certainly don't mean that my friends and I were just so smart that we got through it quickly, I mean that it's just a very, very quick game. A game this quick is just not that fun to play. Some of the questions are moderate to difficult, but the vast majority have really obvious, simple answers that don't challenge the players. Easy, dull questions combined with a laughably short playing time mean that this game will not be taken off my shelf very often, if ever again.

While the real musicians behind the scenes make a better attempt to sound like 'em.

After hearing the album, I was dissapointed that Sentinel was different than the other songs on the album. There were a few good instrumentals but I still didn't like most of the album. Mike Oldfield uses a unique mixture of sounds in his music and he includes a few voices as well. Some of his songs I would not even classify as new age, like \\"Shadow On The Wall\\" since it sounds like rock music and doesn't have good vocals.

However, the casting of Vanessa Williams as Dulcinea is wrong. Dulcinea was a Spaniard from La Mancha in the city of El Toboso. 99.9% of Spaniards are white, mostly with dark hair but light to olive skin and fine facial features. Vanessa Williams is a mulata (a mix of white and african black). The Cervantes story originates in the 15th century (around the time of Christopher Columbus' Discovery). The mulatos did not come into being until the 17th century and much more in the 19th century and later. This was when the Black African slaves mixed with the European (French, British, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese) whites.

Bete Noire is a more upbeat album.What I love about Mamouna is that it is \\"chill\\" music. Listening to it evokes something haunting and mysterious to me. My all-time favourite song is the closing track, \\"Chain Reaction\\". Try listening to this song while lying in the dark. I absolutely can't get enough of it.This is a great collection of original music from Ferry. If you're a fan, get out there and pick this one up. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre songs buried beneaeth production wizardry","review":"By this stage of the game (early 90s) it's increasingly obvious that Bryan Ferry was lapsing into stylistic self parody, and \\"Mamouna\\" would have to be a contender for the most perfectly produced piece of easy listening fluff in the history of recorded music. That's really not enough, though, because Ferry's songs have grown increasingly solipsistic and insubstantial with the years. \\"Mamouna\\" can float by without notice, practically hook-free. With the exception of the single \\"Your Painted Smile\\", and to a lesser extent the title track, \\"Mamouna\\" offers the aural equivalent of being slowly suffocated with a scented pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice on paper, but...","review":"With such a great list of musicans on this album (Nile Rodgers and Brian Eno are just two) it dissapoints greatly. Though similar in sound to the excellnt Avalon, Ferry just doesn't have the same well crafted songs as he did in 1982. What results is an empty, souless albums which at its best (Mamouna) washes over pleasantly and at its worst (N.Y.C.) can be embarassing. While the production is pleasant and often innovative (thanks to Eno) it can't cover up the fact that the album is actually incredibly dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Possible Turning-Point","review":"It sounds as if Ferry has finally consummated the mood-music sound he has been working at since Avalon. Mamouna has a warm, human tone nearly absent from Boys and Girls and Bete Noire. His lyrics are still perfunctory a best, though. You may not like the direction the man has chosen to follow, but you can't help appreciating his dedication and intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferry at his finest","review":"This is probably my third favorite Bryan Ferry CD, following \\"Boys and Girls\\" and \\"Bte Noire.\\" It maintains the atmospheric production of those two CD's (this time courtesy of Robin Trower) and also ponies up with some great writing from Ferry.The players all pitch in with great work. Old Roxy friends Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay and Brian Eno contribute to most of the songs, along with notable musicians like Maceo Parker, Nile Rodgers and Pino Paladino. They all pile on rich, lush layers of sound, buoying Ferry's timeless tenor. While \\"Mamouna\\" is probably one of Ferry's lesser known albums, I probably return to this one more that, for instance, \\"Taxi\\" or \\"Frantic.\\" If you prefer Ferry's work in the \\"Avalon\\" era, then \\"Mamouna\\" will probably be to your tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I am ecstatic in that I just tracked down an audio recording, Bryan Ferry - Wolverhampton Civic Hall 1995; the live tour promoting this effort featuring Robin Trower on guitar. Excellent, a Ferry/Trower treasure. This studio recording is simply Bryan Ferry's finest effort; without a doubt. A richly orchestrated production something like what you would expect from Peter Gabriel. There is an ambiance to this recording that is surreal; immersive. The musicianship throughout is superb and the performances somewhat understated; no one musician really rips on anything here and yet the tracks are very powerful and effective. Great songs really; great material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roxy Reunion","review":"I won't say much about this album beyond my opinion that it is excellent. What most people don't realize is this album is, in effect, a Roxy Music reunion. Brian Eno, Phil Manzanera and Andy MacKay are involved in most of the songs here, and they get help from the likes of Yannick Etienne and Nile Rodgers. This is one all star album from the instruments up to the production booth and it cleary shows. If you like anything that Roxy ever did, or Ferry solo for that matter, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"the trilogy","review":"Finally got a vinyl copy of Mamouna. This represents the third of my estimation of Bryan Ferry's best work. The other two being Avalon and Boys and Girls. Mamouna retains all the languid longing romanticism of the other two albums with perhaps a bit more ominous and foreboding irony to the always sophisticated textured sound Bryan Ferry/Roxy Music is famous for. Electronica synth based sound seems to dominate more which may relate to the over all dark character of this release. None the less with the exception of one cut, \\"wildcat days\\" that has a monotonous presence and lacks any interesting development. The rest of the cuts are first rate lounge lizard Bryan Ferry all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ferry at his finest","review":"This is probably my third favorite Bryan Ferry CD, following \\"Boys and Girls\\" and \\"Bete Noire.\\" It maintains the atmospheric production of those two CD's (this time courtesy of Robin Trower) and also ponies up with some great writing from Ferry.The players all pitch in with great work.

There is plenty of action and suspense, and the special effects are simply tremendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Contact With \\"critic\\" success","review":"Finally! A Star Trek movie that critics enjoyed and was worthy of the Star Trek label. The visual effects are wonderful! The DVD enhances the wonderful film. The \\"little things\\" which show the relationships of the crew are present (You told him about the statue?) but not nearly as present as in Insurrection. The cameos of Reg, EMH, Alyssia all add to the film, and help \\"smooth\\" things over. There are lots of wonderful moments in the film. Technically speaking, the DVD has lots of well thought out chapters, stunning FX, great sound quality and wonderful enhancements. This is a superb movie on a great medium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT MOVIE!!!!","review":"When I first watched this movie, I was, \\"WOW!\\" Jonathan Frakes proves himself as both a great director and a great actor. This movie ROCKS!! It's awesome. I expecially liked the scene in which the Enterprise-E enters the fray against the Borg cube. The visual affects are astounding.When the movie introduced Zephram Cochran, I was, \\"That's him?!\\" However, I liked him besides that he got drunk all the time. One of my most favorite lines in the movie was said by Cochran: \\"What are you some kind of astronauts . . . on some kind of star trek?\\" That line simply sums up all of the Star Trek movies. Bottom line: A CANNOT MISS FOR ST FANS!!! BUY THIS!!!!!!! AN ESSENTIAL!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Captains' log ... \\"Boring!!!\\"","review":"Don't bother with this one. How a film with a very promising start can end up so trite and dull is beyond me. \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\" is the only Star Trek film that lives up to (or, actually, beyond) the hype. The best performance in this film is by James Cromwell who has never had a disappointment performance. Sorry but he can not save this insignificant film. When I went to see this in the theatre I could actually hear two people snoring behind me. Everyone else started laughing. Had it not been for moment of sheer entertainment my money would have been completely wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"* Better Than All the TNG Movies *","review":"I don't know why the TNG crew cannot get their acts together with their movies but they have got to get with it. Its ridiculous that out of 4 TNG movies this is the only really good one.

I felt DS9, Voyager and Enterprise were nothing but a bunch of spin off meaning the title (star trek being used in each of them). I didn't understand DS9 and Voyager at the time and didn't follow Enterprise.It wasn't until later when I've collected them all! Every single star trek episode and movie to date that I realized it's telling one big story.Which bring me to this movie. I now consider this film being the first episode in the story I mean. I'm sure a lot of you have seen it already if you haven't you won't understand the series Enterprise. I HOPE THIS GRABS YOUR GUYS ATTENTION!! I'll continue with my review on Enterprise season one"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Contact is Awesome","review":"This movie is awesome. It has everything. The late Jerry Goldsmith did a wonderful job with the score for this film. Its one of my favorite Star Trek themes. It has awesome bad guys in the Borg. Not the Borg lite from the TNG episode Descent, but evil mean Borg and the queen.I loved James Cromwell in this film. He was completely believable as Zefram Cochrane. Johnathan Frakes did an incredible job of putting this film together. Its my favorite of all the TNG films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"What could be better to Star Trek fans than a combination of the Borg and time travel? Nothing.

If you like Star Trek then this one is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Intelligent Reviews","review":"Really, I have just enjoyed reading all the reviews for First Contact. Trek fans (I've always felt) tend to be literate and thoughtful people who can express themselves without alphabetical shortcuts or the word 'sucked'. It's been fun to read the thoughts ... and of course 'First Contact' is the great outing for the Next Generation crew. This movie is almost Shakespearian in its depth and grandiosity, covering just about every emotion from rage to \\"you have the bridge, Number One.\\" Patrick Stewart, in particular, turns in a performance that would honor any movie in any genre. The man can so some acting. 'First Contact' ranks among the best in space opera and this two-disc release does it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Trek time-travel thriller","review":"In \\"Star Trek Generations\\", the \\"Next Generation\\" crew had to share their first venture onto the silver screen with some of the original series veterans, including Captain Kirk, who perished at the end of that film. In \\"First Contact\\", the NG crew gets to shine on their own, and do they.The plot, action and characterizations are all first-rate. Combining the NG crew's arch-enemy, the Borg, plus mankind's first warp drive space venture, as well as time travel, makes for a solid adventure.Picard, Worf and Data, perhaps the NG crew's most interesting members, are given ample time to shine in this movie. Guest stars James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard provide top-notch Earth-bound support.A MUST for all Trek fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Star Trek Movie of all time!!","review":"This film is a spectacular work of art. The cast and crew blend together in ways that most films can only dream of like Star Wars Episodes one and two, which were the worst movies I have seen in my lifetime. Anyways this film is a must for anyone who likes the science-fiction genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell do people see in this film","review":"I have have been a loyal Star trek fan for many years and this is the second worst part of the star trek francise I have seen (Followed by Star trek Voyager) The way I see it any (so-called) Star Trek fan who says any good word about this has a screw loose. Even though you might be able to call it an average film (for NON-TREKKIES) it has no place in the star trek universe. The amount of in-consistent information in this film is so vast (after watching TOS episodes about First Contact 'metimorhisis' (I don't know if that is spelt right) and the 7 TNG Borg episodes) I haven't got time to right about them all, if you do want to read them look at the anonymous vevier from NH, United States (where ever that is) who is the next best thing to my best friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"dear leod","review":"Hey glad you noticed my post.

It was a travesty of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and a really nasty film to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie could be called \\"Best of Both Worlds Part 2\\"","review":"One of the best Next Gen Movies to hit the Silver Screen; this one takes the mystery of the Borg a step further. The producers throw out the hive mind concept and introduce the Borg Queen. It's Trek like it should be. Not all the actors get equal screen time but it a rollercoster ride from start to finish. If you like the galactic space battle scenes this one is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only all Trek were this good . . .","review":"If this is the death rattle of the Trek franchise, then it deserves to be mourned, because Mr. Frakes pulled something rather special out of his hat with this one. From the moment the truly beautiful score starts up, this film is polished, exciting, engrossing, and slick.Special effects are a tad patchy, but at their best rival anything short of 'The Matrix', with CGI finally pulling Trek into blockbuster realm. Acting is solid, and is raised to extraordinary heights during one scene between Picard and Lily in the Captain's Ready Room, which is simply superlative drama. It may be the best scripted- and acted- scene in Trek.So the humour falls a little flat at times, and the normal Trek mantra of thoughtfulness and caring-sharing gets pushed to the rear. So what? This is a stylish, smooth addition to a legendary genre, and is the 90s equivalent of The Wrath of Khan. If only they could have kept it up . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE FOR TREKIES AND NON TREKIES","review":"I once again returned to the final fronteir and I have to say this journey may have been the best one to date. The borg challenges the federation but they never calculate the ability of Picard, Riker, Worf, and the rest of the crew to thwart assimilation. I loved this movie. Data proved more heroic than I thought capable of an android. In terms of new characters, Cochran proved brilliant as the first earthling to reach Warp speed. As for the Borg Queen, she is just about as sexy as a Borg can get. I was pleased to see her again in the Voyager special which aired a few weeks ago. Buy this on DVD! Live long and prosper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually stunning and captivating throughout","review":"This was a truly awesome film and certainly the best Star Trek film I've seen. The opening scene with the Borg attack was truly awesome, the special effects were out of this world. It certainly set itself apart from a tv episode while still keeping some links with it, after all, 'The Best of Both Worlds' was a superb episode. First Contact provided a comprehensible story so that it didn't solely rely on everyone's favourite enemy. It was excellent to be able to see the Borg in such detail and also enjoy the film as a whole. It certainly out-classed the slightly disappointing 'Insurrection'. Hopefully the tenth film will serve up a great plot involving the Dominion or the Borg again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star trek First Contact","review":"The movie is entertaining and enjoyable to watch.

Spielberg and Zemeckis have nothing to worry about from this hack.I was a big fan of the Star Trek TV series, but have always felt the movies were pure pap with plots slapped together to maximize box office receipts.

There is an apprentice that learns a lesson when he starts doing the most surprising thing.DO NOT READ THIS PART IF YOU HAVN'T READ THE BOOK! Fireheart and Sandstorms friendship grows into something else! Bluestar is really not herself wich I'm sad about. At the end theres a natrual disaster which some cats in Thunder clan die.

Cinderpelt tells Fireheart that Bluestar is just going through a phase, and will soon heal. To Fireheart, it seems that Bluestar is damaged forever. Before Fireheart knows it, Tigerclaw attacks his Clan again, and now Bluestar seems she will never be the same, comforting old Bluestar. I HIGHLY recommend this book and you'll be missing a whole lot if you don't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book in the series!","review":"Sooo the best! Every book has truth in it.

Cloudpaw constantly gets in trouble and that gets very annoying, especially when Fireheart doesn't punish him enough. And Bluestar's frustrating, thinking that everyone is a traitor and not coming out at all. She has also given up belief of StarClan.

The only thing that made me give this book 1 less star was that it was so dark and depressing , although that is true it is still a amazing book, The way Erin Hunter made the story flow unpredictably so that you may be shocked made me stick on it.

The wood actually looks nice and it's a great value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new single","review":"Probably his best first single since My Brave Face. Fine Line is quite catchy and actually has pretty good lyrics. It reminds me of a cross between Flaming Pie and something from the Ram album. The other two songs(which won't be on the album) are pretty good as well, Comfort of Love being a nice rocker, and growing up and falling down an interesting experimental acoustic number. It's a shame it is only available as an import in America, as this obviously means the CD will be more expensive. For those who are just casual fans, you should probably just get the album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard when it comes out (if the single was cheaper I'd recommend it to anybody)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy now, analyze later","review":"It has to be one of the greatest injustices of all time being Paul McCartney. Not only were you part of the most trascendental bands in all rock history, but also, you are one of the most succesfulls songwriters of all time, and because of that you are your biggest enemy of your own work. People always expect to hear 5 \\"Yesterday's\\", 3 \\"Hey Jude's\\", 2 \\"Long and winding road's\\" and one \\"Band on the Run\\".For me, Paul is just an rock musician who writes in a way that makes me enjoy a greater part of his work. That way I can appreciate his new albums and thus give me the chance to learn to love them. Sometimes he makes deaf albums, and also makes bad single choices. This is not one of these times. \\"Fine Line\\" is a great uptempo song, with great melody, simple words and lots of \\"trinkets\\" here and there. The B-sides are good and surely will find a place in not few fans preferences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best song from a weak lot","review":"Chaos and Creation ranks at the bottom of the albums released from McCartney. \\"Fine Line\\" ends up being the best song from a woeful bunch of tunes cobbled together for McCartney's Chaos CD. But is it a good song? Lets put it his way; it's a nice song. So nice that it's part of a car commercial these days. On any other McCartney album it would have been a filler track. It would be nice if Paul could re-acclimate himself to the electric guitar and do a little rock 'n' roll again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposal Forgettable pop","review":"Even his legacy as a Beatle can't save the new single from being disposal forgettable formula. There is nothing interesting here except that McCartney is back from a 4 year absense. \\"Jenny Wren\\" is a better song than this, which McCarney seems to have written on auto-pilot. His days of being innovator are long behind him. From anyone else, it would get nowhere, not a great buy, I would say wait for the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was This Guy Really in The Beatles?","review":"I just listened to the whole record on AOL Listening Party. There's no doubt this record will be heralded as the best McCartney record since Band On The Run, but what's really up with Paul is every record is worse than the last.As far as I can tell every tune had a fragmant of an idea behind it, which was then turned into a tune in the studio. By the time the bridge arrives, McCartney is hacking out uninspired chord progessions layered with horrible, clumsy lyrics.I feel sorry for the guy from Radiohead. He must be dreading the diplomatic reviews he is sure to recieve from artists he has done good work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"My Favorite actors!I enjoyed this onemost of all!

Amazon had better give me all of my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the coffee table","review":"More than anything else, this book makes a great conversation starter to bring up the often-taboo subject of infant circumcision, more aptly called Male Genital Mutilation.

This book is one of my favorites. The full color paintings are exquisite, expecially the renditions of horses, morning glories, lotus, bamboo, and peonies. Accompanying each painting is information on the specific kind of Chinese brush, paper, and paint color combinations the artist used. What makes the book especially delightful are the anecdotes on each page about Chinese culture, philosophy, aesthetics and the artist's experiences growing up in China. This is a wonderful book both for those who are interested in learning how to do Chinese brush painting as well as those who merely wish to appreciate Chinese painting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. The cover says \\"If you loved THE DA VINCI CODE, you'll flip over REVELATION.This book is nothing like the CODE. There is no mystery involved even though the author tries to make you believe it.I liked the characters in the novel. It's too bad the author didn't give them something more mysterious and interesting to do. Please don't buy this book if your looking for another page-turner like the CODE. This book is sorely lacking in great action and mystery that made the CODE so much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Putter Downer\\"","review":"This is a book that I really wanted to like, but after 50 pages found myself unmotivated to pick up. It kept sitting on my end table crying out, \\"don't you have something better to do?\\" I know this sounds silly, but it is really a quite accurate representation of how you will feel reading the book.The characters are hyperbolic and stereotypical, and generally unbelievable. The story is trite and predictable. The one good point about this book is that Christian Balling writes in a style that is easy to read. If Mr. Balling can provide his audience with more intriguing characters and plot, I think he will sell some books. Because of this, I gave the book 2 stars for writing style.I tend to be a reader that gives a book 50 pages before moving on. There are so many good books in the market to read that I am not anxious to spend more than 50 pages on an unforgettable novel. This was such a novel. I moved on to something else, and you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE THE TIME TO READ IT!!!!!","review":"To be honest, I thought that there would be better reviews for this book. I was shocked to see that it was getting bashed. I loved the book! I read it in one night because I couldn't set it down and the characters were very believable. Mr. Balling did tremendous research and it shows on every page. I feel that this book is a mix of Robin Cook and James Rollins. If you like either of these authors, then you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"Looking back on the days when me and me chums watched pokemon, I realise how mentally sick we all were.

It also covers empires such as Funan, Chenla, and Lin I later called Champa, and the flowering of Buddhism in Vietnam.

This is an excellent reference book for human resource departments, hiring managers, and, also, for those in-transition. I refer to the book when hiring key employees and I encourage those who work for me to use it for interview preparation.Yates provides a review of situational, personality profile, stress, and behavioral interviewing approaches; knock-out questions; and over 200 questions that will be useful in assessing ability, willingness, and manageability.Hiring capable, motivated people is considered to be the most important management task. A poor decision results in a whole host of negative outcomes including lost time,expense,poor morale, and, possibly, irreversible negative outcomes. \\"Hiring the Best\\" will serve you well when filling open positions in the private, public, or the social sector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guide","review":"So few people have solid interviewing skills, which are critical in ensuring that you consistently hire the best people. This book is incredibly useful in helping you move past the \\"gut\\" decision. Several chapters are spent on how to ask various questions so that you neither lead the candidate into giving you the answer you want, nor intimidate the candidate at the wrong time. Very helpful in redefining the typical standard questions (which any decent candidate is prepared for) so that you can really get to the substance.The book's focus on explaining why certain methods and techniques work better is excellent. In particular it has been very useful in teaching and/or re-assuring the interviewers (both veterans and newbies) at my company that they are asking the right questions and making the correct judgement calls. That confidence is a key success differentiator from the usual randomness in interviewing that often leads to a substandard hire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple","review":"Very bad book, everything it says is intuitive.

The fifth one, by Diane Farr, was simply outstanding! I was practically giggling in delight the whole time I was reading, especially from the moment I figured out that this was Fred Bates's story--the Fred Bates whose honor Trevor Whitlatch was defending in Ms. Farr's second novel, Fair Game. In this novella, we discover why Trevor was so eager and willing to help his friend out. Fred Bates is one of the most likeable characters I've ever come across, and the heroine in this story, Claudia, runs a close second. Their story is interesting and engaging.

It seems top-heavy and bloated; more of a chance for all these stars to show how \\"down with\\" Bill Monroe they are, when in fact they aren't really playing these songs much in the Monroe tradition at all. Yeah, sure, we can't begrudge modern artists the chance to put their personal stamp on old music, but this too-perfect studio style doesn't reach me emotionally.

Her characters are so well written and so three dimensional, it is astounding. Her grasp of political intrigue is amazing and really gives a sense of realism to the story. The nuances of her systems of magic make her books all that much more enjoyable to read. I have yet to read a book by her that I truly didn't like and this one beats most of them. I truly cared about the characters in this book and felt sympathy for their plight. This is yet another book that I had a hard time putting down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and very unique","review":"I have nothing but admeration for an auther who can write a book as \\"deep\\" as this book was. She gave a distenct and complex personality to every single one of her characters and managed to keep every personality differant and unique. Although she did manage to kill many of my favorite characters very affectivly. I've also noticed many complaints about the complexity of the beginning. I liked it. It was fun reading the book again and picking up on little details you missed before. Besides, it's not like you stade confussed very long. All in all, i enjoyed the book a lot and can't wait to get my hands on the rest of her books. I just wish she would hurry w/ the 3rd one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! couldn't make it through this one.","review":"I was introduced to Melanie Rawn through the Dragon Prince trilogy which I had received as a gift one year. I only made it through the first book before vowing never again to touch another by this author. Well, to my shame, I broke my vow and bought this book. I didn't make it all the way through. I found it difficult to follow and boring with an erratic pace. The background history is not interesting and without anything to interest the reader the temptation is there to skip entire sections, which unfortunately, while it will preserve the reader's mental health, it will leave him totally lost. Don't spend your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"an adventure with heart","review":"i love these books.the people in them actually have lives outside of the numerouse battles and confuseing politics.i also love that you watch each one of the main charecters grow into adulthood so they come alive to you.iadmire melanie's great imagination and the strength she put's into her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"I loved reading this book! It takes place on another planet, where magical people called mages live. Not everyone is a mage and those who aren't are frightened of those who are. One of the weird things about this book is that instead of the males being all powerful, women rule this world (it takes place in the equivalent of a.d. 1000 or something like that), and that confused me for a while. The author really makes you care about the characters, important or not. Other books only concentrate on the main people in the story. Some parts (especially in the second book) were tasteless though. Other than that, you should read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, powerful book!","review":"I loved this book. It is one of my favorite books. I can totally relate to the characters, which are so well depicted that they seem to come to life. The well thought out plot kept the book in my hands for hours on end. This is her best book so far, followed by it's sequel. I hope the 3rd book comes out soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant blend of politics and magic","review":"This book doesn't have too much of the hard-to-understand magicspells and unpronounceable names that are common complaints aboutfantasy books. While magic is quite the order-of-the-day, the mainplot revolves around engrossing politics and well-developed relationshipsamong the characters. While the romance was disappointingly low-key :),and there were some rather predictable best-friends-die's, the bookhas a terrific and well-ended plot. Thankfully, the book didn't stophalfway into the story and my withdrawal pangs won't be too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is the best thing about this!","review":"The first 2 pages were great!!

Then she finally talked me into reading it and I was hooked! I couldn't put it down! This is a must-read for everyone over the age of eleven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To much politics and to little prose!","review":"As a long time fan of Melanie Rawn, I am sorely dissapointed in Exiles. The plot not only has to many twists and turns to keep even the most dedicated reader engrossed. Character development is extremely poor and takes a back burner position to political development.And speaking of politics, I for one do not think it mixes well with fantasy, and Rawn proves my point.I must be honest, and I only made it 3/4 of the way through the book and I do not know the outcome or ending. And I must also inform people that I began the book 5 times before I decided to sit down and read it. It lacks the spark of the Dragon Prince novels.To many characters, too many plots and subplots, too little character development, too much political machinations and no spirit! Altogether, theses qualities make for a very poorly created book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long ans Slow","review":"I'm surprised at how high this book is rated. I didn't find it to be a terrible book. The main characters were fairly interesting but I would of thought a book of over eight hundred pages would have alot more going on inside. I found it very slow. Maybe the author knowing she was writing a trilogy was just laying groundwork here but I was not interested enough to purchase the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Today's worries in a new light","review":"One of the greatest reads I've ever come accross. It is definitely up to speed with the rest of MR's works and once again flaunts her abilities to create a whole new and entirely different world, way of life, and view on very real and pending topics in today's society. From homosexuality to mixing political and religious affairs, the whole spectrum is covered with a style of writing that can be called nothing less than a graceful and intricate masterpeice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"I enjoyed this book (and its sequel) much more than the star scroll books. I liked the characters more, and the plot was good.I have to admit that I'm a little tired of the \\"mages after the catastrophe\\" plot line, but Ms. Rawn does this well.My major comment about Ms. Rawn's writing is that she tries to make it more complex than it really needs to be to be a great story. There are almost too many people to keep track of. In these books, and even more in the star scroll books, I felt as if I had to take notes to keep track of who was who and who their parents were, and how they fit into the story.Please write #3!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm embarrased I bought this book","review":"It's rare I don't finish a book once I start it, but I only made it to page 247 out of a 825 page book before becoming too disgusted by this mindless drivel to continue. The characters are very one dimensional, the plot thin, and the writer isn't clever enough to weave in her political agenda. It's slapping you in the face! She randomly skips over and completely ignores things she doesn't want to, or can't explain. The reason? To quote a character, \\"My talent is coming to a correct conclusion based on fragmentary evidence.\\" Oh, please. If you don't have the creativity to explain your own plot, don't write the book. I wish I could get my money back. This book will be donated to my shire's next anti-raffle."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was Fabulous!","review":"It was the best book I've ever read, and the series only get's better. It has everything, it has magic, love, government, religion, family, everything. Everyone should read this book. Melanie Rawn is one of the best authors I have ever heard of. She is very imaginative, and I hope someday I can write as well as her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thuroughly disappointed","review":"I came to know Rawn through her \\"Dragon\\" books, and I would easily give 5 stars to every one of them. However, I was saddened when I opened this book. I found it to be very hard to follow, and rather uninteresting. None of the characters caught my attention, and I quite often got totally lost in the political structre. Maybe someday I'll crack it open again and try to re-read it, but I never made it more than halfway through before putting it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rawn lovers-Avoid at all costs","review":"I am shocked and dismayed at the number of 4-5 star reviews this book has recieved. I consider myself quite a connoisseur of fantasy novels (I own hundreds), and was sorely disappointed at Rawn's second attempt at a series. Her first \\"Dragon\\" series was PHENOMENAL. It is one of my favorite series of all times along with Jordan's W.O.T. The plot is horribly simple and the characters overdone and pathetically easy to anticipate. I found myself rolling my eyes repeatedly and barely staggered through to the end. I agree with another \\"reviewer\\" that two different people are writing here under the same name.If you want to read an excellent series by an excellent author, read Melanie Rawn's Dragon series (6 titles total). Please, someone bring the real Rawn back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"A friend gave me book 2 of this series saying \\"oh you don't have to read them in any order\\" :P. couldnt follow it at all so i took book 1 from the library and barely read 5 chapters before i went and bought it. i ADORE her sense of humour! The politics and heritage can get a little longwinded and she has several \\"steamy\\" type sections but nothing overly much... but all of it is sprinkled with a refreshing sense of humour that kept me laughing out loud throughout. I got VERY attached to the characters. She has an annoying habit of killing off all your favorite characters though... and some things are a little too \\"far out\\" to believe, tending to use magic as an excuse for everything. But this IS a fantasy book right? what fun is it if it's all believable hehe. I highly recommend it, but it probably won't be for everyone and Women will probably enjoy it more than Men will (not saying that men won't.. but all my male friends snorted a bit about it :P)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The incredible disintegrating book","review":"** spoiler alert ** This book started off great, then devolved into a very messy and poorly written deus ex ending. I guess Rawn got tired of the book about halfway through but finished it because she had a deadline to meet. There are about 8000 characters in the book and most of them are little more than a family name. I knew I was in trouble when the ladder boy died and I didn't even care. And enough of the cutesy words! By the end of the book, I damn near gagged every time one of the women \\"dimpled\\" at someone. Dimple this and dimple that, yaargh!It's too bad, too, since this book showed a lot of promise at the beginning..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Slogged my way through the other series because they were around, but the girly factor in this one was too high to manage to finish.

If you like that, and fantasy, this might be a sure thing for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I don't understand how anyone could read this book. It was simply too boring for me to finish. Half of the time I did not know what I was reading, esp. the parts about the political structrure and the history. From reading the few chapters i could stand in this book, I never want to again read another Melanie Rawn book of any series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was boring!","review":"I didn't like the magic system - why should some people get to be born with magic and others not?

This book is a must for all Jessup competitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jangle and Inspiration","review":"I used to own a bunch of albums by the Church on vinyl back in the 80s and was looking for a good CD compilation. This 2-CD collection looked good ... and it turned out to be very good! 33 tracks that cover every facet of the band's underrated career, from the early 80s jangly guitar sounds that reminded so many people of the Byrds, to the more atmospheric, anthemic, and slightly psychedelic sounds they experimented with later in the decade. Above all, their songs were consistently good, often elevated to greatness by Steve Kilbey's vocals and the thrilling guitar dynamics in the music. These were songs that made you either want to play air guitar or grab an imaginary microphone and sing along. Inspiring stuff. The Church was lucky to have a few popular hits during the MTV era, but their music runs much deeper than that. Long-term fans may bemoan the absence of some favorite songs, but you can't argue with the fact that this compilation is packed with quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Best tv series.

Being double sided, the disks are poorly protected in the box, and it's VERY easy to scuff the playing surfaces in handling. (Just opening the package I got finger prints on them!) I fear that they will get scratched fairly quickly.)Still, a good set at a fair price.Now... how about the rest of the seasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series, love the Anamorphic wide screen","review":"Why does a series made for TV on widescreen only play as a distored full screen on some players? Why are the subtitles only offered in French. Don't the designers of features realize that an English speaking audience just might have hearing problems and need the substitles. Get with it. At least offer it in English and then add in French and Spanish. Most do.Stories, picture quality when the player isn't forcing it to full screen, is very good. Enjoyed seeing the earlier stories again even if I can't hear everything. I guess I'll just have to live with the volume turned up and hope I don't miss too many words."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Is Drama?","review":"ER is drama... and the best show on TV.

I've been watching it from the airing of the Pilot and I've been hooked ever since. If you are looking for an emotional high this is the show to watch. The writers and actors are amazing. Each episode makes me laugh, cry, and gets my adrenaline pumping. This show confronts extremely controversial, contemporary issues and even though I'm not in the medical profession I believe that it is very realistic. Anyone who works with a lot of people day in and day out can relate to what it is like to be pulled in several different directions at once and still try to maintain a professional facade, which I think this show pulls off beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an oversight!","review":"There is a huge oversight in the manufacturing of these discs. The discs are double sided and they failed to identify which side is Side A and which side is Side B. When they come new, Side A is facing up. But if you don't put them back in the same way, you'll need to actually put the disc into the player and pull up the episode index before you'll know whether you have the correct side or need to remove the disc and turn it over. I have looked very carefully and there is NO indication of Side A or B on any of my discs. Perhaps they corrected the problem part way through manufacturing, but I can assure you there is nothing on my discs to tell.Anyway, that is my only beef. The ER series is top notch and I think most of us are familiar with it or we wouldn't be considering buying this. I give it four stars only because of the manufacturing issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Merely-Anticipatory 5-Star Rating","review":"Having seen the first season when it first aired (as well as catching reruns of it on TNT), I believe it to be deserving of a 5-star rating all on its own. With all of the bonus materials that they are including, I wish that I had more stars to give.It will be great to once again see how very green Dr. Carter was when he first came to County General. Also, getting to see the lost Drs. Greene and Ross will be quite nice. Now for the rest of the seasons...."},{"rating":"2","title":"ER Season 1","review":"Loved this show when it originally aired.

Not quite so fantastic a plot as those others, in this one the fourth Doctor is off to Victorian London. A talented magician and his animated manikin assistant, both in the employ of a Chinese god, serve as the Doctor's foes in this one.The Doctor's companion is Leela and a local pathologist and theater manager provide the assist. As with the other novilizations the book is focused on plot and does not provide much insight into the characters thoughts. I found it an entertaining read and as it is reasonably short, it can be read in only a couple hours, providing an evening's enjoyable entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A history lesson in the orient.","review":"The author is not only a writer but a world class historian who has lived a great deal of what he wrote. He is a retired admiral who served in WWII and personally knew many of the key players from the president on down. This book is one of 16 volumes but most likely should be read first if you want an in depth discussion of how we ended up involved in the war. This is especially true if you have problems understanding why we dropped the atomic bomb. There are those writers that don't agree with some of what the Admiral has written, and I'm sure it's true, but for anyone even remotely interested in WWII Naval history, it is a MUST read. Highly recommended.The Rising Sun in the Pacific, 1931 - April 1942 (History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Volume 3) (History of the United States Naval Operations in World War II)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-priced Toddler Toy","review":"This is like a nice Fischer Price toy for babies but is usually targeted and marketed towards Autistic children. Although all Autistic children differ and are unique, I have three of them and they basically couldn't care less for this toy. I found it over advertised, overpriced, and quite boring myself. Turn it one way and the cheap little plastic beads fall to the bottom, tilt it the other way, same thing. I suppose if you are 1-2 years old you may enjoy this but it may be too big for that age group as they more than likely would clunk themselves in the head with it so I don't really know what it's purpose would be. Perhaps some child out there somewhere may find it entertaining but advertised as an audio type toy for Autistic children is just making money off from parents with disabled children. Shame on you companies that are doing this! This should simply be advertised as a toddler toy, period!

It was about 6 years ago and I was in Starbucks waiting for my drink to be made. All I could hear was Christ being sung about in such a soothing voice; and I asked the cashier, \\"WHO is that singing?\\" And she said, \\"It's Bebe Winans. We're carrying his CD this season.\\" So, as I was wiping my tears because I was so moved by his music, that I got back in line to purchase the CD. I've probably bought over 12 copies throughout the years, and I give them away as gifts each Christmas season.

I'm not one to buy too many Christmas CDs (how many does one need) but believe me after hearing this CD, you won't need any others. From the 1st track: Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, strings so lush they'll warm any heart, I was transformed to the spirit of the season. If strings aren't your thing, the choir on \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" is treasure to the ears. This CD will get heavy use in my home, car and office player for Dec and probably enough beyond.Thank You BeBe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy no, patterns no, waste money yes","review":"Quilts for Baby: Easy As ABCThe book has wonderful looking quilts.The patterns are non existent. until the book is in your hands do you realize she takes short cuts and uses printed fabrics, not cut patterns for the center of the squares.I was disappointed horribly when receiving this book and will gladly pass it along to someone that may have more access to the fabrics the writer uses.

The average I found was around $16.00 USD per yard.Misleading title: I should add, easy is not the word I would use for these quilts either, unless you are a quilter with years of experience.Since I am not a quilter with years of experience the easy part seem to be only in the head of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely great service!!","review":"I couldn't have asked for better service.

Yes, the music there in all early Italian and there are a number of dances. But it's not a collection of those simple, tuneful dances from early in the renaissance but more complex works by some first rate composers of the later 16th century. This is a strong and often serious album with David Douglass and Andrew Lawrence King delivering convincing performances. Mixed in with the instrumental music are a number arias sung by Ellen Hargis, which one might not expect given the title; happily this only adds depth to the overall work. A well performed and well thought out offering that any fan of Early music is bound to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a big fan of renaissance instrumental music, and since these are dances, I was expecting some pleasant, spirited melodies, like on the excellent English Country Dances. Although there are several tracks like this on this CD, many are slow and dirgy.

Unfortunately this person is actually telling us the story. Having a narrator who has no powers of description, limited intelligence, little grasp of punctuation, and no clue how to structure a story makes for a really bad book. I have been a Simpson's fan for years and had high hopes for the book, but, really, it's annoying trying to follow the senseless meanderings of a random idiot. None of the characters are developed at all, the plot is really weak, the writing is bad and sloppy. Worst of all the narrator doesn't understand what's going on.

But forty pages into this book I realized this kind of humor is A LOT funnier as a cartoon. I just found it frustrating how senseless and absurd the whole story is. It's like having to read a Leslie Neilson spoof. I just got tired of characters with two brain cells. There's no straight man to anchor the insanity. Every character is as brain dead as the main character Burley. It's too much like having to read a Looney Toons cartoon. I recommend you pick up Chris Genoa's \\"FOOP\\" instead. It's just as funny as this book, but much smarter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious from start to finish","review":"Schwartzwelder has done it again. I've been a huge fan of his Simpsons episodes because of their wild and outlandish subjects. With this his first novel he has mixed his own humor with an almost Vonnegutian story line that is guaranteed to please anyone with a slightly slanted view of things. If you like Douglas Adams, in particular \\"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency,\\" you'll love this outlandish romp through time and the criminal underworld through the eyes of Frank Burly.

So it pains me to report how much I ended up NOT liking \\"Once & Again.\\" I'm not even really sure how to explain it, except to say that there was never a single moment, the whole time I was watching it, when I wasn't acutely aware that I was watching actors acting. The whole thing seemed very artificial and contrived. The adolescent characters didn't ring true for me, either, nor did the character of Lily's sister ... and since these characters are integral to the plot development, that left a huge believability deficit for me.

If you're expecting something all natural that tastes like Kraft, you're going to be disappointed. Kraft's sauce is thicker and sweeter, but Annie's sauce tastes less processed and has a better all-around flavor.

It's just truly awful -- does not resemble a cheese taste in the slightest. Just a weird sharp and very unpleasant taste. The sauce is thin. They are even worse is you try to reheat.

It was amazing, and we were so excited that we decided to buy a large lot online. I couldn't find the exact style we bought, but the lable on this box was almost identical to the other Annies. I was WRONG, this was awful - the cheese was a powder instead of the pre-mixed packet that came in our original box. It was watery and smelled like vomit. It left a bad after-taste. I do not recommend this particular type of Annies."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting.","review":"I honestly would rather gnaw on the box this macaroni came in than to ever eat a bite of the actual product again.

However, I became concerned about the laundry list of chemicals kraft uses,including Yellow # 5. This box uses annatto and beta carotene for coloring.Its difficult to put in words what this taste like. On one hand its utterly bland and flavorless, yet it also leaves a weird sharp chemical like aftertaste in your mouth. I've tried the white cheddar one as well and it had a similar taste. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one because I like the fact that it does not use yellow #5 for coloring, but I don't think I'll be giving Annie's pasta another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best ____ & Cheese product around!!!!","review":"Picked up this product at Target when I saw it on sale for a buck a box awhile back, and have NOT gone back to Kraft since!

That determines the right or wrong action to resolve an ethical dilemma. \\"When, Why...If\\" is a personal ethics workbook which guides us through this process of self discovery. It includes chapters on honesty, love, help, harm, sex, and will. Although it is designed by a Pagan teacher for Wiccans, Pagans, and New Agers it can be utilized by those of any spiritual path who are interested in defining, acknowledging, and evolving their own sense of ethics. This book goes beyond the concepts of good and bad set in stone, focusing on the uniqueness of any given situation. You will not find a list of \\"do\\" and \\"do not\\" in this text. You will find \\"why would you?\\" and \\"should you?\\". I definitely recommend this book, especially for those without a flesh and blood teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful info","review":"If your small business does its own taxes via software, instead of an accountant, then this book can provide good supplemental information.

This information will allow you to speak intelligently to your tax preparer, to make sure that you get the maximum deductions allowed by law.

Moreover, they have perfected the formula for clear writing and sensible organization.In my opinion, you can't rely on an accountant to advise you on these issues in detail. As a businessowner, you need to know the guidelines so that you can earmark and time your purchases in a cost-effective manner. This book is helping me to do just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"helping small businesses save money","review":"This book lays out the various different deductions small businesses can take on their taxes to help save them money.

Although I am familiar with many biz deductions, this book walks you through many examples of deductions you can take if you plan ahead. I really like the \\"Day in the Life of...\\" examples of how you can maximize legal deductions pertaining to mileage. There's an excellent section on home office deductions. My husband, a self-admitted dummy when it comes to expense reports, taxes, etc., picked up the book after I was done, and even he understands the concepts. Already he has found deductions for his sole proprietorship and non-reimbursed employee biz expenses. Great value and so easy to understand.

Archos has been selling multimedia player able to dipslay pics and view movies for a while now. The argument of the form factor is not valid anymore with the Gmini400 which is as small as an IPod.

Unlike other reviews I have had no problems with the interface and in fact have found it very easy to use with my Windows operating system. I have filled up the 20 GB drive and the player still responds very quickly when starting up movies and albums.

If I Could Fly is very Victims while Unfinished Business and Il Adore are both mellow country stuff. Same Thing In Reverse resembles a country song with a dance twist - like Karma Chameleon. Based on the above, I think it's high time that Boy cut a country album.The title track could be something off Sheryl Crow's Globe Sessions - light country rock.Phone conversations are used are interludes between songs - like what Janet Jackson did.While Cheapness and Beauty deviates from the blue eyed soul/reggae/dance formula of Sold and The Martyr Mantras, it's still a great CD and a definite grower."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"I usually love Boy George, but I bought this cd, played it once and thought it was horrible.

The western genre has a lot of fine, talented writers; Elmore Leonard, Loren Estlemen, Johnny Boggs, Jory Sherman, Bill Brooks, Ed Gorman, Ralph Cotton, Peter Brandvold- just to name a few. The storylines vary from the quick entertaining reads to the more complex plots.

This is an absolute abomination... the worst DVD I have purchased of anything... the audio has a constant rumble which sounds like a train throughout. As for the video quality, it's even worse than the audio. This is obviously a transfer of videotapes that are several generations removed from the master print...

After he said it was all cleaned and again how great the Kirby is I brought out my Hoover of this model. I emptied out the canister and then ran it over the area he claimed was all clean.

Michael Moriarty pales in comparison to the amazing Sam Waterston; neither George Dzunda nor Paul Sorvino can hold a candle to Jerry Orbach; and, of course, it's good to see some women (S. Epatha Merkerson, Jill Hennesey, Carey Lowell, Angie Harmon, Elisabeth Rohm) in the cast. Yes, Steven Hill is a better D.A. than Dianne Weist, but he's around for a few of these years, and this year former Senator Fred Dalton Thompson has taken over as Jack McCoy's boss.

If you've only discovered the series in its later years, definitely check out the first few seasons. They are not as stylized and not as witty, perhaps, but they're well-written and interesting.

For 6 episodes, you spend over $44. That is damn ridiculous. Dragonball as it is right now has died down a lot, and it won't pick back up, as DBGT will turn everyone off until the final saga.Practically every episode until the final saga(even that, actually) features a new enemy every episode, and it gets repetitive (but then again, DB/Z/GT is all very repetitive.) Now, this is coming from someone that IS a very big fan of DBZ, and has seen all of DBGT, and the final saga is very worth it. But $20+ is NOT WORTH IT!!! Just tape it once a week.

This is the album that broke me of that habit. :-( Having been a fan (at this particular point in time) for 25 years, that's rather sad. \\"Outside\\" was one of the most disappointing albums I've ever heard. Bowie's venture into industrial metal should never have taken place. Despite the fact that 9-Inch Nails would have no career without the influence of David Bowie, the reciprocal situation does not work so well. I really only liked one track, a revamped \\"Strangers When We Meet\\" (originally recorded for \\"The Buddha of Suburbia\\" soundtrack). Even the most die-hard of Bowie fans (such as myself) might find this album not up to David's usual par."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT A SAMPLE OF OXFORD TOWN!!!","review":"I'm not into david bowie, but one of the reviews from the starship trooper page said that the song from the graduation is called \\"I have not been to oxford town\\" by dave bowie.

Outside is the best album I've ever heard... I've worn out about 5 copies of it and have to keep stocking up on Outside CD's, because they go everywhere with me. Its one of those albums that you can listen to once, smile, then listen to it again... and again and again and again... A MUST HAVE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Diehards Only","review":"As a huge Bowie fan for years, I was a bit disappointed with this one. It has some high points, most notably, \\"Heart's Filthy Lesson\\" and Mike Garson's piano work, but the rest is largely uninspiring.A futuristic romp that is a bit too Eurotech to sink one's teeth into. I do like the lyric content; definitely proving that Bowie is still the maniacal master. His prolific, chaotic lyrics/dialog are, at the same time innocent, and diabolical.Overall, the musical accompaniment seemed rather contrived to me. I love the rich textures and harmonic dissonance of past Bowie/Eno collaborations, but I wish the stream of consciousness on this effort broke into coherent song more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"gggreat.","review":"This is a good album, Bowie's best since Scary Monsters. The only bad thing is that it is a concept album and as thus it tries to make you care, even though you really don't, it has little 40 second things that carry the story by using spoken word stuff and I just skip them to get to the great songs like, Hearts Filthy Lesson (which was in the movie Seven) which is very Nine Inch Nailsish.A good album, I suggest buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Stuff","review":"The occasionally silly narrative is the only drawback to this record; I sometimes wonder what it would have sounded like without the various characters and their monologues interrupting these excellent songs. Not that the idea doesn't work: the dark, futuristic story informs the lyrics and gives the work a very creepy and urgent feel. Bowie, Eno, Gabrels and the rest of the personnel are said to have played role-playing games and engaged in various other musical experiments during the making of the record, and this sense of play and experimentation shows. Standout tracks: We Prick You, Hallo Spaceboy (which sounds brilliant nine years later on the current Reality tour), I'm Deranged, Strangers When We Meet, and I Have Not Been To Oxford Town.At least three of the songs from \\"Outside\\" were used in films; you have probably heard something from this record before, even if you don't know the work already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outside rocks","review":"This album is probably the best of Bowie's more recent albums. Many of the songs can be descibed as nothing other than incredible: for example, 'Outside', 'Thru these Architects Eyes', and the beautiful'The Motel'. Mike Garson is a genius, and really helps to make the album what it is. The whole team of musicians here create a fantastic album. The fact that the album is a work of sheer musical genius overides the annoying segues that you just skip through. Buy this album, it is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Outside is one of Bowie's most engaging and satisfying works. The sound is impenetrably dense. The best way to describe it is jazz meets industrial.The \\"storyline\\" is ambiguous, which allows (or demands) for each listener to superimpose their own meanings onto the proceedings. The experience becomes interactive, unlike listening to writers that like to tell you exactly how they're feeling and what their songs are about.Ultimately, I don't think the \\"storyline\\" is the point of this album. I think it's about situations, textures, atmospheres, moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.","review":"I can see why this wasn't a hit, but it has some legitamately moody pieces and would have to be my favorite bowie album after Station to Station just because it sounds so unreal. After this came Earthling which sucked ass, but Outside stands as a great album and I'm Deranged and Strangers When We Meet are among Bowie's best songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to listen to","review":"In general, I'm a big fan of insect noises (cicadas, crickets, etc.), and I've discovered that it's really hard to find good field recordings. So I was pretty excited about this CD, even though I'd never heard any of it; I was sure I'd love it. However... it doesn't sound at all like I expected. There is no soothing drone, no happy chirp, no peaceful hum. These insects make some impressive and intense sounds, but it's not something I enjoy hearing. At best, it sounds sort of like an AM radio that's not tuned to anything, but more often it just sounds like high, piercing shrieks of feedback. Genuinely painful, even when listened to at a reasonably quiet volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, literate, and ingenious","review":"Arnold is a great mind and should be read by anyone who wants a greater understanding of our own humanity.

On the disc were single episodes from five different animes. One of them was Genma Wars. This is quite possibly the worst anime I have ever seen. I'll admit that I've only seen one episode of the series and in most cases it's hard to make an accurate judgement based on that, but Genma Wars is in a completely awful class of it's own. The animation is terrible, the plot is so convoluted you'd think a three year old wrote it and the acting (dub, the only option available on the demo)was probably done by junior high students. With all that said, I did enjoy watching it in a Mystery Science Theatre kind of way with a friend of mine, so if you're looking for something so awful it's funny, rent Genma Wars. Otherwise spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"the fact is","review":"that this is not a Japanese amine. It's Korean. I'm a Korean and I'm not too proud of this production. But I could give you some reasons. The director of this film is one of the best comic book makers in Korea and well-respected in Japan, and this was virtually his first attempt at anime production. The project started ambitiously, and it was supposed to be backed up financially by a company with a lot of capitals, but the short-sighted company cut the budget down, and the director had to work within the given budget. I've read the original comic book that came out around 1988, and I still remember it as one of the better comic books I'd seen. Maybe if the Japanese anime production company could pick up the story and redo it, it could become much better. The story itself was great. It's just that the great storyline was not very well depicted on the screen with a lot of cuts. (It's originally over 10 comic books.) Wish it were better, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new...","review":"I am not a fan of King Crimson but I do like \\"In the court of the Crimson King\\", \\"Red\\" and \\"Discipline\\".

Somehow two guitars, two sticks (bass) and two drummers coexit in beautiful musical harmony. This has got to be one of my all time favorite King Crimson albums. Granted, Adrian Belew seems to be sheparding the tunes in his fashion, but when it ends up with great tunes like \\"Dinosaur\\" and \\"Walking On Air\\" and \\"People\\" and not to forget \\"Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream\\", how can you complain? My only complaints are not with the astounding musical offerings but with the crazy title \\"THRAK\\"? and the boring cover art. I would have preferred a cartoon like cover art from P.J. Crook as many of the live KC albums have received. Heck, Dinosaur would have made a proper name for this CD. This is a more accessable King Crimson than most of their other albums but it still offers the heavey guitar crunching that all Crimsonites have learned to love. Highly recommended. - Ciao"},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic is gone","review":"This latest incarnation of King Crimson is basically a variation on the Adrian Belew era ensemble that produced three masterful albums: Discipline, Beat, and Three of a Perfect Pair. Unfortunately, the songwriting on Thrak sounds rehashed and uninspired. I'm glad Adrian Belew has been rescued from doing Budweiser commercials, but I'm afraid it's too late.

This flat band measures 4\\" across in width which is the same as other bands.

Two of the last three songs \\"Southern Breeze\\" and especially \\"405\\" are outstanding instrumentals that alone warrant buying the CD. Isaac Hayes stays true to his roots, but does a great job of blending in other styles that should please both his longtime fans and smooth jazz fans who don't mind in little funk in their latees. Excellent \\"road trip\\" CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating funk and jazz","review":"Like the man himself, 'Raw and Refined' is at once tough, gritty, soulful and ever so smooth. I have alot of memories tied up with this album (purchased whilst living in America for a year in '96) and whenever I play this it calls back memories of late-night carousing, dalliances and excursions around the USA. Like Isaac Hayes' legendary album 'Shaft', this too serves as a good soundtrack for the more adventurous side of you. Interestingly, while the sturdy funk workouts here are prototype Isaac Hayes, he really excells on more breezier, laid-back jazz oriented material such as the delicious 'Tahoe Spring' or the 'Night Before'. 'Southern Breeze' and 'The 405' are also tremendously evocative pieces of work. 'Raw and Refined' eclipses anything of Hayes' 80's output and continues to show the flexibility and evolvement of this soul icon. Would love to hear more like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best!","review":"To be honest, this album was not enjoyed at all. My favourite type of music is raw, driving funk. I know Issac isn't known for funk but he has had an influence on it and vice versa. I thought the songs on this album were weak. It made me realize just how much of a role his voice plays in his music. The song The Birth of Shaft had high expectations due to the name but ended up being a rock influenced song with a repeated annoying riff. None of these songs pulled the album up after that and the synth use caused some of the songs to border on cheese.

The Grey Lady soon realizes that she has a stalker after he attemps to loot her strawberries.This begins the game of hide-and-go-seek that really makes the books fun. The Grey Lady easily wins the \\"game\\" and the Snatcher is left alone. And what do stalkers do when they are alone? They develop new things to love. In the Strawberry Snatchers case, the new obbsession is none other than blackberries.If you think about it The \\"Snatcher\\" isn't such a BAD, bad guy(or E.T. hopeful) he's just out looking for strawberries to steal and eat, while working an that foot fungus. Notice the mushrooms growing after each step he takes on the sidewalk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave me bad dreams","review":"I vividly remember looking at this book in the school library(back in 1987)and had several nights of bad dreams afterwards. It isn't necessarily scary for most people, but for a child who has not been exposed to sinister images it may be quite creepy. I was raised in a home without television, thus I had very little exposure to scary images as a young child. If the child or children you are considering this book for are uncomfortable with creepy stories, then I would recommend passing on this one for now. Many of Molly Bangs' other books are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book scared ny 3-year-old","review":"When we read it, he seemed okay, but twenty minutes after lights out, we heard him crying. My husband went in to see what was wrong, and little Tommy said, \\"Daddy, the strawberry book is scary. Put it in jail.\\" Jail is a big plastic bag in my room where we put scary books, videos, and action figures so they can't hurt us. Now, I'm not saying everyone's kid will be scared by this book. But if your child is easily frightened by \\"mean guys\\", as mine sometimes is, you might want to give this book a second thought before purchasing it. At the very least, check it out from your local library first to see whether it passes the scare test for your kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"baffled by 5 star ratings","review":"i found this to be a truly creepy children's book. i wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 5 years old. it is visually very unappealing. i'd return it for a refund but the shipping would probably cost me more than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"angela's review of grey lady and strawberry snatcher","review":"This book was a great picture bok but it would be better if it had words for a story in it.

As I \\"read\\" the book to my daughter the first time, I thought that it was too scary for a 2 year old and worried how I would explain what the strawberry snatcher was doing or what was happening in the eerie-looking swamp.

But since I had it, I decided to let my kiddos look at it and see if they liked it. They Did!!My three year old, who wants to read, had no problem 'reading' this story and finding out all sorts of interesting aspects to the pictures as he read the book.My son has bullied his little sister into helping him act out this little book. He has 'read' it to me many times over. He has enjoyed this book and so has my daughter.I rated it a four because, as I said, I found the pictures just a bit creepy when we first got the book. But it is well enjoyed by children, so I'd certainly buy it again.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"All three of my kids love this book!","review":"This wordless book is beautifully illustrated and really draws the \\"reader\\" into the story. It is so full of fun details that we feel we are discovering something new each time we look at it. My two year old insists on reading this book at least once a day and it holds the interest of my 5 and 8 year olds as well. The loving and unique family in the story is our favorite part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine art","review":"I am a children's librarian, and I consider this to be perhaps the most visually stunning book I've seen. It is a worldess picture book whose originals were painted on grey construction paper, as Bang makes virtuoso use of positive and negative space. Details and memorable images abound. Parents will want to go through this with younger children, who will appreciate the sharing experience of discussing the plot, motives, and details - indeed, they will find it richly rewarding in this way. Older children can enjoy it on their own - as can adults, frankly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant -- as usual","review":"There isn't much to not like about a Dears album. Except that they all tend to sound the same. That isn't to say they're not all great, but there's no significant evolution -- at least none that I can hear -- from album to album. This isn't a bad thing but, considering the numerous changes in personel over the last ten years, it is rather odd.Gang of Losers is no exception: some great songs, some okay songs. If you liked the other albums, you'll like this one -- probably just as much.I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earnest, Thoughtful","review":"It's no wonder the British are so keen on The Dears. The lead singer sounds alot like Damon Albarn (of Blur). That's who I thought this was the first time I heard them. After seeing them on Letterman last night, I knew I had to get this CD. They are a multiracial and multigender band that rocks nevertheless.If you like earnest, thoughtful lyrics (sung by a singer who can actually sing) combined with memorable melodies, these are The Dears.

Its a long commute (2 hours each way) and by the time I get home, I'm too tired to practice anything but dinner and bed. The conductors frown on people playing acoustic instruments on the train, so I bought this adapter and a cheap used electric guitar so that I could play on the train and listen through my headphones. Out of the box, with default settings, there is a little latency. But that can be adjusted down to virtually zero discernible latency (on my HP laptop). The bundled software from Native Instruments is basically trialware. The key that came in the package did not work for any version of the virtual amp software. But Native Instruments made good with a valid key after I told them which version I wanted to activate (AC-Box). The Native Instruments software includes a plug-in for virtual mixers as well (I use n-Track Studio, and highly recommend it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing - especially the software","review":"The hardware does what it is supposed to 5 out of 5.The software is appalling 0 out of 5.After some google searches I found various free demo software packages that allowed me to use the device to record on my computer - took me a couple of weeks of googling and reading various forums to understand what I was doing and feel comfortable.

Just to make sure I hooked it up to my desktop i7 2600k to see if that made a difference and it did not.It seems some folks love this thing but I don't know how.I did not check to see the latency if I were only recording so I suppose it could be ok for that.

Only part of the book covers actual game design and it doesn't go into much depth; I don't remember reading anything I didn't already know. Game design is a combination of creativity, user psychology and fundamental mechanics but this book seems to treat it almost as if it were a branch of programming that an engineer could pick up with a little extra study. If you want to understand games, study them -dissect what makes some fun and others not. If you want a book that gives an interesting perspective into game design, get Rules of Play."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, a must for new game designers.","review":"This book should be on the shelf of every game developer and designer. It's a relatively complete guide to the development/design process of a video game and will give excellent insight into the techniques and approaches used by the professionals of the field. It covers a lot of topics so it ends up not being (nor pretending to be) a specialized \\"textbook\\", but it is a very high quality overview of the creative phase with many great tips and guides. Placing an example game design document at the end of the book was a classy and very appreciated decision :)If you're interested in game design or game development in general, please, do buy this book. If you're interested in a specific area of development, such as general coding, buy game programming gems or game programming graphics gems if you're into gfx. If you're looking for a hardcore game programming guide, this is not what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred Spirits","review":"I love this cd.

The first half of the book sets up the protagonist's betrayal by his fellow criminals; when he miraculously comes into a large fortune, we are prepared for a \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\" style masquerade and ingenious trap-the-trappers finale. Alas, as soon as our hero shows up (disguised) in his old haunts, inquiring about his previous persona, the villains panic and kill each other off without even a last word or a shock-recognition-regret scene. A lot of careful scene setting and plotting goes totally to waste by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"or 1.5 star for lil or no horror","review":"lax enough monsta action; the jeannie ghost, the girl monsta & brief unknown thing was barely ok. lousy, retarted collection; not exciting enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not worth buying","review":"This is just one of those dvd's you wouldn't mind renting for family night with the kids.

It's as bad as a couple of others have said. These are silly GHOST stories ones parents must have told their kids LONG ago. You will NEVER be scared, which is why I don't consider it J-Horror. Even as silly ghost stories this anthology is terrible. The make-up is pathetic and I guess what passes for special effects are laughable, as is the acting. If you really want to get into Asian Horror (because Korea and now China are making some good films). I suggest \\"A Tale Of Two Sisters\\" or \\"Whispering Corridors\\" to start with because they are more than just horror, they are good movies with great stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP THIS THIS IS NOT J-HORROR","review":"Oh man, this is really (...)!!!I rent this DVD,I REALLY, REALLY glad, I rented it didn't buy this Crap!

The plot had lovable caractors, great animation, perfict music to make the mood. I just love it. I love fighting anime as much as the next person. Yu Yu Hakusho was a thrill, yet this just hits the funny bone the right way. In the last three episodes I cried. I felt like jumping into the TV and hugging Kyo Yuki and Tohru.

He was genuinely interested in the wellbeing of this exploited class of people and cared more for their trust than he did in getting the so-called \\"scoop.\\" His photography reflects this, and his legacy is well represented in his students, many of whom went on to photograph the Great Depression (a topic this film also touches upon).This is a film that every student of American history should see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken right out of the box","review":"Bought from another online retailer.

However, with a topic as important in our nation's heritage as slavery and the Civil War I would have hoped that more truths would have been involved in this book. Undoubtedly it would not have been a typical light romance like the Sunfire books are, but to belittle the time period by putting these characters in such made up situations ruined the sweet romance that this book attempted to attain.I collect the Sunfire books and love to re-read them on rainy days. I can honestly say that reading \\"Corey\\" once was enough for me and I will stick to reading the other books in the series when I feel like getting cozy next to the fire on those rainy days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have heard it works but BEWARE of the ingredients - Formaldehyde","review":"Formaldehyde is in most nail polishes but it doesn't mean you should ignore it's danger.

Charlie Terrel is the finest musician that I have heard the last 5 years. The music is fresh, the lyrics are unique, the sound and production is superb. The unfortunate thing is that most of his albums are no longer available as his Record Label has not promoted/backed him. I urge you to try and get your hands on any of his 3 albumns.

The children dancing are excellent and I really liked their choise of songs. However I expected this to be somewhat instructional and that is not the case. They do not show the audience how to do any of the dances and at times the camera is not focused on their feet making it impossible to follow. But overall it is very entertaining. Just don't expect to be able to follow what they do. Songs include Mexican Hat Dance, Charleston, The Yellow Rose of Texas (line dance) and other old favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Yr Old Loves It","review":"My three year old girl loves this video.

Uhmm, aaahh, ok. What about those Red Sox? As for this movie, well, aahh, gee, uhmmm, aaahh I watched as much as I could and tried to think of any saving grace to recommend it. I could only come up with one and that is I found out how the dream tape in The Ring was made. The rest of the movie, if you can stomach it, is a very disturbed student film. I tried to visualize the interpretations that the other reviewers got out of this movie and either it is too deep for me or it is like Picasso, who I've always felt was putting people on and making a living by it. If you do decide to watch it, and there are at least 10,000 movies I would recommend before you do, don't watch it while you are eating."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is far too generous!","review":"As a fan of alternative and surrealist cinema, I eagerly searched for a copy of this film after reading the glowing reviews fellow \\"art-house junkies\\" were giving it. After finally finding a copy at a local video store I almost asked for my rental fee back! Sure, this film is art, if your idea of art is 45 minutes of blurry, hooded figures dragging an epileptic Christ-figure across a barren landscape in slow motion! The first 10 minutes are interesting, if not mildly stomach churning (not necessarily a drawback), but after that the film becomes redundant and dull. I was bitterly disappointed, as were the three other art-movie fanatics I had invited over to watch it. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

I like finding movies off the beaten path, but don't believe this is so far off the beaten path, please....really it tries too hard to offend and mystify, succeeding in neither. It is a laughable movie....a pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-controversial, avant-garde parody dragging a body and saying nothing.

Yeah, so they made a movie. This thing plays out like a Bauhaus video that wont end. If it was, say, 20 minutes it would be good. It has some creepy imagery, but it goes on WAY TOO LONG.

I guess it's a great, stunning visual experience, but then what do I know...really?. I think I had to take dramamine when watching this so as not to vomit as a result of the hard to watch visuals. I honestly don't know how anyone in a correct state of mind can discern how a God is born in this film. If the artsy fartsy folks hadn't read the box I think that they would think what I thought...Ahhhhh I'm thinking in black and white and it's all blurry...where are my glasses? Oh no something like a shakey little wierdo is being drug around in the dirt by the Jawa's from StarWars. Anyway I better go watch some Evil Dead in order to cleanse myself of this...whatever it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily The Worst...","review":"No other film even comes close. When my friends and I want to hurt each other we rent this movie. This movie really deserves less than one star. It must be The Only Perfect Gift for masochists and sadists alike. Noone could watch this whole film without whiskey. I almost gave up black and white movies forever after viewing this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incomprehensible","review":"This movie deserves either one star or five, so I've given it five. It's not as offensive as others have said because the images are so difficult to discern that one's imagination is forced to fill in the details. If gore and offal are what's desired, the viewer would be more satisfied with one of dozens of low-budget splatter flicks. Perhaps 'Begotten' shouldn't be considered a film at all, but a series of black-and-white art photographs arranged in a semi-random order. The picture on the cover is about as clear as they get. It has a plot and a story, but without the notes that are provided I doubt anybody could know what they are. I enjoy the movie for its extreme artfulness (artful in the sense of being a product of labor), but I haven't been able to watch the entire thing in one sitting. One must be in a certain sort of mood (chemically induced or not) for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Disturbing!","review":"Reviewer: cur from Seattle This cult classic is hard to describe, but if you are in to pure unadulterated disturbances, you will like this film. almost silent, but the souds you do hear only add to a black and white parody of death and redemption, like osiris, but in a darker surreal depiction. I have to date not been able to view the film from start to finish without having to take a break. Definitely a worthy collectors item but not a film you would want your 12 year old to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"It's midly interesting, but way too long to have to watch the grainy black-and-white ultra-high contrast image. In the extra features, it is discussed how it took HOURS to achieve this effect; hours that could have been better spent. It's not nearly as esoteric or surrealistic as it purports to be; and certainly not enough to warrant the price it's going for."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 MAJOR FLAWS BUT WELL WORTH A LOOK","review":"it's all been said really. an excellent experiment in cinema. very abstract. you shouldn't necessarily try to find reason or order where there is none, so in watching this you can make up your own story. much like some of david lynch's work. i would emphasize that the latter portion of the film drags ass. it could have been cut here n there but that's just my opinion. and also if the score had recieved half the attention the images did, this movie would be a ten star rating in my book. either way, if you have a curious eye and interest in surreal/exprimental art, then you should own begotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been....uhh...","review":"Maybe it could've been a good short film. If you don't like grainy, deliberate \\"art\\" films, don't even bother. If you do, you will still probably find this \\"film\\" overlong and tedious. It had an interesting style and a pretty good opening, but absolutely dies after 5 minutes! Oh well.

Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rorschach on film","review":"The \\"Begotten\\" (1991) is directed by E.Elias Merhige (Shadow of the Vampire). It is something that I imagine Rorschach would have made if he had directed movies. This film is image after image of high contrast depictions that read like solarized images, negative images, that seem to flip back and forth, becoming almost like an ink blot where the imagination begins to take over. Influenced by early black and white films like \\"Nosferatu\\" it refers to the dark side of imagination.

No other film has ever done that to me. It's left a mark that will never go away. After watching it, I was afraid to touch the video tape. Afraid of it's evil. It leaves you with a feeling of pure hate. Hate for a society that can spawn beings who could make such a film. Love it or hate it, your feelings will be very strong. I loved it for making me hate it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was extremely slow and rather boring...","review":"I was told by a few people this movie was shocking, disturbing and a work of art. Art is subjective so...eh...figured I would give it a try. I understand it uses symbolism from the Bible and is about creation...but geez...the movie is slow and boring. Also, it is black and white and has a grainy look to it so at times it is difficult to see what is going on. The first 10 minutes of the movie had a house which came closer and closer and once inside the viewer was shown Christ disembowling himself with a razor. Then a woman appears and helps herself to some body fluids and becomes pregnant. The rest of the film has people toting (very slowly...a snail moves faster than this movie does) all over the place. I guess I have been desensitivized by other films but....unless you want to watch black and white grainy gore which brings on creation I would pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"You MUST watch it TWICE to full understand or appreciate...","review":"...or else it's going to completely go over your head. Any written description of the plot WILL NOT prepare you for watching this film. Provided you're not completely disgusted after the first five to ten minutes, you find yourself completely absorbed for the rest of this quivering, shadow-filled story. I wouldn't romanticize it by focusing on it's religious imagery alone, ie. the Creation, the immaculate conception, Christ's crucifixion, Goddess-worship, etc., simply because this is a stark and brutal interpretation of those themes. I can't say that I loved it either, (ie. it gave me a warm-fuzzy feeling, and so on) because it is difficult to watch, but it's one of the most unforgettable viewing experiences of my life. Its comparisons to Lynch's \\"Eraserhead\\" are justified, except that \\"Begotten\\" is not half as surrealistic. And watch it alone--it's dark, morbid tone will make your company leave the room, trust me!

This was also filled with lot's of love.

Of course the ending was happy, and of course it's just the first book in a series of however many, but I feel like I shouldn't even bother reading the rest of them.

Even given the brief attention span of a reader of modern fiction, the lack of continuity, excessive use of jump-cuts, and economy of presentation leave the reader searching in vain for the central theme. Still, the basic rawness of its poetic passages has a visceral attraction and a primitive strength.

When first published in 1916 this book may have been excellent for young children but seems to be out of place and out of date for todays child. In a world where children are teased and exposed to violence this book teaches nothing but contempt. The first story talks of sheep murdered and their tails hung to dry then burried. More on laziness and the fact that being different is bad. Illustrations are poor. Many popular short tails left out. Really not what I expected from Scholastic. No morals teaching stories or modernized grammar like other books. I havn't seen de-moralizing stories since Dumbo and Rudolph the red nosed reindeer. There are better books out there.

I had this exact book when I was little, and my mother brought the old copy to me cause she thought my daughter might like to have it. I don't think I'm going to bother giving it to her. I was frightened by this book when I was little. Mother Goose looks more like a wicked witch, stealing a baby, on the cover. There are tons of nursery rhymes, but most of them are very obscure, some only a couple lines long. And maybe I am reading too much into them, but a lot of them seem full of sexual innuendo and possible drug references. One titled \\"Robin and Richard\\" seems the most questionable, about two grown men staying in bed until 10 o'clock. I'm not prejudiced at all, but this seems like a very strange rhyme for children to be reading. Everything about this book is disturbing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Values You Want to Teach Today","review":"I thoroughly agree with the person who said that this was not for today's child. With all that is going on in today's society, with increasing violence among our children, this version of Mother Goose does little to teach children tolerance. When I bought this book, I was expecting cute and innocent children's rhymes. I do not remember reading as a child Mother Goose rhymes that were so gory. Now, in all fairness, not all the rhymes are like that, however, you have to flip through the pages to read those that are more tame.

Superunknown, Down on the upside, Bad Motor Finger all have the same feel yet they have their distinct sounds. you can really see where the band was going over the course of these albums. this album is not terrible it's just that the songs lack individuality and technical skill that the band would demonstrate on later albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECTAS CONDICIONES!","review":"MUCHAS GRACIAS EL DISCO LLEGO EN PERFECTAS CONDICIONES Y MUY RAPIDO A MI CASA EN ARGENTINA!!

The characters are all well written and all of them come across rather well due to a good balance of strengths and weakness. It is true that it is hard to remeber who some characters are due to the large number of them combined with names that can seem very familer. Also some of the characters pop in with little or no introduction. It does help to have read the other two that came out before. Still it is fast paced where it should be(battles) well it takes it time when it should (court politics). Towards the end the book starts to fall apart because it seems to disagree with the Unicorn.

It is a concert strung together with glimpses of a tyranical father and scenes with a controlling boyfriend. After 30 minutes of having these scenes repeated, we have got the idea.

There is one event only, after 85 minutes of film, in which she finally sees what the audience has seen ages ago: that her boyfriend is like her father. She sings for a record company and then--bang--another concert as a star.As a movie, this has to rate two stars.For Dolly fans and for people who like rockabilly, this will be worth the price.So, know what you're getting and be sure what you want.

Episode 44's subtitles for the Japanese dub are incorrectly coded with episode 45's subtitles. While it is possible to play the subtitles for the English dub, as noted above, it IS NOT THE SAME.

I have bought 3 copies and have given 2 away as gifts to my fitness-savvy friends. The book is extremely useful, whether you're trying to lose weight or gain, or whether you're sedentary or athletic, although it's targeted to athletes - even to extreme athletes. It explains in scientific, but in VERY easy-to-understand language WHY you should consume a certain amount of carbs, protein, fats, etc, rather than just telling you in a more dictatorial way that you SHOULD do it. It explains metabolism, nutrient breakdown, meal timing, and more. Even as a personal trainer, I have found it to be a very useful tool on top of what I already know, because it makes it easy to explain to clients or friends why they should eat grains, at what times sugar can be ok, when to take your pre-workout meal and why, and much more.

How can a non-bodybuilder tell a bodybuilder how to get results? She lacks the practical knowledge that comes with competitive experience. The only helpful section I found was for caloric requirements for each periodization phase. Too little emphasis on protein, way too much emphasis on carbs, and the references for the research needed to be footnoted more clearly.

If you eat more then you need you will store it as fat. Doh!Then this fool pushes some really bad bio chem, you need carbo to build muscle. More fantasy. If you want to gain muscle mass, you must eat amino acids aka protein. Of course you also need to exercise - and for that you need an adequate blood sugar level.

I like the fact that most of the information provided is based on scientific research and evidence. Some of the reviewers are correct when they explain that the book is brutal in terms of understanding some of the biology involved. However, it doesn't expect you to understand that we breath oxygen to gather electrons exiting the electron transport chain through oxidative phosphorylation. If you don't quite understand something, google it! What's wrong with enhancing your brain while enhancing your body? Spend a little extra time on adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The only gripe I really have is about Amazon. When I removed the book from the dry packaging I noticed that the first one-hundred pages were wet.

If you are a strength trainer, athlete, or involved in any serious workout/sports, I recommend Dr. Michael Colgan's \\"Optimum Sports Nutrition\\" which is by far a better book (maybe even the best book) in giving comprehensive and scientifically proved ways to enhance yourself.

I generally like Richard Simmons (or at least tolerate him), but this routine was lame-o. The moves themselves are easy enough, but probably geared more for the over 50 set (not an insult). Simmons is all over the place with the choreography and seems to be making it up as he goes along. There is no warning for step changes - he just does his own thing and expects you to read his mind.

Richard was just All Over The Place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this video because of the music, which was good. However, the actual workout was not. Richard does his own thing without cueing anyone else. He would go from grapevine to kneelifts to whatever without any warning, making it very hard to keep up.

I ordered the \\"Disco Sweat\\" DVD immediately. The DVD was not love at first sight.... it was more of a work out than what we were use to. But, after a week of doing the dance routines, we found it easier to go through it without begging Richard to \\"stop!!\\" I have not done the floor exercises after the dance routines yet.

But, he is so adorable, it is a good workout, so it is a good addition to my workout library. The reason I gave it four stars instead of 5, is at the end of the workout, there is a crunch segment. I have a slight neck problem so crunches are out with me, and if the description had shown crunches, I might not have bought it.

I workout six days a week, sometimes twice a day, so I am really used to exercise, and because of that this wasn't terribly physically challenging. However, I love the fact that it is easy on your joints (the one common fault of American programmes, I find - apart from po-facedness - is being too hard on the knees) and it is a hoot to do and you *are* constantly moving.

Simmons doesn't tell what moves he's going to make, and only repeats them 2-3 times, so I was always playing catchup. Meanwhile, he sings over the background music, ruining the one redeeming value! The bizarre cinematography is often focused on one person's face, or knee, etc., so that the exercise isn't visible at all.

It moves too fast from movement to movement so you are always behind. There are too many closeups where you can't even see what they are doing. It would help if Richard counted for you, but he does this in only a few places. It would probably be a good workout-if I could do it.

My son told me to turn it off after 2 minutes of viewing it and he's only 2.5 yrs old. It is poor in quality in addition to it being so lame. DO NOT BUY"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This album, along with Double Nickels by the Minutemen, and all albums by the Replacements changed how I listened to, and appreciated music. J. Mascis is an incredibly unique guitar player. There is no one on earth similiar to him in style and grace. I hope that on the other side his solos roar on for eons."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fist Dino album.","review":"Being 13 years old, I missed all the my favorite bands when they were in their prime (Sonic Youth, Polvo, Pavement etc etc), which is upsetting at times but at least I can get these sweet reissues.I read about DJ from the coolest record reviewer,Mark Prindle [...] I liked what he had to say and looked furiously for these records. Well, it just happened to be the day that I went to the record store, that these things came out. I had to beg some guy to let me buy it, but I got it!All the songs are fantastic. Let It Ride has to be the best song on here, in my opinion. The Post is one of the greatest noise songs ever. J is a guitar genious.I highly recommend this and I'm waiting patiently for the reunited Dino to come down to Florida so I can finally see a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more do you want?","review":"This album changed my entire view of music. Most alternative (meaning anything not hair-metal or classic rock) seemed like ugly noise to me back in the late 80's. Then I heard this. What the hell is he doing half-way through 'No Bones'? It is the most raucous, sickening, beautiful thing I've ever heard. I was never the same--thankfully--again. Most would argue that Green Mind is their best. If you like slaved over, polished pop singles then Green Mind is their best. But if you have any sense of the wants, the needs, the lust and loss involved in the human condition, Bug is gonna getcha. Despite length and number of songs, Bug is a better value than any box set. If you want some good sound, check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Fiction.","review":"The title says it all.It is pure fiction, and anyone who believes that this book is anything other than pure fiction is delusional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did'nt like it","review":"I like devin the dude,but i wasnt feeling this album.The beats are bland.The lyrics are hilarious though.If you like sex filled weed smoking rhymes this albums for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is an all out classic album. Southern funk meets 94 era hip hop flavor. Its like if Tribe Called Quest were funny dudes from Texas that liked smoking weed and drinking. I can't recommend this album enough. If you like hip hop period, you need to own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice stuff","review":"This CD was my introduction to Boccherini. The only things I had heard were a couple of his more famous movements on collection CDs. This is a very enjoyable listen. And what some other reviewers have said is true: Boccherini seems much less self-absorbed than other composers; he doesn't seem to be writing to impress anybody, but just for the enjoyment of the music. This music has an innocence and creativity that is refreshing. It is also well-performed on this CD. I've never heard any other versions of this particular music to compare it to, but I've heard enough performances of music from this period to know that these musicians are very relaxed, and putting a good deal of themselves into it. Well worth looking into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with the book. While the subject of Maya's donation was slightly covered, the author spent the majority of the book describing her various problems with relationships from her family of origin through her various husbands and boyfriends and the guilt she felt in her parenting of both Maya and Maya's younger half-sister. Her treatment of donation was sparse at best, focusing more on her own less-than-comfortable relationship with one of the recipients and her various speaking engagements. As the parent of a child who was also, at the age of 17 a donor, I found myself saddened that more attention wasn't paid to Maya's story and legacy and less to the writer's need to describe her conversations with her therapist. A wonderful opportunity to educate and encourage others about the gifts of donation - for both donor families and donor recipients - was missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"A friend of mine told me about this book - I probably wouldn't have picked it up on my own, I'm more inclined toward the \\"Master and Commander\\" approach - and I loved it. It's a thoughtful, moving, un-put-downable memoir that says a lot about parenthood and the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maya was my Cousin","review":"My Aunt Ellie sent me a copy of the book when it was finished, that was April of 2004. I finally finished just yesterday July 12th,2005. I never anticipated that it would describe in detail the harrowing wait in that hospital for those 4 days that we all endured. I had to put the book down for the year to regain the strength to read on.Being extremely close with Maya and having her be a huge part of my childhood, I thought there would be more about Maya's life as part of \\"Dan's\\" family. \\"Dan\\" is my Uncle, Maya's step-father and Maya was as connected to us as an actual blood relative of our family.Although this is much more of a biography rather then letting people really grasp who Maya was, it is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Essential Recording?","review":"Well, maybe it's essential if you want to complete your Husker Du collection. In that case, I'd recommend buying it last. But, if you're new to this band, there are much better places to start. The performances are energetic but sloppy and the end result is a record that sounds like what most hardcore bands were doing at the time. That is to say, stupidly fast song tempos, lack of melody and structure, and \\"angry young man\\" shouting. Top it all off with bad bootleg-quality sound and you have \\"Land Speed Record\\".For a great live H.D. album, check out \\"The Living End\\", which was recorded on the \\"Warehouse\\" tour (regretably, their last). The boys had thankfully abandoned hardcore by then, but there's no shortage of passion, energy and volume, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"unlistable generic angstcore","review":"this is not worth owning. i love husker du, bob mould, grant hart, sugar, etc., but this is just no fun. as an aesthetic go for broke, speed-ridden mass of noise, its great. otherwise, if you care about anything else about music (ie melody, lyrics, harmony, production) go elsewhere. great cover though, and data control IS a good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mess","review":"Husker du are legend. Zen Arcade, New Day Rising and Candy Apple Grey are classics. What we have here in Land Speed record is a mess. Aside from the very excellent cover this LP has few redeeming qualities other than a document of the beginnings of one of the greatest rock bands of the 80's. Buy for curiositys sake only, otherwise pick up Zen Arcade metal Circus or any other Husker Du release for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this album with all my heart","review":"I love husker du.... this album is not. The guitar isdrowded out, bob's screams suck and out of sync, singingsucks, sound quality sucks. The music isn't discernable.Its really sloppy,even for husker du. What is up the two track thing? OK unique, but still... you either have to wait or forward till you think is the next song. For a better mini album, go to metal circus. and this album:26 minutes, not good. (...). Not enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"For serious fans only","review":"A series of lightning-fast hardcore punk tunes recorded live with mediocre sound quality. The songs have not aged well, especially political numbers like \\"MIC\\". If you want an introduction to the early punk-based sound of Husker Du, check out \\"Everything Falls Apart and More\\" before buying this one. You have to really love the band to get anything out of this record.The CD mastering is also strange. Rather than assign a separate track for each song, the CD has just two tracks that correspond to sides 1 and 2 of the original vinyl release. Yet another high-quality SST Records product."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUSKER DU as in DO buy this","review":"This is a must-have for any Husker Du fan and a fan of hardcore. People who do not like this album are people who do not like hardcore. Husker Du was hardcore, get over it, like it, enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This adapter fits snugly and does the job, even when chained with another adapter to hook up my trailer. Good product that gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is NOT center pin brake!","review":"Both the part itself (printed on body) and the box say \\"center pin AUX/BAT\\". This is very frustrating because this was after I was originally sent another part number (the wrong part since I order this one) which also stated it was Aux/Bat on the body. So my rating of this product is on the basis of having the wrong pin configuration. If you actually wanted a center pin Aux/Bat then the product will likely work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before there was Oni, there was Miku","review":"What do you get when you put four pretty girls in mech suits and send them into a glamorous world of tag team wrestling? A sport to gain a huge following in Earth's fictional future; and some great fight scenes to mix in with the sweet story and spunky laughs. Not quite the caliber of Ranma 1/2, but if you like that series, you'll probably enjoy this one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"????","review":"This is a good anime. I fell in love with it, but the appeal is somewhat limited. It's about a girl named Miku who wants to become a great Neo Pro wrestling star and joins three others and a drunk for a coach. This one is actually very good, as Miku has to look hard within herself to find out how to beat Sapphire, with two secrets being revealed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"seag kept it real","review":"I AM FROM THE O SO MY COMMENTS MAY SEEM BIAS, HOWEVER, SEAG KEPT IT REAL.

It knocks this one flat on its behind and urinates all over it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Elliot","review":"I have always enjoyed Elliot's books, but was unaware of this one until a friend recommended it now that it is back in print. This is a great chronicle of Elizabeth's early years, almost a coming of age on the mission field. She shares the significant things she learned along the way and how she grew in her understanding of God in dealing with life's unexpected trials. A wonderful book for high school/college women."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This book only tells of the hardships related to being a missionary in Ecuador. Very little scripture references or scripture related verses are included in the stories. I just felt that it lacked content and adhesiveness. Something is missing in the structure. The book is not what I thought it would be. Sorry, but I didn't get enough information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless reminder that God works through people, His way.","review":"Out of print for many years, \\"These Strange Ashes\\" now returns as a classic of Christian missions. Written by an author better known for books about her husband Jim Elliot's well-publicized martyrdom in the 1950's, this book reviews Elisabeth's earlier mission work as a single woman deep in the South American jungle. Far from a rosy or simple story, Elliot honestly shares her struggles, frustrations and confusion when God acted contrary to the way she thought He ought. This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who deeply cares about Christian missions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC FROM THE OUT-OF-PRINT ARCHIVES","review":"This book is awesome!In it Elizabeth shares the details of her first missionary trip.I have the original version which was a hardback published a long time ago.This is a great book for anyone who would like or might take a mission trip.Elliot paints a picture with class using her gift with words found on the pages of her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"As if you were there in the jungle yourself","review":"Live the thoughts, eyes and ears of these courageous women, whose lifes bear the scent of a totally dedicated hearts sensitive to Gods call while living in a remote jungle in Ecuador and their tales will open your mind to their beauty of character and lives set as a flint for God"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest encouragement from a wise pilgrim","review":"I have so appreciated the life and writings of Elizabeth Elliott through the years - but never managed to get to this book. It is an honest story of her first year as a young single woman missionary in south America, and the string of events/struggles/griefs she endured that year. In the midst of her difficulties - God was faithful and guided her into a deep understanding of God's sovereignty. This is a great book for those who savor memoirs from modern day disciples of Christ as well as if you are in a season of struggle, pain and confusion. Elliott's words give the reader a fuller understanding of God's steady, reliable character in the midst of sorrow, doubt and adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"an accidental gem...","review":"I have bought the Vinyl LP of the album and found that it was one of my personal favourite. I love the track \\"look at the sun\\" and \\"Now She's Gone\\". The production of this blues outfit was clean and the arrangement was quite fresh, especially \\"look at the sun\\". The rest of the album is somehow boring (especially the last cut, which was a little bit cheesy) but overally speaking it's quite a surprise to listen to the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitals only","review":"Frommer's does a good job with the general hints on travelling cheaper, but unless you plan on visiting only the major cities and capitals only, look for another book. There are 24 major cities and surrounding areas covered from Ireland to Budapest, but that's not many cities in comparison with all of Europe. I only will have a short time in Europe and that means that I will only be able to visit two of the cities listed and have to use another book for everything in between. Lonely Planet is much more inclusive and definitely covers the lower price scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful using the advice with this book","review":"I have had mixed results with Frommer's books. I like their maps and guides to attractions... BUT... The hotels they recommend in the lower end category often fall short. I especially did not like their recommendations for Rome.The book has a great layout but the hotels need to be rechecked. I would make sure to balance this book with another guide like Karen Brown's or Fodor's... I make sure any hotel I stay in has a good rating in at least two sources...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treats for the fans!","review":"I really like this cartoon series since I'm a fan of the view askew universe and it's good humor. It's a two disc uncencsored set containing all 6 episodes (only six since the network kicked the series off instantly and the time slot was very awkward for an animated series to be played on television) and a funny intro by Jay and Silent Bob for each episode. Pretty Cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty funny stuff","review":"If you like Kevin Smith, you'd probably do well to watch the short lived animated version of the first film.It's kind of like Kevin just felt he could do anything that he wanted to, and several hollywood celebrities jumped at the chance to be in it. I really liked some of the stuff that he did, the trial, the Outbreak episode. I wondered why ABC bought the series, but it was pretty obvious why the stodgy old network would dump the series. I just wish that it would've been on a hipper network when it was on, so maybe would've gone on longer than 6 episodes, or the 2 episodes that aired.See how many celebrities you can guess, including Alec Baldwin, and Judge Reinhold. Can you guess which basketball celebrity makes a very minor contribution? loads of fun for the whole family, and not too dirty for the elderly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Smith can do no wrong","review":"I was completely amazed that this show was cancelled after only 2 episodes. I have been a fan of Kevin Smith since Clerks (The Movie) came out. He put a fresh spin on a very tired movie scene. I guess the only positive thing to come out of the cancellation of the show is this DVD set. We might not have seen this release had the show been allowed to air in it's entirety. In a nut shell this is the continueing adventures of Dante, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob. If you liked Clerks the movie, you will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly reccomended DVD for Kevin Smith Fans","review":"This is an excellent DVD. After missing the original run of the episodes on ABC, I finally got to watch them and on DVD it is better. Kevin Smith's writing is excellent. He didn't try to tell the Clerks movie all over but showed the other mis-adventures of Dante, Randall, Jay and Slient Bob. Speaking of which introduce the episodes which makes for a better watching experience. The commentary is excellent and bonus materials are great as well. Looking very forward to Kevin's future projects, this DVD will help buffer that period."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best !","review":"like every Kevin smith movie. it's good - but when it comes to animation it's even better, with no limites, it can't be better. just sit and laugh with all your heart"},{"rating":"2","title":"A show that had wings, but no wind to help it.","review":"This show is by far one of the best animated ones I've seen. It was original, had cool animation, and writing by none other than Kevin Smith.Don't expect to watch a sequel to the Clerks movie. There is no swearing, even though they tried to slip a sex joke here and there. But the core of the original film is there. The characters, the quick dialogue and, of course, the laughs.I just watched the entire DVD and I must say that it makes you mad to think that you could be watching this show every week, but can't because ABC canceled it. I hope Smith thinks about maybe taking this project to HBO or Showtime so he can REALLY do what he wants.I recomend this to any hard core Kevin Smith Fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually *based* on the DVD","review":"I bought this DVD today, and if you thought the aired episodes were funny, just wait! The added bonus of this DVD is that you get to see the episodes in the order they were INTENDED to air (My personal favourite is episode 6, which includes a great parody of my favourite Warner Bros. cartoon, \\"Duck Amuck\\"). You also get to see the unaired \\"Flintstone's List\\" footage from episode 2, as well as the context the Leonardo Leonardo footage from episode 2 was placed in. The featurettes were an interesting look at how they nailed the look and feel of these shows. My only complaint is that Smith an Co.'s commentary track is just a 2 hour rant on how they feel they were betrayed by ABC. All in all, Smith fans (or fans of the Clerks movie) should run out and buy this disk, others may want to wait until the proposed animated Clerks movie comes out before making their decision.boingo2000"},{"rating":"1","title":"Money wasted","review":"Things just seemd to get better for Kevin Smith, each movie seemed to take on more and take it on successfully. This cartoon series apparantly bombed on the networks and its easy to see why. Poor production masked by weak jokes about Korean animators, and plots that feel like they were lifted from the Simpson's and then dumbed down. Wish I had not ordered this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"Being a big Kevin Smith fan I couldn't pass up this dvd. It has all the episodes of the animated series and is very complete. My wife isn't a big fan of the movies but did find herself enjoying this animated series. While the movies are not for young viewers the animated series is ok. It says uncensored but I didn't really see anything that needed censored. If you like anything that Kevin Smith did or are just wanting to dabble in the Clerks realm this is definately the best and safest way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series would be great without the network.","review":"The triumphant return of Dante and Randall, two clerks just trying to survive the day to day onslaught of customers. This animated series was never given a fair shake by the network, which shall remain nameless. Sporting talent like Alec Baldwin, Charles Barkley, Gilbert Gotfried, and Julia Sweeny, this is a star studded event. With parodies of films like The Last Starfighter, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and the Bad News Bears (and that was just one episode) it was a hilarious jab at pop culture.The cast and crew commentary is utterly hilarious, with insight into the inspiration behind each episode, what had to be done to make it work, and why the \\"network\\" hated it.Also included are animatics to show the director's vision, a segment on the animation style, the film-festival trailer, the Super-Bowl promo, and of course, you can never get enough of Jay and Silent Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see DVD!","review":"I was not a huge fan of Clerks the movie but I was very surprised about this. Not a great TV shows but hilarious characters and great jokes. All 6 episodes are really good but the court one is definitely my favorite.There is a funny introduction by Jay and Silent Bob each episode and the then there is a commentary for all 6! Very entertaining!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clerks Uncensored!","review":"A spin off series of the movie, Clerks Uncensored only had two episodes shown on ABC in 2000. We get to watch Dante and Randal deal with more problems within 6 episodes. Cancelled by \\"the company\\" (as Kev calls 'em on the Uncensored commentaries) after two episodes. We get all six eps on this set! Seriously, Kevin Smith is a genius! Awesome show, too bad ABC cancelled it. Watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Kevin's Best Work","review":"On my list of top 20 movies of all time, at least 4 of them are Kevin Smith's. I *LOVE* his work. That said, I found the Clerks animated series to be boring. The stories were slow and repetitive. The jokes were sophmoric and tedious compared to his usually intelligent humor. I just couldn't get into it. I know what you're thinking, \\"Jay and Silent Bob? Intelligent humor?!\\" Ok, so maybe intelligent isn't the word, but it's humor for intelligent people. Compare and contrast with, for example, Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler. Still often VERY funny, but it doesn't take a much wit to get the jokes. This disk was more like that kind of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely horrible, Kevin needs to apologize","review":"I am a big View Askew fan, but this is just horrible. It just isn't funny except for 2 minutes on one episode. A lot of unfunny stuff is just repeated and repeated. And some alleged jokes are just beaten like and equine carcass. I think Kevin Smith needs to start smoking again, maybe it was nicotine shock or something. He's dillusional, he can't discern to what he thinks might be funny and what the other 99% of us think. I'm real worried about him, he needs to go to a Doctor, maybe a brain tumor. I couldn't even watch them all, I could only stomach up till ep 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's uncensored about it?","review":"I first heard about this animated adventure on viewaskew.com. I must say that I never saw the original broadcast of the first 2 episodes, but when I heard a complete collection was going to be released (I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan), I just had to get it. My expectations must have been set too high because it was just plain awful. Laughs were far and few between. The best parts of the whole DVD were the Character Development and The Clerks Style Featurettes, but hardly worth the money paid. The 15 second introductions before each each episode were the only \\"uncensored\\" portions of the video. I had expected a little more off-the-wall, cutting-edge humor instead of 6th grade antics. Save your money and buy something worthy of being in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"i bought this dvd saturday. i returned it sunday. it is, without a doubt, the worst thing i have ever seen. from random-in-a-bad-way storylines to characters obviously inserted by network people (come on, leonardo leonardo the evil megalomaniac?) to censorship (how ironic, considering the title of the series), this series sucks. the one saving grace came in the last episode, when randall and dante are at a comicon, and fans ask them questions like \\"so exactly how little did you sell out for?\\" small compensation for the three hours of my life that are gone beyond recall. i got my money back, but the wasted time can never be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Smith fan","review":"I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan!

I did not put over my head. And they snapped right in half. Looking at the plastic, it is stressed with cracks all along the plastic part, and i'm surprised they even lasted the 3 months I had these. Don't bother purchasing these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snapped after 2 Months of Office Use","review":"I'm an audiophile but wanted to listen to music at my desk at work and still be able to engage in conversation, so sound quality was last of my concerns. I wanted headphones that looked really nice, weren't big, and that I could hear around.I got what I wanted, until about a week after I began using them I found that they slid off my ears relatively easily and then, two short months after I ordered them and used them only at my desk at work (they were tethered to my G5) they snapped in half.Overall the sound quality wasn't terrible (wasn't great either), but not enough attention was paid to engineering the phones to work on a person's head, and the plastic used to fabricate them is of an appallingly low quality. I bought a pair for my mom after getting mine and now will be buying her something else before hers break, too.I would never encourage anyone to buy these. Even if the sound quality were perfect, who cares if they're duct taped behind your head?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Logicrap (in my opinion)","review":"Purchased this hi-tech, alien looking headphones not two months ago and the headphones have already snapped from stress midway across the thingee that goes over your head.Sound reproduction was good for what consumers pay.

More drawings would have been welcome, as they show better what you actually see at the eyepiece. Reading the book wants you to get out of your chair and observe the marvels described.One effect of the compilation of individual columns is that there is some overlap: several objects are treated in two or three chapters. This is no handicap, as objects are written in bold and can thus be found easily in the main text.There is plenty for everybody, whether you are 'just' using binoculars or have a scope small or big.Last but not least: its really Sue French who wrote this book and should get due credit for it, Richard Fienberg 'only' wrote the foreword.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Celestial Sampler","review":"Visual equivalent to a sampler box of chocolates; every bite is a delight!

This series had enough problems of its own (original creator wasn't involved, the first storyarc was considered by audiences a poor return to 'Dragon Ball' days so they switched to fight-intensive DBZ style) without being trimmed and repackaged for American audiences to digest.About the only thing left to add is if you have seen the original Japanese series on VCD you may want to steer clear of this, as the editing and the soundtrack make it so you can't enjoy it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"SSJ 4","review":"it starts with uub saving pan. then elder kai and kibito kai pull goku's tail out while uub fuses with majin buu. uub is supposedly defeated. goku becomes gold oozaru, and then, ultimately goes ssj 4 in this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's the best!","review":"Great unit!

It absolutely refuses to work with Server 2003 (my main OS) though.Few people use 2003 for a desktop OS though, so I won't take points off. It only takes a few seconds to boot to 2000 to upload new music, and if you're using 2003 for your desktop chances are you're savvy enough to set-up a dual boot in an hour or two.I got this player for $210 from New Egg, so despite some problems with my chosen OS it's still a fantastic deal for a 20GB player."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER BUY AN ARCHOS PRODUCT!","review":"I had problems as soon as I opened the box.

However, I found that Direct Source's print is missing about 8 minutes of footage, including the scenes where the party guests first realize their building is on fire. This is not the result of this being a different edit of the film. There is simply a noticeably awkward jump in the film that skips over the scenes.

I'll watch anything with Anthony Hopkins, and nearly anything with Julianne Moore. Ray Liotta makes a great bad guy (lots more moral corrosion than Lecter).\\"Manhunter\\" is, by comparison, pretty dry stuff. The acting is a bit austere; it seems more like actors going through the motions than getting into their parts.

It's packaged in a generic-looking triple pack with 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Hannibal' and there are absolutely no special features (there aren't even names for the chapter stops). It's a surprise, then, that it looks and sounds as good as it does. The movie is old (1986) and it's generally referred to as a footnote to the other two in this set. Still, I've seen it dozens of times over the years (on film, cable television, VHS, DVD) and this Blu-Ray picture is the sharpest I've ever seen it. The night time and darkly lit scenes are crisp; the lights and colors (sometimes used expressionistically) are clearer and show more detail than I've ever seen.I'm not bothered by the lack of special features; this was such as unlikely candidate for Blu-Ray release, it's a treat just to have the movie in such nice shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannible \\"Trilogy\\"","review":"Being the movie buff I am, I enjoyed this set; however, I was disappointed a bit.

If you are a social history fan, a Restoration bug, a 17th Century nut, or you just love learning through insightful and witty prose, this is a book you will get lost in. It's not unlike \\"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew\\"--but more gracefully written, with a fine wry view of the era. Pepys would have loved it! And so would Charles II.

The scenes about the elders were breathtaking. They brought the women elders, grandmothers and great grandmothers into the circle at the family reuntion. Cecily Tyson and Maya Angelou added so much.

The editors present numerous short vignettes where the reader hears, in first person, a variety of Cubans describe their lives. As with all matters Cuban, things are seldom as simple as pro- and anti- opponents claim. The conceptual tension between the gains people of color made as a result during the revolution, the silence the revolution imposed on race matters, and the looming threat of a \\"racial rollback\\" with the dolarization of the Cuban ecomony are all here, spoken from the perspective of Cubans caught in the complex social millieu that is contemporary Cuba.

I was looking forward to reading about Serena because she seemed to be one of the more interesting characters and I was left sorely disappointed. I don't understand how you can have a romance in a book and not really give the reader anything to go on. If Serena can't remember her memories, then how are we supposed to get a feel for a connection between her and Stanton? They had absolutely no chemistry to me. Stanton and Vanessa seemed to have more chemistry (later I found out Lynne Ewing was originally going to hook those two up). Too bad Lynne didn't hook Michael up with someone else later in the series. Personally, I think Vanessa and Stanton would have made a better couple. I understand others might have a different opinion, but that's just how I feel about it.I give it two stars for at least being well-written, if not the most interesting or the best of the series. So far, it's my least favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first book","review":"Usually series improve over their course. Hopefully this will still hold true with the other books. However, I found this book very blah. Serena was a character I was unable to get a firm understanding of--perhaps due to her mental confusion in the book, it made her less sympathetic than a heroine should be though. And being a fan of the character Stanton, I really don't understand his draw to her. There is some character trait that she has that needs to be delved into, as to why he would like her better than Vanessa (who he did have chemistry with) and why she would be so susceptible to the dark forces. Not just her super power. I did like her brother Collin and Wally the raccoon, however Morgan is a character that is very flat and deserves better treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Series I've ever read!!!","review":"I've already written a review for the first book, but I believe that this book is better than the first. I love Serena's attitude and how she is the key to the Atrox. I also love how she realizes that someone who is in league with evil may not exactly be evil itself.

If you like folk music, buy this cd right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deviates greatly from the novel","review":"Although Marc Warren gives a respectable performance as the Count, this BBC/Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel is a far cry from the source material. Several characters and events are omitted in favor of a wildly out-of-place subplot involving a syphilis-infected Arthur Holmwood and his dealings with a Dracula blood cult. With its rushed pace and brief 90-minute running length, it appears to have been a hurried production and heavily edited for its U.S. airing. One would expect a more faithful version of a literary classic from the BBC and Masterpiece Theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different take on Dracula!","review":"I really enjoyed the Masterpiece Theatre's version of Dracula. Sophia Myles as Lucy was quite different from other versions I've seen. Sophia is an exceptional actress and played the role extremely well.

It if had been shown in theaters, probably would have been the surprise comedy hit of the year.Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This version of Dracula is not very good. First of all, Dracula himself looks rather silly, and the Van Helsing character is a joke. Stick with the versions where Gary Oldman and Frank Langella plays the blood thirsty count from Transylvania."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreadful . . .","review":"I echo the remarks of the other 1 star reviewers. This is surely the worst Dracula adaptation ever made. Boring, ridiculous and poorly written. The screenwriter obviously never read the novel.

You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"This was just plain awful! Mina is a very strong female character in the novel, not the wimp portrayed in this production. There is a perfectly good plot in Bram Stoker's book.

I HATE home movies, yet people keep putting them out on DVD for the unsuspecting to buy. If you want to make a movie, at least shoot it in letterbox. Most handheld camcorders from Best Buy come with the 16X9 option, and this button wasn't pressed by the idiots who made \\"The Veil.\\" They crapped up the image on a PC and cheap software so it wouldn't look too much like \\"thanksgiving 2004 with your parents\\". Basically, it looks like a bootleg of a DVD...compressed image with box-like pixels. An example would be...if you rented a high-end film at Blockbuster and ripped it on a 4.5 GB DVD.

I bought it based on all the 5 star reviews I read.The characters all wear gas masks, so you can't tell who's talking and you can't hear about 85% of dialogue. The movie is extremely long and difficult to watch.It's almost like a visual jigsaw puzzle, but due to horrible filming and sound, you're missing the majority of the pieces. Good luck trying to watch this nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death of the Gods","review":"Hellish screaming, the fierce drums of doom, intense, mind-shattering riffs, surely this is the soundtrack to Ragnarok. When my friend played Jacknife's Moment of Reckoning for me I had to look out the window to see if the giants had risen again to wage war on Odin, Thor, Tyr and all that is noble. The members of Jacknife have seen the future. They have seen the death of Buldur. They have seen Hel rising from the seas of darkness on a ship made of the bones and fingernails of the dead. Ortiz has matched wits with Loki and won. In return he was granted the power to invoke the magic of the runes with just his voice. I can't wait to see these guys live, and yet I am afraid. I am afraid of what might happen when you amplify the music of chaos. Will the dead rise? Will the moon turn to blood? Will Bush somehow get re-elected again? It's all too frightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pinnacle of metal.","review":"Jacknife's debut album, Moment of Reckoning is awesome. Their bass lines and rhythm grip the listener from the very first note and the whole album will leave you amped and ready for more. You can feel their energy in each track; if ever you feared for the future of metal, this band will reassure you.If you haven't heard them yet, you're missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slammin...","review":"Moment of Reckoning is my fav metal album of the year so far. It's got all the elements: Super heavy and direct riffs, spawned-from-hell vocals and drumming that rattles the fillings. This is a great debut from Jacknife and my guess is you will be hearing a lot more about these guys in the coming year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !","review":"I needed this video for my son ( a college class) It arrivedpromptly which was a must!

It is interesting from a historical point of view, but there is only one genuinely good character in this movie (the father) and he dies fairly close to the beginning. Other characters seem to change drastically with no explanation. You have to sit through a gruesome torture scene and several incredibly ridiculous sex scenes and to me, in the end, it just wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"RAIN ON SUNSHINE.","review":"I had very high expectations for the movie, unfortunately it did not live up to any of them. Though the movie is about a Jewish family during and after the World War II, it is hardly uplifting. The characters were very unsympathetic. I can only give it 2 stars due to the quality of the acting. Overall, I feel that I wasted 3 hours of my life that I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the soul?","review":"This film would have been far more better with Hungarian acteurs. The whole soul of identity and temper vanished into clisjees by the american way. I don't know why the director went into this trap. The masking of the protagonist Ralph Finnes into the different roles made it to a non believable story �C was thinking more about the make up then the message from the acteur. The story is interesting, painful and beautiful, but is not taking me enough because of some surface acting which was kind of irritating. With the resourses this project may got, the results I expected was not met. The photographic part of it was indeed splendid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult circumstances","review":"The transmission of this video was so poor, probably due to buffering problems, that viewing was near impossible.

However, all these assets were wasted on soap opera-like melodrama and gratuitous sex scenes. The female characters, even Valerie to some extent, are cyphers that are only there to seduce the three characters played by Ralph Fiennes. I am disappointed with Mr. Fiennes' choice of roles in the past several years as he only seems to reprise his role in The English Patient over and over again. Instead of the melodrama and trite symbolism, the film could have further explored the characters' drives for assimilation and faith. The tumultuous political events and their impact on the characters' lives are not fully explored and only play second fiddle to Mr. Fiennes' posterior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used but Good???","review":"Thankfully the DVD was playable ... based on the \\"jacket\\" and the condition of the DVD it was doubtful that we would be satisfied with the purchase. Definitely not used to this kind of product coming out of AMAZON.In my future purchases I will demand \\"AMAZON - NEW ONLY\\". The \\"jacket\\" was soiled, with what I have no idea and the DVD itself looked a bit \\"battle scarred\\", but as mentioned before playable. Almost returned because of the jacket condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and underseen","review":"The Bottom Line:Sunshine isn't perfect, but its story of 100 years in Hungarian history told through the eyes of a grandfather, father, and son (all played by Ralph Fiennes) is consistently compelling and replete with moments that linger in my brain; if you're a 20th century history buff with 3 hours on your hand, you could hardly do better than renting this underrated gem from Istvan Szabo.3.5/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to...","review":"These were slightly softer than the originals.

It is clear that this author knows what he is talking about and I love how he combines useful business tools and tactics with personal accounts of the real-life application of these tools by real estate agents.

The murder was real but n-landplayed a trick on the media by saying that it was influenced by an-land song called\\"Christianity is stupid\\" The deeply religious family being killed by the son. The real twist is how the media,without any proof, made this into the top evening news in the san fran area for awhile. This was less a publicity stunt than a primeexample of \\"Culture Jamming\\" and a way of showing how yellow the press really is. Very thought provocing and humourus at the same time.The rest of this release deals with radio,the equally manipulating form of media and how formats and marketing subliminaly control you.

It would be impossible to write about how many ways in which this show influenced my life. I think the greatest lesson I took from the show was to embrace life and celebrate the quirkiness of individuals. I am a woman pilot who wishes I had the tenacity and grit of Maggie to live out my dream of being a damn good bush pilot and damn good (and strong) woman in AK.

The show follows the experiences of transplanted New Yorker, Joel Fleischman (Rob Morrow) in the Alaskan town of Cicely, where the citizens are some of the strangest people on earth. Joel is baffled by the quirks and oddities of locals and it doesn't get any better for him as he is bound for four years of indentured service as repayment for a loan to go to medical school. Despite the quirks, the people of Cicely are warm and caring people. Its that soft undertone that helps keep Northern Exposure from tipping over the edge of being just plain weird. The only drawback to the collection is that since the first season was a midseason replacement, it is a scant eight episodes. It would have been nice to see this and the second season packaged together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I have waited many years for this series to come to DVD, and it has been worth the wait.

I liked the parka, but if that means sacrificing the booklet of info, then I can do without.... I hope we don't have to wait a long time for the next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show at a great price","review":"Though, I must admit, this was a very short season, I still enjoyed very much the episodes it did have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show!!","review":"The price was pretty good. the package came relatively quick but wasn't a very protective envelope. there was no cushion for the case itself. In the end the inside of the package was damaged but as soon as I turned on the dvd my wife wouldn't let me turn it off. So I am very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"Like many others, I hate the fact that the music had not been kept intact for this set. I also hate the fact that there are only a few episodes in this season (perhaps it should have been included with season 2?) I also don't like the dual sided discs. But, with all that said.....the shows themselves are wonderful, and just as I remember them. This was truly one of the best series of the 90's. I remember watching this as a junior high student and wishing that I could live in Alaska; or at the very least, a town just like that. Great show, I can't wait for the remaining seasons to come out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the reviews suggest","review":"I briefly hesitated before getting this DVD, because the reviews posted here have been mixed. But I got it for Christmas and I've been delighted. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't really have a problem with the 2-sided DVDs. The episodes are all there in good quality sound and picture. The extended and deleted scenes are sort of superfluous and not very interesting, and will probably disappoint most people. They may interest only the most diehard NX fans. If you loved the series and can spare the $44, you should get the DVD. The first three seasons are the best writing ever on television, so you should add this to your DVD collection if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more!","review":"There's no arguement here that Northern Exposure was one of the most original shows on TV. I just wish that the production of this DVD set was up to those standards. No linar notes, poorly labeled two-sided DVD (with only TWO shows per side--give me a break!). No extras except a few deleted scenes.How about a booklet? How about a listing of songs (one of the great things about this show was the amazing use of little known and popular songs that advanced the plot)? How about interviews? Credits? Filmographies? Etc, etc, etc.Next time, skip the cute package parka and give us some worthwhile extras on the DVD's--you're charging top dollar! Customers expect more these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"Norther Exposure is probably one of the best cast, best written, & best Location-scouted TV shows ever aired. My wife & I eagerly awaited for the show's arrival to DVD. When we purchased the show--for an outrageous $50.00--we were shocked at what we received. Yes, the innovative packaging was fun, but it hid the fact that there was nothing inside. As others have noted, the price is horrible when you realize that there were on 8 episodes! What makes it worse is that there is absolutely no information included. No booklet with stills from the show, no list of episodes, nothing at all. On top of that, they do not even give you multiple discs, they give you cheezy 2 sided discs with 2 shows on each side. What were they thinking? Others have noted that seasons 1 & 2 should have been combined. I agree. If you are a fan of the show & want the episodes from season 2, you'll get reamed gain... there are only 7 episodes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better.","review":"Universal should have put more into the contents as they did in the packaging! The disc are double sided with two episodes on each side.Also the menu screen comes up with no intro! Its great for fans but also a real disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but....","review":"I love NX so much that I paid the HIGH price for these DVDs. I really enjoy watching it, it is really good, but I would have appreciated more episodes or a lower price.If your an NX fan buy it if you can afford it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Series - The DVD sets.....","review":"IF you did not have the opportunity to see the TV series \\"Northern Exposure\\", then you may enjoy these DVDs. However, what you will miss is the actual TV series. What did he say? The DVD sets offered here are NOT the TV series as televised. As one reviewer bravely noted, and most others simply passed on by, is the creative genius of the TV series as televised. That includes the original music delightfully inserted with an artist's touch. Whoever made the decision to remove the original musical excerpts defaced a work of art imo. In short, if you've got money to burn and just want to see a few favorites episodes, go for it. Better yet, watch the re-runs. IF you are really a fan, find somebody, anybody, who taped each episode. I wish I had. It's a crime to mess with an artist's Art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greed","review":"This was my wife's favorite TV show, so I was eager to pick this up. But 8 episodes for $41.99?! While Northern Exposure is a wonderful show, that price is absurd. A quick per-episode comparison with other great shows, based on Amazon prices at the time of this writing:$5.25/episdoe for Season 1 of Northern Exposure (8 episodes)$3.82/episode for Seasons 1 and 2 of Homicide (13 episodes)$2.06/episode for Season 1 of The West Wing (22 episodes)$1.87/episode for Season 1 of 24 (24 episodes, of course)If nothing else Northern Exposure should have Seasons 1 and 2 bundled a la Homicide. It disappoints me to say this, but I can't bring myself to buy at these rates. I hope the studio will reconsider how the series is marketed. They are of course free to ask whatever price they want, but I hope they won't be rewarded for the price they've chosen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I strongly recommend that you NOT spend your money on this DVD. The entire second disk that I received is defective. It is clearly a problem with the disk itself, entire parts of the content are inaccessible and the problem always occurs towards the end of program sections. After reading reviews of later seasons of Northern Exposure, I see that this is a known issue.Northern Exposure is great...that's why I bough the DVD. Amazon is very convenient...that's why I give them hundreds of dollars a year. But this product is defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Several times made this and Season 2 memorable","review":"The first time I watched this DVD, I was a little annoyed with Doctor Joel Fleischmann's whining, and the blatant mistakes in depicting true Alaskan life.However, after watching it two more times (I was bummed because there aren't many episodes in the set), I started to really appreciate what the whole show was trying to say. I started to really love all the characters who appeared shallow the first time and started to show more depth the more I watched each episode.By the time I got to the season finale of the 2nd season, I was laughing so hard I almost fell out of bed.I would certainly recommend this to anyone who likes watching shows about Alaska or just outdoorsy type shows.I didn't much care about what else was on the set. The episodes were enough.LynneChugiak, Alaska"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Glad It's Finally Here!","review":"Okay...would I have been happier if this set had included more than eight episodes? Definitely! Would I have preferred a better price? Absolutely! But finally seeing these early episodes again with digital quality was certainly worth all of the aggravation. Besides, having a Costco membership helped the bitter pill go down a little easier ($34.95 Wink, wink).Would have liked to see a little more in the way of special features beyond the typical deleted scenes and outtakes, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What idiot priced this DVD?","review":"Too bad that some money-grubbing Scrooge has decided to ruin this show's legacy by not only charging $59.99 for this dvd, but then having the audacity to include forced previews as well! I was looking forward to buying this when I first heard it was announced, but now ... I'll just wait for the used guys to get around to it. $59.99? Somebody just does not have a clue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive!!","review":"I was really interested in buying this as I didn't get to see every episode when it originally aired, but $40 for 8 episodes?? You've got to be kidding!! Parka or no parka that is outrageous! I'll either wait for a combined seasons 1 and 2 or rent it and not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Star Show, 1 Star Price","review":"I have been waiting forever for this brilliant show to come to DVD. However, the amount Universal is asking for this season is disgusting. Many other TV shows release entire seasons of shows with 22 to 24 episodes for the same price or only slightly more. This set contains a mere eight episodes. Why couldn't they have combined this set with the second season (which was only seven episodes long), the way the first two seasons of Homicide were combined?I will hold off on buying this until I see a price drop or some sort of sale. Unfortunately, that high price will keep sales low, and as a result we may never see the later seasons on DVD - a horrible thought, but I'm not going to support the greed that went into the production of this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flip the Disc Over !!!","review":"Yes it's true the first season is only 8 episodes long ( I wish they had put 3 seasons on one disc) , however, do you know how long true NX fans have been waiting for this ? We've had to sit and watch all the other crummy shows with low level talent be placed into the digital realm while we wear our VHS tapes out ..... All that being said .....Yes the extras are a little thin, yes there is no episode guide inside the case....but the impact of this show far outweighs the little extras that we have been so accustomed to. Quality does not mean quantity. Oh and by the way, the pilot is on the other side of the disc....Flip it over...and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY THE BEST","review":"It's about time and yes i agree they should have includedthe trial run with the real season one together.This showwas brillantly written.I have watched over and over.I was sodisappointed when A&E; stopped airing the reruns(boo-hoo).I hope to see the complete series from beginning to end onDVD...It's about life!!! BEAUTIFUL SCENIC PEACEFUL ENTERTAININGA show worth watching- A collection worth having #1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Northern Exposure Season 1&2","review":"This is one of the best TV shows ever created. The DVD's look and sound great. Much better than my VHS tapes with all of the recorded episodes. The ensemble cast really get their feet moving during the short 1st and 2nd seasons. You can actually feel the chemistry b/w Joel and Maggie and it starts to boil over onscreen. Such a great cast with exceptional writing.The DVD's them selves are a little short on content. For one I was surprised to see only 8 episodes for season 1 and 7 for season 2. I bought the two seasons combined and still think there are some shows missing. There is plenty of lost footage and outtakes but nothing amazing to write about. You do a get a little insight from the actors by their outtakes. I was hoping for a little more just based on the quirkiness of the show.Overall this is a great series to own and cherish. I would definitely look for on sales though. In my opinion $50 is a little much."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE HECK????","review":"OK, I love the show, so why only a one star review? The first season of Northern exposure was only eight episodes, so that is what you get in this package, eight episodes. The second season was only seven episodes, so if Universal decides to release the second season, it will be even shorter, at probably the same price point, which is unacceptable. Why they didn't release seasons 1 and 2 in one package for $40.00, (which is a much more reasonable price for 15 episodes) is a mystery. Wait, I solved the mystery. Greed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasently surprized","review":"I was pleasently surprized at the condition of this used dvd series,I was expecting a few scratches on the 2 disc set but i did not find a single scratch on either disc.I also expected to receive Item in about 1-2 weeks,but i received the series in 2or3 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"I watched NX on TV when I was a teenager and was very surprised when I bought the DVDs for my husband (an NX fan) that I still enjoy it. That doesn't often happen with shows I watched as a child.If you are on this page though, you probably don't need to be told that NX is a good show. The downside to the DVDs, as another reviewer mentioned, is that the 1st and 2nd seasons only contain 8 and 7 episodes respectively, whereas the 3rd season was a full season. Yet, you will be charged roughly the same amount for each season. There are few bonus features that make this purchase worthwhile, and it really seems as though combining seasons 1 & 2 into one set would make more sense. But, I still bought it despite that and apparently quite a few others did too...so the marketing works."},{"rating":"1","title":"NX Fans aren't fools!!","review":"I have been avidly waiting for NX to be released on DVD and this is what we get!! $60 for 8 messly episodes! What is Universal playing at here? with every bad sitcom under the sun being released on DVD they take in excess of 10 years to make this show available en masse to its fans and now they are trying to bend us over and screw us royaly. Who knows how much they are going to charge for Season 3 which actually contains 22 episodes. All of us NX fans need to band together and protest loudly and proudly to Universal that the market for this show is out there but we aint a bunch of punks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Northern Exposure INCOMPLETE For Any Season","review":"The Northern Exposure DVDs feature only four episodes per disc. At two discs, two episodes per, that's eight episodes out of thirteen.

Still a great show, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show but Terrible DVD","review":"OK, the 1 star is not because I don't like Northern Exposure. On the contrary. The one star is for the pathetic organization of this DVD.Not only is this DVD too overpriced for 8 episodes (give me a break!)It is incoherently organized on two sides of each DVD, which are not clearly marked.I was willing to overpay for the DVD. But aren't we, the fans, entitled to a quality DVD in exchange?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all time greatest TV shows !!","review":"Every couple months I search for Northern Exposure on the internet. I find the same things , but I also find more things. Interest is still growing. My suggestion for the studios is this: Release the series on DVD and make money. You will also make alot of people happy. Or don't, but have the guts to take a stand either way. Tell the fans now what the plan is. It will be gobbled up if released. Just look at the stuff people are buying. Northern Exposure had fine writng, interesting stories and a great cast. That's all I have to say because anyone reading this is most likely a fan already, but to those who are not in the know; if it comes out do yourself a favor and at least rent a couple discs, I strongly doubt you will be disappointed. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't complain - abstain!","review":"People, people . . . It's absolutely no use complaining about how high the price of this set of DVDs is. You can't say, \\"I bought it, but I'm unhappy about it.\\" The company already has your money, and they won't change their pricing based on your expressed unhappiness -- what they learn from the transaction is that you *are* willing to pay their price. If you really think the price of this set is too high (as I do), you've got to grit your teeth and NOT BUY IT! That's the only thing that will genuinely signal to the company that you aren't willing to meet their price. Six or seven bucks an episode? It's crazy. Release a combined set of seasons 1 and 2 for this price, and we can talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 Stars, and this is why:","review":"First, let me say that I LOVE this show. I never missed an episode when it was on television. I give this 2 stars because of other issues abound.The price is completely whacked considering this show is a decade old, there are only 2 discs with eight episodes (yes, I know there were only 8 the first season, but hence my reason for complaining about the price!!!), the lack of extra features for such a series, AND....the thing that REALLY ticked me off....it seems that since they are charging an exhorbitant price for this set, they COULD have paid someone with a brain to arrange the episodes in PROPER order on the discs!!!! (The pilot episode is on SIDE 2 of the first disc!!!!) What a shame. Universal should tuck their head between their legs for such a marketing disaster!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Superstar videos are really terrible.","review":"At first, I was excited to see new infant products, since my kids love the Baby Einstein series so much that they've seen them a million times. I ordered all the Baby Superstar products and now, I'm going to return them. They are really, really bad videos. I don't know if these guys are just trying to sell toys or what, but these videos are BORING and CHEAP-looking. Also my kids hate them. I tried to give them to my sister-in-law but her kids hate them too. They don't hold children's attention - kids know when something is bad. No one should buy these terrible products.

These videos are AWFUL. They are shoddy, cheap, and insulting to children. Even worse is the parents' guide on the DVDs. It is condescending and phony. My kids have no interest in the video. I showed it to the other parents in my parenting group, and they all agreed with my assessment. Maybe a very listless, slow child would like this video, but for normal, and especially above-average children, it is truly awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would we do without it?","review":"My son is absolutely in love with this video.

I found this entire series to be extremely one dimensional. These videos are passive eye stimulation at best as they provide no challenge to young viewers. The footage used appears to be stock footage of some sort and the toys featured are not always age appropriate. The parenting guide is insulting, even to new parents. How any of the baby superstar videos won any award begs the question - what exactly is the criteria used to judge these products?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought this video thinking my son would like it as much as he likes Baby Bach and Baby Mozart (which he's been watching avidly since he was 2 monthes old). I popped it in and he could have cared less. He's watch Baby Mozart for two hours if I'd let him, but this video couldn't hold his attention for two minutes.He first watched it at 5 monthes, so I though perhaps it was his age, but I pulled it out at 7 and 9 monthes and again, he could care less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information regarding demonic activity worldwide","review":"I'm grateful to the author for taking us around the world giving us clear examples of demonic activity.

I miss the days of Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady. Now that was TMNT. April is barely even in these, and as annoying as most think she is, she was my favorite character for the humans. This season is just one big disappointment and it pains me to even say such a thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK","review":"A two star rating is being generous. DVD's are meant to be something special. The special portion of this DVD is the pilot episode of \\"Tales of Frankenstein\\". The disc is filled with trailers and and the novel of the classic itself for your DVD-ROM. The menu screen started the trouble with the highlighted selection being hard to determine. The trailers seem to be from a bad source and do not flow within the DVD. The video interviews are cut short as they begin to get interesting, I have yet to sit down and listen to the audio interviews. Overall the production value of the disc is quite poor and the art for the cover and the insert looks as if it was done in two seconds.

For die hard collectors of horror only..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hits and misses","review":"It is nice that this release has a few treasures to offset what is more or less a messy presentation. The treasures are: a couple of nice bloopers featuring A&C and Lugosi, The complete pilot for Tales of Frankenstein, and some interview footage that I've seen around before( they cut most of this footage short at very odd places- who made this decision and why?). There are a whole bunch of trailers-the b/w ones are almost always dupy and/or re-issues. A few are enjoyable. The infamous Lon Chaney jr. episode of Tales of Tommorrow is here in a condensed version- sad and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not every good","review":"I thought TALES OF FRANKENSTEIN was a not a very good movie. The storyline is not very exciting. The actor of Frankenstein's monster is bad. Dr. Frankenstein himself is a boring one, compared to Colin Clive or Peter Cushing. I thought the make-up for the monster was good but he did not seen as human as Boris Karloff. I did not like the music or the introduction which has clips from other movies like Murders in the Rue Morgue, Dracula and The Raven. I would much rather watch the original Frankenstein or another Horror film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Missed Opportunity","review":"This is a fun collection, but a terrible DVD.

It's not susceptible to the regulations of the communist FCC like TRL and all the other ... on TV. Instead of providing the so-called masses with a pure, untarnished DVD with uncut audio and video, they release this ... with the same lame editing as you'd find on eMpTyV. I know they have an MTV20 Jams DVD as well; it's probably just one long beep with completely blurred out video.

For anyone who is a fan of time travel science fiction, hold on to your watch because the space time continum is about to be thrown into the blender. The author starts you in one place and then just flips it this way, tosses it another and then finally when you think you've landed in \\"real time\\", he creates a whole new reality!!!I would also recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good love story.

These dvds are shockingly irresponsible. The \\"science\\" that they are based on is outdated, and isn't at all in line with what we in the child psychology and educational communities have been researching over the past five years. These videos are clearly not based on current, peer-reviewed research. The parenting tips on the dvds are also surprisingly out of date, and the \\"experts\\" that appear or are referenced are not considered knowledgeable or relevant by the scientific, research, or educational communities.

As a medical doctor, a PhD in Developmental Psychology, and a mother, I find it sad that this is the sort of pap that is being fed to children too young to make their preferences known. Infants need stimulation, interaction, and challenges. They do not need to be plopped in front of the television to watch substandard material based on outdated, junky science.

All these make this book a great tool for biotechnologists and business persons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Biotech Entrepreneur's Glossary","review":"The Biotech Entrepreneur's Glossary by Dr. michael Pappas, is the only book I know of that combines both biotech and business terms in an easy to understand format, and is a very useful resource.

Thank you, Eddie!Try this out for lyrics (from Sugar and Spice):Well there's love on the menu ...I'll be the knife and you be the forkI'll try the rump steak and you try the porkIsn't that sooooo romantic? Well, it may not be everyone's entree but this is one of my favorite CDs and the remaster makes it much more enjoyable. This was their last album with Robert Gillies (sax and trumpet) and the first with Neil Finn (Crowded House). Dizrythmia and its predessor, Second Thoughs, are two excellent albums, and the remasters are well worth upgrading to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!

Well it does touch down with Enigma like sounds occasionally, but that unfortunately does not make up for this rather boring CD. If you listen to the first track, you have listened to the whole CD. There is very little variance among the tracks in tempo and sound. If your looking for background music this may suffice, but not worth the 14 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly boring, even a little silly","review":"I was eager for this CD, considering how much I love Jewel in the Sun, and the Healing Spirit. But something is very wrong here, and I feel I wasted my money. I actually burst out laughing when I heard her saying \\"I am the voice of the sea\\".

First of all it doesn'tknow what it is. A drama, comedy, sort of mystery or post teen comedy. Either way it is pretty bad and while it can hold your attention the end result isn't worth it. The only thing that saves it is tha amzing cast of talented actors who are trying as hard as they can to make something out of nothing. 2 stars for the cast"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brad Rowe and Amanda Peet are Terrific.","review":"A sizzling, star-studded cast brings to life a funny/sexy look at sex in the 90's. Brad Rowe (Purgatory, Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss) ignites the screen, and Amanda Peet (The Whole Nine-Yards) was fantastic. This was a good date movie because the plot is based on sex, I can't wait to see Body Shots again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it that Tara Reid getting raped is not important? It is!!","review":"Well, if you have only watched 10 minutes of this movie, I will just let you know now that Tara Reid driving around in the Mercedes in the rain, with the cut on her forehead claiming to have been raped is about as far as this movie went to describe what happened. If you think you are going to get the answer to this controversial question------GUESS AGAIN.That's all I have to say, and that the movie drags on and on.P.S. Tara Reid got me to see the movie because I think she's really great---otherwise I don't think I would have seen it in all actuality.Thanks,C"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver","review":"I saw this on the big screen and I was very disappointed. The producers were going for a film which would leave it's audience questioning their own views on sex and love, but it did not. Throughout the movie the cast remarked about life, love and sex trying to sound profound but succeeding in sounding fickle. The most interesting part, and the reason I gave it 2 stars, was the way the cast protrayed the recollection of the same event by two different people of the opposite sex. The film should have focussed on that plot and developed it further. The rest of the movie was actually a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT QUITE","review":"I have the movie Body Shots it started out just about them having sex. About the middle of the movie the plot just changed It suddenly became about a mystery and trying to solve it. Great acting (Tara Reid, Amanda Peet) TERRIBLE ENDING does not even have an ending you expect the movie to start after the credits. I liked what they were doing with the movie at the beggining but then it got jumbled and confusing. If you like rape sex movies with bad plots then this movie is for you if not dont waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"I saw this movie in the movie theatre and was disgusted by it. I think it is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Don't waste your money or your time watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body Shots","review":"Foul language was use for its shock value rather than supporting the film. The plot was very jerkey and did not flow very well. It was so boreing that I could not finish watching it. It fails as a comedy and as a porn flick. Not sure what it was trying to accomplish. Truly a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Brad Rowe","review":"Body Shots is a piece of garbage. The acting especially that of Brad Rowe is dreadful. This movie took in less than one million at boxoffice, flopping, just as did every picture Brad Rowe has appeared in. The film is like watching a very poor made for TV movie. Terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1 night can change your life forever","review":"At first sight this movie struck me as being a feel good movie with lots of sex and good times. It has sex and great times, but also gives you a whole new look on relationships.This movie cleverly shows how the events of one night in the lives of 6 twenty somethings can change their lives forever. The movie is fast flowing and quick to set your hearts pumping to the music and seductive events that occur. Watch it with a friend, or even a whole group of friends. It's a great film that shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Shots","review":"In a way I found \\"Body Shots\\" to be a little insulting. The way that the male and female characters are written it's like they're a disgrace to mankind. All they talk about throughout the film is sex. I mean it has your typical male (which by the way, not all men are like this): wanting it, fantasizng about it, then getting it, and then bragging to your friends. From all that sex talk, which gets really annoying, you have a rape issue going on.Overall, \\"Body Shots\\" is really uneven and way too much for one to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Jennifer Kern","review":"She is absolutely right about the limited scope of this book. Look at the title -- it presumes there is such thing as \\"Jewish\\" interfaith family life.

We keep a kosher home and celebrate both sets of holidays. We go to church and synagogue regularly. Sadly, there is absolutley nothing useful in this book for my family since I (and my kids) are not planning to convert."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference for the interfaith family","review":"This book should be in every interfaith family's library! The book is made up of short segments that deal with almost every interfaith scenario possible.

I appreciate the interesting facts they weave into the book about the Titanic. For instance after showing how to draw a 20's style automobile, it has an interesting fact about a car that sunk with the ship. There is also a glossary of terms in the back. We used these as our vocabulary words for a unit study on the Titanic. The book is reasonably priced and you only need to purchase the sketch book and special pencil and eraser if you desire to, you can use everyday paper and pencil. We are happy to add this book among our favorites in our Titanic library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Imformation and no new or good facts!","review":"I was excited avout getting this book from a school book order but I was very disapointed with how the book presents itself .

If you set the clock under battery and then you plug it in you lose all of your information. The alarm clock is nice but without the battery back-up you can't depend on it. The projection part only works when you hit a button on top of the main unit. It then only shows the time. If you hit it again you can see the inside temp, hit again the outside temp. Not sure why you would want a projection clock if you have to walk over and hit a button to see it displayed. Haven't bothered to insert (waste) batteries to even try out the thermometer part. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"junk, stay away","review":"I bought this and after six months the projector function does not project. Even then the number projected on the ceiling was too small, and had no focus or adjustments. Unless you can read an eye chart without glasses you may be able to see what time it is when you wake up in the middle of the night. Yes the light is still on but it is so dim that you would not know it is still on . I have seen this problem when companies use cheap LCD Diode's. They dim due to bad design, to much heat.

We had a clock with the same features and it worked properly for a number of years until its remote temp sending unit quit.

However, this changed my opinions. It is written with sheer eloquence, and allows the reasder an intimate game of peek-a-boo with the Chinese Peoples and culture.It serves up Chinese culture better than a day trip to China Town. I enjoyed the book, and thoroughly reccomend it. BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great read about China","review":"I truly believe travel narratives are the best ways to learn about a country outside of visiting them. Iron and Silk is one of those great books that give you the feel for China and the Chinese people. I read this book before my trip to China in the summer of 1998. Though the book is dated a bit, it is a must read before any trip to China or for any armchair traveller. I loved the way Salzman combined martial arts, calligraphy, tai chi with his other observations about China. My only problem with the book is that Salzman comes off a little to perfect...he always succeeds in this or masters that.....just a little to self serving. But that is just a little criticism of an otherwise great read about China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read and interesting","review":"Salzman writes in an easy-going, friendly tone and because of this, he puts the reader right in the story with him. I felt as if I were a friend of Salzman and was following him through his adventures.He shows compassion, intellegence and respect for others in Iron & Silk, and is easy to like. So is his book.I have read other books that have shown me a truer picture of inside China written by authors who were raised in China and then became Americans. Salzman's book, however, probably gives the reader a realistic description of how nonChinese visitors are treated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to read","review":"I felt sad when it comes to the end of the book. It seems that I was departing away from a part of his life in China all together.This book is very easy to read, and it is quite honest. He tells the story as if you were there to witness. And the people are all so different and interesting. His writting is not biased, or stereotyped.Anyway, so after I read the book, I checked out his profile online. I just imaged that he would be as young as what he described in the book. He is 44 already, married to a Chinese American woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was boring in some parts and some were good","review":"I didn't think this book was that great because all he talks about is what he acomplished and everything always turns out good for him. There are no parts in the book where he doesn't acomplish something that he wants to do. Also I thought it was kind of boring the only parts in the book that I like is when he is practiceing his wushu."},{"rating":"1","title":"the karate kid goes to china","review":"so, when you go to live in a foreign country, all you need to do is learn the language - right?salzman tromps through china with the maturity of a 15-year-old. he never bothers to learn the local culture and we watch him trip up repeatedly in awkward and embarassing situations.reading his commentary becomes painful. salzman wasted his time travelling to china. don't waste yours reading his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read, hard to put down, Chinese culture, martial art","review":"My flatmate was reading this book and I read a bit of it when he wasn't home. I had to keep reading it, so did our other flat mate. The three of us were taking turns to read it at the same time. My flatmates are going to China to teach English, I am interested in martial arts. This book makes you want to go to China to teach English and learn martial arts.This novel is easy to read, funny in parts and discusses some of the political problems that face foreigners in China. The author shares his experiences with the special police when trying to travel with friends, and explains how the police tried to stop famous martial art instructors from teaching him. Salzman also intrigues you with his many different martial art instructors and the styles he learnt, coupled with Chinese calligraphy.A must read, wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you let such a racist review appear?","review":"On my original note, I think Mark Salzman wrote a very charming and entertaining book. He shows the Chinese culture from his point of view and shows the humor both sides encounter. I would recommend anyone who is interested in visiting China to read this book first and then reread it after to compare notes"},{"rating":"2","title":"How many times will I read this book?","review":"You know I play the \\"bumbling mute illiterate\\" card when I write about China. Salzman doesn't. But, he's not a hard core journalist or political commentator like Ian Johnson. Salzman's love of martial arts brought him to China. Like me, he loved David Carradine in Kung Fu. But, unlike me, he speaks fluent Chinese. He's also quite gifted at writing in English. Get this one.This guy didn't have to come to China to write a great book. In fact, he's written quite a few that aren't set in China. Fiction, memoirs, whatever. I love this book enough to order some of his others, and pay the exorbitant shipping costs Amazon imposes on poor old expats in China.{I learned later that this isn't even his best autobiographical work. LOST IN PLACE is. His novels are also excellent and I am sick with jealousy.}"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun With Culture","review":"This memoir is light and humorous and a wonderful way to learn about Chinese culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!","review":"Reading this book was rather contagious. Once you read a piece of it, you couldn't stop until you're done with it. His observation upon the Chinese was uncanny & being a Chinese, I really got to take my hat off for him as he explained to me the reason(s) why Chinese behave in such manners at times (which's rather logical from the hindsight now). It's funny, full of cliche', & the rigidity of Chinese vs. the informality of Americans formed the funny backbone of the whole book. Highly recommended. As a note of reminder, this book doesn't devote wholly to martial arts but simply a sideline to his day to day living in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron and Silk","review":"I thought the book Iron and Silk was very interesting as well as humorous and riveting. When I was reading book it was like Mark Salzman was my tour guide and he was bringing me around every where of China. He shows almost anything a reader wants in his/her book. I have read a couple books such as these but this one is probably the best I've read. I was mostly amazed at how Mark Salzman got into this book with his heart and soul. This is one awesome book that you'll find everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"This thing is a piece of cr@p. It's a cheap $2 plastic flashlight (batteries not included) with an equally cheap clamp and metal rod.

It also is not very functional. It holds 2 mmr cards backwards so you cannot see the title of the card and it does not offer any kind of storage space for headphones, business cards, or anything else. It also folds open but the cover does not bend all the way behind the back of the case, so it is a bit cumbersome to hold in one hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard case returned as it did not fit","review":"Confusion regarding the exact use had to return.

So far, so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice case","review":"The case is nice, although the small 'hooks' that hold it in place often release.

I almost had the Tungsten RIPPED APART when I first try to remove it from the case. So I just decided to trash the case.The Tungsten is an exceptional PDA, but this case doesn't even deserve its Palm brand name. Sure it's hard, but primarly to your Tungsten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the picture fool you","review":"I was wondering why I could not find this hard case anywhere that the Tungsten was sold, and I had to order it online.Upon receipt of the case I figured out why: on the internet you can fool people by showing them a picture of an \\"aluminum\\" case and it looks aluminum. You can't fool people when the item is right in front of their eyes.Do not be fooled: this case is made of ... plastic. The hinge is also made of plastic, and every time I open the case it feels like it is about to crack in half.If you are left-handed, this case will not feel ergonomic in your hand, as the person from Ireland pointed out below.When the item this case is supposed to protect is more rugged than the case itself, you know you have a problem.It is a shame that such a well-made, classy item like the Tungsten does not have a decent case to hold it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slim leather case is much better","review":"Opening and closing the palm T while it is in the hard case is very awkward.

The man has admitted to staging scenes of the show and staying in hotel rooms, to me, that discredits almost anything he has to say about natural living. If you are only interested in entertainment, then this show deserves about three stars. However, if you are interested in learning survival information, or not interested in seeing a fool run around in the woods, I would highly recommend Survivor Man. Also, any of Tom Brown's field guides are great for a person who is truly interested in survival and not just cheap entertainment.Also, NEVER drink your urine as Bear tells you to do.

I thought I got a lemon but after reading many reviews (on multiple websites), it seems that everyone is having the same problem with the TJ35 and this backlight issue seems to be a design flaw.The pluses are that it's fast and its slim profile makes it easy to hold and operate.

If the kids (2 of the 3 like it) want it in a pinch great, but it's not crossing my lips EVER again. And comparing it to Kraft, there's not much difference in the nutrition department.

Although they made a bad desicion and put electric drums on the album,(which really gives it its 80's sound) it still manages to work,despite the fact it didn't work for alot of bands. The album is really good when you're hanging out in your basement on a rainy day, or night. Overall it's a pretty \\"peppy\\" album, so it won't bring you down; it's happy, and all of its listenable, which is very contrary to their earlier stuff. In my opinion the first album on their way to greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arguably the Mup's most dull offering.","review":"Maybe I'm in the minority here, but this record just sounds dull and uninspired. The sound here is based around cheesy outdated 80's metal for the most part. Just awful production with no real push to it... I just seriously dislike this record. The lyrics sound boring and forced, which just doesn't feel like Curt Kirkwood's style to me. I'm all about growing as an artist, but this record should have been out of print long ago.There are a few somewhat redeeming monets, though. \\"Light\\" is a pleasant enough song, and \\"Touchdown King\\" is a fine example of their mid-period sound at it's best. \\"Party Till The World Obeys\\" is *almost* a really good song... but the lackluster production turns it into a boring thud. The best bet on this record is the acoustic \\"Like Being Alive\\"... even though that would have been the weak link on any previous album.Some swear by this record...

Both albums are suffused with the band's mystical ambience which is created by quirky and often poignant lyrics (sung in Jonathan's distinctive strained falsetto) as well as haunting instrumentation. Whereas Deserter's Songs was a loose, free flowing album, All Is Dream is far tighter, placing more emphasis on the individual song. The dream-like (hence the album's name) aura is helped by gems such as \`Spiders and Flies,' as well as the stunning \`Dark is Rising' and \`Hercules' which open and close the album. All is Dream is brighter than Deserter's Songs, it is refreshing and optimistic despite the wistful melancholy at the core of most of its songs. It shows the talent and uniqueness of the band and is a thoroughly enjoyable listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Bill's #22 of 2001","review":"4.25 Stars. Mercury Rev certainly has come a long way since their debut back 1992 (that has mixed results I guess). The noise blasts of old has now been replaced with orchestrations and symphonies. However, All is Dream kind of rocks it up a tad more than Deserter's Songs. Incorporating guitar antics similar to those of Godspeed You Black Emperor works really well with the orchestrations and Johnathon Donahue's vocals. I like this CD better than Deserter's Songs, but not quite as much as Boces. Best tracks are Lincoln's Eyes, You're My Queen, and Spiders and Flies."},{"rating":"2","title":"weird and wonderful, that's our rev","review":"back with a change in style since deserter's songs, this too is a highly acclaimed album. jonathan's lyrics still stand up with those on deserter's... and with a development in sound, all is dream could only be a success. although not as good as the predecessor, this lp is still a piece of magic. first single, the dark is rising heightens expectations as the first song of the album. full of orchestral violins, jonathan delves into the darker side of the rev,while nite and fog is up there as one of the singles of the year. although it gets a little lost towards then end of the album, with songs like spiders and flies passing without note, this is still a credible album to return with, especially since having to change producer in the middle of recording, and one every fan of quality music should have in their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserter's Song's this isn't.","review":"what a pretencious piece of drivel. jonathan has finally lost his mind.

From start to finish, the music is unoriginal, disconnected, and pretentious, at times sounding like an old Journey song and at others an opera. The lyrics are meaningless, forced rhymes (spiders and flies live and die, six legs to stand on and two wings to fly, It makes you wonder, why can't I, What was the season and the color of your eyes---WHAT?). In most songs the first verse is repeated at the end of the song as though the band had no idea how to bring an end to such a cacophonous atrocity. By the second song, I was convinced that this CD is intended to be played at a chipmunk funeral. It is essentially a menagerie of dirgelike compositions with inane lyrics sung by an off-key, whining loser. The only thing more astonishing than the band's absolute lack of talent is the fact that they have a recording contract.

Thats the thing with this album - it gets better every time you listen to it! Numbers 1,5 & 7 are my favorite tracks but they are all great! Hercules is mastery and the small \\"saw music\\" infill between track 4 & 5 is pure genius and quite magical!(Especially when it goes from one saw and melds seemlessly into two,creating an intertwining duet of unusual but beautifull music) BUY THIS and give it a chance!

This guys had a difficult task, they had to come out with an album that could live to the standards of Deserters Songs, and in my opinion they did it and did right.They kept most of they trademark sound in practically the whole All is Dream album, they even came out with new classic tunes that after several plays wont leave your head.Not many bands can or does provide a follow up to a classic record as Mercury Rev did with this one. Do not listen to the radical \\"I Cant stand Change\\" fans, enjoy one of the most underated bands in the USA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good god what horrible lyrics.","review":"I loved Deserter's Songs, especially the first three songs, but All is Dream is terrible and overblown. I have repeatedly tried to give it a second, third , fourth.... chance but the lyrics are so horrific and trite that I cannot change my initial opinion about this album.

This is not news. Since 1991's Yerself Is Steam (still their best), Mercury Rev have been purveying the new progressive rock with disparate results - the listless Boces, the spacey funk of See You On the Other Side, the over-praised Americana of Deserter's Songs. All Is Dream is nominally better than Deserter's Songs - sonics reach out and grab you (the melancholy undertow of \\"Tides of the Moon\\"; the strings and glockenspiel of \\"A Drop in Time\\"), but the weirdness of the arrangements never feels organic, just odd. At this point, all this should sound effortless. Most of the time on All Is Dream, you can hear the strain as they reach for the next bizarre effect.

These are apparently outtakes from a previous recording session, and it definitely seems like it. That said, it's still an interesting release.Many people thought Black Flag was at its best when it was at its rawest, which is pre-Rollins. There is some merit to that, but Rollins brought something to the band that made it shine. It was an artistic bent, a skewed philosophy, and lots of introspection. It was raw poetry, and that's something that can't easily be duplicated. This release is the blunter side of the Black Flag sword. It won't make anyone into a fan, but it also shouldn't turn people away ... except those who never liked Rollins in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt deserve one star, Great Band's worst effort","review":"This album turned me off to Black Flag for years.... I can See You is just dippy, no better word, the rest of the songs are boring, Out Of This World couldve done better without the rest of the tracks but as a collection this is horrible pretentious crap.Seriously the only work these guys have done worse is the collaboration with Minutemen (GREAT BAND) called Minuteflag"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy, solid, holds a lot, BEAUTIFUL","review":"Well, I love all of the red Le Creuset items and now have several of them adorning my red/black/stainless/ivory kitchen. This crock replaced a smaller mouthed black one we had, and I just love it because it's beautiful, of course, but also it holds so much. I no longer have to squeeze things in...

(my local UPS man appears to have untreated anger issues...) I love the color, the size is impressive without hogging all my counter space and the weight (with or without utensils) of the crock will never tip over even in my most hurried grab for a spoon!

Buy it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remove stickers with Veg Oil","review":"There was a sticker on the bottom that was not easily removed. The best way I have found to remove gummy stickers, is with veggie oil or most any cooking oil. Just thought I'd add that info as someone stated they spent a long time removing a sticker. I must say, I don't know what it is today with stickers all over everything one buys, rather insane and the consumer certainly does not appreciate it.The utensil crock is very nice. I like that it shorter than most and wider than any I have came across.One thing I would like to suggest is to customers is, place a paper towel on the inside bottom of your utensil crocks. That is what I do. It keeps the inside bottom cleaner, dust free, and metal utensils you won't have to listen to clanging when they hit bottom.One thing I would like to suggest to manufactures, is to please place some sort of silicone mat inside the bottoms.Great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Le Creuset Stoneware - Cracked","review":"This was shipped as a gift for my parents.

It is large but the width and height allows large utensils to fit nicely in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring Tale From The Inner City","review":"A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints tells the tale of director Dito Monteil's struggle for life and inner peace while growing up in crime-riddled New York, and the escape he barely makes to California. The friends he had become the faces he sees when he pictures who he has become today and, returning years later to help his sick father, he finally faces the people he'd left behind and tried to forget. With gripping performances from Shia LaBeouf and Robert Downey Jr, supported by a talented cast, this movie is a must-see for any fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Saints Here...","review":"My wife and I turned this one off half way through. The only reason we stuck around that long is we were wanting to see these street punks get their @$$ kicked.If you were raised in a big city maybe this is for you. But to watch a bunch of lowlifes go around telling everybody off whom they encounter on the streets (including each other) and with every other word being the f-bomb was hard for us to watch. What a bunch of rude kids.Soundtrack you say...there isn't one. A little music to go along with the dialogue helps any flick but none here...just yelling, cursing, fighting, dogs barking, and car horns, all typical of big city sounds.I wholeheartedly agree with another previewer recommending 'Sleepers' and 'A Bronx Tale'--both excellent movies, but I cannot glorify this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ever!","review":"Loser!If I could have rated this movie NO STARS I would have done it.This is the most depressing and debasing movie EVER!99% of the women/girls are SKANKS! 99% of the men/boys are LOWLIFES!It is over-the-top in vulgarity! There are enough F-bombs to decimate Hiroshima!The only actor in the film worth watching was Dianne Wiest.There is nothing happy in the film whatsoever!

I probably won't ever watch it again. You can tell it's an indie film, especially after watching it. The only thing I like about the movie is the fact that Shia LaBeouf is in it. This movie is very disturbing and really rubs you the wrong way. Lots of violence, very vulgar scenes and language. Definitely not a family movie.

The DVD cover is misleading--neither Dawson or Downy got much time on screen. The \\"plot\\" consisted of young punks chasing girls and using the f bomb about every 2 seconds. I don't know the actual running time, but it felt like a four hour movie. Don't bother watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their problems are our problems, reading about theirs helps us deal with ours","review":"Part of the appeal of Charlie Brown in the Peanuts comic strip is that nearly everyone has a better life than he does. Everything he does fails in one form or another, from trying to kick the football to flying a kite to being a friend. This book concentrates more on the other characters in the strip; a large number of the captions are about Snoopy, Woodstock and Spike. They too have their foibles and desires that remain unsatisfied.Yet through it all, we are amused, for while their problems are similar to ours, we can laugh at that the Peanuts characters because fundamentally they only exist in our minds. As we translate the marks on the paper into events we interpret in our own way, our similar problems become tempered and easier to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice fixture","review":"Not only is this just what I was trying to find in a standard lighting or home supply store, it was also much less expensive than the one fixture I did find. When it arrived, I was very disappointed because the glass was completely shattered. However, I went to my computer, followed the directions for returning it and Amazon shipped my replacement for next day delivery. Amazon provided a no charge return and, of course, I was only charged for the one fixture. Very pleased with both the light fixture and the service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice ultrawide","review":"This lens covers a handy range of focal lengths. At 24mm (equivalent to 35mm on a 35mm film camera) it replicates the popular moderate wide angle that is handy for car shows, architecture, landscapes and group shots.Go down to 12mm, and you get a very wide view, great depth of field, and essentially no barrel distortion.Although there is some overlap in the focal length of the Pentax 10-17mm lens, that one has the pronounced \\"fisheye\\" distortion (though not too much at 17mm), while the 12-24 maintains straight lines (it's \\"rectilinear\\") though if you are tilted up (or down), your subject will lean in (or out).More expensive than some lenses but less than others, I say it is worth it. Its constant f4 maximum aperture is part of the cost (and weight).It is a little bulky, not lightweight, and has a rather large lens hood, so you might have to rearrange your bag divider..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love that wide angle view!!","review":"* Did a lot of research before buying this lens and it is everything I was hoping for. My favorite lenses in the 35mm film range were 24 and 28mm. This lens covers that range with some left on both sides with very little distortion, and the edge to edge sharpness I would expect from a fixed focus. So far I have not noticed any major \\"purple fringing\\" problems that others have in high contrast areas. Since I do all my processing in PS, I am prepared to deal with those as they pop up. I manual focus only so did not test the auto focus aspect of the lens. I personally do not mind the size of the lens hood as long as it does the job it was intended to do. Someday I will buy that 15mm LTD, but I like the ability to zoom instead of switching lenses out the the dust, dirt and sand I find myself shooting in many times. Maybe Pentax will come out with a weather sealed version of this great lens???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pentax Wide Angle Zoom","review":"This is a great lens and was exactly what I was looking for to shoot large objects in tight spaces"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great PDA if the backlight doesn't burn out","review":"I've had my PDA for about a year and never had a major problem however one month after the extended warantee expired my backlight burned out.

No One."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pryor deserved better.","review":"This film was intended to be a drama, but was reworked as they shot it because producers wanted humor added. The result is ridiculous. Still, Richard Pryor starts out very convincing and totally committed to his part. Pryor could have played this straight because he had the chops. It would have been great to see him in a straight drama just this once. There's a point late in the film where his character, Eddie, asks aloud, \\"What are you doin', Eddie?\\" I think Pryor was asking himself the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Hero","review":"Pryor tried to make a POW into a laugh blast. It blew up. It does not work. Could have been done better but they went way out in left field to make him so tragic and his humor just does not pull the plot.

This DVD provides an insight into both. As he travels he plays great tunes that he is able to adapt to the musical style of each location and the people he meets.

Anyone who has ever visited Jamaica will find it all the more entertaining. Several of the past reviewers have already commented on the musical highlights (which were masterfully captured) but for me the most enjoyable aspect of the production was being able to \\"walk with\\" the artist along this adventure. Great added features make this a must have for Ryan Adams fans.

When I watched the DVD, I saw that it has a lot more to offer. The scenes are shot very nicely which makes you absolutely want to go and visit Jamaica. The sound is great and the songs sound even better than all. I was also suprised to see Ryan Adams behaving nicely (I went to his concert recently and he was very mean to the audience). Overall, if you enjoy Ryan Adams' music, this DVD will please you with acoustic versions of some of his songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book No Cliff May Owner Should Be Without","review":"This book has several traits that make it unique among residential architecture books: 1. it was written by the architect it covers 2. it is a reprint of book that was written during the heyday of the homes featured.

It is certainly much better than the plastic plate that comes with the Tungsten. The case has a sturdy feel and protects the PDA very well. As advertised it is slim and fits easily in my pocket. I like the catch that holds the Case closed. It is very convenient to open but never pops open unexpectedly. It is a little clumsy to slide the Tungsten PDA open. I also wish that I did not have to remove the PDA prior to synchronization, although it is not hard to take it in and out. All in all it is a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good looking but lacks good use","review":"I bought this because it seemed very sleek.

It is told by an amzingly insighful young girl who watched with curiosity, absorbed the events occurring around her and mentally recorded them, allowing her to tell the tale 60 years later.

As usual, Mr. Machado tries to be a good lecturer/flight instructor and comdeian but accomplishes neither. He is long winded and overdoes everything. I found this production useless since I already practice what he preaches. The sound qaulity on this video is poorly recorded and difficult to discern at times. The tape caused my VCR to jam.

Just gave up.* Labelling of the channels does not include channel logos (like my LG does; great feature)* Lack of a guide. Kind of stupid to have a cablecard and have to switch to the Comcast STB to see what's on.* PIP seems to be restrictive on what can be in the main picture. You can put the digital tuner in the PIP but you can't activate the PIP if the digital tuner is the main picture (not the PIP)* Menu system is slow.

Other than that, this book was a waste of my time. I hated these characters and basically couldn't see why the author would think I should want to root for them. What happened to Shane was obscene.

I couldn't put this book down and I've sent copies to friends so they could enjoy it. Sure, the jacket got lots of attention on the beach at Fire Island, but it's the writing that makes this a superb read. Doug Guinan is one heck of a story-teller and I can't wait to read whatever he writes next. This books moves and shakes and laughs out loud, and oddly enough, actually had me caring for some seemingly unlikeable characters. Read it...it will confirm what you always suspected lurked behind the captivating eyes of the oh-so manipulative super-beautiful and those that acquire them. I'd like to read the author's take on a New York story next as he's so excellently captured LA here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow bit of fluff, but a fun trashy read.","review":"Guinan's first novel is the literary equivalent of limp celery--not much crunch and very little beneficial effect. The characters are terribly predicitble two-dimensional stereotypes, but they are appropriate for the novel's setting. The ending is a blatant attempt to add some gravitas to the work, but has no subtlety and little believibilty. However, it is an easy, fun read that will not require too much effort. The cover, an obvious ploy to attract the novel's target market, will insure that it sells well and will probably cause some anxiety on the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hugging, no learning","review":"Seinfeld supposedly used this single guiding principle in his sitcom. I hated it. Although I didn't hate this book (much), it suffers from the same flaws. No character is or becomes likable. No one learns anything at the end (except perhaps that they can be bought). And the author for some unknown reason ends the book just when some interesting change seems possible for everyone involved! It made me angry to think I got all the way through the book for this! Will Kevin find happiness in a normal existence or must he return the empty obnoxious world painted for us in the book?It's not that hard of a read and it does have some moments. After all, it did keep my interest for three days, enough to finish it. I guess that's worth something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and trashy and depressing for gay people","review":"I found this book to contain a lot of humorous lines that would be quite appropriate for bar talk, but it lacked any sense of story to keep may attention.

I think this book does nothing to represent the gay community ina positive manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had waited for the paperback version","review":"This book was alright but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to someone. It was a beach read. You really don't have to think that much. I felt the author spent tried more to develop other characters than developing the relationship between Kevin and Brad. I thought the sex scenes you would find in a book like this to be few and far between and rather cheesy. The plot was uneven. For example, it appeared a relationship was developing between Rob and Kim but that never materialized. I also found the book to be full of cliches and snobbish one-liners. Like I said, a beach read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"Definitely a fluff piece. No real story here. Poorly developed characters, some need not even appear in the book.

I picked this book up, expecting shallow yet entertaining (like the hilarious Misadventures In The 213) but all I got was shallow.

I guess if you slap a sexy stomach on the cover, any book can get published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about unlikable characters","review":"Not everything about this book was awful. There are a few funny, witty exchanges and some of the supporting characters are intesesting. However, the two prinicpal characters are dull and so self-absorbed that you never really care what happens to them. I didn't feel the author ever made their romance engaging or even believable.Even though the novel was short, some scenes felt recycled as the story went forward (example: when he feels in someone's debt, Kevin \\"rewards\\" them with flashes of his superb naked body... at several points in the book. I smiled..... the first time.)When I first saw this book at A Different Light bookstore, I thought, \\"that awesome torso on the cover must be compensating for a pretty weak novel\\". I wish I had listened to myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"I thought the book was great. Not every book has to tax your mind like a test book to be entertaining.

Pick it up, I think you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gym rats gone WEHO","review":"What is refreshing and entertaining about this book is that the West Hollywood lifestyle is sent up completely, touching upon and torching the gym culture, the size obsession (steroids and penis enlargement), money, sex, drugs and ATTITUDE. It's an entertaining and vivid indictment and I got not a few laughs out of the author's style and in particular the dialog which is excellent. However, there is not a lot of humanity in the characterizations and although the irony and social comedy reminded me of the writings of Robert Rodi and Ethan Mordden, the people in this story lacked the kind of charisma which would make me care about them. For a social comedy and a cynical but hilarious send-up this is top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollywood dreams make great beach reading","review":"While I found the beginning of California Screaming slow and heavy handed in its descriptions of the LA beautiful crowd, I'm glad I stayed with it. It's a very fast-paced summer read that while filled with every Hollywood stereotype, but you soon realize that Guinan is really just mocking their self agrandizing! All those silly beauty and body building tips, any possible accouterment the perfect penthouse must have; it was all great fun. A couple of problems: I could care less about Leon, the end was a bit disappointing, (Anthony was turning out to be my favorite character) Brad, (the wizard of technology) never mentioned the Internet, but still I came to really like Kevin only after he left LA, but hell, I'm an Easterner."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a horribly disappointing novel","review":"I was really looking forward to this novel after having read \\"Sex Toys of the Gods\\", \\"Glamourpuss\\", \\"Blind Items\\" and several other more involving novels in the gay fiction category. The characters in \\"California Screaming\\" however are obnoxious from the first page. They are extremely shallow and superficial. I could barely get through this novel because I didn't care what happened to them. Not only is every other paragraph about going to the gym but even the characters own thoughts are repetitive. Kevin's continuous reflections on how good he looks were enough to make me nauseated. His character is lazy, unmotivated and has not a single interesting thought. The characters learn nothing in the end and the novel is a complete drag!! There is MUCH BETTER stuff out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book takes \\"shallow\\" to a whole new level","review":"After reading \\"Misadventures in the 213\\" and \\"Sex Toys of the Gods,\\" I was looking for another \\"young people (mostly gay) trying to make it in LA\\" type of book, one of my favorite mini-genres. However, California Screaming is an insult to the term \\"beach read.\\" The characters have no personality, at least no appealing personality. There is no one I could relate to in this entire book. It's just body-worshipping vacancy at its worst. The sex is even lame. If this had been my first \\"gay\\" book, there would have been no second.

I bought with Naxa NCA-670 and didn't think it was going to fit at first. Of course I don't read instructions, figured out that the facing plate was already clipped into opening, so I just had to pull it out first. I also was playing around and clipped the two brackets in on each side of the radio with all the bolt holes, which of course I didn't need for my vehicle/radio. So, I had to unclick them. Also, be careful when you are bending tabs (if radio has a sleeve) on the 'cd pocket' side (bottom of stereo), because when you get it all together you may find that your opening for your cd pocket is construed at the top on the opening because the radio tab(s) is pushing up against it (which I also figured out from trial and error).

I did not need/want the cd shelf, but I cannot really complain on that. The issue was more that the new stereo Dual XML8100 and the 1998 Dodge Dakota required soem additional mounting infrastructure than the kit provided. I modified the kit side panels to mount to the sides of the radio to prevent it from slipping forward and used the stereo's anti theft device to support the backend.

I don't think it could be much simpler than using a kit like this. Keep in mind, it's made to fit 25 years of vehicles, so installation takes a little (very little) thought to get a perfect fit. The CD pocket isn't big enough for a cell phone and too deep for conveniently hold a stereo remote...and I honestly don't know anyone that carries a single CD in their car, in jewel case...but I commend Scosche for trying to make the most of the available space. bottom line, if you have a dodge, get one of these and the Scosche wiring harness and make your install a lot easier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works & is cheaper than Crutchfield or Bestbuy","review":"Purchased this, a wiring harness and an aftermarket stereo system on Amazon for my GF's 1998 Chrysler Cirrus lxi.

Could not pass that up in this economy. Took a risk & ordered it. Decided to get a 3 year Sqaretrade.com accidental damage warranty, just in case something went wrong during installation. All 3 items work great & were a perfect fit for the Chrysler. Quality of the plastic is good & the fit is accurate. Very happy with the purchase, especially considering the price.

Both versions of this song are tired today, but the second and third songs on Side A are well worth hearing. It's a mistake to call them B Sides because all of Side B of the record was carved up into an intricate design that included squiggly and straight lines and a brain and a box of cereal, so, of course, Side B was completely unplayable.

His battle decriptions and his attention to minor troop movements are confusing and essentially unreadable. The maps he provides are completely inadequate in providing a better understanding what took place. The maps can be excused by the fact that they are provided with 19th century technology, his muddled writing style cant be. If you're looking for an enjoyable reading experience that will help you learn more about Chamberlain, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dangerous and frustrating experience. Beware!","review":"First: Even though it's not stated, assembly is required.Second: The assembly is made impossible by screws with poor, easily stripped holes, badly pre-assembled panels and feet that are uneven, resulting in a wobbly final productWhy is this allowed to be sold?

A pretty weird premise (then again look who's distributing it). Great movie for fans of the old roughie genre from the early '60s. Plenty of female flesh to ogle, and some truly absurd and horribly bad movie moments to savor. I do wish that there could have been a commentary added like some of their H.G.

The film is clearly an 18 rated so why the need for the scissors?Anyway the film is ok but the promise of the trailer (and make of that what you will) is not delivered in the film due to the cuts.Shocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful film with historic Navy extra feature","review":"Not ironic.

Hooray, for Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An delightful snaphot inside the human condition","review":"So different was my opinion of The Heart Sutra from that of the previous reviewer (Nov 20) that I wondered if we'd read the same book. It was a collection of gems - each one a carefully crafted and engrossing snapshot of the human condition, with characters so real that you might have met, travelled with, or perhaps even slept with one or two of them. Wilton evokes the real world in vivid colours, tastes and sounds, and manages with great effect to find the poignancy in everyday events. The characters are effected by events around them, but usually react philosophically and with subtlety, often as we ourselves do. Nowhere is the book stagy or overdone.Reading the Heart Sutra is a pleasure from start to finish. These stories should be savoured. Read them one at a time, letting each sink in for a while before starting the next. I eagerly await Wilton's next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight to the heart","review":"My 2 year old actually started to say \\"Please may I...\\" after reading the book to her.

We've had this book for awhile now, and it's still one of our favorites. It's a fun, enjoyable story and has helped my girls learn how to say \\"please\\" when they ask for things, instead of just demanding what they want. The word \\"cookie\\" in the main tag line throughout the book \\"think of a better way to get a cookie,\\" has been replaced in our house with whatever the demand of the moment is. For example, I'll say \\"think of a better way to get a glass of milk,\\" and they will both respond \\"may I PLEASE have a glass of milk,\\" usually with big smiles. It was a fun way for them to get into the habit of saying please.

They are more expensive and harder to use.With any of the new C.A.R.B. compliant spout, including this one, it's a sruggle to fill your car or even your lawn mower. And, don't count on getting out the last drop of gas without removing the cap and using a long transmission funnel. They've been doing that for a few years in Califotnia, already.The only viable alternative is the No-Spill brand with the push button, but those cost twice as much.If you have an older gas can that still works, keep it. If you can find one of the rarer and harder to find old spouts at a local hardware store, buy ALL of them. I've visited 10 stores and discovered that they are all gone, and there will be no more of the old ones. There are a few left on eBay, but they are getting scarce there, too.So, either find the old stuff, or be in store for more and more frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only giving 1 star because I can't rate it a 0 star.","review":"DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE GAS CANS FROM SCEPTER!!!

This is all great fun as you try to wrestle almost forty pounds into the perfect position and maintain the pressure. If this can were to be knocked over the gas would slowly leak out!

If I could rate negative stars, I would. The nozzles are the same for all versions and they ALL LEAK at varying levels, some at a fast drip, some at a steady stream.

I finally found directions on eHow. the scepter site instructions were no help, they didn't address this particular can they address the simplest can. after trying again with the instructions, I finally took off the spout to use a funnel, and found a little cap inside the spout! would it be too much trouble to mention this on the can? After using the funnel to fill my car, I put the cans by the trash. the 1.25 gallon does not have a cap for the tip of the nozzle so you can't block fumes after using the can."},{"rating":"1","title":"an epic abomination","review":"It is indeed \\"spill proof.\\" That's because nothing comes out, until you unscrew it in desperation and spill gasoline all over the intended target, your shoes, your pants, the ground, and any small animals and vegetation, hovering alien spacecraft usw. in the vicinity. Raccoons beware!!! Cheaply made. Poorly designed. Overly expensive. One slightly aberrant twist (guaranteed because of the inherent flaws) and the springs leap from the locking mechanism, never to fulfill the role they never could in the first place. The worst piece of crap I have ever bought in 45 years of life on this planet. I will be shopping at Lowe's instead of Home Depot from now on simply because they sell this garbage. My only regret in writing this is that I have to give it 1 star.

Okay, I understand the need to control emissions, but my complaint is not about the overly complicated locking mechanism. I can open it and pour fuel out. That's not the problem. The problem is the copious amount of fuel that drips out from the sliding section of the nozzle, dripping onto the ground. I've contacted the manufacturer, and they just say to follow the directions. Seems it's no big deal to them for an environmentally friendly, EPA certified, CARB compliant gas can to be leaking gasoline onto the ground because it's so poorly made. Also a little ticked because I'm not talking about a few drops of fuel, I'm talking about a couple of ounces of wasted fuel.Update: The manufacturer actually did send me two replacement nozzles at no charge, and these don't seem to be leaking. So, I'll give it two stars since the manufacturer did help."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as the government could make it","review":"Used as directed, I got more gasoline on myself and the mower than in the tank.I resolved the situation in my favor with super-glue. A modest application of the glue to the green sleeve in \\"clicked\\" position, followed by a bit more glue with the spout depressed did the trick. So configured, gas will S-L-O-W-L-Y flow into the receptacle of my choice.Having circumvented the \\"adult-proof\\" features of the device, I can still say that it's completely worthless. As another reviewer suggested, buy yourself a proper funnel, preferably with a filter, and simply skip this whole spout nonsense.For pouring fuel into a leaf-blower or weed-trimmer, you might want to consider using a glass bottle as a transfer receptacle.

I bought it because it was the cheapest. What a complete waste! I was unable to get gas from it because the childproof mechanism to regulate air intake wouldn't work. Eventually I torqued off one of the springs in the mechanism accidentally which rendered it even more useless.The only way I was able to use this device was to drill a hole at the base of the spout (use the drill away from the gas well or you may win yourself a darwin award). However my modification means now the can leaks vapor when the spout is out...I got it to work, but more out of frustration.Bottom line...don't buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst product - no instructions","review":"Had to call the company on how to use it!!!!!!!

As other reviewers have noted, Willie sort of slides through one song after another during the first part of the DVD with idiosyncratic (or lazy) deliveries that lack fire and enthusiasm. The last third is somewhat better but all in all you don't finish watching with a very positive impression. He doesn't seem to really connect with the audience even though there are camera shots of people clearly enjoying themselves. Nelson's guitar playing is one of the few strong points and even with a \\"lead\\" guitarist playing as well, Willie plays a lot and well.

When it stops, the unit shifts into \\"keep warm\\" mode. It works the same for slow cooking: Just set the timer and forget it. You can return to a meal that's warm and not overcooked.

The rice is passable but certainly not the best we've had - our very old National rice cooker produced better rice. Also disappointing is the lack of a retractable electrical cord - winding the electrical cord around a chintzy metal cord holder (unstrategically located at the bottom of the cooker) gets old very quickly. Lastly, the fancy electronic display is not very informative when cooking rice. (It may be more helpful when using the appliance as a slow cooker - but we thought we were buying a rice cooker.)Bottom line: it looks like a Krups, does not perform like one, and, with all its good looks, is decidedly un-ergonomic in its design.

You can pretty much control your entire Tungsten T with the keyboard -- and I didn't even read the instruction manual, so if I had read it, maybe I could do even more...

It is light, portable, and it responds as well as a normal keyboard. The one downside, which I recently discovered, is that it won't work with the newer class of Palm Devices, explaining why it is so inexpensive now. When I first purchased a keyboard, it was to go along with a Zire 71 handheld. That handheld died, forcing me to upgrade to the newer Zire 72. Much to my surprise, Palm changed the connection for their PDA's, rendering the wonderful little typing device useless.So, if you are using one of the older models that it can work with, I would certainly say that it is a good buy. But, I would not count on it to last you for generations of Palm devices to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tungsten C","review":"This keyboard did not work with my Tungsten C.

And also admittedly, the author straight off the bat says that if you are looking for pure architecture on Wren look at another book, or pure scientific theories of Wren also look at another book. However, I was hoping for a middle ground. The book delves more into the turbulence of the times and how that affected young Wren's monetary standing. Lots of info about minor characters. Lots of overly long and redundant quotes from archaicly written (obviously) source materials that the author has to paraphrase almost word for word after the quote.

This is a very uplifting story about how Olive finally comes to discover her dreams at the North Pole.

It has an adjustable heat control which makes it handy for a variety of foods. The use of multiple trays and the option of adding several additional trays gives it a very good capacity for jerky making. It took me about 4 - 5 hours to make a batch of turkey jerky. Since this units uses 750 watts, it's important that it not take too long to dry the meat. Otherwise, the cost of electricity could make it expensive. The unit also has an overheat-mounted fan to circulate the air. This greatly speeds up the drying process and promotes more uniform drying over static convection-type driers. I am quite happy with its performance. The only downside is that the unit is made in China rather than in the US, but that's become the rule these days with much merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 of the sets was warped badly","review":"I ordered 3 sets of these and 1 of the sets was warped badly.

The problem lies with the center air passage which is about a 1/2\\" taller than my original trays. They will nest with each other and presumably other models but not with the FD-75PR. I was skeptical that maybe my dehydrator was not the model I thought it was so I double checked the inside.

It was with no shortage of excitement that I grabbed up a copy of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" back in October of 2000, but the result was severely underwhelming. Apart from some of their earliest albums, this is my least-used U2 disc. I know the critics are ranting and raving, and have been since its release nearly two years ago, but I'm left with a sour taste in my mouth.

Although the first half of the cd is better...the whole cd is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze-Fest","review":"I have been a longtime fan of U2 (introducing my entire dorm floor to \\"Boy\\") but this album is a major letdown. There is enough music today that is designed to induce sleep. U2 did not need to join those ranks. Where's Edge's guitar on this album? If you are a 12-year-old who think's Bono and his voice are \\"dreamy,\\" this album is for you. If you appreciate what U2 used to be, don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Day. Is there anything else?","review":"After hearing \\"Beautiful Day\\" I thought they were back. I'm not expecting Joshua Tree caliber out of them, but I was hoping for something on par with Achtung Baby. At least that album had some fire and originality in it. The remaining songs are consistently bland, go nowhere, and leave your mind a wandering. Really disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave it behind","review":"I feel this album makes for great car music,really. But it's sort of a concept album. \\"Walk on\\" reminds me of Pink Floyd's \\"Eclipse\\" from Dark side of the Moon. I haven't heard any other CDs by U2, but I also haven't heard many CDs quite this good. I highly recommend it. That'sall I can realy say about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have been getting older","review":"I dont know what was wrong with this album, I can't place my finger on it... I grew up listening to U2, been to 3 concerts and still can't quite figure out what is up with this album... Oh yeah, I know now... I got older and this is not the U2 that I remember from the early years... even as far back as Achtung Baby and Pop, this is a totally different sound from U2 than Im used to... I cant say its better or worse, just different. If you are a U2 fan, you should get this album, just cause its freakin U2 for godsakes, but if you arent, I would still recommend it... what more do you want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 - It's a \\"Beautiful Day\\" when you listen to this!","review":"With all of the 80's bands fading away, U2 is only getting better. I listen to this CD soo much, I have to stop because I don't want to get tired of it. Just about every song on this album is great. I usually select certain songs from my CD's, NOT THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old, socially conscious U2 fans disappointed.","review":"If you like the older, social commentary style of U2 music, this release is not for you. This was the first U2 I had bought in a few years and now I can remember why. This is definately a pop sell out album. I guess they had fallen behind in the castle and sportcar payments. YAWN. Too bad I did not think to save my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Forgettable Embers","review":"well, die hard fans must be pretty hard up. calling this the best album since Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby is absurd. at best, it sounds like U2 put a compilation of \\"B\\" sides for release. oh, but they did that 2 years ago and it was more satisfying! What happened to the songs that left to wanting more like \\"With or Without You\\" & \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". What happened to the wail Bono's voice as in \\"One\\", \\"Pride\\" or \\"ULTRA Violet\\". What was always great about U2 was it's ability to be innovators and at the leading edge of progressive music. Even POP was a better album, if only because of it's inventive & exploratory nature.i would imagine Daniel Lanois is wishing he would have better spent his time producing \\"Red Dirt Girl\\" with Emmy Lou Harris.i feel badly about this harsh review, but i was so let down! i'm a big fan of U2's music, but i was more satisfied with \\"Million Dollar Hotel\\" than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"as bad as everything they've done recently","review":"This album started the U2 decline, at least in terms of art. Half an album is just filler. It includes probably their worst tunes ever - Grace, In A Little While and Wild Honey -. The hype worked at that time, but not anymore. Fans have realised they were fooled by this mainstream product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sellout begins...","review":"This is it,folks, this is the album where it all changed for u2-from a creative musically interesting group of artists that never liked to stick to one sound for too long to a corporate pop singles-driven commodity..this album has no spark at all,only beautiful day is worth anything at all on this pointless collection of synthetic nostalgia throwbacks..just an excuse to sell-out stadiums..might as well you already sold out your integrity,u2..time for another i-pod commercial,lads?If only the bono of the 80's could see what he's become today..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance.","review":"For those of you who hate this album, I say give it a chance. The first few times I listened to it, I thought it was [bad].I realize that it is quite possibly one of their best albums to date. For those of you that say it lacks passion, you obviously didn't see them perform these songs on their current tour. It was awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a masterpiece, but still a great comeback effort","review":"I am simply a casual U2 fan; I don't own their entire catalog or anything like that. This album is not an epic masterpiece in the way The Joshua Tree was, but of all the U2 albums I have heard, this one is the most listenable and satisfying of the bunch. It is the only U2 album I can consistently listen to from start to finish, because I find their other efforts to be, although excellent, somewhat overbearing and best heard in small doses.The band sounds excellent as always on this album, and I think they sound more comfortable than ever. The music seems to flow effortlessly, never becoming ponderous. Lyrically speaking, the album does not seem to have as much of the weighty political and religious references as other records, which contributes to its overall lighter feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"As beautiful as a Summer's Eve?","review":"Cleansing. A spiritual reawakening. As reinvigorating as a fresh pot of morning java. After scaling the heights of utter stupidity with POP!, U2 has returned to form nicely. This CD makes you want to relieve yourself, it's so relaxing. Go ahead, let loose. Bono will lead you."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"All that you can't leave behind\\", except maybe this album!","review":"This has to be a low point in U2's recording history. A fan since the early years, they've dampened my enthusiasm with this latest installment. Worthy of note are tracks 1, 3 and 9. The rest can be relegated to the 'B sides'! What happened to creative genius and imagination. Some of the lyrics are diabolically bad (New York!?! - what the hell!) Hard to believe that this same band released The Joshua Tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very forgettable, not even a spark much less a fire","review":"U2 has managed to hang onto their massive popularity for a good long time now, with passing decades and styles. For that I give them credit. Obviously they know full well what they are doing and do not need my support. However, as a music fan, I'm still not sold on the music that U2 are peddling these days. In stark comparison to their '80's pomp-rock classics, their current work seems soulless, lifeless and even worse, just plain dull. There isn't any of the anger that defined (to me, anyway) their sound. A good friend explained to me that an aging millionaire can no longer sing the blues. That rings true enough insofar as either of us know. But that also doesn't mean that the music will mean as much. It doesn't, not at all. U2 are now a fairly pleasant pop rock band, nothing more, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"frightful dreck","review":"So bad it could bust my speakers and burn my stereo upon contact. U2 was a moderately talented but marginally inspired band whose day has long since passed. Even if released in '00, this album deserves it's place on one of those dreadful \\"best of the nineties\\" CD's that've been going around."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!! Hypocrisy, thy name is YOU TOO.","review":"This pop collection is designed for those young at heart (but with graying temples) who gorge themselves full and cheat regularly on their mates (yet want to show how sensitive they are by crying to Christmas inspired songs).Seriously, this pseudo-music is the final proof that U2 are comparable to backstreet boys: they want your love, love,love and your money.to think that they used to write songs about social injustice..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dud...","review":"the songs on this record follow one of 2 formulas: Bono talks his way thru a pompous lyric over a bed of synths and Edge's echoey guitar, Bono talks his way thru the first minute/2 minutes and then the chorus comes blasting at you. these songs have no melodies whatsoever. as a result, the songs are duuuulll. Peace On Earth and especially, Grace...are stupifying. Grace is deadly, deadly dull. Bono's lyrics are mostly just bad poetry. the exceptions are Elevation(which is great)and Wild Honey(which is eh). this cd is wildly overpraised."},{"rating":"1","title":"once a great band","review":"Having been a U2 fan for years, I was looking foreward to the release all that you can't leave behind because it was the band's first album in 3 and half years. I got the CD when it came out hoping for an album like boy, war or the joshua tree. Beautiful Day was a pretty good song and I expected U2 to return to their 80s roots. Unfortately, all that you can't leave behind lacked the emotion, drive or creativity that marked previous U2 efforts. I had difficulty making it through the album because there was little to keep my attention.Hopefully U2 will get it right next time but until then I will be listening to the Unforgettable Fire"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Stuff U2 Left Behind","review":"Ahem... I know I other reviewers will give me heck for this review but I have been a fan for a very long time and this is just not all that everyone is cracking it up to be. \\"The third masterpiece,\\" as Rollingstone magazine claimed it, is way unfounded. True, 'Beautiful Day', 'Grace' and 'When I Look at the World' are good songs and worthy of being on a U2 release. But what the heck has happened to Bono's lyrics? The bubblegum that fills up 'Elevation' and 'Wild Honey' makes me want to stuff my ears. I laugh at myself for saying this but there is just too much Bono on this record.I know it's unfair to say \\"I liked them better when they were _______.\\" but their latest release, depsite its pleasant re-direction in sound, is nothing more than tidy little song structure with little heart and a catchy hook here and there. Heck, Edge encourages us to go download the whole thing. I encourage it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I really dont like this cd. There are a few great songs on it like spanish eyes and elevation, but other than that, I really dont understand the hype its getting. Now, dont get me wrong, I absolutely adore U2 and think they are musical geniuses ... but this cd just doesnt cut it for me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Amazing that these guys advertise themselves as the worlds greatest rock band.....when they aren't ROCK!!!! These losers are an insult to ROCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult to mainstream","review":"U2 enter the 2000, rocking and a rolling but with Bono's stupid long hair. Bono roars vocally through the opening song but the musical backing is unimaginative, to say the least. A power rock reasonably faced paced ballad, if that makes sense. But, without a single inventive guitar line, with absolutely nothing new and also without much of a pop edge, either. Beautiful day is reasonably catchy, but Bono sounds raw.ATYCLB it's just so - commercial. So ordinary in it's commercial intent. They play it safe, everywhere. That's about it. This is a fairly unremarkable album, all told. It lacks direction, generally, there seems to be a general laziness surrounding the album. The lyrics are nothing at all, just mere words that mean nothing - just listen to Elevation - there aren't enough ideas in any of these 11 commercials.I say that. U2 can now be classified as a 'veteran' group"},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as \\"Pop\\" ?","review":"As an old U2 fan, I was waiting for this new album for some impatience. \\"Pop\\" was a *terrible* attempt to make something techno. Those guys should have sticked to what made their success in the 80's... Now, \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" is just a juxtaposition of junk music. Maybe 2 or 3 singles are good, the others just don't cut the mustard. Very far away from \\"Achtung Baby\\", \\"Joshua Tree\\" or even \\"War\\". 2 stars, isn't that too much ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope!","review":"Oh, how it pains me to give U2 two stars...but I must. As much as I respect this band for constantly reinventing its sound, always experimenting with new ideas and music genres, I'm disappointed in this cd. With the exception of Beautiful Day (which is a brilliant song, beautifully arranged), there was nothing else on this effort that piqued my interest, or made me care about the music at all. That said, I must admit I was never a big fan of The Joshua Tree (I'm not afraid to admit it), so if you like that album you'll probably love this one. I just couldn't get into it...sorry guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sob! Choke! Sniffle!","review":"What happened? I've read quite a few reviews that read that U2 has finally plunged into the pop genre. I didn't know too many pop lovers that would say U2 is a good band, that is, until now. All of a sudden...U2 is playing on pop radio stations...and hardly at all on rock or classic rock stations (except for their old tunes of course). For me, I really tried. I REALLY did. It didn't work. I don't even think I can listen to the entire CD all the way through. It's boring, \\"popish\\", and the lyrics are down right awful. I was surprised with the turnout of this CD, I had been waiting it's arrival intensly. Maybe i expected too much?"},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU CAN NEVER GO HOME AGAIN!","review":"I awaited this album with great trepidation. The reviewers were quick to laud it as rocks saving grace, a return to when instrament and lyrics combined to tell a story, lift emotions and inspire. What I recieved was the antithesis of all the pundits glowing reviews. \\" Beautiful Day\\" is the only track that has any artistic merit whatever. If you are looking for vintage U2 try thier Greatest Hits, released last year with a companion disk of B-sides and covers that is a true return to rocks melodious side. It will be easy for me to leave this tripe behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 Has Lost it. Sad day for me, I loved them.","review":"U2 has gone over the hill, and has reached the bottom rather quickly. I love U2, or at least I used to. They have gone through the kind of change the beatles went through near the end. Their music has no more meaning. In a sense, they have sold out big time. I miss the heartfelt songs of the early eighties...where did they go and why did you leave them? I do not want instramentals...I want U2! I want With or Without you, Where the streets have no name, One, Mysterious Ways, Unforgetable Fire, New Years Day, and all the other greats. Alas, they are gone, along with the U2 I once new. Sorry U2, I no longer know you or your music. Goodbye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you listen to 'Kite'","review":"If you have purchased or are about to purchase this album, please make sure that you listen to 'Kite'; I think that it is the best track on the album.Musically, it is a bare, beautiful song, containing U2's distinct sound and some of Bono's best vocals to date. Also, while the lyrics are simple, the last stanza is brilliant.I read a Rolling Stone interview with Edge on U2.com in which he mentions that he is proud of the track, but not sure it will be released as a single as it is a slow song (paraphrased). Though releasing singles is not a true measure of artistic quality of a track or an album, I hope that the band will consider putting this one out. Aside from being a beautiful song, I think that 'Kite' would give music fans hope (and proof) that rock and roll is not dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected MUCH more from U2","review":"I have been a huge U2 fan since War, and I was really excited when they released this album. But I have to say that it is not one of their greatest efforts in my opinion. The keyboards are a bit amplified on most songs, and Bono seems to have become a little tone-deaf in his old age. I don't know why, but his vocals seem a little weak and off-key. If you love U2, I recommend you listen to this cd somewhere before buying it for yourself, otherwise you may be in for a surprise. Beautiful Day was my favorite from this CD, and most of the other songs sound similar to each other and are just boring. U2 is still the greatest though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over produced, over rated and under done","review":"I bought into the media hype and bought this one thinking it was some kind of rebirth for U2. From the interviews, they sound embarassed by their work over the past few albums and felt they needed to 'rock' again. I'm not sure what they think they recorded but what they released is dull and lazy. The lyrics amazed me. It's like they aren't even trying anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody terrible","review":"I was a U2 fan since Joshua tree (1987) but THIS is the worst U2 album in their entire career!Pathetic, hypocrite and dejavu - it's TOTALLY forced record.Like someone said, they were doing auto-pilot recording.The lyrics are also the worst ever - Bono has never written so pathetic and hypocrite lyrics!Definitely - All the things you must leave behind - if you want to listen to U2 again and not to get sick or irritated.The last 'real U2' album was Zooropa."},{"rating":"1","title":"On further listening...","review":"First let me say that I didn't much care for U2 prior to Achtung Baby. I didn't mind hearing them on the radio, but didn't feel the need to own anhy of their albums. Achtung Baby, Zooropa and Pop changed that. Each album charted new ground for the band; they were interesting if nothing else. This album puts U2 back on my \\"don't need to buy\\" list. Beautiful Day and Eleveation are the only stand out songs for me on this disc; everything else is at best okay to listen to, but not exciting. Some of it is just boring. I guess U2 has returned to their \\"roots\\", but without any real enthusiasm for it. The songs, as I said are almost all unoffensive, but none of them stick in your head afterword; kind of like rock muzak. Only a couple of songs are cringingly bad (Peace On Earth, Grace), with the lifeless music overwhelmed by even worse lyrics. I think long time U2 fanatics will like this very much, but if, like me, you only found U2 to be worth your time recently, avoid this disc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back boys!","review":"U2's first albums were more raw and unpolished. The band peaked in the development of their early style on the trilogy of the Unforgetable Fire, Joshua Tree, and Rattle and Hum. Then, they reinvented themselves with Achtung Baby, and spent the last 10 years in an experimental stage. I personally didn't care much for their 90's work.All That You Can't Leave Behind is a polishing of their 80's work coupled with the creative development of their 90's period. That and a dose of pop music mixed in. With some years behind them their maturity shows here. This is a great album, one I didn't care for at first, but which grew on me as I listened to it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd impression","review":"really 2 and 3/4 stars. i fall into the category of the u2 fan that was initially disappointed by but willing to give this album a chance. after my first few listens i gave it a week off and then listened again. i now like it more than i did but do not consider it a strong release. i feel that the first several songs on it are good, but, there is what seems to be a good portion of this album where the songs really do fall short. it sounds like the band loses direction and these songs sound very formulaic, in both music and lyrics. i would consider it a possible transition album from their 90's work into whatever direction they take in the decade ahead. the \\"greatest ever\\" rave reviews for this album could be setting up unrealistic expectations for a majority of fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 outstanding tracks - rest a bit average","review":"I would term this a good album - but not great as a lot of people are saying. The single, Walk On, When I Look At The World and New York are all brilliant. The rest are all a bit weak. A lot of the tracks are slow .... which is not U2's forte. There are some notable exceptions on other albums(One, Bad etc.).I do not profess to be U2's greatest fan but agree with most that ATYCLB is their best work since Achtung Baby, which , in my opinion is within the top 3 greatest albums ever made. So far ahead of its time and not a single weak track on it. Pity about the stupid title though.Anyway, this is about ATYCLB. A step in the right direction. Well done lads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell yes! U2 Rocks Forever!","review":"This is U2 at it's best. \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\" is just an excellent song as is \\"Kite.\\" \\"Elevation\\" has that funky sound that was so evident on their other albums Acthung Baby and Pop. I absolutely love this album. Every song is pleasing to the ears. I just got this CD yesterday and I've already memorized most of the songs. I would reccomend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Addition","review":"While I don't believe Joshua Tree will ever be topped or the sound of the early days will ever really be repeated, this is by far one of U2's best albums. U2 is inconsistenly great, the sound on this album is a nice change to what I believe is rock at its best, pure and simple (but never basic or bland!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This fire is forgettable","review":"I grew up with this band back in the 80's and many of their earlier works were high school anthems for us. War, Boy, October, Red Rocks, etc... all electrified us. But I guess when you've done what this band has done then there's not much room for improvement - and this cd shows it. This cd lacks any emotion or chemistry. It clearly tries to pick up where Achtung Baby left off, but fails. It's basically, well....boring. Nothing here really rocks or moves the soul. Most of the cd just plods along, with a few peaks here and there, and then gracefully ends. Nothing can last forever and U2's ability to crank out masterpieces is no exception. I would have rated this cd a 1, but I like U2 and felt compelled to at least give it a 2 for effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEIR BEST; EVEN BETTER THAN JOSHUA TREE!","review":"Six years now since the release, and this magnificent grouping of songs is still fresh!

But of the albums that they have created, The Unforgettable Fire, The Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby being the best, these were albums of their time, and had never been done before.U2 tried to do be originalwith Zooropa and Pop. (I personally think that Zooropa was one of their greatest albums)but they were not altogether greeted by the popular music media.This is a great album, one of their best. If you love U2, then you'll really love this. Buy It."},{"rating":"2","title":"the real thing","review":"U2 has made a lot of great music in twenty years, which makes the power and emotion of this cd all the more remarkable. ATYCLB is like a compendium of what makes this Irish band stand head and shoulders above other artists: personal lyrics set to anthemic music ringing with the clarity of Edge's guitars. In fact, the Edge's role as sonic architect of U2 is really on display here, and I now see how important his role has been all along (and I have been a fan since 1983.) ATYCLB is all that makes music so vital to life because it reflects and focuses all that makes life what it is: the expectation and loss of love ('Walk On'); the eternal promise of tomorrow ('Beautiful Day'); how painful it is to see a friend destroy himself ('Stuck in a Moment.') All I can say is that we are the better for U2 keeping on, and do yourself a favor and go see them in 2001 on tour: you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too forced","review":"I have to agree with the last reviewer.

As another reviewer put it, \\"this is their third masterpiece.\\" Just get it :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"New York...Miami Part 2 perhaps?","review":"This is a great album, but I am a little knit picky when it comes to U2 titling their songs. They should have named the song New York as New York(MiamiPart2)because basically the song is a sequel to POP's Miami, only this time the character visits another North American city. But don't listen to my anal criticisms, All that You Can't Leave Behind is a must have for U2 fans the world over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This cd was very moving.

It was very inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for U2 to Leave it All Behind.","review":"Oh what a huge disappointment! And this coming from a woman who only really understood fanaticism through my obsession with Bono ten years ago. This album sounds so dispassionate and flat.

I'm off to sell my copy to the highest bidder!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"getting strong again","review":"YEap, Bono's voice was getting stronger after the crap Zooropa/Pop period. Very good songs despite some not-so-good (as Peace on earth (good lyrics, though), New York and Grace).Nice to listen to, but not as nice as HOW to dismantle an Atomic bomb, when Bono's voice streched out and no filler was admitted entrance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I'm a huge U2 fan but this album is a disappointment. The songs are very mediocre by U2 standards and the album, as a whole has none of the passion and heart of past U2 efforts. It is not fair to expect a \\"Joshua Tree\\" or \\"War\\" every time but they can do better than this. Bono's voice sounds strained and some of his lyrics are just plain bad John Lennon/Beatles rip-offs (not the first time Bono has done this). The Edge's usual great guitar work is also absent here. U2 is a great band and are capable of recording fantastic music but this album is far from great."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exciting disappointment","review":"I was really looking forward to this album based on the pre-release reviews that the songs were reminiscent of Unforgettable Fire and I am real happy to report that the songs are indeed of that genre. Unfortunately the \\"voice\\" isn't. Bono's range is noticeably stretched on almost every track on this album and some of the songs seem to actually be written to accomadate his shortcomings. In addition, the production seems muddy, ala \\"Exile on Main Street\\". That style worked for the Rolling Stones; it does not work for U2. So, 4 stars for the songs less one for the vocals less one for the production equals a disappointing two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to you U2???","review":"Ever since Achtung Baby, U2's music has gotten from bad to worse. long gone are the days of their rebel, political albums, such as Boy, October, War, and The Unforgettable Fire.

But my favorite U2 album was \\"War\\", \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" was Ok, and from there they completely lost their edge, pun intended. To me, U2 was at their best when they played as angry as anyone in Punk, but were [a lot] more talented. They softened as they got rich, and that will never come back. This is not a return to \\"War\\". Maybe \\"The Joshua Tree\\", which although it is regarded as the \\"peak\\" of U2's musicmanship, I thought it [was bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still left wanting more...","review":"For someone who has followed U2 with great expectations of every release since Boy (including wondering what this band would sound like on their second album after hearing \\"I will follow\\") I feel very unsatisfied. Having only listened to the CD twice, perhaps it will \\"grow on me\\". I want very much to like it (which in itself is a sad statement).While many people trashed Pop, it had signaled to me a new beginning that veered in a very interesting direction. As I type my comments, I am reminded of a thought a friend of mine shared a long tome ago, something to the effect of \\" a band can only make so many vicious albums\\".

Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"this album is so heartless and commercial that it baffles the mind. how could a band that made such outstanding music at one time in their career subject itself and its listeners to such overhyped crap! have you even listened to the music and lyrics to \\"beautiful day\\" and \\"elevation?\\" my god, you'd expect this from a sophomore effort, not from a band that's been around. supposedly, their intent was to move away from some of their recent experimental offerings once they realized that techno wasn't the hype everyone thought it was going to be and they needed a new bandwagon to jump onto. seeing the writing on the wall that their \\"direction\\" was nowhere, they opt for rehashing (or attempting to rehash) what they once were. totally disasterous. for bono to state that \\"they're applying for the job as the best band in the world,\\" is laughable. save us the time. radiohead and belle and sebastian beat you to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 puts out a wonderful easy listening album","review":"I'm sorry, but I can't understand all the five star reviews that peope are giving to U2's new perscription sleeping aid. I'm sorry to say it but they've gone the way of the Rolling Stones. Don't you guys remember the ferver and intensity U2 used to have (think zoo TV tour). This album puts me to sleep, I still can't remember what half of the songs look like. Hopefully Bono and company will put a lttle more depth into the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one seriously overrated album (AND IT'S TOTALLY BORI","review":"Beatiful day was a good track. I really like it. The rest of the album............-sucked. All the songs, except for Beatiful, were trash. Completely boring. People who give this piece of trash five stars need to learn a liitle more about music. Boring Guitar Rhythms, boring drums, boring bass, and completely forgettable vocals. Lyrics are a lame attempt to be poetic and that about sums it up. Download beatiful day off of itunes or something, but forget about the rest of the album. I wasted my money big time on this disc. I haven't listened to it for like 5 years because it is just so pathetic. U2 IS CAPABLE OF MAKING SOME GOOD MUSIC, BUT WITH THIS DISC THEY FAILED."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good disc","review":"I've heard a lot of people talking about how wonderful adn how masterful U2's last 2 albums were. Personally, I think that they weren't. The techno feeling of both discs (Pop and Zooropa) just didn't seem like the same band that released such ballads like \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" or \\"With or Without you\\". This album however, goes back to basics in a sense. A lot of things are better about this album. The writing is fabulous for one thing. Also, the instrumentals aren't crammed into a fake beat like on the prevoius albums. The CD just sounds more natural, more real.This is a must have for all U2 fans, new and old. Whether you're a Joshua Tree era fan or a techno era fan, buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but thankful for it still","review":"It's been a while since I've looked forward to an album release. Since reading a while back that this ATYCLB was a return to roots sort of album - I was optimistic. Well - I'm not as euphoric as I was the first time I heard the Joshua Tree on a midnight record debut. And no anthems in the vein of Pride, or Sunday Bloody Sunday. But there are songs here that from the start stirred my soul - Stuck in Moment, Walk On, and Peace on Earth are small gems. Only Elevate and to a certain extent New York let me down. All in all, a good listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2","review":"Great album. Go out and get it NOW!!! Personal favorites....track 4 and I love track 1.

It features Bono's gift for writing clever, insightful, and personal lyrics and The Edge's classic guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 ATYCLB (Limited Edition)","review":"I just picked up my limited edition of All That You Can't Leave Behnid, the new U2 album (Oct 31, 2000). Many have already heard this album, since it leaked out on the net a few weeks ago. As for the music, it's absolutely great, truly a classic U2 album. The limited edition is worth it in my opinion, as it comes bundled with an extra single, the unreleased Summer Rain. The sound of this album is much simpler than anyhting the band did in the 90s. An EXCELLENT listen, I have no room for specifics here, but the vocals also sound much stronger than those of Pop, the 1997 release. This album has been getting absolutely positive press everywhere is is a must have for those with an even moderate interest in U2."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG STEP BACKWARDS","review":"After covering new ground with Pop, U2 have opted to take a step backwards and deliver a collection of songs which sound like their older efforts, only not as good. It leaves you thinking, why bother? If all they want to do is rehash their old stuff, why not just release the second half of their greatest hits collection, do a few stadium gigs and be remembered fondly, rather than going downhill. And as for \\"Beautiful Day\\", has nobody ever listened to Ah-Ha's \\"The Sun Always Shines On T.V.\\" ?? (obviously U2 have!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Today's album is the 1st album of the rest of their lives","review":"If this had been U2's very first album, we'd all be shaking in our boots. No other band in the history of rock would've measured up in passion, heart or soul. But, this isn't a first album. It's many albums later. And, a band that could've fallen flat on its face has stood up so tall we can't even see the top of its head from down here. There's a bluesey feel trickling in, and an unmistakable gut. From the illustrious \\"New York\\" to what has become my all-time-favorite U2 tune, \\"Walk On,\\" the music transports you through portals of emotion, love...sacrifice...forgiveness...injustice. I've been a U2 fan for 17 years, and, thus far, this is my favorite album of theirs. How can a band so \\"old\\" remain so fresh? If only I could mature as graciously and beautifully as they have. Rock on, U2!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave this one behind!","review":"If you like anything that U2 has ever done, you must get this CD! U2 has had many \\"styles\\" over the years, but this one really seems to capture the best of everything they've done. If you're a Joshua Tree fan, you won't be disappointed. Or if you're more of an Achtung Baby fan (like me), you won't be disappointed, either.Don't get me wrong though, this stuff is still very original. They didn't just copy what worked in the past. The rhythms are totally new and just phenomenal (you won't be able to get \\"Elevation\\" out of your head for days!). The only thing that isn't new is that Bono is still writing beautiful, poetic lyrics that make you think - no trite love songs here. And The Edge is as fantastic as ever (and Mullen and Clayton are too).U2 deserves Album of the Year for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 comes home","review":"U2 returns to form with their newest effort. Not that the experimental sonics of Zooropa and Pop were a bad thing, but All That You Can't Leave Behind simply has a stronger collection of basic songs than their previous two efforts. This is an album along the lines of Rubber Soul or Beck's Mutations, simple melodies filled with introspection and passion. The background noise hasn't dissappeared, it just lies hidden until the third or fourth listen. Edge's guitar is restrained but masterful. The rythym section is tight. And Bono is at his vulnerable best."},{"rating":"1","title":"the beginning of the end???","review":"Has ok singles but the rest is sadly poor, and now with their new release being even more bad, I wonder if they'll ever be great again???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!","review":"I do not understand why more people do not feel the way that I do about this album -- this album has given me songs to listen to that seem to get better with every playing, and that both lift you up, give you something to think about and tug at your heart. This album truly is a sort of homecoming for U2, and all I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you for a wonderful masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"why do i like it","review":"U2 has never disappointed me before, and i can say this album is wonderful as always why?- well, its simplicity in expressing the feelings on one side, and so tehnicaly perfect on the other side is a thing that impress me the mostthey are so simple, but also so different, so special, so perfect"},{"rating":"2","title":"A LIFELONG FAN SPEAKS","review":"I have been a fan of U2 since War and I consider the core emotion of my love of the band stems from the War-Joshua Tree era.

With ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND I feel I've had a visit from an old, loved friend. I love this album. It makes me want to sit down and talk to the artist. The emotion, depth and seriousness that I love U2 for absolutely POURS from this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the hype","review":"After all the hype leading up to this album, I was extremely disappointed in the end result.

I went to the ATYCLB Listening Party here in Mexico, and I know for sure THIS IS THE BEST U2 ALBUM EVER !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too shallow, too bright","review":"This new album is above all a disappointment after the brilliant \\"pop\\" album. \\"Pop\\" was dark, full of pain, fear & confusion. U2 tried to experiment with different kinds of electronic music and disturbing rhythms. They captured the chaos of modern times. This new album lacks the seriousness and depth of \\"pop\\". The songs about world problems (when I look at the world, peace on earth) don't convince as much as \\"wake up dead man\\" on \\"pop\\". If you like the more happier music, I suppose this record appeals more than Pop. But if you like the darker, yet richer of meaning, stuff. Go back and listen to Pop. This new one sounds all too familiar. Some songs sound like you heard them before. Are we sure \\"beautiful day\\" is a new song ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless!!!!","review":"I thought U2 was nice, hearing the radio I never thought of the fact that the album could be a complete letdown. Well, I should have done that. I bought this, and it sucks, the first five songs are good, but then....:C, not good at all. Next time, I'll stick with the hits, and that is exactly what you should do.

Keep On Rocking!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really all that great","review":"This record is really pretty average if you ask me. Every single was really fairly average and when I finally heard the CD at work it really sounded terrible. It sounds like some really average new adult alternative band or it sounds like a band fading away and fast. I guess U2 did take a step forward from the last album, but that isn't saying much because the last album was so bad. Just look for War, Achtung Baby, and Joshua Tree before you go out and buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I never understood the attraction that most people have for this band. They spend way to much time polishing mediocre tunes. Although produced very nicely, the songs on thier own do not hold up.

Pure greatness for the greatest band on Earth!Just listen to \\"Kite\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Over","review":"How can the mighty have fallen so far? One of the greatest bands in the world has devolved into a mockery of itself - the U2 I knew and loved is long dead and this is far from a suitable epitaph. The Irish lads promised this would be a return to their classic style, with The Edge's beautiful, ringing guitar standing out once more; I can't hear it, at least not for more than a few seconds. The album offers up three \\"good\\" tracks, and they all pale in comparison to what this formerly great band produced in its heyday - \\"Beautiful Day,\\" \\"Elevation,\\" and \\"New York.\\" Everything is forgettable, missing even the incisive lyrics this band once wrote so well. I really had hoped this album would be a return to form after U2's terrible spiral throughout the 90's - instead, it's some half-hearted attempt to become something new again, and a failure at that. Goodbye U2, it was great while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good CD","review":"Ok i am the kind of person who likes to brag and this is not going to be any help to u at all if u want to buy this cd or not, but oh well for u thats ur problem.

She says they were very nice people and she said she gave them an icon. That was no help to u but oh well. Bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough of this CD!!!","review":"I've been a fan of u2 since i was 12 and went to the joshua tree concert. This album seems a return to their naked and unashamed passion that seemed to disappear for awhile while they experimented with different styles (techno, over-the-top theatrics, macphisto, etc.). Not that those albums don't have their place, too; but this album is beautiful in a way that is u2 at its truest state. Hearing this album live was amazing and made me see the songs in a different light (at notre dame). What energy! Walk On is an anthem, Elevation HAS to be played LoUd, Stuck in a MOment is gorgeous...i could go on. JUST BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When U2 became just businessmen","review":"I can't understand what people like about this disc. It has almost no redeeming qualities. If you're a U2 worshipper you will like this album, simply because you will force yourself to pretend it's good, even though any clear minded listener will know that the opposite is true.This is the most lame attempt at music ever done. Songs are just horrible, pointless, silly, superficial and commercial. For worse, Bono's vocal range isn't there anymore. It's absolutely painful to listen to Bono straining to hit the high notes; there's nothing artful about it. As much as I like U2, I wanted to like ATYCLB. But to me, ATYCLB is inescapably disappointing.This is total sellout time for U2."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 is finally back on track...","review":"Wow!!!! This is an awesome U2 CD. I still say that The Joshua Tree is the best U2 album ever, but this is a close second or third. Beautiful Day is an awesome song, and so is Walk On and Stuck in a Moment... . This is definitely worth buying. A big improvement over Achtung Baby and Pop, which was a decline in U2's greatness. BUY THE ALBUM!!!! IT DIDN'T WIN THREE GRAMMY'S FOR NOTHING!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics U2...","review":"From the absolute madness of Zooropa and Pop, Bono and the gang go back to basics on this one.Who can forget the radio-friendly \\"Beautiful Day\\"?Definitely beautiful days ahead with U2 sounding raw and fresh again, like the good old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first U2 album that (sadly) sucks","review":"Man, U2 had a great thing going with the last many albums. This is the first album that I have not loved by U2. The critics claim it is a return to old form, but this is no Joshua Tree or Unforgettable Fire. The songs wear old and (gasp) boring. Come on, U2, you can do better than this. Those of you who are die-hard U2 fans like me that must pick up some new music by them, do yourself a favor and just buy the \\"Beautiful Day\\" CD single, because that is the only truly great song on the CD. I didn't think I'd live to see the day I would be writing a review like this for U2."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is painful","review":"Yes I was faithful listener and fan, and this is such a big disappointment. If there is any indication that U2 ran out of creativity, this is it. Don't get fooled by all of that \\"back to the roots\\" reviews, because this album doesn't sound at all like \\"Boy\\" or \\"War\\", or anything else that U2 released. In my wildest dreams I would have never imagined U2 releasing elevator music album so weak on all fronts, from it's lyrics to it's music, from Bono's self-indulging vocals to Edge's powerless riffs. This is the album you can definitely leave behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Addition to a Fine Body of Work","review":"This album is neither their best, nor is it even close to being groundbreaking. Instead it is an incredibly solid chapter in the larger context of their work, as well as a necessary musical regression into their own past explorations of what constitutes the fractured archetypes of rock and roll. What they have created through this exploration is a fascinating pastiche that is far more interesting, in this last year of the 20th century, than their past attempt, articulated in the diasastrous Rattle and Hum (their one true abysmal failure), to make sense of the competing discourses of their sources of musical inspiration. U2 have succeeded in sounding original by really doing nothing original, and that is something that is much harder to do than one would imagine. We are living in a sorry age of music when a merely decent song like \\"Beautiful Day\\" sounds, when it erupts from the pap that is normally played on the radio, as if it were delivered by the gods."},{"rating":"1","title":"All That You Can't Leave Behind","review":"This album proved to be a true dissapointment. I've been a U2 fan for years and find myself in the minority when I say I've enjoyed their earliest work (Boy, War...) and their latest (from Achtung Baby on) the most. The two albums I never liked (and never bought) were the Unforgetable Fire and Jushua Tree and low and behold they've resurected that preachy, pretentious style. Yeuch! I appreciate Bono's politics but you have to give the listener some good tunes with which to wash it down. What made the later albums so great was their willingness to experiment. Now that's gone and I lament it so."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 at their worst!","review":"I have been a fan of U2 since the beggining. I enjoyed their previous change of direction with the last few albums, but this is just too much. I enjoyed three tracks on the album, and one more might grow on me. As I listened to the album I thought of someone running through a field of dandelions on a warm summer day, AND THATS WHEN I WANTED TO PUKE! Save your money. Buy something you have never heard before. Anything but this (...) from a great band, that has lost its edge(not the Edge of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"For die hard U2 fans only","review":"I have been on and off the U2 band wagon for about 10 years now. Achtung Baby was great, Zooropa not that good, and POP was OK. I really don't consider All That You Can't Leave Behind to be that much better then POP, Different yes, but better, no. Beautiful day is a tune that can be listened to time after time, but the others tunes are going to be forgotten within weeks. I was expecting more out of U2. Were is the inspirational rock tunes from Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby? Did they leave the Edge behind on this album? The one star I give is for Beautiful Day. My advice would be to simply buy the Beautiful Day single and leave this album for the die hard U2 fans, and only to keep your U2 collection complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to your collection","review":"If your a big U2 fan this is a must have. Maybe it won't be your favorite cd of all time, but, you'll have your favorite songs that beg to be played over and over and over and you get the point. U2 has remained strong in their sound and talent. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Well, I admit, this CD is kickass! I DO love the CD, but only tracks 1,3, and 10 REALLY get me going! \\"Beautiful Day\\" is one of the best sounding songs since the Beatles! All the other tracks, however, are almost TOO pop for me. Still, this CD is one of the best this year! BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless these Irishmen","review":"Many albums are great on first listen but tend to wear off pretty soon. Albums that take time to appreciate do hang around longer. When it comes to great albums, it normally takes numerous listenings to acknowledge their true appeal (about 30 in my case with 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'). It is certainly one of those albums.If you are one of those people hooked on classic guitar-based rock U2 have produced there long awited masterpiece. Having got over the tech-pop thing out of their system they have gone bck to producing what they are best at, pure and unadulterated rock as we know it. It is reassuring to know that there still exists a band in the world today that can still write and play its own music of such excellence.Which track is great? In a way they all are. Right now I am hooked on the incredibly haunting 'In A Little While'. But it is just one of several gems contained in the album.God bless these guys for reminding us that rock still lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best album of the year","review":"U2 proves once again that they are the best band in the world. On ATYCLB U2 pulls off many highlights such as Elevation, Walk On, and Stuck In A Moment which should go down as some of U2 classics. Easily the best album of the year five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down solid album","review":"Let me preface this by saying if you are looking for a cutting edge experimental album, this is probably not it. But some reviews have made this seem like the backstreet boys and brittney spears re-incarnated which it is not. As a long time U2 fan, I LOVE this album, and I really didn't even have to try. I think this album has struck a great balance between doing what they do best and still maturing and evolving into something new. This album is probably best for those looking for some new songs that have a touch of familiarity to them. I would be hard pressed to think any U2 fan wouldn't like it, but it does seem to go over better with those who love old U2(Joshua tree, Rattle and Hum) stuff also. Personally , after POP I braced myself for a pop-ish mediocre album, but was pleasantly surprised to hear that it all that I can't leave behind, LOL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can leave this one behind","review":"I've been a big fan of U2 since around the time Achtung Baby came out, and this is such a huge step backwards in terms of creativity that it's sad. I loved the more experimental songs on both Zooropa and Pop. Each of those albums had more energy and excitement than this slow and dull \\"return to their roots.\\" How is this a return to their roots? It's so bland that even very early U2 is more enjoyable. It starts out strong with Beautiful Day, but then it loses steam and sputters out after a few songs. Where's the power of Mofo and Please? Where's the soulful singing from songs like Lemon and So Cruel? This album is lacking almost everything that made U2 great. In trying to scale back they cut too much and turned out what is arguably the worst U2 album to date (although none of these songs induces quite the agony that Party Girl does, they are still very poor). Do yourself a favor and pick up any of U2s older albums. This one isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Man, what a disappointment. Maybe I listened too much to the hype. I'm a huge U2 fan; if music can change your life, then U2 has done that for me. So for all of you reading this who have scanned the other reviews and see the \\"return to Classic U2\\" kind of statements, they are being blinded by nostalgia for what this band used to mean to so many people. In the '80's/early '90's, U2 MEANT something in a way that other bands didn't. They seem like they are trying to reclaim a piece of that legacy on the new CD, but the songs just aren't that great. A couple of tracks are pretty good, and if you like U2 buy the CD anyway, but if you are buying into the \\"return to the old U2\\" hype YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. Lower your expectations and it's a decent CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainstream","review":"This album is their second worst ever. A plenty filler mainstream. Bono is getting worse and worse - In A Little While, When I Look At The World, Kite, Wild Honey - , the music is ordinary and thick, full of clich��s and \\"classic\\" Edge guitars. My 14 years old brother can write a better tune than Wild Honey. The used production doesn't works, it makes the album even weaker. A simplistic effort, quickie, pointless and dull.

While there\`s nothing truly horrible here, most of the moments are merely passable and far from memorable. \\"New York\\" is probably the best track, and even that is far from stunning. This record offers nothing new to the current music scenario, presenting weak compositions that lack originality and innovation. It certainly doesn\`t deserve all the overexposure it got, since it has been awhile since U2 created something truly remarkable and cutting edge.

Bono sings like s**t, easily his worst voice ever - listen to tracks 5, 6, 7 - songs are extremely ordinary, poor and flat, ballads are boring as hell, production is pointless, as well lyrics. This is just hype, style, sunglasses, Beautiful Day video, etc. A Shame.All That You Can't Leave Behind really sucks so bad, I'm ashamed to tell my friends. Bono said in a 1994 interview that the 3 piece sound was dead.

They stayed away from their electronica, experimental stuff they've been doing for a while. This time, they're back to the what they're excellent at--back to good 'ol rock and roll. I see how much TRAVIS resembles U2 --especially in the song, \\"Walk On.\\" ... ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Yet","review":"This is indeed the best album that U2 has ever put forth. In addition, it is probably one of the best albums in music history. What makes this album so great is its balance. In fact, balance is one of the themes in the lyrics of this album. Very few groups put forth this type of record. Serious, enlightening songs like Kite, When I Look at the World, and New York, are balanced with the jovial themes of Wild Honey and Elevation. Another major criticism of this album is that U2 have lost their edge, pardon the pun. The truth is that U2 has matured over the years. Songs like those on War are now passe, and the group in many ways has realized the flaws of their past thinking. Songs like Peace on Earth tell of the new found maturity of the group. Overall, this is the best, most balanced album in the history of the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 Music is alive again ..","review":"I got the album today from Amazon and wow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've listened to it 3 or 4 times in a row - in an effort to find redemption and I can't find it. Some of the tracks are good, but once again, I'm blown away at how a band can have so much talent and so much time off, and come away with nothing more than mediocrity.I, unlike others, would have liked to hear more of Edge on this one. But, capitalizing on that fateful Rolling Stones' verse, you can't always get what you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"First of I am a huge U2 fan. I am amazed by their constant innovation and vision. I feel like this album is very poor(with eception of 2 tracks), none of the lyrics or music are impressive. It sounds like they just wanted to make an album for the fun of it. I bought the album without listening to it first and I paid the price. I cannot believe these are the same guys that made Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The best way to describe it is \\"banal\\". All my friends raved about this CD and for some reason I can't get into it. I want to just warn people to listen to it before they buy it. I am usually not so negative but this is honestly the worst they could have done short of recording themselves burping and then selling that as an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third And Final","review":"Ok. This is it. Third and final review. Today I fell asleep listening to this album. I fell asleep listening to a U2 album. Never thought that would happen. I have really tried to like it but, lets face it guys, aside from Beautiful Day and one or maybe two other songs, this album is pretty sucky by U2 standards. Maybe at 40 they are too settled and well-off to really have anything to rock about anymore. They have done awesome, amazing work and I would hate to see them blemish it with a slow decline into mediocrity just to give the fans another album. Maybe its time to knock off and let the great stuff they've done shine with its own brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Courtesy Star For the Memories...","review":"I'll keep this short and simple. I'm a big U2 fan and this c.d. was absolutely terrible! It represented a recurring theme in a music - one which few bands pull off well: the attempt to mix a cocktail of trendy, tried and true. The songs are poppy and senseless and are lukewarm at best when compared to such genius as \\"War\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"\\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" is a heartless heap of commercialism and a failed attempt to pander to the next generation of consumers. \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" should have been left behind...along with Madonna's \\"Music\\" and whatever nonsense former greats will undoubtedly ruin themselves with. It's a sad day when U2 sells their soul - but alas, this day has come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catch them on their next time out!","review":"I've tried to understand what so many fans are raving about on this newest endeavour by U2. \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" will never be anywhere near as mind blowing as \\"The Joshua Tree\\"! I bought ATYCLB because I thought, \\"A Beautiful Day\\", was a great song; and I was looking forward to an album with many other great songs to match the first release. Needless to say I was quite disappointed. I wish U2 would just return to their roots. Maybe next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST OF U2","review":"I'm a huge U2 fan since their erlier days and have all their albums. I'm VERY ANGRY with this album, because it shows no good lyrics or sound improvement. It's a very big mistake to say that this album is a return to \\"Joshua's Tree\\" or \\"Rattle and Hum\\". There is no joy, no pleasure on this record. SAVE YOUR MONEY! This is \\"All that you CAN leave behind...\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good thing about the record is Peter Gabriel's chorus!","review":"As a long timer fan of U2, I feel deceptionated about this record as well as the previous two ones. Bono's voice is weak, Edge shows none of his magical cords in the record resulting in just another music experiment. If you're trying to progress into music I recommend picking new alternative groups rather than hear U2 doing it.I think that for big stars it's hard to call it quits on the top, and for U2 well, Joshua Tree was it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Cutting Edge","review":"\\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" is yet another cutting edge performance by U2. They continue to take odd sounds and turn them into great music. They also continue to be a band with a message (see the inside jacket for a list of causes they back). The songs are not of even quality. The good ones are great (Walk On, Elevation, Beautiful Day, Kite), but there are also some tracks I skip. Their best offering since Achtung Baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This CD is OK.I mean if you likerock and you are a U2 fan, then you'll probably like this cd,but 2 me its nthin special"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit over-rated","review":"U2 almost always puts out solid stuff and this disc is no exception. It took a little while to grow on me but after all was said and done I found myself enjoying it. While not as good as \\"Achtung Baby\\" or \\"The Joshua Tree\\", it nonetheless strives for high performance and comes quite close. A few of the tracks are actually boring, but the good ones shine all the brighter because of that. \\"Kite\\" immediately brings \\"The Joshua Tree\\" to mind with its guitar work. \\"Beautiful Day\\" grew on me as did \\"Walk On\\". This cd is worth picking up, but give it a little time to get under your skin. Also try the companion DVD from the Elevation 2001 tour-it is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to mellow out to","review":"I'm still a high school student, so I have loads of homework to do each night. The thing is, I really like to listen to music while I work, but most music really distracts me. That's why I love U2's ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND. I can listen to it and just mellow out and concentrate on what I need to. The melodies are soothing and relaxing, but they also have some nice, mesmorizing melodies. My favorite tracks are BEAUTIFUL DAY, STUCK IN A MOMENT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF, ELEVATION, and WALK ON. I would recommend this CD to everybody. Just a note though, U2 isn't the kind of band that you really sing along to or anything, their songs are to be listened to and enjoyed, not vocalized by the listeners :-) Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"U2's best album ever!!","review":"I've heard a lot of U2 music and have various albums, but I'd have to say that every track on this cd has a tune that will stick in you head forever. In my mind, this is some of U2's best work. Songs like \\"Beautiful Day\\", \\"Elevation\\", and \\"Walk On\\" truly show what this band is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I bought this CD to complete my collection of all the new U2 CD's. U2 are such a stunning group and masterful writers of music.This CD is a must for all U2 fans. I have yet to hear anything U2 have done that I don't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring veering on cheesy","review":"All That You Can't Leave Behind was a grand return to form for U2, and it's an album meant to inspire and bestow the virtues of positivity. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Opening with \\"Beautiful Day,\\" amongst the best singles the band ever wrote, they set up an electrifying array of excitement and passion - tracks like \\"Walk On\\" and \\"New York\\" carry the gauntlet well enough and make for a fun, uplifting listen. But it's hard to deny that too much of this is U2's downfall - Bono's so smooth sometimes he sounds condescending, and the songwriting can often verge from positivity into nauseating treacle if left unchecked (\\"Grace sees goodness in everything.\\" Way to be, Grace)."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2's best album since Achtung Baby","review":"\\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" is one of the best U2 albums of all time, and definitely their best since \\"Achtung Baby.\\" The new record is very consistant...each track is part of a coherent whole, and there are no weak tracks. Of special note is the rocking opener \\"Beautiful Day\\" along with one of the best anti-war songs of all time \\"Peace On Earth\\" which is especially poignant right now when you listen to it in context of the situation in the Middle East. Along with these amazing tracks, \\"New York\\" is a great song about the real melting pot of New York City.This album is highly recommended for even casual U2 fans. 2000 is almost over, and U2 has released the best overall album by any rock artist in this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"first impressions","review":"my rating is 2 1/2 stars. and that rating does not mean that this album is ultimately good or bad, just that it is my first impression of it. before listening to it i had heard this was a return to pre-techno era U2, however, i was disappointed by the lack of guitar on it. it seems the one thing they did leave behind was the Edge. U2 has mellowed after 20 years and this is where they are now. give it a listen if your in the mood to relax sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"And we've only just begun.........","review":"The album is superb. But I believe the best is yet to be. These are 11 songs that are just dying to be played live and if the BBC Sessions I saw at the U2 website are anything to go by, this will be U2's year on tour and Bono deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.Beautiful Day is a gospel song to me. It speaks of finding true \`beauty' aka \`redemption' only when one is at the point of nothing. Yet it's disguised as a brilliant pop melody too.Stuck in a Moment is a classic. It breathes hope into despair. Elevation....another great gospel song...going up the charts. Walk On...classic U2...Steve Lilywhite revisted. Kite....this song soars. In a Little While...the treasure of true love that waits.... Wild Honey....sweet stuff. Peace on Earth....you'd think it was Midge Ure....the magic never ends....Don't just believe the hype. It's far better than the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Midnight","review":"U2 touched the pop waves again with All That You Can't Leave Behind. This one is a little more commercial sounding and not as well arranged as Achtung Baby. I would still recommend this CD...a top 5 release for the boys from the emerald isle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Return to stripped down rock, but...","review":"This album was hearalded as the end of U2's experiments gone wrong with electronica (i.e., Pop) and a return to simple stripped down rock. They succeed in this regard, but the album lacks the fire and ferosity of some of U2's earlier work like War or The Unforgettable Fire or the intraspection and connection with the American soul on The Joshua Tree. It's not U2's best, but still worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused In Chicago","review":"This is my second review because I'm not sure that I understand all the hoopla and 5 star ratings. I find it hard to believe that the people giving it 5 stars will be listening to this a few months from now. The beautiful thing about Joshua Tree, Unforgettable Fire, and to some degree Achtung Baby, is that they still provide listening enjoyment to this day. I've really tried to give this album a chance but I find that the lack of rhythm and tempo changes has me consistently daydreaming instead of listening. Spend your money more wisely."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Edge Less Bono","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love this album,especially Kite, Elevation, and New York, but everytime I listen to it, I keep wishing Bono would just pipe down a little and let the Edge pump up his clanging, chiming, coruscating guitar. Bono as the 'Face of U2' gets too much of the spotlight. All the weaker tracks are ones where his vocal entirely dominates, like Grace and Peace On Earth, which really needs to be lifted off the ground like Kite is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars Are Not Enough","review":"U2 fans were holding their breath prior to the release of All That You Can't Leave Behind. What would the 'tone' of the new album bring? Would it be another Joshua Tree with anthemic ballads, have the static, despair and glitz of Achtung Baby or the sarcastic, kitsch vibe of Pop?They needn't have worried. U2's 10th studio release is, without a doubt, their best yet. From the feel-good vibes of 'Beautiful Day', the melancholy beauty of 'Walk On', the rocking swagger of 'New York' to the sublime 'Peace on Earth', this is the album ALL U2 fans, casual or diehard, should own.A triumph of simple beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 leave behind the glitter","review":"A great, back-to-basics album. The original U2 sound is there -- one which I really missed during the 90's glitter detour, though it isn't as grand as Joshua Tree. The lyrics are just as poignant, perhaps more so, on \\"Grace\\" and \\"When I Look at the World\\". Those are 2 of the best songs on the disc, in my humble opinion.All in all, a welcome return to Edge's stunning guitar, Bono's soothing wail( at least for this long-time fan), and clear, grooving rythms from Larry and Adam. No glam and glitter here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly dissapointing album !","review":"WARNING: THIS ALBUM IS THE WORST U2 ALBUM EVERRRRRRRR!!!!!! AND I MEAN EVERRRRRR!!!! i mean what happened to that melodic and flawless tunes from the album \\"Joshua Tree\\"? U2 became one of those alternative DJ rock band from a soft rock band. Dont waist ur money buying this album, buy Joshua Tree instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this album","review":"U2 were a good group, but since Pop and now All that you can't leave behind. U2 are showing bad signs, The albums starts off with A good Song, and then the rest are horrible, you can compare this album to rock groups these days with dull lyrics (same political lyrics which become boring, very similar to pop)and dull beats and rythym. This albums is definitly not a good album and leave it behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret buying this one","review":"After \\"Beautiful Day\\" this is one boring album. Every song sounds the same, dull and uninteresting. I bought the album because of several reviews comparing it to some of U2's earlier recordings. I can't imagine anything further from the truth. I was sorely disappointed with Bono's sing-songy, \\"adult contemporary\\" vocal style; he's capable of much better. It seems U2 has lost their passion for great lyrics and powerful music. I gave it to two other long time U2 fans to see if maybe it was just me, and they came back with the same response."},{"rating":"1","title":"I truly hoped this would be as good as they say...","review":"But what a disapointment, even after several listenings nothing sticks. except maybe Wild Honey. Please don't compare this to the Joshua Tree or The Unforgetable Fire, even Zooropa and Achtung Baby were far more interesting(just remember Lemon for example). It's really a shame; I expected much more from Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, not to mention The Edge. I guess being commercially succesful, means being lame. An old fan - Disapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened??","review":"I've been looking forward to this new CD for quite some time. \\"Back to their roots\\" was a term used to describe this album years before it even came out. Many \\"inside\\" people said that it was going back to the style of 'The Joshua Tree'. I'm still waiting for that new album to be released then. While I'm not dissing this album, I found that it disappointed me. 'Achtung Baby' remains my favorite U2 album, and I tend to compare everything released since to that album. The direction this album took surprised me. It's a very mellow journey. If you like U2's changing style with each venture, then this album will satisfy you. But if you're expecting a 'Joshua Tree', or even a 'War'....all I can say is \\"not here!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"The disturbing rants on this album don't pass as music in my book. Since Bono has been lobbying Congress to give our money away to Africa, his music has suffered. Maybe he should give his own money away first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Sappy Pop Music","review":"Many have said that this is U2's best album since \\"Joshua Tree.\\" To this I must say, please stop sniffing the toxic products under your kitchen sink. \\"Achtung Baby\\" burries \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\" \\"Achtung Baby\\" not only produced 5 hit singles, its other songs were great too (\\"So Cruel,\\" \\"Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World,\\" & \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\"). \\"Achtung Baby\\" bravely explored new ground for U2, and is sadly overlooked. While there are a couple good songs on \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" (\\"Elevation,\\" \\"Walk On,\\" & \\"New York\\"), overall it is weak, sappy pop music. What happened to U2's revolution?!? What happened to the social commentary of songs like \\"Running To Stand Still,\\" \\"Bad,\\" \\"Exit,\\" & \\"Mothers Of The Disappeared\\"?!? U2 must not have much left to say to the world, and they're now just in it for the money. These are four extremely talented men that have produced a sub-par effort. I'm very disappointed."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},x={key:1};function R(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(o(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-9dbaa4ac"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/5.md","filePath":"sponsor/5.md"}'),H={name:"sponsor/5.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
