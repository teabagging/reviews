Matt Damon does it again","review":"Chief Miller of the US Army is onto a plot involving bad intelligence. He has been lead on a wild goose chase tracking down WMDs in Iraq. He has the CIA and high ranking military intelligence officers breathing down his neck. He is on the verge of uncovering a major scheme that could change the course of the war. War is tough when even your allies turn on you.This movie is stacked. It's got great acting, suspense, mystery and drama. The screenplay, score, and cinematography are amazing.

Considering 66% of the movie is night scenes that look like they were recorded on VHS, I place this Blu-ray up there with the picture quality of \\"28 Days Later\\". GRAINLY!!! Barely DVD acceptable. DTS 5.1 is weak, but this may be because of the visual chaos is hard to associate the sound to. I feel bad that Matt Damon was the star of this movie. As an actor, he's a perfect soldier. But the poor story line in addition to the poor cinematography is the death knell for this movie, no matter how good of the acting.

That is NO weapon of mass destruction found in Iraq. History has proved that's an un-deniable fact.Secondly, Matt Damon's acting is truly riveting. It's the only reason that kept me watching this film till the end.Thirdly, all other aspects of this picture are disappointing. For example, the hand-held camera style of filming made it very hard to see what's happening.Because of all the reasons above, I gave it 2 stars.Rottentomatoes website shows it made 33.1 millions at the US box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used Disc Re-Packaged by Amazon","review":"The movie was good, but has anyone else received blu-ray discs from amazon that appear to be used, and re-packaged as new?

Hand-held camera work gives this action drama an urgency that conveys a sense of verisimilitude, especially in the well-staged combat and action sequences. The film was not a hit in theaters, and some who saw it felt it was anti-American, but this is a very American story of honesty and truth prevailing against the powers-that-be. This is a solid action thriller. Paul Greengrass directed. Brian Helgeland adapted the screenplay based on the book by Rajiv Chandrasekaran."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a thriller like the Bourne series","review":"I was expecting much more from this movie.

But, many other good songs have been left out, such as \\"Trail of Tears\\" and many others...! But, this album delivers the goods! Some of my fave songs off this album are, Electric Crown, Alone in the Dark, Ballad, The Legacy, and Return to Serenity. \\"Sails of Charon\\" is a new addition, and its awesome! It has an excellent intro, and outro!

This is supposed to be the best of Testament, not the worst! Anyway, that song kinda soiled the album but I would recommend getting it and just ignoring track 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake product","review":"I bought this for a present to impress my lady's mother. Her mother has a very keen eye in such products and can spot a fake product right away.

I have been sold from the vey first whiff! Very elegant and classy but not loud! Definitely great for more romantic evenings but can also be worn to business meetings because of it's subtlety. The fragrance is RICH, SLEEK and WARM without being overly flirtatious. The scent lasts for many hours time but is not cloying. Great for more mature (in age)women but younger women will love it as well. I NEVER let the bottle reach it's end without having a replacement!! WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this battery for your Dell Inspiron E1405.","review":"Reading reviews of this battery before I bought it, I was assured I had the correct replacement Battery.

Sam's a puckish treat.","review":"In this world of awareness of our aging and where all that has gone before gets us, this is a one-stop whirl back to basics. Tom DiCillo has a strong grasp on where each of us needs to be headed but loses sight of all too quickly in our professional quests. Though family seems to take a backseat during much of John Tuturo's counter-circling to get to Splatchee Lake, and, unknowingly, to an understanding of his own mortality, Sam Rockwell's Bucky, gets him there in perfect condition. His Oreo cookie breakfast, and unassuming lifestyle will stay in your heart forever. A truly sweet Indie. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"I too was channel surfing and came upon this movie and could not change the channel. And it was my first introduction to Sam Rockwell, who is, WOW, so talented. The many looks and characters he played in the movies that I have seen since this movie, is astounding for one so young. Why haven't I heard of him before. And his movies are few and far in between it seems. I find I can't wait to see the next one. You won't be disappointed. A little bit of magic, and wonder is in this movie, you have to look past the bad reviews and judge for yourself and give it a chance to work its magic on YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"One of my favorites, since buying it several years ago, I still like to watch it again and again.This is one of my favorite movies, when I want to watch a fun movie where I'll feel good about people without fairytale sappiness, this is what I grab from my stash of DVDs. Al and Kid are wonderful opposite types who remain themselves throughout the movie, yet add to each other through the friendship that they form. The feelings of camaraderie are portrayed well with a freshness that comes right through the screen and I end up taking life a little less seriously after watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running on empty","review":"'Box of Moonlight' feels like a short film painfully dragged out to four times its natural length as John Turturo's uptight clockwatching engineer finds himself facing a typical indie movie midlife crisis after a job ends unexpectedly early by going on the road in search of childhood memories and finding himself caught up in standard indie movie issue eccentric Sam Rockwell's free spirited lifestyle. It's supposed to be liberating, but Rockwell's Johnny Depp impression quickly outstays its welcome and you have to wonder about Tom DiCillo's notion of freedom (destroying other people's property, cheating on your wife, giving your unsupervised small child fireworks to play with). A few quirky moments aside, such as Catherine Keener's warped phone sex girl, it's not a road worth taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD AWFUL","review":"This is the reason independent movies get a bad name. It painfully ambles from art house cliche (the wacky free spirit, strained offbeat dialouge) to standard cliche (the pent up businessman, all Southerners see Jesus image in a decaying billboard) As if it werent bad enough to begin with, it runs a good twenty minutes longer than it needs to, as if the film maker had so much banal material he had to tack on just a little more. It offers the viewer no insight we havent all seen better executed before. Rent or buy Living in Oblivion, by the same director- It has its cliches, but it is about making fun of them instead of perpetuating them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Flick, But Buy the VHS Version","review":"Other reviews have described this movie's quirky charm and essential good-heartedness, so this is just a note of warning: the DVD version has been \\"cropped\\" from the VHS one (I know, I know, widescreen is supposed to reveal MORE at the sides, and it does, only here they've also sliced off the top and bottom of the frame). I don't know if it was a bad editing decision or a bad transfer, but this movie's actually better on VHS. First time I've seen that happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review of Box of Moonlight","review":"I just happened to be channel surfing and came upon this movie. I was pulled in by it. I had never heard of Sam Rockwell before this movie and I found him to be so refreshing! John Turturro as the middle aged man going through a mid life crisis really works, he played the part so well. Sam Rockwell and Turturro had a great chemistry in this movie. You find yourself pulling for Sam Rockwell's character and hoping he finds the friend he wants and needs and he does with Turturro! I would recommend this movie for sure. It is one of those make you feel good movies. I also wanted to see more of Sam Rockwell after this, his other movies.. Matchstick Men and Confessions of a Dangerous mind were great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so crisp it will make you crave fresh air and a fresh start","review":"Inspirational. I stumbled upon \\"Box of Moon Light\\" at around 2:00am one night while flipping through the TV channels. John Turturro's character subtly but steadily drew my interest. Later I was laughing outloud. Let go of all your expectations and let these characters tell you their story- it is, without a doubt, worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart warming story of two eccentrics","review":"This is a story of an uptight engineer who hasn't stopped to smell the roses in a long time who runs into an eccentric loner who is by his own words, \\"off the grid\\".

The Navy have a supergun,few battleships,few small fighters,and the battleships need to be protected from little League Fighters! Why couldn't they have spent more money,or worked harder on the ships than what they did on it! The League must be rich! Other than this,the game is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have , love, hate:","review":"This game is getting old now, I have to speak for the game because I bought it twice, once back in the day when it came out and again in 2004 for a lack of a good space shooter on the PS2. To this day the graphics hold up well and the gameplay factor is what brings you back for more. Missions range from escort to defend the base to take out the enemy base or fighters. The gameplay is hard, I mean really hard. (for easy play pick up colony wars 3). The missions are setup in fork fashion, loose a mission it changes the outcome, and completion path of the game. If you liked tie fighter or x-wing games from back in the day and you arn't to spoiled with modern graphics give this game a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game offers a lot!","review":"This game has it all!

First we only have 9 tracks on here. On the cassette, there are 3 additional songs which do not show up on the CD, which makes no sense. \\"Applejack\\", \\"Heartbreak Express\\" and \\"Me And Little Andy\\" fail to make an appearance on the CD. Instead we have 9 songs, which don't even make up 30 minutes of music on this CD. There are some great songs though, like a new version of \\"I Will Always Love You\\", and classics like \\"It's All Wrong But It's All Right\\", \\"Two Doors Down\\", \\"9 to 5\\", \\"Islands in the Stream\\", \\"But You Know I Love You\\", \\"Here You Come Again\\", \\"Old Flames (Cant Hold A Candle To You)\\" and \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\\".

I don't know who dropped it off as there is no one there who would be interested in reading it. It has no relevance to most of us regular folks. We have no interest in Onassis or his family. Their problems aren't/weren't ours. We don't care about them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I've always been interested on the Onassis' family but I've never read anything much about them until this book of Ms. Mouttsatsos.This book gives us an understanding of the famous Greek family and how hard their life was. A very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving account of lives touched by tragedy","review":"Kiki Mousatsos has told a moving account of of lives that seemed to be like fairytales, but sadly ended in nightmares. It is so rare to be able to read chapter after chapter graced with such love, insite and devotion to these mysterious and real people that the author so obviously carries with her to this day. The fact that she knew and loved these people like family and was given permission to write this moving story gives this book a rare quality. Grab some tissues and enjoy your read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most unbiased of the Jackie books, and the best!","review":"Kiki writes about these people in a flattering but realistic manner. Rather than concentrating on the dirt (like Kitty Kelly or C. David Heymann), Kiki describes Jackie, Aristo and Christina as somewhat flawed but well-meaning people. She holds nothing back, whether good or bad, and she makes you feel as though you were there too. I would trust her view rather than most biographers trying to earn a quick buck with a questionable source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but definitely sugar coated!","review":"Kiki Feroudi must obviously still be in the employ of the Onassis empire. This book is such a blatant valentine. There really isn't any new dirt, just page upon page of praise for Aristotle Onassis and anyone close to him. A much more realistic book which is just now available on amazon.com is Oh, No...Jackie-O! by January Jones. This book gives us a totally different Onassis and one that is much more malicious and capable of committing the perfect crime of this century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peurile garbage","review":"That Kiki Moutsatsos teaches writing ANYWHERE amazes me!If you read this book as a comedy,you may get a few laughs.Thank god I borrowed it from a library and didn't buy it!The Onassis PR machine obviously sponsors Kiki!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good insight","review":"If Onassis wouldn't have had any money, nobody would have bothered to take a second look at that man. Having money brings power but not necessarily good manners and kindness. The man was rude, vulgar and arrogant beyond belief. He treated Maria Callas like a servant, wich is unforgivable, and Jackie went through the same treatment. As for Christina, the poor girl suffered all her life from the lack of love and affection from her father. I found the book very interesting, the author gave us a good insight of what was really going on in the Onassis saga. A very sad story indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Did not like the book. A childish tale of the women in the life of the greek tycoon.

This one just lacks. - Sorry -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment for Ember and Sparks fan.","review":"If you're a fan of Duprau's two Books of Ember, don't be fooled by the advertisement. The Prophet of Yonwood is not exactly a prequel, as the ads claim. Most of it was babble and nonsense and the storyline was stale and downright boring. The events in the story -- even the so-called prophecy -- do not lead the reader to a better understanding of the underground City of Ember nor does it have anything to do with it. In fact, the only thing remotely premonitory didn't occur until the epilogue.I am glad to see that Duprau is still writing. She's a talented writer and storyteller. But aside from the misleading premise of the story, The Prophet of Yonwood did not live up to the author's standards. Hopefully she'll come out with another Book of Ember as a sequel to the second and redeem reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I loved City of Ember and even read it aloud to my 7th graders. People of Sparks was a great book showing what happened after they left Ember. This book didn't tell me anything. I wanted to know more about what led up to Ember, but it wasn't there. Yes it showed how the world was in battle and things weren't going well, but that's about it. I kept looking for hidden clues to people in the other stories, but there just wasn't anything there. I will make sure to make this clear to my students when they want to read this book. Read it for it's own merit, but not to link to the other two books. Even then - I don't think it's a very good book. It dragged while waited for something big to happen. It never did. Too bad too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Addition","review":"In all fairness, I will agree with other reviewers that this book WASN'T as \\"good\\" as the other two in the series. Well, there is definately a lot less going on in the story, anyway. But this is a PREQUEL to the City of Ember which means it doesn't necessarily have to involve the same characters. It all ties together in the end, and comes back to the original story. Just hang in there and don't dislike the book because it doesn't continue the story after the People of Sparks. A good addition to the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost no connection to the City of Ember","review":"The first book in the series, City of Ember, is brilliant. The second book, People of Sparks, is still interesting, although it does not live up to its full potential.The Prophet of Yonwood, a prequel to City of Ember, is completely dull. It takes so long to get to the point (the point being how Ember becomes Ember and exactly what has happened, etc.) that I rushed through all the pages to find that there are only 2 pages at the very end to connect the plot in Yonwood to Ember. It's so disappointing because I was earnestly hoping that all the details and mysteries that are just hinted in the City of Ember would be unraveled in Yonwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"As I do agree with others that this book did not mention \\"Ember\\" at all except at the end of the book, BUT what do you expect when it is 50 years before hand?? It is an interesting read....and the 4th book in the series does mention some people in this book at the end of it.Would you be lost if you did not read this book...no, other than with the few references, like I said before, of the people in this book in the 4th book at the END."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not part of the Ember series","review":"The book itself was kinda of ok, but as part of the Ember series it was horrid. It only ties in on the last page. The entire story is preachy and anti-religious. I was excited to find out how the City of Ember was built, who was chosen to live in it, how they stocked it for two hundred years. The Prophet of Yonwood did not address any of these plot elements. This book is not a decent stand alone book. Instead, it was combined with the Ember series because it was the only way it would sell. Do not waste your time, skip this book and go on to book four of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Bother!","review":"Has absolutely nuthin to do with books 1 and 2. Oh, except for like 5 page at the very end!! Sorry to say it, but i 'm dissapointed. I mean really, who puts a prequel in the middle of a series? And i'm sorry, could someone tell me what the albino bear is about? Cuz i dont understand. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure how this fits with the first two","review":"After enjoying The City of Ember and The People of Sparks, I was really looking forward to some great background on the conflict that led to the creation of Ember and the destruction of the surface world. After all, the cover art is a falling bomb. Instead I got a character study, even though it was an interesting character study, that was only hastily connected to the Ember story at the very end. Maybe I expect to much from young adult fiction, but I really don't think there was enough information here for even the targeted age group to spark a discussion of how the disaster came to be. Will there be more in book four? I hope so, or else I fear I wasted some money this time. Big disappointment after the first two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!","review":"I read the first two books with my nephew and enjoyed them greatly. They were smart, interesting and suspenseful. There was so much detail and the action moved along at a very readable pace. This third book was truly disappointing. We kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing really interesting ever arose. It was repetitive and absolutely dragged in some places. It was an small idea that was stretched to fill too many pages. This idea could easily have been included as a chapter with one of the other books. At this point, we are not sure we really want to even bother reading the 4th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the others","review":"I was a bit disappointed with this one of the series, even the way the book finishes up seems to be rushed. The tie in to the seriest doesn't come until the very end. The entire first 9/10ths of book could be misconstrued as any post-apocalyptic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"to call this the thrid book of ember is a lie!!!!!!!","review":"this book has nothing to do with the ember story line. it was a waste of my time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!!!","review":"This book really made me mad. It had nothing to do with any of the other books. The only part that explained why this book was written is the end. How the Disaster (mentioned in the previous book) caused for a specially selected group of people to go into an underground city to wait for the right time to go back up into the world to populate the world again. This book had the most irrelevant characters... Ever!!! This book was practically already explained in the previous book. It feels like the author just threw in some boring characters and plot ideas just for the sake of making another book to explain how the world came to be how the Emberites found it. Just do everybody a favor and save your hard earned money to buy a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit with the series, skip it.","review":"This book should not be included in the series. It is awful and just drags on and on. If you liked the first two books in the series skip this one. I'm not sure what the author was thinking here."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disppointing Book - NOT about Ember","review":"SPOILER ALERTAs a children's book, this might be OK at best. However, calling this book a prequel to The City of Ember is a deceptive action. This book has the feel of a book that had already been written about one subject and then, after the success of The City of Ember, the author tacked on a FEW pages at the end saying that the heroine in her old age was going to go to Ember. There is none of the magic nor any substantial continuity to the story of The City of Ember. I suspect that trilogies sell better than three standalone books. I suspect that the author's motivation was to increase sales by calling this book part of a trilogy. The book was boring and a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book was just as good as the others. I have been wondering about what happened before the war and she recently wandered my Q's but hopefully she will go back to the normal characters in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"The Prophet of Yonwood is about a girl named Nickie who moves to the city of Yonwood because she has inherited a house there and her aunt wants to sell it. In the city of Yonwood, someone named Althea Towers has a vision of the end of the world and everyone in the city believes it and she becomes the Prophet of Yonwood. Everyone except for strange old Hoyt McCoy, who doesn't agree with the Prophet's rules, such as: No lights, no singing, no dogs, etc... On her adventures, Nickie meets a boy named Grover, who keeps snakes in his backyard. Together, they have lots of adventures. I loved this book, and if you read it, you will too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not be part of the series!","review":"This book is not bad if it was written to be on it's own, however, I think it was a bad choice to pretend this was somehow related to the City of Ember series. It seemed more like the author had an idea for a completely different story but decided to link it to the Ember series just so people would bother reading it. The connection to the series is so weak it's laughable. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst prequels I ever read","review":"I was so fascinated by the first two novels I couldn't wait to get this one. Yet it is a prequel and really meanders around, then rushed the ending to try and make the connections back to the first two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not be included in City of Ember series.","review":"After reading the first two City of Ember books, I was excited to read the prequel. I was anticipating the story of how the City of Ember was established, instead I found a completely unconnected story. Not only was this not a prequel to the other two books, but it actually seemed thrown together and even 'dumbed down' in its style.The only reason I kept reading this very disjointed story, was in the hopes that there would be some unveiling of information in relation to the other two books. Unfortunately, it comes in the form of a tacked-on paragraph on the last page of the book.There were so many possibilities for a wonderful prequel but, honestly, this is not worth the time it takes to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong turn on the Ember series","review":"City of Ember and People of Sparks were both exciting and compelling. I couldn't stop reading them and I am a grown-up. Yonwood doesn't even compare. I found it to be right wing evangelical propaganda. The sliver of a connection to the previous books is thrown in on the last pages with little connection to the rest of the story. Quite sad as the author had a good thing going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book by Jeanne Duprau!","review":"This book is great. It is filled with adventure and mystery.

And Morton Wilsnap, queer'\\", language I find completely inappropriate for a book that is advertised as being written for 9-12 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I read through the first two books in a flash. They were truely great, and I could not wait for the next one. Then of course we get this completely unrelated and boring book that I stopped reading 6 chapters in out of dissapointment. I was almost convinced not to get the 4th book, worried that it would be a sequel to The Prophet of Yonwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless prequel, don't waste your money here","review":"This prequel is not directly related to the City of Ember. I really tried to like it, but till the end it was just a big disappointment with no real revelation. Feel free to avoid this opus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prequel Sequel","review":"The Prophet on Yonwood takes fans of the Ember series to beginning before the beginning. It answers the questions about why Ember was built, who built it and who first lived there. As with the previous books, the stories revolves around the experiences of a young girl as she lives through difficult and confusing times. The author draws the reader, of any age, into the girl's world in a small town and into her heart and soul. Both my ten year old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed this book and all the books in the Ember series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the series","review":"I very much enjoyed City of Ember and the follow-up, The People of Sparks. The Prophet of Yonwood is not in the same class, however. It's neither a good read on its own, nor a reasonable set-up for the City of Ember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, nothing to do with Ember","review":"I deeply regret having bought this book. It has nothing to do with the original Ember novel, the thin connection is mentioned in the last five pages. The story is somewhere between absolutely boring and ludicrous. A albino bear being confused for a terrorist in the woods? A humming bracelet? Uh, not my liking at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"DuPrau has written The City of Ember and The People of Sparks two great books, but this is a complete downhill for me. I mean what the HECK, does an albino bear have anything to do with the City of Ember? You tell me cause I am clueless. No seriously tell me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"This indeed is a stand-alone book, telling a story of a girl's experience. The postscript chapter tells us that she was one of the founding inhabitants of the City of Ember when she grew up.So it was disappointing, as I had thought it was going to be a prequel to City of Ember, which it really wasn't (and which still could be written).Even alone, the story didn't have much of a plot, and what there was, was annoying. Some people of faith could even be offended by the strong theme of everyone in town blindly following one person's interpretation of the prophet's mutterings, causing people to put up strong social restrictions and to severely punish sinners if they broke the religious rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Expecting.","review":"So, i read the City of Ember a few years ago. It was amazing. I loved it. A year or two later, I read the People of Sparks. Not bad, but could have been better.This book is really not that good. It takes 200 pages to figure out what the book is about, and almost 300 before you figure out what this has to do with the other books. As a stand alone book, it would have been easy reading chick-lit. There is no real plot/ character development. It's basically about a girl who spends some time in a town trying to please god, and who adopts a dog. Not some fantastic story of people who live underground.I'm just disapointed. I was expecting so much more from the author of the City of Ember.P.S. If you want to read a good Science Fiction book that just came out- read Scott Westerfield's 'Specials'. It's part of a trilogy, and absolutely amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Seem to Fit in the Series","review":"I haven't finished the book yet, but I'm halfway through and have lost interest. It really doesn't seem to fit very well into the Ember series. I loved The City of Ember, was intrigued by The People of Sparks and really wanted to read the 3rd book but it has been a let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prophet of Yonwood","review":"I seem to be a 40 year old kid when it comes to the Ember series. I loved the movie so much that I went and purchased the first and second book. I had no idea a third and fourth book was available until recently. I found the Prophet of Yonwood disappointing and, strangely, not in the same writing styleas the other three. This book adds very little background information to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Talent gone to waste!","review":"I loved the first few books they were exciting, tense and creative. I have a few issues with this one however. It wasn't nearly as creative and sure the story turn out good in the end. WHAT HAPPENED TO ACTION? I also feel as though it had hardly anything to do with the other books. What happened to Doon and Linda? Well, I wouldnt have bought it if I could go back. The only thing I can do is warn you, and hopeyou listen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled Promises","review":"In the City of Ember we hear that in the past, there were 4 wars and 3 plagues. One would expect the book to be about those world altering events. Instead the book is much smaller and unconnected to the series except in the afterward. The book is about a small town led by a fear mongering holier-than-thou church lady who the author tries to make likable for longer than I could really stand. Also, some of the characters seem recycled with different names slapped on them. Grover for example seems like a less-brooding version of Doon who is interested in snakes instead of bugs.Skip this book. Or if you want to hear every bit of back-story about Ember, just read the afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some big complicated ideas made accessible for young minds","review":"I was surprised at the depth of substance in this book. Our well meaning young heroine discovers that defining goodness is not a simple task of listening to others and doing what they say. Sometimes you have to think for yourself. This is a well told story- I actually read it fourth as it can stand on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prophet of Yonwood","review":"I hate this book. I wanted the apocylipse, i wanted world war watever the people in that book had gotten to. I wanted the Phalanx Nations to reign death and destruction upon the unsuspecting populous of Yonwood.

It also makes you want to keep reading it.Hope you consider this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my first review","review":"I really liked this book.

Just like the Harry Potter series, it's fun and I consider it \\"brain candy\\". For kids its a good series to get them into reading. As an adult, I have enjoyed it as a way to relax and chill after a long day of work. However, this installment in the series was a wast of 5$. The story wasn't good and only the last chapter had much to do with the series. Everything else was elusive. If you have time and money, go for it. Otherwise, pass this book and go straight to The Diamond of Darkhold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't belong as part of the series","review":"The Prophet of Yonwood should not be considered part of the Ember series. It has some valid story lines that include the impact of blindly following orders, and it's relevant in this post 9/11 world. With that being said, this book has nothing to do with the Ember story line, except for the last chapter, which felt like it was a hasty addition and irrelevant to the remainder of the book. I can't imagine any child being enthralled with this book, or appreciating the deeper, more somber undertones that Duprau practically beats the reader over the head with. Overall, it was a disappointment and a completely unnecessary piece of theEmber saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a prequill!!!","review":"I was not aware when I began this book, after reading the other two.

The first two books were not particularly well written, but they were interesting enough. This book however, had no plot and was not related at all to the other three books in the series, minus a five minute blurb at the end. You don't learn anything new, other than the name of the woman that left the notebook behind in book 1.I highly recommend you skip this book - even if it is free - as it is a waste of time and not interesting at all.

I want my money and my life back. This movie is low, low budget. The acting is way over-dramatic, to point of being plain cheezy. The costumes are all leather and zippers to the extreme. The script itself is pretty bad. The characters have no depth and you never have reason to care about them. The photography tries to get artistic or something hip at points but it just doesn't help.I mean, I wanted to like this movie but there is not much good to say about it! How did this film get enough support to be released as a Special Edition? I'd have a hard time recommending this movie to even the hardest of vampire fans.

However, it ultimately comes up empty. That's too bad, because the film is actually quite engaging for most of its running time. I was left wanting more. Perhaps, that is a good thing. The director shows a great deal of promise. He is certainly one to watch in the future. That said, the film is not perfect. The action in, particular, falls flat. The fights/shoot-outs/sword fights just aren't believable at all. The artistic flourishes are stretched out into absurdity, calling attention to themselves rather than aiding the story. Razor Blade Smile is an OK film that deserves to be seen, if only for its good parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad joke...","review":"This film is neither funny, clever, well acted, well shot, thought-provoking...

I had heard about the Linatone supplement but was a bit hesitant. Well, I took the plunge and tried it out. After about four weeks my dogs coat was so soft and shiny it was just amazing. WIth those results I decided to try it with the cats as well. Same result just beautiful. So the Linatone along with the \\"Furminator\\" grooming tool are a sure winner.

The way it is written just made it so easy and enjoyable to read that I ended up breezing right through it.

I live in a rural area, and there are no towered fields nearby for frequent radio practice. The book makes the different types of radio interaction much easier to understand.Gardner breaks down communications by airspace class, which seems pretty sensible. One thing I liked was its discussion of how to interact with Flight Watch, restricted areas, Military Operations Areas, etc. It has a chapter on IFR communications, though I'm not ready for it yet.The book explains clearly the reasons for saying things a particular way, and gives examples of correct practice. It's easy to understand, and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"an outstanding study in leadership","review":"Having read many books on leadership, this is the one I most treasure and share as widely as I can. It provides an intimate view into the foreign policy decision making of two very skilled foreign policy makers. It covers such critical events as the fall of the Berlin Wall, the massacre at Tiananmen Square, and the Persian Gulf War, providing historical framing and then presenting in their own words how President George H.W. Bush and National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft thought through their responses. The reader gets a sense of having a private conversation with the authors, who discuss the many variables they were weighing, their concerns, their relationships with those involved, their actions, and their reflections on the outcomes. Each chapter provides much material for pondering the nature and challenges of real world leadership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Days that shaped our world","review":"I read the book with amazement. I thought it both profound in the efforts to grapple with the end of the Cold War and the lengths that were taken to deal with international crisises. I don't care about the prose or style - it was wonderful to get my hands on a book that gave me a more concrete insights and level headed practicality in foreign policy rahter than that foreign policy in more recent times. Brent Scowcroft and Georege H. W. Bush lead the world through interesting and troubled times and helped us establish the United States as the preminent global power. It's a good read if you are interested in the shaping of foreign policy at the very top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitewash","review":"This book would have taught me how disorganized and incohesive with the Bush foreign policy. I recall Bush as an elder statesman, perhaps weak on the domestic policy, but a genius on diplomacy. I am forced to either admit that I was wrong at the time, or that this book failed to grasp the brilliance of the Bush successes as they really happened. I am forced to conclude that Bush was a good president, but that he can't put together a book for beans. This book is boring, ill-structured and lacks the cohesiveness which was so ably demonstrated at the time. It's self serving without serving the president well. I don't buy the ego in this book. I'm proud to award it one star. No credit for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not now, not ever","review":"A feeble attempt to preserve a legacy. We've been dissecting this book at our lunchtime foreign policy discussion group. This book was supposed to serve as context for understanding today's problems.

What a marvelous book describing the 'behind the scenes' account of some of the most important and momentous events of the 20th century. By not focusing on domestic policies [i.e. politics] the book shows how deftly America (and Bush) managed these dramatic events (winning the Cold War, the Gulf War, etc.). In retrospect, it appears Bush served America very well and it is too bad he only served four years.

Having put out a truly classic album with 1989's CAN'T FIGHT FATE, she was seemingly absent for most of the nineties, save for 1993's well-below-her-talents cd SOUL DANCING. This album should have restored her to some semblance of public awareness, but alas, with the exception of a couple of club hits, didn't. Quite a travesty, because this is probably her finest album, having the right mix of dance and balladry, alot of it cowritten by the artist. Not only is her voice better than ever--one of the VERY few eighties dance divas that could actually SING-but there were at least four or five possible huge singles on this album, not the least of which is the title track, featuring a career high vocal performance. For those who thought Dayne had disappeared, search out this album. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Without You (Remixes) Rock!","review":"Naked Without You is one of the greatest dance hits to come along in awhile!

One of my absolute favorites being \\"That Old Black Magic\\", which (imho) has never been done quite as beautifully as on this album. The missing star is due to the 'unoriginality' any cover-album bears with it.

This book is the main exception. This book is horribly written; instead of the exciting spellcasting and creature duels of the previous books, there is political debate and horrid plot changes.Mageta, The Lion (a hero of the cards) is written to be a machine wielding coward, and a beloved character is horribly murdered. The other legendary spellshapers make cameo apperances, put in only by demand of the Magic team. The author changes characters, warps the plot, and basically ruins the ideals of this set.If you want to buy this book to learn Magic's storyline, save your money.

He follows the story lines that come with the various Magic expansions, and has kept up with the material on the Wizards of the Coast website. This book does not follow the storyline, and actually contradicts it in some spots.He was most disappointed by the omission of what should have been crucial plot elements.

After the dramatic events in Mercadia, this book is an absolute flop.In the story, Moore takes us between the Keldon armies and their quest for reclaiming their heritage and Teferi and Barrin;s attempt to thwart them. This has nothing to do Urza and Yawgmoth. At all.While it may be a good breather and allows for the reader to see what was going on back on Dominaria, the book is not written interestingly enough to make this worthwhile.However, the next three books by Robert King are excellent, and you will be glad that you have familiarized yourself with Keld, Barrin, and all the event sin this book... despite how painful it may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"This is one book that is just no good.What else can I say, I mean other than just beingnot well written it also had Rayne (who by the waywas a very cool character) killed off.*sigh*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Bad","review":"In my opinion which everyone may not agree with, this is the worst book of all the magic the gathering books.

Firstly, many of the questions this expansion raises - what happened to Sidar Jabari and the other Mirage leaders? Where is the Vintara forest and what is its relevance to the story? Where does Shauku come in? - were left unanswered and the unique Jamuuran flavour of Mirage is nowhere to be found - it's just a place where generic fantasy battles are taking place, with the aid of improbable constructions themselves bearing no relation to anything that went before, and with no backstory describing the emergence of the new nation from those in Mirage. The characterisation is minimal to nonexistant, with everyone being a warmonger regardless of whether they are nature mages, planeswalkers with a penchant for experimenting with time or lecturers at the Academy. Again, no reference is made to the past of any of these characters - Jolrael in particular is badly used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I got bored of this early on.

His version here of f.ex. Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood ain't all that weird. He's been playin' this reggea-like version since the mid 80's!The band is extremly good, but some of the spirit disappeared with Larry Wilkins in the grave, but Dean's doing a great job and so is all of the others, too!So if you know Eric well, or know how he is nowadays, BUY THIS DVD!

I didn't expect him to exactly duplicate the songs Burdon made famous with the old Animals, but I didn't expect him to take as much liberty as he did either.The one neat thing about the Eric Burdon video is that it is multi-angle on at least two songs.

I was a kid back in the 60's when the Animals introduced me to British R&B, and it is amazing how strong Eric Burdon's talent and voice is after this many years. The concert is great! He performs many of his biggest rock and R&B hits, and there are a lot of songs included. The DVD is well produced and very entertaining. It is a live concert with short segments between some of the songs where Eric gives some background and tells some interesting anecdotes. I would have preferred that these segments be included as separate features from the concert footage, but they are short and entertaining. This is a fine performance and well worth getting. It includes some adult subject matter that is not suitable for children, but hey, we're from the 60's man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ERIC BURDON AND THE NEW ANIMALS","review":"I can't believe the other reviewers on this item!!!!

The trail descriptions were difficult to follow without a detailed map in hand to keep track of where you were. For some reason Mr. Molvar was reluctant to identify the trails as being a part of the Continental Divide Trail.

Trail status can change annually in The Bob (the author does a great job of disclosing this in his text) - several side trails identified briefly in the book were virtually non-existent , so make sure to consult the local ranger stations when planning your trip.

The choice of songs is weak, and some of the performances are lackluster (although this may not be the editors' fault). The editing is terrible, with shifts into the middle of songs and shifts out of songs before the singing is over. The psychedelic backgrounds are annoying. Worst of all, the camera pays too little attention to the amazing Ikettes as they go wild; instead, you get a lone arm flailing unaccountably into a shot that is focused solely on Tina.I love Ike and Tina and it pains me to see such slock circulating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances, but ...","review":"Their is nothing wrong with Ike, Tina and the Ikettes performances on this DVD.

The weight of the shoes stretches the rack downward. It is just a matter of time before the bottom sections fall off when you close the closet door.Another reviewer spoke of using zip ties to hold the 3 sections together. That might prevent the lower sections from physically falling off, but the rack would still flex from the weight of all the shoes when you close the door. This flexing pulls the rack away from the door (and out from under stabilizing screws).

The screws strip from the mounting door; if they don't strip, the plastic mounts through which the screws are to be installed simply tear from the constant flexing. The metal tubes on which the shoes rest bend, allowing the shoes to fall through. And there's nothing quite so scary in the middle of the night when you hear the horrendous, thundering rush of about 30 pairs of shoes crashing to the ground when the frame fails. My kids referred to it as a \\"shoevalanche.\\" We tried to make this thing work, but ultimately, it was a joke.In a word, don't. Don't try to reinforce it. Don't try to fix it.

Duct tape can go a long way in fixing the joint problem but it's not a miracle. You can also use all sorts of extra hardware and/or adhesives to make sure the rack stays flush with the door at all times. But why put all that time and money into a cheap rack that ends up looking like Frankenstein (if Frankenstein were a shoe rack)? Just get a better one; it will last longer and look nicer.

So far my personal favorites are #2, #4, #9, #10, #11 with the best of all being saved for last at #13 (dig deep here to get the hidden portion of the track). While the scoop on this studio release notes that the tunes were not played/previewed live before recording - I think most of you will agree that seeing them live will add to the treats of shows past.

Maybe I missed something, but I couldn't believe how this book ended. The main character (Debbi/Devi) doesn't seem to have completed her journey to find her identity.

The nails then go in the groove provided to keep the axle straight; not so, the nails tend to angle up whether pushing (hard to do) or using a hammer. Play with the wheel/axle too much and the would starts chipping. I had to super glue the wheel hubs on 4 different wheels, the plastic was low quality. Most of the cars had to go to the shop for repairs and not a one actually ran straight. This is not recommended if you are looking for something simple and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Twist Toys on the Market","review":"My son loves to play with similar products like TanglesTangle Therapy by Tanglebut this item really didn't have same range of movement and in-turn less \\"play value\\" for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"never understood","review":"what were they trying to create it does not entice enough it just bends a little not to realy move it around like my baby tried to"},{"rating":"2","title":"I admit it I'm an ABBA fan","review":"The music is great and the quality is pretty good I don't like the editing with all of the quick cuts but that's how they were doing it then.If you like ABBA you will no doubt enjoy this DVD if not don't bother"},{"rating":"1","title":"Illeagal dvd wont play in America","review":"This product will not play in America. Wrong zone. When I tried to get a replacement I got more run around, and hoops to jump through, than a cheap carnival circus. This is the first time that I have had trouble with an Amazon purchase. If the response that I have received is typical, it does not speak well of Amazon. I am going to give Amazon the benefit of the doubt. Everybody has a bad day ever now and again, but I expect better. Today I ordered this dvd again. I've still got the one that doesn't work. As of now I am stuck with a dvd that will not play and will not be able to get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Guy","review":"If your trying to decide if you should get this or not. I say yes. I personally bought one of these used, one of the refurbished ones, about 2 years ago. Since then I have bought an IPod, but when I travel I still use this thing. Why is this? Because the single AA battery on this thing (Yes, its AA not AAA) will last for a very very long time. I beleive the number they say is 50 hrs and this sounds about right. A single minidisk will also hold a lot, maybe 70 to 90 songs. If you need more space you can simply buy more minidisks which are fairly cheap, and are quite durable. The device definately deserves a 5 star review, but the software that comes with it is a little weak. By comparison to most mp3 player softwares it is very bad software, and after using ITunes it certainly is a pain. You can basically do everything you want with the software, but it will take about two or three times as long as it would with ITunes for instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony should stand behind their products","review":"I own a MZ-N505 that was given to me as a gift less than a year ago. This product does not currently put out any sound through the headphones. When I contacted Sony I was told that it was past the 90 day warranty period and that I would have to pay 95 dollars to have it fixed. The unit was only worth 150 dollars when it was given to me. In response to my dismay about the large repair cost, Sony responded there was nothing they could do and I should either pay to have it repaired or buy a new unit. I have bought many Sony products for myself and as gifts of the years but after this fustrating experience I will not buy another Sony product. Why should I when in less than a year it will not work and they will expect me to fork over more money to them. I recommend not purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"I would recommend this to anyone. Easy to operate and download. It just takes time downloading. I do not use the earphone as provided with the product. I use sports walkman earphones. The upside is that it holds about five hours on one little disk. One battery last forever.

Just about everybody has some gripe about the openMG software. I haven't had any problems with the software at all. I think it is very easy to use and my computer hasn't locked up once. The interface on the player is also simple. I have the rm-mc11el remote and a CaseLogic arm-band carrying case so I can work out with it. The disks are cheap and they hold a lot of music, at least compared to flash memory players. The time it takes to transfer a song from the computer to the player is minimal, about 30 seconds or so. I can transfer a whole cd in less than 5 minutes in the LP4 format. This player would be even better is it had a belt clip or a custom carrying case. I can do without the belt clip because it would probably bounce off my waistline while I jog. The CaseLogic case works, but I would rather have one that fit this player exactly."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy crappy software and no mp3 support","review":"here's the quick and dirty on the sony net md walkman line... they work great and play great and the mini-discs are cool BUT their software absolutely sucks. you CANNOT just transfer mp3 files, you have to convert EVERYTHING to the sony proprietary format first and then transfer the files, and you have to do this all with the sony sonicstage software which is a major pain to use. on top of that the transfer rates are WAAAY slow. stay away unless you really love sony for some reason. had I known that you have to convert everything to ATRAC3 before it would transfer the files I would have never bought this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Sony's NetMD software is not user friendly.

I up graded to XP and I haven't got it to work since. I have gone to sony website and down loaded every program and driver. None of them would install under XP. Microsoft has no drivers for it.

It has to convert them to ATRAC, which takes for ever, and eats of disk massive amounts of disk, since you now have copies of your songs in at least 2 different formats. The tranfer to device is reasonably fast over USB, but the conversion from mp3 to ATRAC is no where near as fast as ripping a CD.The disk format does not allow folders within folders, so you cannot group by artist and album.Also, the software has the concept of \\"checking out\\" music, so you cannot delete a song on the player without connecting to the original computer you used to download.I'm planning on returning this item ASAP, and getting a good Samsung mp3 player instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"I have had this player for a little over a year and a half and it has just stopped recording. I called Sony and they said it can be replaced for $109 (not including tax and shipping & Handling) which is clearly not worth it. I tried to search for a fix online and found that a lot of other people have the same problem with the player. Not only that but the problem occurs at around the same time, a year and a half to two years. Before the problem occured the minidisc was a great player. I would buy a five pack of minidisc and be able to record and carry 25 to 30 cd's worth of material in my pocket. The player is so good that after it broke I still thought about going to get another one, but after reading the other people who have had problems with the system I think I'll be moving back to cd's. It was good while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"One problem","review":"This is a great product, i can store my music on the mds so i can take the mp3s off my pc, which is awesome. I can fit 3-5 Lps on a single disc at 132 KBS, awesome. I can transfer an entire cd in less than 5 minutes, awesome...PROBLEM- transferring an entire disc worth of MP3s takes 40 minutes unless the files are already in ATRAC3 with USB 1.0. That really [bad], but its worth it, becaus eoppin in a new disc is so much better than rewriting a memory card. One thing that is really great about the minidisc, its aweosme for running and jogging, not as small as an mp3 player, but still great.

Not only did the software installation go badly, the actual transfer of songs was long and unreliable. It takes about half an hour to transfter to cd JUST ONTO THE HARD DRIVE. You must transer it using the software due to it uses some weird formatte. Then burning the songs took another ten minutes. When you did get them on, youll find that after an hour, the song data gets mixed with each other, and the tracks start 10 seconds into the previous song.

It is so good that it prompted me to acquire all other Keegan's books which are available. Sadly none has come close to Fortunes of War. I do not care for the Spain vs England background. It is the story of the two lovers which gripped me and held me till the end. Our two lovers are such likable beautiful young men, their characters solid and almost real. When they were forced to be separated I felt a tug at my heart and just had to keep on reading until 3 in the morning to savor their reunion. Their love for each other is lusty, breathless yet tender and touching. I am a straight woman and have not touched a romance novels for years. However Fortunes of War has become one of my top ten favorites. I hope the book will be savored by a wider audience and not just men in love with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weigh hey up he rises!","review":"I don't really like \\"historical\\" novels but it is impossible to get \\"gay romance\\" or \\"gay adventure\\" without going back a couple of centuries or so (what is WRONG with publishers)? FORTUNES OF WAR is better than a lot of \\"Historical\\" romances because Keegan is not afraid to put in just as much LOVE as you find in a heterosexual novel (though with better sex). His plots tend to wander or lose steam in this genre, and I personally prefer his contemporary thrillers like ICE, WIND & FIRE, but this one is delicious as a box of Valentine's day chocolates."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good historical novel from an interesting point of view","review":"As historical novel go, this is fairly good and interesting. Set during the reign of Elizabeth the First, when Spanish Empire tried in vain to subdue England and privateers and corsairs scoured the seas, this novel takes the point of view of the eventual losers, the spaniards, through the eyes of an Irishman/spaniard nephew and assistant of the ambassador of Spain in England. In Ireland he will make acquaintance with a young disgraces son of an Irish Earl, Robin. They fall in love with eacxh other, but fate will separate them. They wuill see each other at sea, among battles, pirates and they will bot experience picaresque adventures in Spain. The historical part is fairly accurate, and whilst I think that the novel would have used some more editing, it remains a very good work. I've loved the disenchanted yet loyal Dermot channing and the brave, tender Robin.A great gay historical novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Add me to that list of people who bought this highly rated timing light based on reviews only to go to use it for the third time and find that it had no display..........dead.

The book goes on to explain a strippers percetion of her job, then it goes on to tell us that strippers go through greatlengths to justify what they do and how they blame society, x-relationships, family and others, but never themselves. The book goes through many interviews, all of which are very much common and related. A good girl strips to finance her education, to support her children after her man leaves her or to support a drug habit. Or the most common, but not admitted, just for the money.

This book covers interviews with strippers to find out why they strip and how they feel about it. All the answers are the same, too bad. It should cover interviews on the men that visit these clubs. Why do they visit these clubs, what do they think about the strippers, how much are they willing to spend, etc. Since all these stripper books are the same, I was hoping someone would cover interviews with the patrons instead of the stripers. Overall, this book was not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does nothing to dispel a persons misconceptions","review":"The interviews were a little interesting, the book was well written and structured, however it does not discuss the relationship of prostitution to stripping, pervasive influence of government and/or organized crime nor the long term effects such exploitive use of a strippers beauty may have had on their relationships since. The concept seems to need a little more in-depth exploration. I also felt that the critical, feministic theory is limited to only a few paragraphs and it should have been covered more thoroughly. I don't think this book does much to challenge a persons preconceptions or prejudices."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Season 4\\" is just the last half of Season 3","review":"Really disappointing if you purchase these expecting to see episodes of Saving Grace that would follow the episodes broadcast and available on DVD for Seasons 1, 2 and 3.These 9 episodes are simply the last (final) 9 episodes of Season 3, and are included on the 5-disk \\"Final Season\\" DVD set of Season 3 episodes.

An example of the mistakes in this book would be that it states that \\"tender\\" and \\"lush\\" are both nouns of quality. They are not. Another example would be that \\"childhood\\" is a concrete noun--the book itself states that \\"concrete nouns refer to persons, places, and objects that you can see, hear, smell, touch, or taste.\\" Childhood concrete? I think not. It amazes me that this book is in its fourth edition and still contains so many mistakes. I'm only on the ninth lesson and have found many more mistakes.

I loved the mix of Victorian sensibilities with space colonization, especially the use of Industrial Revolution-era technology (with a little alchemy thrown in) to create spaceships and stations.

It is with some regret that, in my opinion, this novel is not one of his better efforts. Frankly it was a chore to read to completion. It was not entertaining which has to be just about the worst thing you can say about a science-fiction novel.

He attaches himself to every major franchise (X-files, Dune, Star Wars) and ruins their legacy with his bad writing and poor plots. This series was the most pathetic star wars storylines that shows his complete misunderstanding of the Star Wars Universe. As mentioned by another review, I feel sorry for the other competent authors that now must take this into consideration into the Star Wars timeline. Ultimately, this series does not have the feel of Star Wars and is just another lame SciFi trilogy with the SW name attached.Avoid this and all other Anderson works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great; Gotta read Champions","review":"Anderson has brought star Wars to a new level, often describing meals and lifestyles.

The only downside is I still haven't read Champions of the Force."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"I did not enjoy this book, but I confess that perhaps I simply misunderstood what this book would be about when I purchased it.

I believe \\"A Fine Mess\\" is now somewhat difficult to find (see http://www.dbinfosource.com for more info) so while I do prefer the grittier, more expansive two discs worth of material on that release, if you can't find it or are looking for a place to start, then by all means go with this disc!

Getz, with the help of some of the world's most talented musicians, performs a variety of compositions in different tempos & genres, that most musicians can only dream of doing.

Irony is, Reilly falls into the hole he dug for Daly. Some of the things the golfers did and said to Mr. Reilly were obviously not meant to be published. However, Mr. Reilly betrays their confidence in hopes of some cheap laughter at their expense. Pro-golfers will take a dim view. This book could have been great, but cheap tricks and crude language are never funny, Mr. Reilly. And the chapter on the lady golfer reeks of sexism.

I thought he showed a fundamental disrespect for his craft, the game and for the golfers he served by taking this approach.

The book is not so much about caddying, as the title might suggest, as it is a series of lightweight, cliched personality pieces about a variety of golfers, professional and recreational, and pseudo-golfers (that is, big stakes golf gamblers). Was the book edited? As just one glaring example, in the chapter about David Duval Reilly recounts Jack Nicklaus giving advice to David Duval during a practice round at the 1992 U.S. Open while standing on the famous 18th tee.

The copy fills only the bottom half, and the last third of the text/prints are cut off, as if the original were larger than the current page and no action was taken to correct the problem before the book went to print. I can't see its value as a historical reproduction, as so much of the information is missing. It is, in my opinion a total waste of money, and I would advise anyone looking at this book for any sort of technical knowledge to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough going","review":"This is not a reference work for beginners.

I suspect that other people working in different philosophical fields would find this work just as useful, as this edition covers a wide variety of philosophers from vastly different times and places. As someone who is generally interested in philosophy and the history of ideas, I often enjoy browsing the sections on individual modern, postmodern and Asian philosophers, and so I have found this book to be helpful in expanding my own intellectual horizons.

Oxford dic. has a more amiable format with bibligraphies etc. but the coverage of this one is far broader.Well, okay, this may be the best available of its kind.. but still poor in many respects. Tainted by a ridiculous multi-culturalist concern which doesnt befit a serious philosophical attitude.. philosophical concepts are mostly absent outside the current analytic terms, and continental philosophy seems to be represented in terms of a poor treatment of certain important figures rather than serious explication of relevant concepts.. If youre a student of analytic philosophy you'll find important concepts like truth tables or coherentism covered in detail.. that is the only satisfactory aspect of this dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful reference","review":"Entries on just about everything, this book has been a very important reference for various philosophy classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise and compelling","review":"All the reviews have already said everything I would, so I am adding my rating.

Additionally, the hinges on the monitor are very loose and conventional wisdom is that they need to be replaced with new (not used) laptop hinges which cost about 100 each (one for each side of the monitor!). Now the headphone jack has a short in it and sometimes the speakers work after plugging in a headphone and sometimes not. The system has very poor battery life and heats up much more so than other laptops I have used. I will never buy another Toshiba...its construction stinks!

The tools are very thick, but also very light-weight. I wasn't expecting the material to be so thick given the low price. I can't imagine these breaking during normal use (I have a small urban backyard garden plot of flowers and vegetables), but if they do, they are covered by a lifetime warranty.Do not hesitate. If you do any sort of gardening, order these tools. I am really happy I discovered this tool set. \\"Fiskars\\" is embossed in tiny letters along the orange part of the handle, but other than that, it's hard to tell these are Fiskars.They come in a plastic blister-pak that you'll have to cut open with scissors and discard.

For a the beginner listener to SRC, think the industrial attitude and roll of Nine Inch Nails mixed with the slow '60ish retro trip/hip-hop of Portishead, with the help of some techno, jungle, thrash, and plenty of Cure/NIN/Smiths-inspired lyrics.

Tobey's voice is strong and forceful, sometimes fantastically shining. The songs show a range, from Garbage( one of my favorite all time bands) and Rebublica tinged tunes, to the loud metalics you might expect from NIN.

At best she can be transformative to read, I'm thinking of The Four-Gated City, The Sweetest Dream, The Golden Notebook, The Good Terrorist, Love Again. She has written some stellar books. Here, she is full of brilliant ideas, but they aren't fully integrated into the novel, so it is a little clunky to read, story hung with politically astute insights. Also, it's a little bit dated, such as, the protagonist is 45, which was considered quite a bit older in the 60s and 70s than we consider it now that the \\"Baby Boomers\\" are well over 45. There is a recurring dream in the book that could have been edited completely out, or at least made not as intrusive.

But this lack of feeling and over all vibe, if you will, was a stark contrast to everything I love about house. I've heard GV's tracks on many other compilations and each sounded promising.Since my initial time of purchase, I've only listened to it 4 or 5 times, just to be sure my tastes haven't changed and my ears haven't deceived me.

NESCO replaced these parts, again under warranty, and we ruined several meals before we gave up on it for a while.

But even WITH food, we STILL got nauseated, BAD stomachaches, and vomiting. It does give a bit of an energy boost that feels like crack (j/k) for a short period, but it is NOT at ALL worth all the pain, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, headache, CHEST TIGHTNESS, and uncomfortable feelings that come with it.

I had an upset stomach and vomited on and off throughout the rest of the day. I decided to give it a second chance, but the same thing happened the next day. I'm not sensitive to medication or supplements or anything, so it's just the vitamin. I wish I could give it zero stars, but unfortunately that's not an option. A couple pounds is definitely NOT worth being sick all day everyday. I will not continue to use this vitamin and strongly encourage others not to start. One a Day should look into a safe way to aid your metabolism, not one that makes you sick. Extremely disappointed in this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with the results..","review":"My experience with this multivitamin has been pleasant. I do admit the first day I took it, I wasn't aware of the effect of taking it on an empty stomach and I did vomit. However, once I started taking this an hour or two after eating I was completely fine. Perhaps a lot of the women taking this aren't waiting long enough for digestion to ensue before taking it? Either way, after I got past that issue I've been feeling fine with it. I have noticed quicker wound healing than previously. Also, whenever my face breaks out, I have noticed the blemishes clearing up a little quicker than normal (this could just be psychological but it seems this way). For someone who doesn't get enough nutrients in the day, this is wonderful. If you are a person who gets all of your nutrition from food (which is the preferred method), then these supplements are really of no use to your body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upset Stomach!","review":"Agree with the comments posted here.

Just ten min after taking it I had to pull to the side of the road but the pill was still in my system so during the day it gave me incredible gas(basically makes you want to go #2). To tell you the truth though the active mind and body used to make me sick as well but not the point of actually needing to throw up. The whole day I had a headache and just felt very sick.

It has caffeine and other energizers which were perfect for the morning. I'm trying to lose weight and already take multivitamins so I thought I could just take this instead. I started taking this every morning and soon I noticed I wasn't feeling well. I attributed this to just it being early.After a while, my nausea became stronger and soon I was unable to hold down food. I had never become physically sick before but taking this pill had me bent over the sink/trash/toilet. Even still, I tried to ignore this. Finally, after a week of this, I went online and googled this product.

Within an hour, I threw up. The last time was just today about 30 minutes after lunch.

The WOAD Active Metabolism gives me the ongoing energy boost to get up in the morning and work out. So far I lost 6 pounds in 3 weeks.

The book turns out to be essentially a showcase for the yarn art of Mariano Valdez, the husband of the author. While the art is colorful and interesting, the book did not serve my purpose of gathering detailed descriptive information on their sacred rituals, as the title suggests. The text basically describes, in short paragraphs, what each piece of art represents. It gaves some basic insight into Huichol deities and animal allies, but only in small snippets, so it is hard to put all of these puzzle pieces together to form a cohesive overall picture or understanding of their religious practices. A nice book of art, but not much else. It is also a fairly thin book -- not worth the price, in my opinion, unless you feel that the high-quality images of Valdez's artwork are worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Teacher","review":"I have owned a Petersen for about 15 years now.

The stand back folds up to become the case, but it doesn't seem to lock when you unfold it, and the screws that tighten it aren't great. You constantly have to watch that it's not going to fold up and dump the music.I used the stand three times, and the ring that allows the height adjustment just snapped. Not as I was adjusting it, but as I was sitting and playing.

The shelf that holds the music is very thin plastic and does not lock on tightly, cannot hold books, only sheet music, because it's too flimsy. The legs are sturdy but very heavy, you might as well get a regular metal stand. The stand is very short, you can't use it if you stand to play or sing.

It was sturdier than those thin metal folding stands. It was compact when folded up and easy to carry. It was easy to set up. But I've had problems with this stand and am now shopping for another one to replace it.First, one of the legs was too loose. It slid out each time I moved the stand (and in my flute choir, we move around a lot during performances, so this was not good). So I had my handy husband alter the leg and it was better than new. But then, after a performance one night, I heard a snap as I was putting it away. One of the pieces that the legs fit into cracked - and not one that was holding the \\"altered piece\\". After many hours of super glue and tape repairs, I'm giving up on this.

I contacted Petersen, which promised us \\"replacement parts,\\" which were, of course, on back order. That is some two months ago, and there has been no trace of the \\"replacement parts,\\" and no reaction from Petersen when I've written to complain.

Also, I grabbed the stand below the desk to move it on a gig and a couple of the legs on the bottom fell out on the floor while on a restaurant gig in front of an audience and it was very embarrassing.

Then, when I wanted a full refund--including shipping and handling--Amazon was very polite, but merely referred me to to Musician's Friend for customer service. (Why use Amazon as a middle-man if they provide no customer service protection when dealing with a 3rd party they endorse by linking customers to them?) Musician's Friend too were polite; they blamed Amazon for the slow process of the order.

It was rented at some gas station in Vancouver Washington. The film was not a Vampire movie but a stupid low budget movie about these people fearing the end of the world when night falls. It had that David Birney in it and it was horrible. We went back and asked for NIGHTFALL the TROMA Movie and that was a much greater improvement. What ever you do pass on the Asimov \\"classic\\" which apparrently is directed by Julie Corman.. and buy the Delullo classic. It is worth it believe me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A brief comment","review":"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I haven't seen Ed Wood's Plan Nine from Outer Space, so maybe it's just the second worst movie ever made, but anyway, it's up there. The actors looked like they rounded up a group of homeless people and gave them some acting lessons. The acting was poor, the dialog was worse, the sets were hoky, and the overall implementation of Asimov's concept was atrocious. Even the audience was laughing derisively at how bad it was after the first half hour of the flick. I give it two stars just for effort since it's at least based on the Asimov story and perhaps their heart was in the right place, but otherwise it would rate one star. Possibly worth seeing if you've seen the Ed Wood movie just to see if this one is actually worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame...NOT the Asimov classic","review":"Beware...this is not the Issac Asimov classic by the same name.

The rest of this CD is painfully corny and boring-- especially the first track, the last track, and the title track. I like Vicente Amigo, but this is his worst album. Most of the songs just don't have the hearty essence of real flamenco.

I was turned on to this cd from a friend, and in turn I have purchased 3 for other friends.

The distinct unique sound of Indian instruments weaved with Western guitar and rock sound makes me want to get up and dance, shout with pure joy, every time I play this CD, which is everyday.I am also a belly dancer and have created dance routines just for this CD. Everywhere I have played Anant's music people have fallen in love with this extraordinary sound. I played this for a Hindu friend of mine and he immediately fell into the rhythm and mood this CD invokes and bought CD's for his family.I cannot say enough about this Anant Jesse's music, it is exuberant, delightful, dynamic, eclectic. Highly recommended. I hope that Anant is soon back in the studio, I am waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookie Cutter","review":"I just received this item and its the perfect size!

You can actually stick your finger into the coffee just after pouring and you won't get burned!! Also, the Glass Coffee Cup Level Gauge broke on one of our urns and we haven't been able to find a replacement. We are considering getting rid of all 3 urns and buying something else.

This book is so filled with grammatical errors, misspellings, and just bad writing that I found it incredibly distracting to read, incredibly disrespectful of the reader, and just plain unprofessional.The content barely scratched the surface on many issues. There are much better books available from Amazon. Try \\"21 Things I Wish My Broker Had Told Me\\" by Frank Cook or \\"Your First Year in Real Estate: Making the Transition from Total Novice to Successful Professional\\" by Dirk Zeller."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was very poorly written...","review":"I am sorry to say that this book was most assuredly the worst book concerning tactics for getting started in real estate that I have read. It was full of spelling errors, grammatical errors, and typo errors. This should never happen in a published work. One gets the feeling after having read the first two to three chapters that the author simply wrote down as much as he could remember and then hurridly put the book out for sale at 22.00 bucks a pop. The author also has the annoying habit of using exclamation points where they are not needed!The author, after the first parts of the book, resorts to giving the reader terms of the business. Fantastic. I think we can all find out what those terms mean without having to buy this book.Save your money and look elsewhere. This book is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Just OK\\" starter book","review":"Although there is usable, valuable information in this book, overall it's just OK. There are a lot of errors that should have been caught. That lack of attention to detail in a listing or sales contract could land you in court.There was also some padding to make the book bigger. When the author tells you to make a list to compare brokerages, he includes the list three times so you can compare three brokers!My guess is, that in the future, the author will write a better, more in depth book about real estate. He knows the business and has been very successful. In the meantime, \\"Your First Year in Real Estate,\\" by Dirk Zeller, is a better introduction to the profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"He needs a proof reader","review":"I have read many many books in my 40 years, and I have NEVER seen such an EMBARRASSING collection of misspellings and poor punctuation in any book, even those which were self-published. A run through a basic spell checker was obviuosly never done, and author has very poor grammar skills indeed, not knowing the prover use of their vs. there.Its hard to take someone's advice seriously when their writing skills are so very very bad. I would be embarrassed to release this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful!","review":"I just picked up a copy of this book and after reading the first chapter, have had enough! Although I'm sure it's filled with some helpful tidbits, the gross about of grammatical and spelling errors over-shadows this. This author's credibility is not only based upon the accolades on the back cover, but by the book's format. By no means am I an editor, but this book's editor should have, at the very least, crosschecked the copy with a word processing program.Never before have I encountered such carelessness and to realize that I purchased a book with grammatical errors, shocks me. Boy, am I sorry I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Nash's Real Estate book","review":"Frustrating to read, due to all of the grammatical errors. It gives you the feeling that most of the it was transcribed from illegible notes made on a stack of napkins, or directly from a voice recording made while driving a car. Maybe with better editing the next edition will be worthwhile, though most of the content seemed pretty basic (though, I'll admit, I'm no real estate pro). Right now, I would invest my book dollars elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty but not too durable","review":"I bought this dress for my daughter's 4th birthday she adores it however five minutes after she put it on the little rose buds around the waist started falling off, and she was just dancing in it!

Unfortunately, too few books and journal articles have been published on this important topic. With the field of librarianship facing a time not far away when several of its current leaders will be retiring, this wonderful book depicts the attributes of future library leaders. The book is organized in nine \\"attention holding\\" chapters. It is not just based on perceptions about effective leaders, but this volume reflects both quantitative and qualitative research on library leadership. Practicing academic and public librarians provided pithy comments on what is required to be a library leader. This book is a \\"must buy\\" for anyone interested in library leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mikey is the best but overall I'm disappointed","review":"My son got this toy along with the other three for his fourth birthday. We like Mikey the best but they were overall a disappointment. They go terribly slow although Mikey is the fastest ( they all go different speeds ) They do nothing more then roll straight across the floor. By the commercial we thought they did a lot more. They make no noise nor do their arms or weapons move that is all manually which is hard to do when they are rolling across the floor they'll fall down. He likes them but it was not all that he thought they would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"get back on the cross...there's no fire here","review":"On Get Off The Cross, Firewater sounded like a Tom Waits, Pogues, Nick Cave cover band doing original tunes. It was absolutely wonderful, a 5-star affair. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the follow-up. The wait went for naught. This was a monumental let down after the magic and moodiness of Get Off The Cross. Ponzi has few, if any, stand out tracks. Firewater was a real cool band that seemed to ruin the effect once they realized how cool they were. Grab a copy of Get Off The Cross...We Need The Wood For The Fire before you purchase this lesser effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Songs! that's it!","review":"On this entire Cd there were only 2 really good songs.

I may be wrong, but it looks like a bunch of photocopies bounded with spiral bound. The contents of the packet are basically the same thing you would get from the Immigration and Naturalization Service if you call them and request a naturalization package. And if you get it from the INS it's free. There's also a tape that comes with the packet that could help people who don't understand English very well practice what the interview would be like. This is probably the most valuable item in the packet. It would be useful for someone who can't get anyone to read them the questions in English. I recommend instead (if your first language is Spanish) Carlos F. Paz's Practica para el Examen de Ciudadania (available at Amazon). It's a real book, with more content than this one, and it costs four times less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"This is not even a book!

We got him this set for Christmas, we just hung them up on his bedroom ceiling, and he thinks they are great. However, with the set we got, the planets are only about 2/3 of the advertised size. In our case, it's really not that bad, because they are still impressively sized in his room. But, if you really need them to be the advertised size, you will be disappointed. The sizes we got are [Planet(s) (Ad size, Actual size)]:Sun (36\\", 23\\"), Jupiter (22\\", 13\\"), Saturn (18\\", 12\\"), Uranus, Neptune (14\\", 9\\"), Earth (12\\", 8\\"), Venus (12\\", 7.5\\"), Mars, Mercury (10\\", 7\\"), Pluto, Moon (8\\", 5\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"We bought this set for our 5,5 yo for Christmas. What a disappointment! The pump stopped working withoin 5 minutes, and Neptune had a huge hole in it (impossible to repair). Other planets can not hold enough air to look like little balls (like on the photo). They look sad...When I asked my son if it was okay with him to send it back to Amazon, he didn't mind at all. And this is a boy who is CRAZY about Space and Planets...I personally LOVE Learning Resources company, but this product did not meet our usual expectations. I am sending it back...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Toxic","review":"I bought this item for my son's 3rd birthday. He is planet obsessed and wants to hold everything, so this is ideal for him. Unfortunately the quality is low and the materials are questionable. I could smell the chemicals before I got this out of the box. No where on Amazon's page OR the packaging is there any detail regarding the materials this product is made from. My guess is PVC/poly vinyl. With everything proven about how toxic VOCs and vinyl materials are, why are kid's toys still being manufactured with it? Other reviewer's comments about egg-shaped planets and poor quality is completely accurate - Saturn's rings are droopy and sad, Uranus and Venus are shaped like eggs, the smaller planets lose air quickly - but since this the only product of its kind on the market, physical flaws and poor quality can be lived with. The toxic smell is another story. Unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea. Poor quality.","review":"The pump is essentially worthless. It took less time to blow them up manually. The small planets are very misshapen. The shape is more like that of a lemon than a sphere. All but 2 did not hold air more than a day or two. Saturn looks like it has pieces of shoddy, plastic-encased scaffolding hanging off of it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"neptune had a hole in it and won't hold air","review":"the product is every colorful and easy to use. The quality of workmanship in not so hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea with Poor Design","review":"Pump is a joke. I used my electric air pump or else this would have taken hours to inflate. Even so, the whole process took approximatley 4-5 hours (including repairing Saturn with worthless patches provided). Saturn is poorly designed and had a tear hole at the point where the rings connect to the planet (a hole and this is discovered the first time we inflated it)! The smell of the plastic is so strong in the room we have to keep the door open and ventilate it during the day. If the smell does not disappear I am repacking the product and returning it for refund. I recall the scandal last year in China for using toxic paint in toys. Who knows if these Chinese manufactured products were or were not involved in that disaster. I do intend to call the manufacturer today and request a replacement Saturn. I don't expect much, but I will give it a try. A great concept, but poorly produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was greater than i expected!! my 5 year old boy just loved it!!","review":"we used it as a decoration for my 5 year old boy birthday party, it was outer space theme, he helped us to hang the planets and the sun, he had so much fun!! and then after the party we played with them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far below expectations","review":"The planets do not form a toy perfect sphere. In the case of the Moon, Mercury and Pluto, the prints are largely absent from the surface and are all nearly equal (blank). Saturn's rings are heavy and give the impression of being a hat that ring. The idea for inflatable solar system is good, but that, specifically, is very poor. Keep them hanging because my 3 year old son is very picky about those details that he does not know ...

We also got an extra mercury (so we are pretending it's Pluto's moon). The only thing about this is the smell when first opening it. It took about a week of airing these out in the garage to get that rubber smell out enough to hang. Then it took a few more days in the bedroom to finally have the smell go away.

First, it comes with a \\"pump\\" and I put pump in quotes because it is really quite useless when it comes to blowing up any of the planets and the sun. Second, three of my planets had a hole in them. Of course, it does include \\"patches\\" for holes, but it really is just thin pieces of packing tape which are again quite useless. If I were not beginning the unit on solar systems tomorrow and in need of some visual props, I would have returned the set. Needless to say, I am not going to choose a product from Learning Resources for future classroom enrichment. Save your money and buy another solar system display.**UPDATE 12/4/12**I contacted Learning Resources and they decided to send me out a replacement set. I hope that the planets are leak free as the kids in my classroom are enjoying have them up as we study the planets and the solar system.

The baker is also a nice size for taking something medium-large to a potluck rather than something large or very large. Although this baker will release foods and any burned on material, it does take a bit of scrubbing to get anything burned off. My baker came with a hole bored into the top handle, by design, and I am still wondering if a factory employee made a mistake in putting one there or if it serves a practical purpose or is part of the design? The hole doesn't look like it does either, and a concern I have is whether or not moisture getting inside this tiny hole will cause any unglazed stoneware inside to eventually crack or break or cause the handle to break off. Does anyone know? Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks, John Ed, for not taking the easy route...","review":"It would have been simple for the author to take the easy, obvious route here, telling a straight-ahead story about a washed-up football coach on his last legs who wins the big game at the end and everything ends happily ever after. Instead, he turned it into a funny, insightful tale that works on so many levels and rings totally true. It is NOT a football book! It's a story with fascinating characters (go deeper than what might appear to be stereotypes at first read) and so much local color it almost reads like a movie script. I've enjoyed Bradley's work in Esquire and SI and I'm glad I found this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Chicago for U.S. newcomers\\" would be helpfully descriptive","review":"My rating - take it for what's it's worth - is based on the book's use to me, as a U.S. born Chicago newcomer. There are portions of this book, devoted to entertainment, dining, weather, and neighborhoods, that I found useful. Even the sociological aspects of America, as discussed in this book, were a bit of an eyeopener (seeing ourselves as others see us). Still, this is less of a Chicago guide and more \\"Welcome to America\\". For those of us who are already familiar with the logistics of opening a checking account, or the difference between a condo and an apartment, the definative published guide to Chicago culture remains to be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better for those who have never lived in the U.S., but...","review":"Well worth the cost.

Yeah that's the \\"plot\\". Yawn. I know it makes no sense.Why couldn't they have at least shown more scenes with that gorgeous Italian woman.

She's the only socially redeeming thing about this misguided effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"I spent several years being a confirmed self-help junkie. I read everything I could get my hands on, went to seminars and was a passionate seeker. When I finished this book, I remember thinking, \\"I don't have to ever read another self-help book.\\" Of course, I have read many others, but ACTUALIZATIONS remains my all-time favorite. It's profoundly full of memorable ideas and insights. You may find yourself quoting it to your friends. Quite simply, Stewart Emery is one of the best teachers I've ever encountered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concepts but outdated.","review":"I had to write this review because there were nothing but glowing reviews when I purchased the book. This book is OLD. I think it was written in 1977 and it reads that way. The author uses a lot of hippie terminology. It just gave me the feeling that it was really out of date. I am admittedly a self-help book junkie, so I feel embarrassingly qualified to review the thing. A lot of his concepts seem \\"new age\\". Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with that, it's just that over the last few decades writers seem to have become more and more adept at sharing this kind of knowledge without sounding hokey. Do your self a favor, buy something written in the last couple years. If there are any ideas worth keeping, rest assured, your favorite contemporary author has borrowed it and made it easier to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"While this material is easy to understand, I found it superficial. It is simply a kit. Expect nothing more. The material seems dated, particularly in light of September 11. Also, the listing of US Embassies and Consulates lists Czechoslovakia rather than the Czech Republic and the Republic of Slovakia. Again, dated material. The production quality is painfully cheap. I was very disappointed in this material, and I think it is vastly overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring sequel","review":"I read this the other day and I wasn't so impressed!

This album sounds better now than it did when it came out in '85. And it sounded pretty good back then, too.First off, the playing is superb and the sound is amazing even now. Second - while 'Thunder' isnt 'innovative' - the writing is INTELLIGENT, and every song has its own identity. There is definite Van Halen, Accept, Maiden influences. Even a slight progessive sound on \\"Run For Your Life\\". \\"Clockwork Toy\\" has early thrash influences. And there is more. Get past the rather cheesy chorus of the opening track though, and its a great listen.There are a lot of different 'sounds' here. Which is good, right? The bottom line is this album sounds better than it did when I was in High School. Its a lost classic. You cant go wrong if you like this style of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"THUNDER INDEED!","review":"I don't remember if I've reviewed this CD before but I have to say that Mr. Akira Takasaki is one of my favorite rock/metal guitarists, period!

For me rock music doesn't get much better then what these guys throw down. They've had a few lineup changes but on this CD is the classic lineup that fans like me love.And I want to take a moment to mention their great and criminally overlooked drummer, Munetaka Higuchi, who passed away a few months ago.As a drummer myelf I have always loved his energetic and tasty playing and how he really complimented Akira's playing.

So, producer Max Norman (as he always did in those times) made them change their sound and become \\"hair-metal\\" - with all the package: make-up, outrageous clothing, reverb drums, etc, etc. THe final result was not a bad album at all, but, at its best, it sounds like just a pedestrian metal album filled with weak pop metal songs who serve only one purpose: make room for the magnificent solos of Akira Takasaki, a genial guitarist with feeling and melody.

I almost forgot what I was trying to prove when I followed through.The book does not explain how to use the formulas. So, the problem sets are hard, because you are not sure how to apply the formulas.A lot of the later examples are based on the result of the earlier ones.

Having a proper stroke is essential yet it is only part of putting. Every book I have ever read on putting does a poor job on 'reading greens' and this book also does a poor job on this aspect. I don't care how well you strike the putt, if you don't know how to read the contours of the greens you will miss the putt by feet and not inches. I recommend you seek out a PGA professional who will teach you how to read greens. Not all PGA professionals are equal in this regard so ask around different clubhouses.

My wife was the only one using the machine and she is 200 lbs, well below the suggested weight maximum, so this seems like shoddy work to me.At the end of the day, the $300 we spent on it would have been better served getting a membership to a gym for three years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller 5 stars - Manufacturer 1 star","review":"The seller of this product was great, but the item itself was a nightmare. It arrived with two left base supports and when I called the manufacturer for a replacement part they challenged the situation claiming that it was impossible. I had to provide photos as proof and call for a parts pick-up. When the replacement part arrived it was the wrong part. I again had to call for a pick-up and request a replacement part. It took 3 tries to get the correct part and correct bolts. I found the customer service to be difficult and rude.

Maybe 4 months after I started using it the cable broke. NO, I am not over the wright limit. The cable hit and injured my foot when it snapped with amazing force. A friend had the same thing happen this morning to her. I think there is a design flaw. Unless you like massive bruises on the top of your foot and having X-Rays, I'd pass on this thing. If it had been continuously used I could see how it just wore out, but less than a year of use? My friend has had hers for about 19 months she says but didn't use it the whole time.

Amazingly, most of the Gazelle was still intact. However the water bottle holder was broken. As this is an optional component, I went ahead and assembled the Gazelle and contacted the company's customer service. I was promised a replacement, but here it is over 4 months later and I still haven't received the thing.I realize this is just a minor component and the rest of the Gazelle is working fine. I just can't recommend any product from a company that has such ineffectual customer service.

I too wore out the tape from playing it too much.In 1985 I attended an INXS concert at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. This concert was performed just months prior to the release of Listen Like Theives. Many of the songs that INXS performed in concert were from The Swing. I remember when INXS performed \\"Burn For You\\", you could have heard a pin drop when it was over and then there was applause. I was in awe. This was by far the most spiritual experience I've ever had at a rock 'n' roll concert. I've been to many since and nobody has matched the experience of INXS. While this album captures some of the energy that INXS had in concert, it's a close second to the real thing. It's regretable that Michael was taken from us too soon.This is a great album, period. Buy it, you will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I am a big fan of INXS, so it was so nice to have this CD.

Superb playing from everyone, with jaw-dropping work from the two leaders, guitarist Django Reinhardt and violinist Stephane Grapelli/Grappelly (it is spelled both ways on the packaging). As far as GREAT recordings are concerned, these are among the most fun. The interplay and invention are exciting and the effect on listeners is palpable, producing joy and probably even some dancing.

Great Packaging! Good Sound!","review":"No less a guitar great than Les Paul has declared Django the best guitarist that there has ever been. Les Paul should know as he's lived through many of them including Eddie Van Halen. From a guy who totally improvised great solo after great solo at speeds that Eddie could only reach by using his two-handed technique, Django just used the two working fingers of his left hand. Incredible! I used to own the old 2-disc \\"Djangologie\\" covering his material prior to this period and although his playing was great to hear, the hiss and bad recording wasn't so I'm glad although we have here the '49 version and only 23 tracks, the sound quality is vastly improved and is decent considering what must have been the condition of the original master after all these years. I also like the cardboard packaging and the liner notes. If you like to hear great jazz guitar played in the acoustic style, this is the one to get.

There are certainly other pleasures, particularly for Who fans seeking virgin versions of later classics, but for me this particular track sticks out. The bombast of the popular version (which I love, don't get me wrong) is absent, leaving the piece to breathe its slightly haunting, folkish air. We are made fans by the finished product, it's true, but we are engendered and befriended when we see the creative process at work. That process is on display here. It is a scoop, without question."},{"rating":"2","title":"tapes almost forgotten","review":"this is a double cd which i bought in vinyl form many years ago. it's the first of three, maybe the best (but the whole series is at least very interesting). it's a collection of tapes that Pete used to conserve in his recording studio. there are many tracks, most of them would become hits or versions by the Who, played by Townshend at synthesizers or acoustic guitar, or both. it's a must for fans of the group, but it could be useful for the others. it's cheap, too. enjoy your listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edition Problem","review":"I bought this box set twice and both times I had to send it back.Two or three cds can only be played in the first tracks and sometimes in the cd player you'll read the message NOT DISC or after cleaning this cds will play and stop,play and stop and you will never listen to the complete songs.I think it is an Edition Problem a big mistake for Global Underground."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Book","review":"Despite the fact that the info page for this book carries the publishing date of 1997, the book was first published in 1965, and it is showing its age. Much of the information is sadly out of date. For example, recent and widely published work on the equine eye has discredited the ramped retina theory. Nonetheless that theory is presented as state of the art information. The information in each chapter is repetitive, poorly organized, frequently uninformative, and to make matters worse, the writing style is dry as dust. I am not suggesting that horsemen from an earlier era have nothing of value to share with us, but this particular book is not worth the time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthwhile","review":"As another reviewer said, stale information. There's been a heck of lot of research into horses since this book was first published fifty years ago that has made this book obsolete.If you're interested in the actual mind of the horse, how they and other animals think and what they think about, Temple Grandin's book Animals in Translation is a fascinating alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a great collection from an artist who left too soon.","review":"Evidently this is a rare album.

Frequent digressions and asides (like this one!) make the text difficult to follow. Key points are skipped over while others that to me seem obvious are covered in excessive detail.Worse, I think, is that the analysis is just not very imaginative or insightful. The technological possibilities are explored adequately, but the political consequences of those possibilites are handled clumsily, if at all.I found this book frustrating.

This 1999 effort has a dozen quality tracks, well-written, well-sung, well-arranged and well-accompanied. No one song broke out as a monster hit, but all are worth hearing more than once.

Sure there are a few kinks, but they can be ironed out as time goes on. Unfortunately, that's not what happens. These kinks grow to be major problems and start to overshadow any good that there is in the writing. The characters start to act less and less like themselves, the dialogue gets worse and worse, and sexula themes are just clumsily thrown on en masse in unnecessary and uncreative ways, in hopes that just their presence will be enough to entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me, I've lost my plot device, could I borrow yours?","review":"If you're an X-Men fan, there are hundreds of other stories that you should read before this one.

Some of the reviews of this comic are better reads than the comic itself. If you want a real story, check out Grant Morrison's New X-Men.

Once again, the heart and soul of the best and truest voice in country music today are shown in the words and music of this CD. Darryl crones slower songs, like \\"Find Me\\", in his mellow, pure baritone, and your pulse rate rises. And you'd have to be unconscious to keep from some clapping and foot stomping with \\"Awful Beautiful Life\\".

A very exciting account of the emotional ride and courageous battle this core of great players endured during their \\"golden age\\" of dominance.Personal accounts by Viv Richards, Joel Garner, Colin Croft etc. make this a most accurate and thrilling journey through an unbelieveably successful period of cricket. Controversy, Kerry Packer, stereotypes, etc. abounded, but nothing deterred from the overcoming victory of this unique group of players.

WW2 Memoirs cover in greater detail the lives of the particpants usually before and during the war but usually stop there or only give a brief postscript. This work is unusual because the author tells you up front the basic story and then unfolds it from there. The knowledge of Norval Carter's fate looms like a shadow over the story but nevertheless his death and his son's (the co-author)discovery of his father still will bring the tears when you get to those pages. This is a story about the meaning of courage, sacrifice and the meaning of being a father and husband. The story covers the events of the war and the buildup for D-day in enough detail that even someone with no knowledge or interest in military history will enjoy and understand this story.

If you want the German Army's self-portrait, look here & in Barnett's \\"Hitler's Generals.\\" Otherwise, read elsewhere.An example from memory: discussing WW1, Cooper trots out as if they were true the platitudes about the army's remaining steadfastly non-political. This works if you forget that Ludendorff was *running the country* in 1917-18, having arrogated dictatorial powers to himself, cowed the Kaiser, run off Bethmann-Hollweg, etc., etc.Needless to say, the \\"non-political\\" bit is nonsense, in WW1, during Weimar, and after Hitler's accession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Student and Radiologic Technologist Atlas","review":"Volume 2 of 3 volumes.

So far I have not been disappointed in this author and I have read many many of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun mystery/romance","review":"I enjoy all of Elizabeth Peter's mystery/romance books, and this one was no exception. Her books are light fun, with no sex/violence to speak of, and I always learn something interesting. In this case, Dr. Peters teaches us a bit about fairy tails. I had most of the mystery figured out by the end, but there were a few twists that surprised me. The heroine was typical of E.P.: smart, independent, more beautiful than she knows, and just rash enough to get herself into trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker than expected","review":"I'm surprised that Mertz published the book under her Elizabeth Peters nom de plum when the style and themes of the book were more in the fashion of the author's Barbara Michaels persona. The book draws heavily on gothic romance influences more than her usual Victorian adventure fluff. Of course under both names she's ultimately writing mysteries and Love Talker doesn't disappoint. There are parts that are too drawn out or too rambling and the characterization isn't as strong as it is in some of her books but it's still a fun and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book by the best mystery author.","review":"I am a huge E.

It is classic Peters, with mystery, humor, culture, and history all wrapped into one entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of her best, but good","review":"After reading \\"The Legend in Green Velvet\\" the day before, I guess I was disappointed with this one. This one has fairies and the old folks at the ancestral abode in the winter time. Pretty conceivable story but I was either not alert or was actually surprised by her villain in the story. She touches on fairies but in her critical---these are not real, but how can I put them in a plausible story kind of fairies, if that makes sense. So, her fairies are people dressed up as fairies to do bad things to good people. Ah, it was okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising, but weak","review":"An older work republished, The Love Talker is a weak romance/mystery that has touches of the wit and humor that mark her better works. I found the plot to be simplistic and predictable, which isn't always a problem if the ride is still fun. However, I couldn't get behind the romance in this, and it seems the author couldn't either, as she only puts it in play in the last 2 pages. So, no real suspense... no real romance... no real read.Peters best work is in her Vicki Bliss and Amelia Peabody mysteries, which I have read and re-read over and over and are worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Good message, good music, well appreciated.

I looked forward to each installment, not just because Lillie Langtry aka the Jersey Lillie was a fascinating character, but because she was surrounded by equally fascinating characters. Whether it was her lover Prince Bertie or her friend Oscar Wilde, the film seemed to capture the essence of the historical figure. The set design and costumes are exquisite. Francesca Annis is lumnious as Lillie from the moment we encounter her as a teen until her death in 1929. I highly recommend this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religious review","review":"This book will prove an invaluable tool in my research on religion and what is wrong with it.

It is a riveting, darkly chilling and beautifully written mystery. Bookshop owner and author Adrien's employee is murdered and Los Angeles detective, sexy Jake Riordan seems to focus on Adrien as a suspect. Adrien begins investigating on his own and the game is afoot! What makes this book a treasure is Adrien English. Adrien is a strong, lovely person whose take on his world of family, employees and Jake is funny and at times, aching painful. He's also got a wonderful, sassy mouth. The shaky relationship between Adrien and closeted Jake is angsty and moving. Josh Lanyon's writing, humor and storytelling are superior. And, Adrien is unforgettable. Just WOW! This book began my forever love affair with Adrien, Jake and Josh Lanyon's writing. This series was voted the All-Time Favorite M/M series for a reason!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great characters --","review":"I own the earlier edition of this and the other Adrien English stories.These are some of my very favorite romance/mysteries. I especially love the way Josh Lanyon writes his characters, in all his books. Sometimes you want to just slap some of the characters upside the head -- as I frequently want to do with Jake in these books -- but his characters are always vivid and engaging.At times the plots of these books are not terribly believable -- but that's certainly not unusual for this subgenre. And all of them definitely *are* very very entertaining. I've read all of the Adrien English books three times now, and I'm sure I'll be reading them yet again before much longer. They are more than worth their purchase price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"The book is a reasonably entertaining quick read, at best.The typos went from mildly annoying to incredibly frustrating as the novel progressed - at two points it seems that sentences, if not paragraphs, have been dropped.It was the ending, however, which earned this book its low rating. The killer's motive is ridiculous. I don't want togive anything away here, but I thought that the ending of this story (which I think is meant to be sexy and romantic) is fairly offensive. I'd like to go into more detail as to why, but won't spoil the ending.Even the most starved gay mystery lover should feel his patience tested by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and satisfying","review":"I really like this book and have been waiting (im)patiently for the next one. Although it is very short, and doesn't have a lot of literary \\"filler\\", I never got lost.

My favourite songs here are \\"Too Loud\\", \\"Little By Little\\", \\"Doo Doo A Do Do\\", \\"Sixes And Sevens\\". \\"Trouble Your Money\\" is a wonderful song too. The only small minus of this record is backing vocals which sometimes don't seem to fit well to some songs. Wonderful guitar and keyboards here as usual. Maybe the following three Plant's records are not so good because of the departure of Robbie Blunt. All in all, great work by the best singer in the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Like Miami Vice meets cool bass lines","review":"I bought this CD for the song \\"Little By Little\\". I love that song. The bass line is one of the best in rock history. It is right up there with the creativity of Geddy Lee's bass lines.The rest of the CD is nothing like it. In fact, it's as if you're listening to a Miami Vice episode soundtrack. It dripping in 1985.I agree that fans either will love or hate this CD. I am undecided. It's one of those CD's that probably has to be listened to at the right place at the right time. To me, driving is always best, but I haven't felt nostalgic enough for the 80's to be so enthusiastic about it.Paul Martinez, the bass player on this album, is the saving grace. How have I not heard of this guy before ? His bass lines are incredibly memorable and thoughtful.

Not that I don't like other Plant solo albums (\\"Pictures\\" and \\"Principle\\" are outstanding) but \\"Shaken\\" is pure Robert Plant (with his original and best band) without any hint of his past or any other influences. Actually, to be fair, the one influence shown here is the times in which it was recorded (dead center of the 80's). That happens to be my favorite period in pop music history (late 70's and 80's) just because it was the last truly original period. Everything since then has been a rehash of other decades. \\"Shaken 'N Stirred\\" is Robert Plant's final, pure, artistic statement. All of his efforts since then (although note-worthy on their own) reeked of capturing past glory or desperately searching for pop hit status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grammy Hammy","review":"Once again, this book was wonderful and very instructional.

Though Tricky is still a force to be reckoned with, each release has felt like a paler imitation of the previous. Morcheeba's latest, though a stretch, seems both enervated and desperate. With no knowledge of Laika, the gentle groove of Good Looking Blues has me cresting along with its soft rhythms and singsong vocals, its freaky mix of drums'n'bass and Arabic melody and Kraftwerk. Couldn't tell you if it's better than the new Morcheeba or not - it might just sound more immediate as it's less familiar - but it will be getting more stereo time based on the incongruity of its rhythms, and its straight up lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!! dont waste money on this....","review":"the only \\"eh well\\" song is the one everyone knows..\\"uneasy\\" the others are really bad!! i tried hard to love the whole albume but useless..as they claim, the laika gang is not producing the space sounds even though their Russian dog was sent to space...they could have learned more from Alpha that used dog barkings in their \\"come from heaven\\"..it is so experimental and scary..i dont even know how this albume was in everbody's favorite list?!...anyway it will just stay in my cd collection and one day in 40 years maybe i will feel listening it again;...(..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's customer service gets a 0 from me.","review":"It will be difficult to review this product because it never arrived and I sent a message to Amazon and received no response.Soon I will contact my Charge card company to have the fees they charged my card reversed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"No, cause it doesnt work good.

Nameless is abducted by an unknown assailant who takes him to a remote mountain cabin in the middle of winter. Nameless is shackled and left to die. I don't think I'm spoiling anything when I say that he does not perish (after all, there are at least 10 more books in the series), but how he gets out and what happens when he does are utterly fascinating. Most of the book takes place in Nameless' head -- his thoughts while imprisoned. We learn so much about his character and past. I can't recommend this book highly enough, though this is really a series that needs to be read in order (don't forget his short story collection, CASE FILE).

The backstories of Mary Quant and Tara Browne may be new to many readers, but the Beatles and fashion info is already out there in a multitude of other books.

(The Smashing Rise and the Giddy Fall of Swinging London) is a tale told with a great deal of affection by its author Shawn Levy. This is a wonderful book for the summer and a nice answer to the Austin Powers movie, as the actual time and place was more giddy than any satire could ever imagine. There was a darkness to this time as well but that is not the story the author wants to focus on as, other than the last few pages, the book is about the first half of the sub-title, and is it a smashing story indeed. Some of the stories (read: gossip) will be familiar but the author spins them out with delicious care. This book was successful in making me envious of those who were there but also effective in making me happy that I did ultimately get to spend a little time there through this book.

It came with a lot of defects, first of all the second time I used the laser the front part just got out and couldn\`t put it back because it wouldn't stay where is supposed to again. I fixed that with glue, but after using it a few times, the laser was each time bigger but less brighter, awful product and extremely expensive by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lazer Tool of Excellence","review":"Excellent piece of equipment.

However, when put to use in the lecture hall, the beam comes on bright, and quickly fades to barely visible.Since I was satisfied with the initial performance, the box was trashed and I fee I am unable to return the unit.

You can see the actual laser beam as it cuts through a dimly lit room. It's cool for getting kittens to chase the light from blocks away. Seriously though, the biggest and often embarrasing problem with this pointer is the need to frequently change the batteries. It eats through them. If you go a couple days or so, especially if you have it in your pocket or another tight space where it may inadvertently be activated, it begins to work intermittently. It becomes unreliable, but changing the battery does not come to your mind as it still works occasionally. It's green color can also be effective where a presenter and a commentator can have seperate colored lasers. Overall, if you present frequently, and replace the batteries at least weekly, it will add a bold impact to your presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks the life out of batteries very quickly","review":"Bought this at the end of September & have replaced batteries twice.

This is definitely not the Rentals...","review":"I'm not sure what happened to the Rentals I remember. Perhaps the lovable, geeky group was kidnapped and replaced by some sort of Stepford-wife android band. Maybe the REAL Rentals have retired from the music industry and are living on a private island or something, and this is a group of clones, which, not unlike that Bizarro guy from Superman, are beginning to deteriorate into clumsy, pitiful, confused creatures. Anyway, I'm pretty sure that isn't Matt Sharp's voice. I don't remember it sounding all affected and raspy and, as some other reviewers have noted, \\"british\\". Not that I have a problem with British people! Don't get me wrong! The point is, PLEASE bring back the Rentals (the REAL ones), because frankly, I am not buying this. (Unfortunately, I did buy it -the album, I mean - but I only listened to it once, and that was about a year ago. I still haven't gotten over the trauma.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened?","review":"I'm a big weezer fan and I really loved return of the rentals. My friends and I had been waiting and waiting for this CD to come out. We special ordered our copies, and when they finally came we tore into them with frenzied excitement. But what we heard was nothing like what we wanted to hear. I know that bands change.. but what was Matt thinking? I keep reading all of this stuff about how he recorded on a tiny little tape recorder and all this crap about how relaxed it was over in europe making the CD but it sounds like things were too relaxed. Matt's vocals are ass on a stick. Petra and the distant sounds of Moog are the only things keeping me from throwing this CD away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Matt Sharp, but this is not the Rentals...","review":"Matt should've given a new name to this piece of plastic, instead of punishing long-suffering Rentals fans with this overlong GLAM-ROCK album.

Over and over again it keeps happening throughout the world. A band puts out a GREAT first album, I mean completely genius. The second album is awful. This is a classic example. Return of the Rentals was a gift from god, but this... this is just new school punk [junk]. Some of the songs aren't that bad, but none of them pass the level of mediocrity. I don't know why he decided to sing like the typical skaterpunk poprock, but uggh. I used to think that Matt was a genius and that his leaving Weezer is what caused them to fall so far, but now I realize that 94-97 was just a really groovey time that will never be repeated.

This is an utter disappointment. Matt Sharp has always been a self centered rockstar (did you see him mugging on Weezer's Pinkerton tour?) and now he steps into the boots fully by calling all his britpop buddies to come and make this just a grand old party. Don't get me wrong here, I like Elastica and I like Blur, but Big Daddy C? What the hell? Just one of the ridiculous moments on this album. The Rivers Cuomo-penned track is sadly lacking, as well. It's not that artists aren't allowed to make an album different from the previous one. It's quite a generalization to say that that's what critics of \\"7 More Minutes\\" mean. Matt can make any kind of album he wants. He chose to make a bad one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not perfect","review":"The whole CD is quite good but there are not many songs that are catchy. The best songs are \\"Hello, Hello\\" wich is in a typical Weezer-style and -rythm, \\"Keep Sleeping\\" (GREAT SONG, fast, it's real britpop as it should be, i can't understand why they haven't made more songs like that) and the slow \\"Man with two brains\\" wich you can't get out of your head because of it's perfect rythm.

I found myself drawn into Judith's world and kept forgetting that this was not actually her long-lost journal but rather a tale written by a modern-day author. Amazing! Ms. Tiffany's choice of language was very authentic and the story was most compelling. There were enough plot twists to keep the story intriguing and keep me turning the pages late at night. I was rooting for Judith during her many escapades, and while everything did not turn out as I thought it might, I found the ending to be thoroughly satisfying. This book has renewed my interest in Shakespeare's work and I look forward to reading Ms. Tiffany's future work as well.

I ended up devouring this book cover to cover so quickly that I had to go back for more books. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the writing style and loved the story. I quickly grew fond of Judith and became very invested in how things would turn out for her. It isn't often that I am easily swayed into putting aside the actual life of a real person used in historical fiction. However, we know precious little about the real Judith, and I highly doubt her real story could be more compelling than what Ms. Tiffany has written.

However, some fans have complaints about his latest CD \\"Love Songs and Lullabies\\". One issue is the 38 minute CD length. I enjoy an artist who can make concise musical statements without feeling the need to fill out an entire 80 minute CD.Interestingly enough, the fact this CD has been released less than a year after \\"Simple Things\\", has also caused criticism. I much prefer a hard working artist who is building a strong catalog of work to some who are only motivated to release new material every five to ten years.I'm afraid some people assume this is simply the soundtrack to his current PBS special. These are actually studio recordings and are comparable to any of his prior releases. The album cuts are varied yet consistent, a mix of instrumental and vocals.

I normally might find an inside account of the professional sex industry fascinating for instance, but as it is described in Porn Valley Story, I just was glad when it was over. While there were interesting statements about sexual inclinations and preferences of many characters in the book, the writers never moved me to care about them as people.A previous reviewer likened this collection to typical New Yorker stories.

Some people might like the \\"raw\\" production but I can hear the performance errors. Glimpses of his trademark lyric approach can be found here which offers some entertainment but I'm giving it 2 stars because its that far away from Mellow Gold, Odelay and Mutations (which all deserve 4-5 stars). It feels like Beck wasn't really trying on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment compared to his later work","review":"I remember hearing Looser Baby and Where it's At for the first time and loving them. I even listened to Odelay and enjoyed the album. This cd just doesn't seem like Beck. It's more country sounding than alternative. Maybe the later stuff just isn't Beck.

I think that this is the record that most defines his music, stripped of the public image (well, created before there was a public image) that has caused a lot of people to undervalue the real weight of Beck's music. There's a slowness and sparsness to it that can be very affecting and he's able to convey a ton more emotion and atmosphere in this type of music than most....I've always found a lot of modern lo-fi disingenuous....a little too cool for its own good. But I never get that feeling with this album. This is campfire music....put it on your headphones at work and feel the stress melt away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The young acoustic Beck","review":"One Foot In The Grave is a taste of what Beck & friends played in the early days before Mellow Gold & Odelay although \\"Ramshackle\\" from Odelay could have easily been on One Foot In The Grave. All of the songs arem played with more or less simple instruments, and the lyrics are poetic, intangled and sometimes down right weird. There is also a great change of mood throughout the cd. The song \\"Burnt Orange Peel\\" and \\"Ziplock Bag\\" are examples of boyish fun and chaos, while \\"See Water\\" is most depressing and slow. But Beck also uses music types such as Delta Blues, Appalachian Folk and other old traditionel American music styles and he mixes them with new and fresh lyrics. This cd might not be totally proffesionel and up to trot (in \\"Outcome\\" you can hear someone coughning in the background) but it's totally original and enjoyable, it's a cd one can always come back to and listen again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"git git git git on up with that lo fi sound... awww right!","review":"ya know he's a mighty good leader and this disc proves it right, we go down to the sleeping bags startin' a fire and man that sure ignites, the flame in yr mind, soakin up a real good time and when yr [bottom] is cold just shake it to the sounds of the burnt orange peel, rockin with a fuzz box! ya can't beat beck at his own game, cuz man he's on tha move, but if show up soon, ya sure can groove to the spirit that moves him all the way through hollow log, throwin a line in at the 14 rivers of soul brotha!

It is however a great history of the cold war told from the perspective of a spymaster. He slips in some lingo like \\"dead letter box\\", but does not really get into the nitty gritty.

Details on how intelligence is collected and processed, and how it contributes to the formation of national policy, makes for a thorough and fine review of the craft and policies of military intelligence efforts, surveying how information is gathered, processed, and used in the formation of national policy. While others could've presented the facts, it's his insider position peppered with personal anecdotes from his intelligence career - he was a high-ranking officer of the CIA's predecessor and served eight years when the CIA was created - which makes CRAFT OF INTELLIGENCE unique.Diane C.

This expanded edition has two added songs originally not included that make it well worth the purchase and the remastering job is very noticeable without having to own a thousand dollar stereo system.There is not an expanded booklet,but better looking artwork then the original release.Thank you Yes and Friday music for making this available and also for still making CD's available to us people who still appreciate a real physical product and not subjecting us to mandatory downloads to get great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"9012 Live","review":"I'm glad they came out with the extended version of this.

Either that, or I would have been a lot more excited if the \\"Whitefish\\" solo, which takes place in the middle of \\"Long Distance Runaround\\"(I know this because I have an excellent...import...of an '84 show), had the full piece restored. Also, the \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" from this tour was a truly exciting version. Now I know, these aren't Trevor Rabin songs, and they're trying to stay true to the lineup...But any time a new member joins a band(vocalist not withstanding...)it's usually interesting to hear how they interpret the parts, and Rabin did a brilliant job making the Steve Howe parts his own.

This book clarified seveal of the lessons I have been taught over the years and opened my eyes to why I cannot swing the club like my lower body swinger friends.

I would have written it differently.\\" \\"Oh, how so?\\" Rumi asked. \\"I would have written: I came from eternity, clothed myself with skin and bones and called myself 'Yunus'.\\" What I love about these priceless treasures is that you get more and more from them each time you read them so the power and delight are literally endless - my ideal type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"His music has been overlooked for too long!\\"","review":"RCA Victor presents Keith Jarrett's music, very much like the American standards to which he has devoted his jazz performing in the last two decades, is hummable, witty, rhythmically infectious and structurally solid.

Jarrett has reached such fame by mastering the different genres of jazz and classical music, and his uncategorizable improvisations, is nothing short of astounding.This entire CD is simply awesome, with today's artists giving their all to this musical tribute - \\"The Music of Keith Jarrett\\", one of the best jazz albums to come out with original music that has been overlooked for too long!Total Time: 58:52 on 13 Tracks/ RCA Victor - 09026 63607 2 (2000)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received the item!","review":"I purchased this item and had a confirmation email, and I even called the store to inquire about the item.

I've owned the GTS 5, 6, and now 7 series ever since a local botique running store recommended them for me. The reason they were recommended is because I'm 6'6'' tall (a little over 2 meters) and weigh 230lbs, so whatever pair I get has to have tons of cushioning. Before I moved to these, I would get knee and back pain if I went over 5 miles since I run predominantly on black top. Now, almost nothing, except when they start to wear out after a year, which is a good signal that the cushioning is gone and it's time to get a new pair!Once you buy one, you'll be coming back to this model over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent All Rounder","review":"Extremely impressed with the all round characteristics of this shoe.

This CD shows how Norman DJ's (not the best mix he's done, but definately easy to listen to) and is more of a collection of upbeat songs. I was surprised to find myself putting this CD back in my player again and again to hear it again. If you like trance, the second CD is great too.

Both Fatboy Slim's gritty mix and the smoother sounds of Paul Oakenfold are very good in their own way, although not spectacular. I'm partial to \\"Necessary Evil\\", \\"Return Of The Original Art Form\\", \\"The Private Psychedelic Reel\\", and \\"At The River\\" on Fatboy's disc. On Oakenfold's disc, \\"Precession\\", \\"Free\\", \\"Another Day\\", and \\"Seven Cities\\" were the high points for me. And although neither of these are the best representation of the DJ's style, they're still worth a look. If you're a fan of either DJ or you like both, as I did, this is a good disc for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatboy Slim sucks","review":"He has no talent. To put him on a CD with a DJ as talented as Paul Oakenfold is ridiculous. Just compare the credentials of Paul Oakenfold to Fatboy Slim, and you'll see for yourself.

I have 2 of these hooked up to a SWANN PC DVR for Net to provide security to my driveways, and they work great day or night. It surprised me when I got such great night vision footage from the very dim-looking red LED's in the Bulldog. The only downside I see to these cameras, is that you have to really crank the tensioner down tight to keep the camera from wobbling when brushed by wind.

I wish they'd release the whole series in a set like they did on VHS and then I'd pay for the slightly-reduced cost. Well, maybe that's silly. If that doesn't bother you then get Escaflowne. It pulls the whole mechanoid-fighting genre into a wonderfully engaging storyline.And please, watch it in Japanese with the English subs on!

The viewer has the choice of hearing the dialogue in original Japanese with English subtitles or in dubbed English. The animation is quite breathtaking and the background art is worthy of the best of Disney, putting the story and characters of Escaflowne in a large, three-dimensional world of wonderful detail and beauty.

It successfully combines fantasy, mecha, romance, and esper themes into what is a nearly flawless story. Excellent music (worth buying all the soundtracks for), combined with a cast of unforgettable characters (including Folken, the greatest character ever) makes this anime better than just about anything else out there. It does contain quite a lot of violence (but with mecha and fantasy genre anime, it's to be expected), but there is nothing in it that I would object to older children or younger teenagers watching.

With the top elastic band wrapped tightly, the edges of the support do chafe the back of the hand/wrist a little bit. Loosening the elastic band helps but lessens the support factor slightly. Minor inconveniences tho.I do recommend this particular type of support, and if you have repetitive stress syndrome or weakness in you wrist from overuse, it allows you to still work, and even write, easily, where other types of supports do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good presentation but dated","review":"The book (3rd Edition) has an orderly presentation that builds confidence but there are scattered elements that are factually wrong and thus tear it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"hollow tip is tight","review":"Man if you like west coast rap or any rap for that matter pick this cd up because it's one of the best cd's out there.

The jiggly-cam effect is way over the top here. And it zooms in and out, then side to side...like some backyard birthday party using an 8mm camera from the 60's, shot by an excited parent. I couldn't finish watching for the headache that was induced. Sad, too, because I really like the Bourne franchise and was enjoying Matt Damon in the part, outsmarting and out-toughing all those other agents. It looked to me as if the director is trying to gimmick-up a bad film. Clearly Matt Damon can carry any film: from quiet and still to action-packed. But leave it to some Hollywood no-talent to screw it up. Should have been great, but instead delivers a sad, sad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"caution, may cause epilepsy","review":"The cinematography in this film is laughable. It is filmed in such a manner that you are made to believe you are in the action...not a bad concept, however the execution here is awful. the screen is so violently unstable, it is near unwatchable. I actually did get a laugh noticing that in a situation where you would expect screen movement, there is none and vice versa. In an intimate moment between the two leads, the scene is shot from several angles including the closet, hall ect. The camera is shaking as if a child who ate too much sugar is holding a handheld, hiding in the closet. Conversely, a scene shot through a snipers scope (where you might expect a little screen movement) is so steady I did chuckle. The movie gets one star from me for some good fight sequences. My advice, spend your money elsewhere, or rent it if you loved the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driving backwards off a parking garage, crashing and walking away?

But when we get up to to the sequences of \\"jumping off a roof through windows and landing perfectly\\" then the serious doubts start to manifest.Great, breath-taking action and jerky cinematography (but would it have killed them to mount the camera, just once, for just one still scene?)The big payoff at the end was sortof a dud. I won't give spoilers here but... that's it? That was the big three-years-of-running, three-film secret?I dunno. Not much of a payoff. Now Bourne vs. 6-7 super-soldier guys in hand-to-hand.... that would have been cooler.Thumbs down if you need to, but I bet you thought the same thing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne 3 'Combo' Blu-ray another winner!","review":"I was a little hesitant before I made my purchase, but I needn't have been. This Blu-ray/DVD Combo disc works perfectly fine on my SONY BDP-S550. Picture quality is great, as is the audio. I wont go into the details of the disc contents, since others already have done so, but this Combo release from Universal comes highly recommended from me. Complete the trilogy with this essential purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed the first two Bourne films. A violent, intelligent, multi-talented character who doesn't remember his past or who he is, Bourne provided irresistable, intriguing escapism. I found it easy to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. This third effort, however, insults the viewer's intelligence on too many levels. The plot is nonsensical and full of holes and the camera work is irritating. Unlike the first two films I didn't engage with this at all. At the end my reaction was an underwhelming - so what? The makers have gone for an easy option, formulaic hotch potch - a \\"this will do, it's only an action movie\\" product lacking in character, motivation or even thought. This could have been a great series. A series it will still probably be, but any pretence at quality has gone with this poor effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godd film - BAD DVD MARKETING","review":"First things first. This DVD starts with adverts that you can't jump through or fast forward. To me that is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.Other than that it's a very good movie, Bourne has returned to being a secret agent who really knows what he's doing. The previous experiment in the troubled uncertain Bourne was a total mistake.Gone also is the filmed-on-a-cell-phone 'action' style of the second film.That's all I wanted to say, if you are in to action movies you should buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for HD","review":"Watched it on kindle fire hd.Mulitple fast scenes were blurred and wavy.Other scenes appeared faded and grainy.I assume it was the DVD and not a problem with the Kindle Fire HD...who knows.Sorry..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie to Watch on a Plane","review":"Is this fine art?

Finally a smart action film in a summer of mindless destruction. Don't get me wrong, I liked Transformers and Pirates 3, but this was a nice change. Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, period. The shaky camera while present isn't as big of a problem this time around. I also like how the Bourne films use very little CGI.A little warning though. More than half the film is a prequel to the end of The Bourne Supremacy (the call between Pamela and Bourne). The start of the movie takes place after the car chase in the last movie and continues until Bourne call Pamela Landy and says, \\"you look tired, get some sleep.\\" It's kind of neat how they tied it all in."},{"rating":"2","title":"exclenete","review":"rapido y seguro el servicio me gusto el producto porque era justo lo que vi es justo lo que me llego"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been OK if not for 2 major flaws","review":"Not a bad thriller, but this film has two major problems:First, it is filmed with a \\"modern\\" shaky effect that gets tiring after a while.Second, there is (to my taste) a major scenario bug: without giving up the end, there is a moment when Bourne is on the phone with his worst CIA ennemy after Bourne managed to lure that guy and his minions out of their building on a false pretext. At that point, the super pro and efficient Bourne decides to tell his ennemy where he is, launching a 10 minutes chase episode. Why on earth would Bourne feel he has to give up his location ? There is \\"some\\" credibility (that is to say, if you agree to go along with the genre) in the rest of the movie, this kills it."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing action/fight scenes","review":"truly enjoyable movie, fight scenes much better choreographed than the first Bourne movie.

The acting and writing are concise and right on.

You really understand Bourne's identity and background in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"ULTIMATE MOVIE","review":"Matt Damon is fantastic in these Bourne movies, he has that All-American look, but with that loner edge that makes Jason Bourne believeable. This most recent installment of the Bourne series is as good as the the first Bourne movie, frankly I felt the second, though good, didnt have the story of the Identity or the Ultimatum. These movies are so fast paced, the action permiates the movie and propels it at break neck speed. I could give you a synopsis of the movie, but if you've seen it you know what it's about and if you havent I dont want to give anything away, suffive to say, if you like a movie with thrills and with all the qualities that make a truely great action film, then there is NOWAY you're not going to think this movie rocks. Highly recommended, arguably the best of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Bournes","review":"\\"Ultimatum\\" is mostly a nonstop, slam-bang action movie with some eye-popping chases and a well-staged fight scene. This is both its strength and its weakness - it is fun to watch, but ultimately no more believable than a Wile E. Coyote cartoon. If you've seen the first two installments in the series, this final entry is well worth your while, and you might enjoy it even if you haven't seen the prior segments."},{"rating":"2","title":"back on track","review":"After the pedestrian 2nd flick in the Bourne series, it was great to see the 3rd (Ultimatum) hitting almost all the right notes. The last 20 minutes drags and the flashback scenes get tiresome which is all that prevents this from a 5-star rating in my books.This movie also shows the benefit of getting actors who can actually act in all the secondary roles.On a side note, where do these people get the energy when they never eat or drink anything in the entire movie? I'm just saying.The extras on the DVD are first-rate including showing how they shot the chase and fight scenes as well as giving us a world tour of all the location shoots. Obligatory director's commentary track and deleted scenes included, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid and equally great #3","review":"I have loved each of the Bourne movies. And #3 was just as wonderful as the first 2-which is saying a lot-as this is something that seems to be very difficult and rare to do with movie trilogies (for example: Spiderman, Rush Hour, etc). I am looking forward to adding this 3rd movie to my Bourne collection and will be able to watch all 3 with the same satisfaction and delight.I am sorry to see the trilogy end, but happier to see it end incredibly well. Matt Damon has excelled in these movies and each one is a treat. I will miss new 'Bourne' movie releases, but will be able to enjoy each one at home.A 'must have' movie for Bourne fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Ultimatum!!!","review":"From the East to the West to everplace in between, Jason Bourne leaves no stone unturned in his search for his past. He has new adversaries - ruthless government officials that have used America's war against terrorism as an excuse to revive Treadstone and kill anyone they consider a threat. The action is non-stop, the suspense intense. A satisfactory conclusion to a satisfactory series.JASON BOURNE RULES!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging","review":"The movie is great. The disc, however, is poor. The case is one of the worst I've come across with the locks and the center retention being far too tight. The disc is plain with little to no graphics. It's like they gave up on the normal DVD packaging because they released a high-def version. The extras were okay.Movie = great, everything else = mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get ripped off..!","review":"The movie itself is a good conclusion to the trilogy, but do not download it from Amazon Unbox. Drive to the video store, walk if you have to, but don't try to watch this heavily compressed version of it. As the other reviewer said (and I wish I had trusted them) the high speed motion which is an essential part of this action movie is made unwatchable by the video compression artifacts. It's not even like other high speed mpeg artifacts I've seen such as those on digital cable where everything goes blocky - this is like true ghosting like early LCDs. I tried to watch this on a 43in plasma TV and it was awful. Every time something moved quickly there were two or three overlapping versions of it.Take the advice of these reviews - don't buy or rent this movie as a digital download.

However, the movie is completely ruined for me because it contains big illogical holes. For example, when Bourne and Nicky tried to evade the assasins, Bourne never wore disguises. The movie showed cameras in the malls, and in the streets recording movements of everybody. Nicky had to dye her hair to look different. Yet Bourne did nothing. He did not even wore sunglasses! And the CIA could not catch him!In another scene, the local CIA chief, tried to save his life by making a run for another country after being found out he had leaked top secret information. While doing this, he's using the passport with his real name!Yeah right! Please be reminded that he's a CIA local chief.This kind of movie is good because it's thrilling and it's brainy.

Very bad choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, poor camera work","review":"The third installment in this trilogy had a good plot, although a bit disappointing to me at the end.After watching this movie I had a headache from watching the hand held camera bounce around in all of the action scenes throughout the movie. It was very irritating trying to follow the action when the camera was constantly bouncing around. I would have rather had them spend the extra cash that is required to film scenes using cameras on tracks, etc. which would have given the movie more clarity, especially in the fight scenes which Matt Damon handles so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"An So SO movie at best..","review":"In the movie during a fight scene, the technique of the \\"tumbling/jerky camera\\" is used - made me a tad motion sick. A great movie - no.. A good movie - no.. A so so movie - okay. For people who like implausible movies, they will love this movie. After awhile, the negativity becomes really annoying. A so so movie overall in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott combos - stop already!!!!","review":"The single star is not a review of the movie, which is great, but to agree with the other reviewers who objected to the Combo releases. The first two Bourne movies are not Combos so why would I want a Combo to round out the collection. I refuse to buy any Combo releases for the higher $$$ and urge other buyers to do as well. We need to send a message. The argument made for Combos is that it protects us in case the HD DVD format is obsoleted. Franky, I'll take my chances because if that happens I can buy the new technology with the money I save not buying Combos (I wouldn't take a step backward to DVD anyway). If the studios think there is a market for Combos - fine! -> just release an HD DVD only version also, at the same time. See how many they sell. Frankly, I only moved up to HD DVD when I saw Amazon pricing them comparable to DVD. If they want the launch of HD DVD to be successful, this is very counterproductive.

They kept the inane car chases to a minimum, had a good motorcycle chase and a too-long roof-top parcourse chase....but otherwise it was all intelligible and cohesive action. And just the right length. The interaction with the CIA's Nikki in the first installment led me to suspect that romance between her and Bourne was in the works. Well, this \\"final\\" episode convinces me of that. And Bourne's ending also suggests fourth installment.

If you haven't seen the first two, they aren't necessary, but I would highly recommend them. In this episode, Bourne is more reflective as he tries to piece together his past. The reflection does not last long before chase scenes and fighting sets in. The story is good, as are the action sequences. I enjoyed it thoroughly.While the action genre is not my favorite, I do enjoy an occasional action show. And since my brother had a new surround sound stereo to go with his new big screen, it was an ideal time to enjoy.

Amazing how everyone in this movie is almost clairvoyant and knows everything everyone else is doing and where they are on the world map. It's as though everyone has the omniscient power of God. Further, as in a lot of these phoney action movies, a lot of people (mainly Matt Damon) apparently have the stamina of Olympic long-distance runners, since they run, jump, dive, etc. for lengthy periods of time without getting much winded.

While I really liked the first one, the new director and editor have screwed this into a cocked hat. I began counting the edits in the film about 15 minutes in. I gave up during one of the many fight scenes when I finally couldn't keep count. In a slow scene you might actually get one that's 7 seconds long! In the fight scenes the edits come so fast and furious - they're in half seconds or 12 frames. The longest I was able to count was about 2 seconds long, and that was an exception.So, the fights make no sense. We just see bodies in motion. If you turn down the volume, its ludicrous at best.

There's lots of action, but I don't believe the women will get turned off by it, and all the fights are totally believable because they are so well choreographed, and becuse Matt Damon is clearly in middle of them all. He creates a charater that is James Bond en extremis wothout going over the top with all that which wine with fish stuff, and which card goes where in Banco.

Matt Damon as Bourne and Daniel Craig as Bond are truly iconic action heroes for the new millenium.One can only hope that there will be at least one more film upcoming, to seal the deal on Jason's search for himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much camera movement","review":"It took me almost the entire movie to try to ignore the style of camera shots on this movie, and not even then I got accustomed to the filming style.It remind me of typical first-time amateur home video movies where the camera never stays still.I understand that sometimes the camera needs to move fast to follow the action, but even then it should be done following a movement path with a panning that is not shaky and well calculated to stop accurately when it finds the target sitting still, without continuing the camera movement and then returning.Almost all the camera takes of still people and objects, were done with the camera moving up/down and left right in a constant motion, which was distracting and unnecessary because there is no need to fake action on a scene that is suppossed to be still. Any action movie needs those kind of pause breaks, this was a non-stop style of camera work.I liked the movie, I feel sorry for the poor camera choice by the director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne","review":"great story, great acting, and great suspensebest of the Bourne trilogy; Matt Damon in one of his best roles"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate Amazon","review":"I love The Bourne Sieries.....Rate them a 5 Buy the DVD Do not watch it via Amazon.Video on Amazon stops and starts unexpectedly.

I may have used to copy 250 pages or negatives in this period of time. I contacted the service department for Microtek who send you to an online repair service that will give you an email response in 48 hours. Turns out that the unit that I paid over $500 for is out of warranty and there is NO repair service for Microtek in the United States! The only thing I can do with the unit is junk it. Amazing waste of good money to make 250 copies. They do offer you a telephone number to call to get a \\"discount\\" on another i900 or upgrade to another Microtek unit. Why would I bother with no repair service available. I understand that when your unit breaks, they will give you a refurbished replacement. No Thanks!!!

Along the way, Microtek customer \\"service\\" was anything but helpful.

The scanning is good but it keeps loosing the connection to the scanner. No help to be had from Mikrotek. I had to repeatedly reconnect the cables and when I am in luck it decides it is connected. But a lot of the time it decides it is not connected. After two years I upgraded to Mac OS 10.8 and Microtek has discontinued drivers and won't support OS 10.7 or 10.8 so it won't work. So I have to thrash a perfectly usable 600 scanner because the manufacturer refuses to support their own product! Not very green. I shall not buy Microtek in the future because you can't trust they will update their drives for new operating systems.

Its specifications were superior to others then on the market (the Epson 4990 had not yet been introduced when I bought). Unfortunately, the solenoid that reverses the mirror on the scanning light broke (after warranty, of course) and THERE IS NO SERVICE IN THE U.S.!!! While I might be able to use the scanner for negatives and chromes, everytime I scan there are three colored lines going in the direction of the scan that must be removed by Photoshop, a painstaking, mind-numbing process. There is simply nothing to reocmmend this scanner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good scanner for negatives and photographs","review":"I purchased this scanner so that I could scan old black & white and color negatives, and old black & white and color photographs. The results were great. The software that comes with it is easy to use and the Digital ICE works great if you want to restore your old photographs. Scanning 35mm slides was more of a challenge so I ended up using my Nikon Coolscan IV ED for those instead. Most of the scanners that I looked at before I purchased this one, limited the size of the negatives that you could scan, this one will scan an 8 x 10 negative if there is such a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac Users Beware!","review":"If you're a Mac user, don't buy this scanner if you want to be able to upgrade, or if you're already running Lion. Microtek has discontinued drivers and won't support Lion, so it won't work. In fact, if I were you I'd avoid them entirely. The scanner has been fine for me, which makes it all the more frustrating that I'll have to get rid of it simply because the manufacturer refuses to support their own product. They deserve to go out of business.

My baby loves other DVDs, like Juana la Iguana and Baby Neptune, but this one doesn't hold her attention for more than a minute.

Once in a blue moon a voice would say a color in spanish -- but the word was only said once and had nothing visual to back it up.The description says it teaches Latin culture and values... HOW?

It covers only colors and shapes. It might be good with a Spanish-speaking adult to guide the child, but It really doesn't do much to teach Spanish.

I, previously, used this book in a day care setting with remarkable results. I was able to purchase it then retail for $10.00. It is now unavailable as it is out of print.

I love any book that enables me to teach my child anything about safety. This book allows my daughter to see the keypad and dial the numbers just like on a real phone. It has a very simple \\"story\\" and is easy for her to understand. My ONLY complaint is that it's not as real-life as I would like it to be. On a REAL 911 call, the operator generally answers and says \\"911-What is your emergency\\" or something to that effect. It seems silly to me that the sound effects in this book say \\"911-Let's go!!!\\" and then blares sirens and fire truck horns. I just think that it should be closer to a real life situation since 911 is a serious phone call.

Thankfully he was quite understanding, but I'm still not sure if this book covered the importance of only calling 911 when necessary.

This book has just the right attitude to help you show your pre-schoolers when to dial 911. It has become a favorite that is always laying around in view. They love being able to actually dial 911 on the 'phone' keypad. They only get the sirens if they dial correctly, so they learn to do that rather quickly.

The convention featured close to 50 bands, all of which were releasing music outside of the traditional Big Six (which is now down to the Big Four) label system at the time, though several of the bands and muscians involved went on to sign with majors. The convention is often cited as a high-water mark of the early '90's indie scene that would go on to claim its place in pop music history as the \\"alternative\\" movement.Anyone looking for a summary of the roots of that movement should look no further than this disc. Fugazi's rendition of 'Reprovisional' stands out, though the Fastbacks and Beat Happening tracks are also outstanding. The disc also captures the live feel of the event, with a correspondingly disjointed track list and low-fi production. Good, dirty fun for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used as a camera for second childs room","review":"We purchased a cheaper camera on ebay, however it did not work right, it was all static. We purchased this one before our second child was born. We had been using our previous set for 2 years befor adding this camera to it. I think this looks better than our first one. The picture is clearer, and colors are more vibrant.Anyone thinking of this versus the new small sleek looking ones, go with this one. Ours has been quite abused, but still works perfect. Also for the handheld, get the 2.5\\" screen, the smaller one is just too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on a second camera!!","review":"A second camera does not work the way you will want it to work. The two cameras cause interference with each other as you switch back and forth between the two cameras. The picture has wavy lines, and the sound is choppy. I wrote Summer Infant about my problem, and they do not want to do anything about it. They said that the cameras operate on a 900Mhz frequency, and could cause interference with each other. So I am thinking to myself: Then why do they offer a seperate camera so you can monitor two seperate channels? Easy, it's to sucker you into buying another one only to find out it won't work!! Another fine example of little ol' working class man versus big greedy rich corporate america. Also, it took 3 pestering e-mails to finally get an answer out of Summer Infant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good 2nd camera","review":"We bought this a second camera for the handheld monitor + camera. It initially worked but for some reason after a couple of days there was no video, only audio, from this source. No amount of configuring with the two cameras would make this unit work. The company, Healthcheck, gave us grief to no end about returning/exchanging. Not until we gave them a bad review on Amazon.com did they relent. You shouldn't have to go through so much fighting to force customer service!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, awful!","review":"This is a piece of crap. That is the best I can say. Half the time the monitor didn't work or the video was bad. Our handheld couldn't pick up a clear video when we were standing next to the camera.

We enjoyed their Christmas concert a year ago. This one is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS ALBUM!","review":"If you have the first two TSO christmas albums...be prepared! This is nothing like them! Beethoven's Last Night draws a lot more from the Broadway style musical...and does it very well. There are moments from the songs that you will carry with you for a long time. This time out, there are actually characters who have been designated voices and I think makes a better album as a whole (in comparison to the Christmas albums where there was just a bunch of vocalists) Paul O'Neill is one of the most underrated song writers out there today. He can certainly rank up there with the best of Broadway AND those in metal. This album is trully amazing. The story is fantastic and the songs unbelievable. As an added bonus....Jon Oliva plays the part of Mephistopheles (the Devil) which in itself is enough to buy this CD. Play it loud witht he lights off:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic TSO, but a little darker and edgier, perfectly blended with classical Beethoven","review":"I really liked this album. I'm a pretty big fan of TSO, having seen them them for the first time on PBS during a pledge drive. I loved the darker tone of the vocals and the lyrics.

Very refreshing, and highly recommended for anyone who bought their Christmas cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"I recently saw TSO in concern in Rochester NY near Christmas and was floored with the production. I had seen the lit-up house to their Wizards in Winter song on the \\"Last Christmas Eve\\" album. So I was only to happy to explore more. I bought that album right away and played it constantly. Loved it.Not having the fill of their music, and thinking it was time to move on from a Christmas theme (It was February)I ventured into this album and fell in love with this one as well.If you like theatrical type music the like of Meatloaf, but with more musical oomph, you will love their stuff. There is a story and magnificent voices. The voice of \\"Beethoven\\" on this album is fantastic. Wow.Songs 6, 12 and 15 rank as my favorites.I hope to buy more of their stuff.The creator of TSO, I understand was the creator of \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" of 70s fame, an album I was addicted to (and I am not religious at all).

It's just not at all what I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate opera","review":"The group fooled me \\"Orchestra\\" meant music but this group insists on having someone sing on each track.

Yes, it's very much Meat Loaf, a tad cheese, but - hey - that's prog rock, no? The only thing topping this album is seeing the band playing it live, which I just did. 22 people on stage, a light show that puts any 70s prog rock life show to blame, and hearing all effects played out (including the children's choir, done by 4 beautiful female singers) is a great experience.

I have both Christmas CDs, and have been waiting well over a year to get this new one. I think it's fantastic. I agree that it has a very Broadway sound to it; since I love musicals, that's a good thing. I don't know of too many other groups that are creating music with this particular sound. I find it beautiful and moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Musicianship, Missed Opportunity","review":"CD reminds me of some of the Alan Parsons Project efforts. The music is great on this, but I have to say some of the vocals were, for me, unlistenable. Zak Stevens and the girls (including Patti Russo, of Meat Loaf's band) were excellent. But Ashworth? Not his style. Sounds like a credible/good metal singer, but totally unsuited for this. The songs he sings lead on ruined the CD for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance found lacking","review":"While the musical compostion of the piece is superb and the instrumentals fall just short of excellent, the vocal performances on the score are sorely lacking in musicality. Most of the the songs seem to fall more in the catagory of speak-singing then actual song, the music of the lyrical parts apparently sacrificed for the sake of clarity of the word and meter. Sadly, it detracts from the piece as the lyrics tend to be rather humdrum. A disappointment, especially for a fan of both Beethoven and classical-rock fusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music","review":"I saw this live in concert and had to get the music.

Not all Jason's lack taste in music.This CD is the most amazing thing I have ever heard. I have been listening to it over and over and over since I received it and am simply amazed. It is good to see Oliva vocalizing on a couple tracks, and the other performers are all top-notch. I don't know how they could be characterized as no better than community theater because they are drawn from the ranks of Broadway's elite.Raw power. Pure emotion. Musical wizardry. Intense character. These are all present here. Not a single note is wrong, nor a single word misplaced.

In fact, I'd put it on my top 5 Earring albums list. Anybody who likes 80's music will find something to like here. The ballad \\"Quiet Eyes\\" is the highlight of the album, and one of the band's better known songs. \\"Have A Heart\\" is definetely one of GE's most underrated, unknown songs, as is the excellent \\"A Shout In The Dark\\". The album does have some production problems, but overall it's an album that everyone who enjoys 80's music should check out. VERY underated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heroine deserved better","review":"Altho I try to avoid such books, I have read a handful of romances where the hero was actively in love with another woman before finally turning toward the heroine. I rarely believe in the HEA when a book starts this way and this one was no exception. The hero was in love with the Other Woman for 3/4 of the book and there is plenty of narrative shown from his POV so that there can be no mistaking where his heart lay.And despite, continuing to carry on an affair with the Other Woman, he had shown a dog-in-the-manger in regards to the heroine, his wife in name only right from the start so that when he does decide he is in love with the heroine, I didnt find it at all believable. Because he's a dog, period.The heroine was funny, lively, and upfront.

The only \\"new\\" technique presented is a description on how Caryl Fallert creates her machine quilted feathers. I also found the exercises and sample quilts uninspiring.

He uses language in describing the early twentieth century games that is clearly derived from the \\"purple prose\\" of the times, but it comes across as awkward and stilted. It would be one thing if he simply quoted such language- but his version of it is forced. In addition, there is much \\"blow by blow\\" description of games, which gets boring very quickly. Finally, he persists in calling Johnny Kling a \\"premier catcher\\" in seasons where he caught 100 games. This is an arbitrary categorization- it is true that there has been discussion over the years of catchers who caught 100 or more games the most seasons ( sometimes the most consecutive seasons), but I am not aware of any place where calling such catchers premier is established.The most interesting part of the book is the research on his Jewish heritage. Otherwise, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for our master spa","review":"I live in the middle of nowhere, and hate trying to find spa chemicals.

My biggest complaint is that the cooking surface is not 10.5 inches, the top rim is. The cooking area is only about nine, which makes a huge difference. It isn't really even big enough to cook bacon, which is why I wanted a square pan. I use it for eggs and cornbread, but I think my cornbread tastes better in a round cake pan.

I am not sure how well it was pre-seasoned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but...","review":"I am a big fan of cast iron, but the shape of this pan is not conducive to cooking over a burner.

I decided to stick the pan in the oven using the cleaning cycle, a method I use to clean my commercial grade half sheet pans and it ridded the pan of the sticky problem.

It is heavy duty cast-iron that came well seasoned. It distributes the heat very well so the food cooks evenly.

Nevertheless, if you have found contradictions of some of its ideas, he makes a good effort to simplify a little more what he have said before so that those doubts are brought on the open for discussion.I just regret that in some chapters, the system of questions and answers lacks continuity and seem too prepared so it feels that the answer was written before the questions was posed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled Order and Slowest Delivery ever experienced!!","review":"Eight days after order has been placed, and the items are not even shipped by this seller.

This, and 'Thunder In The East', were two of the hottest metal CD's EVER, with top notch songwriting, vocals, and ungodly chops. Akira Takasaki is one of the best metal guitarists ever, with mind-blowing runs, riffs, and other sundry fret magic. It is astonishing that this Japanese band could run circles around many other metal bands from the U.K. and U.S., or at least be on par with them musically.

Connelly simply removes the line between the real and surreal while guiding you through a man's shattered sense of reality and self as he tries to make sense of his world around him.

The monsters seem completely uninspired (come on - a brain in a jar! ) and most hark from other, better sources.

I recommend this collection as a good representation of her approach, and if you like it get some more - if not, still share it with friends, 'cause you never know who's going to respond positively.

It's on her Live From Toronto album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky says it -","review":"I was looking for a female version of moon river, and bought this based on other reviews.

I've read the other \\"hot\\" men's books out there, like What men don't want women to know, and they seem to be much more potent (maybe because those guys are anonymous!). I guess it's hard to write a book when you know all of your future girlfriends, present girlfriends or wives, etc. are going to be reading it! Anyway, I wasn't impressed with this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid read.","review":"I am a man. I have read this book. I enjoyed it. It helped me clarify many thoughts. As concerns issues a number of readers, seemingly women, have raised, I would like to comment. There appears two themes, the book is generalist/sexist and then there are what I think are mis-readings. On the first, a book of said title is general and subject to inherent inaccuracies of the broad brush stroke. On the latter, I would caution against what seems to be a reading-into of things; for example, I don't believe the authors want someone who is not themselves, and caution against it in fact, but that doesn't imply a person true to themselves (admitted unfortunate here in my opinion) is going to garner attention/what's desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY","review":"Whoever buys this book is a complete idiot. The authors are three Joe Schmo's who in their free time decided to write an opinion book about obvious, commonplace, trite ideas. There is nothing insightful or useful in this book. Why there are so many people that bought this book and number of good reviews is beyond my comprehension. The authors are smart in that they wrote this book to make easy money off on the retards that buy it. Anyone who wants to write a book with me about \\"What Women Want\\" and have connections to a publisher, let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"Besides not wasting your money on this book, don't waste your time. It seems to have been written by three men who have formed their own post-collegiate fraternity, complete with sticky floor and women of little or no self-esteem. I'm aware of many of the differences in outlook between men and women, but even with those in mind, I'll wait to find a man who has matured more than these three have.In addition, the language, sentence structure, and content structure of the book are written at a very low reading level. Are the authors not able to write at a higher level, or do they assume that women won't be able to understand a more sophisticated read?This book made me alternately laugh and cringe. Good for a raunchy comedy, but not so good for a purported self-help book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what \\"some\\" men want","review":"While I appreciate that this book reveals what three men want to share about their understanding of men's minds, bodies and feelings I would rather have the book be titled \\"what some men want\\". And I'm not sure that as a woman myself that I'd want one of those \\"some men\\". It reflects men as adolescent, insecure, entitled to their \\"ways\\" and suggests that professional men deep down have needs that are just plain old there and that's it. The book left me wondering where the decent, hardworking, genuine men I know fit in. They are out there too. The book is rather two dimensional in this regard. It looks at men rather superficially without an appreciation for the depths of their psyche. I'm not sure I'd apply some of the ideas to Canadian men either. If the book reflects typical American professional men, then it's a sad state of affairs (sorry about the pun). But then, I'd be leaning towards calling them \\"boys\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"At least these guys tell the truth as they see it","review":"I agreed with much of this book, even when it annoyed me. These guys are clearly trying to pull off two things: tell some rather sticky truths, and offer meaningful advice. Since so many other books (The Rules, for instance), are offering subterfuge and deception as a kind of substitute for truth, the heaps of advice they try to build on it didn't ring tue for me. These guys never say \\"do for me\\" and leave it at that, contrary to some of the flame reviews posted here. I certainly don't fill in the gaps in this book with \\"if I flirt with them, I'm a prostitute\\"!!! I think one of us should write the only meaningful response: \\"what Women want\\", and take the same risks they take in this book. Maybe we'll finally start to get somewhere.It's also a FUNNY book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Three Yuppie Stooges Want","review":"These three guys from My Town (maybe I should leave) with their all too recently acquired \\"professional\\" credentials (Congratulations, graduate!) presume to tell the ladies how best to go about pleasuring them, and at the end give away these \\"ugly truths:\\" Looks are almost everything to a guy, and men cheat on women they love. If you are good-looking enough will they not cheat on you? No, because they want \\"sexual variety.\\" So, if you are a \\"10\\" and don't mind your man having \\"sexual variety,\\" then all you have to do is properly perform oral sex on them and be \\"nice\\" (not brilliant or interesting -- a no-no!) and God willing, you should be able to get yourself a yuppie who cheats on you. Happy hunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"These three jerks are laughing all the way to the bank","review":"...and so are other self-help authors, publishing companies and relationship shrinks, as women get more and more confused about how to deal with men.This book is full of contadictions, like \\"professional men don't have time for games and won't stand for them\\", while the rest of the book makes excuses for their own game-playing. But we're supposed to applaud them for their \\"honesty\\"No wonder \\"The Rules\\", in all its absurdity, still managed to sell millions of copies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book was given to me as a gift and I read most of it.

This book is a laugh-out-loud tour into the minds of three very self absorbed individuals. I kept calling my friends to read sections out loud. Beach reading, definetely.Is it helpful? Not really. Ultimately, the surprising thing is not that \\"professional men\\" don't think like women, as the authors seem to think. The real \\"ugly truth\\" is that the come across as so...unmanly. Kind of sad and wimpy in a selfish way. So go ahead, give your phone number to that hot construction worker that harasses you every day on your way to work. Since one of the authors' theses is that a man is either attracted to you when he meets you or he will never be, at least you know where you stand with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Break!","review":"This is one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read. I, a single, atttactive professional female, and a good friend of mine, who is a tall, gorgeous blond--bought this book at the same time. We are both Christians, by the way, but still human. We both thought that we were going to get some sound insight. HA! I chuckled at it's arrogance, mis(not to mention dangerous)information. I read in a nut shell--that you must look like Pamela Anderson and be a sex machine. Even then, the man in your life will masturbate and fantasize about having sex with your sister.

That will not take too long, I suspect, if he has very much in common with any of the three authors. However, if you are interested in a long-term relationship with a man based on love and respect, you will discover what he wants better than any book can covey. Here's a crazy thought....find out for free what your man wants..ask HIM! And listen without criticizing or becoming defensive. If you can't deal with what he really wants, walk away. One more thing, yes, some men do cheat on women they love....and many of those men are left by their wives/girlfriends who no longer love or trust them. If a man loves a woman enough to commit to her, he should be able to muster the restraint it takes to prevent the destruction of trust in the relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy yuppies..","review":"I totally agree with the revewer who said that the book is about what spoiled, fed on baby-formula yuppies want (and what they never get). My advice for everybody is to forget this book and look for a real man, a man with a heart. How to find him: don't pretent that you are overly OK and ready to always please him and all these sleazeballs will fall off you by themselves. Unfortunately, there is an element of the sad truth in this book: some high-income men do tend to be self-centered, heartless, stiff, emotionally blind robots; you need to learn to open your eyes and avoid these men. Forget their money and costumes! The book had helped me to do exactly that. A woman is worth for what she is, and stifling yourself up to somebody's boring and empty life will not do any good; those men who still don't get it in their 30s will have to live alone or learn it. The book reminded me of the famous Ted Bundy's quote: \\"I am the most coldhearted son of a witch you can ever meet\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want the typical preppy man's view","review":"Some advice was relevant, but it would be easier and cheaper to browse sections that appeal to you at the bookstore.

It manages to bash men in a way that would make Andrea Dworkin proud. Men are shallow, selfish, lying, manipulative & deceitful, according to this \\"book\\". What is unfortunate is that some young women are going to read it, take it seriously & think this is what all men are really like. This book should have been titled \\"What Spoiled, Shallow, Arrogant, New York City Yuppies Want In A Woman - And Why They'll Never Find Her.\\" Take heart.

Men want you to be considerate and nice. Men want you to boost their ego. Men want to keep a little black book. Men want you to perform oral sex. Men want, men want, men want.... And let's not forget about man's fear of rejection - boo hoo. It is no wonder these guys are single - they are pathetic losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men are pathetic creatures and women must understand that","review":"This is one of the stupidest books I have come across in a long while. Men are so fouled up they have an innate need to cheat (justified by the authors as wanting variety instead of what it is--abuse), want only beautiful women, and want women who will cater to their every need.Not the most jaded feminist could have ever written such a man-hating tract."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read.","review":"This book was given to me as a gift and I read it with a kind of morbid curiosity, as each page seemed to get worse as I went on. Why anyone would listen to these three dweebs is beyond me. Save your money, or give it to a homeless person."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediorcre book that is just commonsense.","review":"I'm a man who read this book, and I don't understand why so many women hate this book. I'll admit, this book doesn't tell much about how to make a man yours, and it's nothing but commonsense, but it deals mostly with what is on his mind. What were you expecting? Do you hate your boyfriend, or father because he may think the same way?The only problem I had with this book was that these guys gave the impression that all men cheat and want a \\"ten\\" for a wife or girlfriend. \\"Looks matter the most.\\" There are plenty of men who look for more than just that.Other than that, can any woman tell me why it is wrong to tell what is on his mind? The section: \\"the awful truth\\" and \\"facts about men\\" was the best parts of the book, and something that women should know. Why hate a book because of that?Email me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Generalizations","review":"I found this book sitting on my mother's coffee table and read it out of curiosity. While some of it was mildly amusing, it should be noted that it seems more written on how to snag a man with the authors' particular personality types, than how to attract a man in general. Some of this is true for some men, some isn't. I think it's a problem when each gender becomes a stereotype to the other. All men are not any certain way, just as all women aren't any certain way. We are people first, genders second.The few parts of the book that weren't written with this bias seem largely common sense to me, and not especially more true of men than women. Overall, while not quite as demonic as some reviewers make it out to be, the book isn't really worth it. I'm not an expert on relationship self help literature, but I don't think it would be too difficult to find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was written by men?!?!?!","review":"Instead of spending your hard-earned money on this book, buy The Rules and The Rules II. The Rules gives much better advice than this book did. I bought it because I figured since men wrote it, it must be accurate. These men are just capitalizing on women's insecurities. Stick to The Rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! The Blueprint I've Used for All of My Six Marriages","review":"As one of the men this book's readers would like dearly to be with, I can say that this is a manual for a lasting relationship with a great, well-off guy like me. It explains in great detail what kind of woman a guy like me (I'm a former Delta Upsilon president AND a very successful accountant in Northern New Jersey) will fall for, and it's almost like it read my mind in every relationship I've been in. Buy it if you want to be with a guy like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE-TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW","review":"SO,MEN WANT WOMEN WHO WON'T CALL THEM AFTER THE FIRST DATE, WHO WON'T BOTHER THEM ON THEIR GUYS NIGHT OUT AND WHO WON'T HAVE SEX UNTIL THEY HAVE GONE ON A SECOND DATE.

I DON'T NEED 3 \\"PROFESSIONAL\\" MEN TO TELL ME WHAT I'VE KNOWN SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS FUNNY IN A WAY, AND MANY THINGS THEY WROTE ABOUT WERE TRUE, BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE \\"PROFESSIONAL\\" MEN NEVER MENTIONED CONTRACEPTIVE.

They think that their incomes abover $70K can buy them anything--guess what, you can't buy a heart! I advice the authors to think about what women want and think hard, if they want to get any. They will end up married to alchogolic daughters of Wall street wallets (who weren't alchogolics until married). They will cheat with anything young when they get older. They will get caught sleeping with a subordinate; they will get fired. They will get sued for sexual harassment. They will be eaten by their wives (who will have artificial teeth) for the rest of their lives. Good luck!These guys need to go to their mamma--she will understand them. They still need a formula.

Go ahead, say the 3 unmarrieds, chase the guy, and call him after the date. This book was obviously written for MEN (to make their lives easier) and not to sincerely help single women to create love in their lives.

So ladies, here's the brief synopsis: men love oral sex (especially if you let them ejaculate), won't consider one-night-stands as potential girlfriends, and want a girlfriend who's a professional, yet domestic, reserved, yet wild in bed. I got news for you 3 bachelors, with that attitude you will not get more than a shallow, bimbo for a girlfriend and as soon as she gets some brains she will drop you faster than a New York minute. Do you ever wonder why you're still single?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...but nothing new","review":"This book was decent, but I think I read it too late as so much of the focus seemed to be on babies. Also, I already knew most of the information in the book because I've been looking into Montessori for quite a while now. However, other reviews I've read about this book is that it doesn't explain enough for those new to Montessori. Maybe there is just a problem with the explanations in general. I really wanted to learn more about the actual activities, but I'd say it is okay for someone just learning about Montessori. However, I didn't read the sections that pertain to infants since I have a toddler. My understanding is that some of the advice is controversial--such as letting a baby cry it out (something I'm totally against and most research is too). I think it does a decent job of introducing the basic principles but I'm looking for a book about Montessori activities step-by-step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haphazard writing","review":"I read this book hoping to find activities to do with my child at home, what I encountered was a difficult to read, poorly organized, confusing book. Rather than divide the book into age groups, the book is divided into different aspects of curriculum. It is impossible to look for activities, development milestones, etc. for a specific age. You have to read each chapter, and even then they are hard to find- buried in the author's interpretation of the Montessori method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you are completely new to child development and the montessori method than Montessori from the Start would probably serve you well as a fairly accessible introduction. I, however, was hoping for either a more in depth explanation of montessori principles relevant to this early age group or specific exercises and games to play at home. In my opinion this book was rather superficial with lots of repetition and unhelpful complaints about parenting practices today. There are better books out there on the theory and better books out there if you are looking for practical tips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or traumatize your child with this drivel","review":"Rife with poor writing and outdated, harmful advice, this book isn't worth reading even if it comes to you free. There are far too many wonderful Montessori books out there to waste even a second on this garbage. This book might be fine if you want emotionally distant, manipulated children, which isn't the Montessori way to begin with. The writers support many peculiar and scientifically contravened ideas. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry that I wasted my money","review":"[...]Montessori is not a parenting style, attachment parents or more mainstream parents can all apply montessori methods at home. How long the baby nurses, where they sleep, at what age they sleep through the night, none of that is montessori! Different cultures parent differently, and one of Maria Montessori's main criteria for montessori education was that it be relevant to the era and culture that the child lives in. She never went into specifics on any of the crap that these authors go into.I think it is wrong for them to infiliterate their own parenting tactics under the banner of Montessori methods, I hope to find a book that is more relevant and true to what it advertises that it is on it's cover and cover notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending, overwhelming and inaccurate","review":"I am a new mom hoping to learn about ways to implement the Montessori method in my home for my 15 month old son. As others have noted, this book focuses on babies. Further, it gives the impression that if you have missed this window, your child may not properly develop the ability to develop his attention span. Also, as others have noted the advice to wean a child at 9 months is contrary to recommendations by the AAP and the WHO. Terrible advice! I also was shocked to hear them recommend that you shut your two year old in their room at bedtime even if they protest their bedtime.This book has stressed me out and I wish I had never opened it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick something different","review":"It's been a while since I have used this dvd but I was not impressed and I would recommend buying a different hip hop workout video."},{"rating":"1","title":"A discrace to call this a hip hop dvd","review":"This dvd should be given no stars. It's poorly made, the moves are terrible, it's not a workout for anyone I can imagine, and the girls in the back who are her backup are TERRIBLE. To be a certified fitness instructor she is on the chunky side with no muscle definition at all. She clearly is not a real hip hop dancer and looks like she woke up one day and decided to make a dvd. She gets out of breath, her moves are juvenile and the music just sucks. How someone could give this dvd more than 1 star is beyond me.

In many real life cases (the Vaughns, Baby Emma Wyatt, Baby Jessica and Baby Richard) the father's right were not terminated. The prospective adoptive couple fights for years and eventually has to hand the child over (in one case the child was 7). There is no happy ending for them. The real parents don't give the child back to the prospective family after fighting. Many (not all) prospective adoptive families get divorced.

However, the movie was not true to the book in most of the christian aspects. Items such as the chikds cousins teaching him how to pray and more of the part where the family was in Haiti and the childs interactions with the Haitian children. The movie producers decided to only make the movie for a secular movie audience and left out all of the important christian aspects of the book. If you read the book first and then saw what they produced as a movie, you would seriously be disappointed in the movie. They ruined a perfectly good christian novel. I can't believe that Mrs. Kingsbury actually let the movie producers get away with what they left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased this movie with high hopes, only to be very disappointed. The book was wonderful and showed the power of the Lord in a wonderful way. The movie had nothing to do with the Lord, it is like they took the heart and soul out of the book and made a movie of what was left. Wish I could return the movie. SUCH A WASTE OF MONEY!

Karen how could you allow this to happen???"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO DISAPPOINTING!!","review":"I am an avid reader of Karen Kingsbury's books and was on the list to get this movie as soon as it came out. I am so disappointed! It was nothing like the book! Kingsbury is known for weaving a tale that is strong in christian values and in showing God's amazing character and the way He works even through the hard times. There was NOTHING in this movie to make it a christian film! There was NOTHING to learn about or show our amazing God. This movie did not draw me in, nor did the acting or the characters. The christian element was missing and therefore the movie was ruined. I was even more disappointed when I saw that Karen Kingsbury helped produce this! She obviously had a choice, and she chose the easy path that will appeal to the masses and make her alot of money, but at what cost?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading the book, I was really looking forward to seeing the movie. While the acting was good, the screenplay was adapted too much to try to appeal to mainstream audiences, thus losing its message. There is no reference to faith, especially Joey learning to pray and using prayer to help him through the stays with the Porters.This film is okay but, it is too far from the book for fans of Karen Kingsbury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this DVD rendition of Karen Kingsbury's book. I am a big fan of hers and, after reading the book, decided to use the DVD as the basis for our church fellowship meeting. What a shock to find that the screen writers had removed any reference to faith, which deeply penetrates Kingsbury's books and serves as an inspiration to believers struggling with daily challenges in their lives. I had to paraphrase parts of the book to explain to others how different the DVD was from Kingsbury's theme. I was going to donate the DVD to our church library, but will not be doing that now that I know that all of Kingsbury's references to faith have been removed form the DVD. I won't watch it again, so it will wind up in the trash...what a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"I mean, I guess the writers were trying to get at something...

EH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian films can be good","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this independent Christian film. Normally, even though I am a Christian, I roll my eyes at the poor quality of the genre, the easy answers, the mediocrity, the poor artistry. Not so here. This is a thoughtful, nuanced, \\"no easy answers\\" film. It is a film that is about parental love at the heart of it and how complicated it can be. There are a few schmaltzy moments, but not many. I wish all Christian movies were like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Dandelion Dust","review":"What kinds of sacrifices would you be willing to make for the good of a child you love? Like Dandelion Dust, written by Karen Kingsbury, is a very moving story.

Karen Kingsbury has a special way of dealing with real-life issues. You will not be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to the book","review":"If you just see the movie and haven't read the book it seems like a fantastic movie, however, if you've read the book you will know that the ending fell flat compared to the book.

SO bad that it became a gag gift at my lastest birthday party and no one wanted it. As erotica it is poorly shot, corny, with bad fashion, worse acting and absolutely no sex. I'm not kidding. The tape is 5 vingetes where there is too much talking and no one gets naked. Even during the \\"love scenes\\" both the men and women keep their clothes on, it's hilarious. This might be a mild turn-on if your fantasy life takes you back to high school where \\"making out\\" was hot and taking off your date's blouse was the only goal.As erotica \\"by women - for women\\" this tape is truly a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"As far as getting a good cardio workout in this one, you do!

The workout is 89 minutes. I needed something I could work out to 30-40 mins a few times a week. But the thing that bothered me the most about this workout was that Ms. Bento has terrible form. If she ever actually punched someone with those punches she would hurt herself. I have a black belt in martial arts and ten years of training and I could not get past how bad her form was--I would be afraid that viewers would inadvertently hurt themselves imitating her. She has clearly not had any formal training at all in throwing kicks or punches. It is extremely disturbing. I definitely got a good sweat on but could not get past her terrible form. I had to modify almost everything so that I didn't injure myself by following her poor form."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money.","review":"This looks like it was written on the fly.

One cannot use the indicators the authors note to establish child abuse in a slick fashion.

I think not and was very disturbed by the authors' view of children's expressive work. An antidote to this book is Understanding Children's Drawings/Malchiodi; this book presents a humanistic, respectful view of children's drawings, one which I can comfortably use in my own work with troubled or abused children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic view of the meaning of children's drawings","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who said this is a cookbook approach to children's drawings. While there is need for ways to understand what children are communicating through their art, it is not through rating isolated parts or characteristics of their drawings. This book is about how drawings can be useful in determining child abuse, but this seems like an abusive way of using children's art for diagnosis.

Meanwhile this book is terrible, if I wanted this then I'll read the goosebumps books.

Some of the plot elements -- Violet's experiences and the long-lost sister -- are well-worn, but the manner of telling is so fresh that it doesn't really matter. \\"Mrs. Fox\\", unrepentantly awful and cheerfully unsinkable, is a gem.I think some readers will have trouble following the plotline, especially in the beginning, and the quick-spoken, intricate period diction, particularly in Mrs. Fox's voice, may lose some, but the book rewards close attention. It would appeal to readers who enjoyed books like SLAMMERKIN and THE DRESS LODGER, but its tone is far more arch.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard starter, becomes a page-turner","review":"Yes, there's a surfeit of fancy words.

I cooked dinner with my nose in it, I stayed up late, I used every excuse to do errands where I'd have to stand in line, just so that I could have more time with this page-turner.

She takes Madame de Merteuil in her hand and gives her a voice that is both new and true to her Laclos roots. Although we do not have an equally amusing and equally heartless Valmont here, we have a more dangerous sociopath to curdle our blood: Earl Much. Stockley weaves a clever, cruel story which is more English than French this time and Merteuil fits in London almost as perfectly as in Paris.Most of the time sequels to popular classics are big fat failures and I confess I did not have my hopes high on this book. I have to say that I was very happily surprised and I recommend it to all Laclos fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factory of Cunning","review":"I could not even finish this book, which in and of itself is not normal for me.

I don't think it would be possible for me to care any less about the characters. The writing is not enjoyable to read. It is as if the author was doing an exercise in a writing - perhaps becoming bored with writing, or maybe this was her thesis in getting her masters.

I logged on to a site that plays a \\"radio show\\" of movie scores, downloaded, and listened. The overture from this CD was the first selection. I thought it was really cool..right up my alley. I was holding my then five-week old son as I sat in front of the computer. He was starting to fuss and cry, but when the overture started, he calmed down right away and listened!! He seemed to like it as much as I did (which is why I now call the overuture \\"Peter's Theme\\"). I ordered the CD shortly thereafter, and was not disappointed. I especially enjoyed the track called \\"Hot Dogs\\" which incorporates some nifty electric guitar work.

When I found out about The Halo Benders I just had to order a couple.The combination of Calvin Johnson's(Beat Happening) voice along w/ Doug Martsch's(Built to Spill) vocals intrigued me to hear it for myself.And it does work. Maybe sounds a little \\"out there\\" to some- but hey that's what I like.Calvin Johnson has a really deep voice and Doug, well it's hard to describe his voice, but it's lighter(or shinier) with a lot more range and melody. Sometimes they use their styles together or separate, makes for an interesting listen. Singing in different pitches.My favorite song is (\\"single\\"): \\"Don't Touch My Bikini\\"Might sound a little challenging for listeners, if you're not familiar with these two bands(Built to Spill & Beat Happening).- To me it's a joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with Halo Benders","review":"Want to hear something that you will never hear on FM radio?

I was in high school at the time and I remember laughing hysterically and wondering why I was alone; why doesn't anyone else get this? Now that we are (hopefully) entering the post-gross-out comedy era, the State's unique brand of humor is a more socially acceptable commodity. Buy this today, you can't rent it anywhere and you must see it.

While _The Dawn of Human Culture_ does cover many aspects of human evolution clearly and well, explaining theories and pitfalls, and including a lot of clear sketches, most of the book is just that, a rehash of evolutionary theory. The authors don't get to the subject at hand until very late in the book (in fact, I haven't finished reading yet, and only the knowledge that they do eventually make some sort of a point is keeping me reading it).

Planing to occupy an open file or gaining space is useless if you get a knight fork and loose your queen. Strategy exists to create the possibility of tactics.

What a great set! The perfect addition to any Bon Jovi fan's collection! Having been a Bon Jovi fan for almost twenty years, I can honestly say that it is a real pleasure to listen to all of these songs that didn't quite make the albums. Some are vintage Bon Jovi, others are a complete left turn from the norm, but all of them are great! I especially liked hearing Richie Sambora and David Bryan take a turn at the lead vocals. A must have for any Bon Jovi fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know why most of this stuff was unreleased","review":"It seems that the guys in Bon Jovi actually have a taste in music. Had they released much of the stuff on this box set as studio albums, they would have had a much shorter career than the 20+ years that they've been around. I've always wondered why so many box sets were typically an overproduced greatest hits package, and now I know why they are. 90% of the tracks on this set are horrible. Bon Jovi is a rock band, and yet this box set is made up of terrible ballad after ballad. I'm afraid that this is one collection that will be collecting dust amongst my CDs after one very long and painful listening trying to find at least a few worthy tracks to listen to multiple times. Most fans will be better off sticking to their true studio albums and leaving this set to hardcore fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardrock slowly dies with this album...","review":"I don't like to say it, but Bon Jovi is getting worse with this album. As a huge Bon Jovi fan, I bought this album immediatly and listened to it. The first month I loved this album and I played it over and over, but the second mont the songs became annoying and the lyrics made me sick. I was bored of the same lyrics and the same \\"messages\\" in the songs. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a great Bon Jovi fan, but this album doesn't deserve a place in the Bon Jovi collection..."},{"rating":"1","title":"PJL hit the nail on the head!","review":"Just read his review of this POS and you'll know how idiotic this entire band is.Bon Jovi were sugarcoated, inoffensive, cliche, simple, and just stupid.

I was looking for something with all BJ songs on it, since she is a newer fan of Bon Jovi. When I received the box set I was surprised. It didn't contain any of the known songs, with the exception of demos. What it does contain are the demos and the songs that never made it to the CDs. I fell in love with this box set and kept it for myself. Some of Bon Jovi's BEST songs are on here, such as The Radio Saved My Life tonight, Edge of a Broken Heart, and Sympathy. If you are a long time Bon Jovi fan that has every album buy this boxed set. If you are new to Bon Jovi, like my sister, make sure you have everything else first.Also, this boxed set contains a DVD, where the band talks about the box set and the songs. Although I have not seen it all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor us!!!!","review":"I heard the box set, thanks to my cousin who dropped in from the US. The album, needless to say is a music connoisseurs dream. Every song is so breathtaking and so in the Bon Jovi niche. They've lived a dream and taken their fans (like me) along with them. It's such a pity that we fans back in India can't make the most of it. The Set is not even out here and I don't see it releasing in the near future. Such torture for the countless BJ fans dying to get their hands on the box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST YET OF BON JOVI","review":"THIS COLLECTION IS WONDERFUL, IT HAS SONGS THAT WERE RECORDED IN THE 80'S, 90'S AND 2000'S.

I've been Bon Jovi since the beginnings of music for me and I thought I really knew the band throughout all these years. All the new songs show how the group can really keep their creativity and talent going with the changing times. There's so much awesome new material to digest!Highly recommended! There's no other like BJ and they've always given my musical taste much needed satisfaction. The DVD is definitely a bonus also~"},{"rating":"1","title":"1,000,000,000 CAN BE WRONG!","review":"I loved Bon Jovi growing up and was excited that there were all these unreleased songs that everyone seems to be saying are worth something.

They are.","review":"For fans, I suppose this would be a rather big delight; for non-fans, it's nothing that will turn you on to the band from Jersey.

Jon Bon Jovi is/was, really, at best, the David Cassidy of the eighties. I mean, doesn't that fact tell you anything? That the \\"title\\" to this \\"thing\\" ain't really the (mm-a'huh-huh-huh) truth?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Correct me if I'm wrong, but....","review":"....not every single B-side is on this CD (at least not listed, anyway). There was a song called \\"Love Is War\\" which was the B-side of the \\"Living In Sin\\" 45 single from 1989. In my opinion, it was, perhaps, one of the best songs Bon Jovi ever recorded. Is this the hidden track I've heard about? And does anyone else remember it as well? This isn't a review, since I have yet to hear this collection, but I wonder why it isn't listed. Would appreciate some clarification on this. Other than that,I think putting out all (or most of ) their previously unreleased and obscure catalog is a great idea.

From early Chinese rocketry to the public ridiclue suffered by Goddard, Burrows offers the most intelligently written comprehensive text on the history of space exploration available, with a constant, striking sense of humor. After the second chapter his writing becomes a much more obtuse, detailed study, but only because he conveys that much more information -- if you are serious about the subject, there is no more important source. Please read it. Please pass it to a friend. We need more authors as inspiring as this one and this book needs more readers! If you are writing fiction, a historical study, a screenplay, or doing general research -- PLEASE -- do not consider your work complete without having finished this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive review Of US-USSR space race","review":"Burrows does an excellent job of giving a review of the exploration of space by the two heavy hitters, the US and USSR. As an aerospace historian, I was familiar with almost all of what he wrote. The positive of this book is all of the information is contained in one book. Well researched and documented, it gives many insights to the past 40+ years of space exploration. Of course he is biased in his writing, but all historical works are by nature, biased, since we were not there personally to see it firsthand. Recommended reading for the space enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"More a political history than a technical one, and not very engaging.

I am a fan of his attempts at psycho/sociological commentary in the guise of a fantasy, even though he beats you over the head with them more than he really delves. I like a good balance of intelligence and excitement.The Sword of Bedwyr did not make me want to run out and read the sequel. It makes me hope the sequel is better, but I'm in no hurry to find out. I just kept thinking it was slow and relatively uneventful. I tried to make excuses for it, thinking \\"Maybe he wants to tell the story of a hero who isn't born superior to all around him (say Drizzt?), and wants to show how that character develops into someone more interesting.\\"Well, an origin story doesn't have to be action-packed to be intriguing, but if the intrigue doesn't pay out, then you're stuck with a dissapointed reader. My advice to R.A. on this one: A little more, little earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be a Salvatore book","review":"After immersing myself in several of Salvatore's tales (Icewind Dale trilogy, Dark Elf trilogy, etc.), I picked up this series. Unfortunately, it was nowhere near as interesting or compelling to read as his other titles. I agree with the earlier reviewer in that I could not for the life of me get into the story. I didn't even finish the last book, simply because I didn't really care what happened. Not at all what I expected to be, I can't really recommend this to anyone but the most devout Salvatore fan. Instead, read the Demon Wars Saga: much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put: R.A. Salvatore Is A Genious","review":"Salvatore proved to me once again that he is not capable of writing a bad novel. Even though this series will never touch the Dark Elf or Icewind Dale Trilogies, it still seems to capture you with his exciting battle scenes and character wit. TIP TO PARENTS: If you want your children to start reading, hand them the Crimson Shadow Trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver is a brilliant characterisation","review":"The main character fails but Oliver, the halfling character, is brilliant. It appears the fully fleshed Oliver was dropped into a lame story written around him. However, R.A.

A must-read book for anyone who really loves fantasy novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why a trilogy out of this book?","review":"We're far away from Forgotten Realms with this book. Don't waste your money on this book. The hero is hallow and it's simply too easy.Meet Dritz instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disapointment","review":"That was one of the first books by R.A. Salvatore I read. It was a major disapointment for me. This trilogy does not come even close to the books written by Brooks, R.Jordan, Eddings and other fantasy authors. The plot is so-so and the book as the whole is just very poorly written. Yes, there is planty of adventures, dragons, wizards, etc but all of that is very predictable and author just brushes thorugh them without much explanaition and character development. The only good thing about this book is that it is probably the best out of the whole trilogy: the second one was just dreadfull, and the last one was about the same level as the \\"Sword of Bedwyr\\". As the whole I would not recommend it. I just hope that other Slavatore's work are of the higher level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing work by Salvatore this time","review":"After reading the Cleric Quintet, and the Dark Elf and Icewind Dale trilogies, I was excited to find this book. It was a disappointment though, and it seems weak compared to those other series.For some reason the story and characters just failed to interest me and it was more like reading a book written according to some recipe than a cohesive whole. All the usual Salvatore elements are there: protagonist, sidekick, villains and fantasy settings. But they didn't gel into anything believable or engaging so I can't recommend it. It was as if Salvatore tried to plug in these elements, expecting them to make an interesting story, but for me at least, it failed. Anytime I find myself hoping the protagonists are caught or killed, it's a bad sign.My opinion seems to be in the minority and the series may have improved after this first entry, but I'm not willing to buy the other books in that faint hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor execution","review":"Salvatore's blatant lifting of names and characters from various sources, most notably Tolkien, makes it difficult indeed for me to take this novel seriously. Perhaps it's not intended to be completely serious, but Salvatore's calling his main male character Luthien (a very important *female* character in Tolkien's mythology) and his native land Eriador (the western part of Tolkien's Middle-earth), not to mention Oliver deBurrows, a \\"halfling\\" thief whose dialogue is almost lifted from \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" really did me in, even though the story itself is not inherently flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is smaller than I expected","review":"My friend's copy is bigger than the one I received.

This did not detract me from the story which was excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"James Lee Burke is one of the finest fiction writers I've encountered recently. All of his novels I've read to date flow like a turbulent river. The characters are rich, the plots believable and cohesive.

Another great combination that gave me all I could want from a listen. The miles floated away. Burke's similes and metaphores glide the listener sublimely along (\\"raindrops making stars in the dust\\"). A word about Will Patten as reader. Ever heard those pathetic reads from an author? Well, one listen to Patten and those guys will thankfully commit the author's final vain/glory act of suicide. What a hard task this must be, but with prose given him by Burke we get the benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Of the Same","review":"Whether it's Billy Bob Holland or Dave Robicheaux, it really doesn't matter, James Lee Burke always seems to manage to make the story compelling.This time it's Billy Bob, the ex-Texas Ranger turned lawyer. The setting, however, is a little different. Billy Bob travels north to the Bitterroot Valley, Montana and becomes embroiled in the problems of an old friend there.As if the problems he's stumbled onto weren't enough, a psychopath who is convinced that Billy Bob is responsible for his sister's death has also followed him.Billy Bob Holland is a tortured soul who is having trouble dealing with his past while, at the same time, trying to ensure his own safety now. Like the other James Lee Burke books, there is no shortage of action and intrigue mixed with a very interesting, while troubled, main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Landscape Devoid of Purpose","review":"As a novelist myself (The Legacy, Savage Press Oct. 2000), I began reading James Burke's latest tome with an eye towards learning something about the Great American West and the interplay between the land and Burke's fictional charactors. While the desciptions of Montana soared and provided a stunning background to \\"Bitterroot\\", the lack of any meaningful plot and the use of cardboard people to populate the landscape was disappointing.

A host of psychopaths, degenerates and Mafiosos mix with a stage full of psychologically damaged innocents and not so innocents including the trademark flawed ex-lawman and his violence prone pal. Burke's gift for flowery agreeable prose which in past outings has raised this genre fiction to the threshold of literature here fails to camouflage the obvious retrofit that is Dave Robicheaux of New Iberia reborn as Billy Bob Holland in Montana. Two thirds into the story and the work seems to have degenerated into an aimless daisy-chain of one violent confrontation linking to the next act of heartless cruelty, all involving characters who are difficult to care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Delivery","review":"I keep buying these books written by James Lee Burke.

Let's hope he soon returns to Louisiana. Montana does not seem to provide him with the same inspiration. Bitterroot reads like a bad parody of Ernest Hemingway, overlaid with a patter of homespun philosophy and pop psyschology. It is filled with tortured similes and other forced descriptive devices. Perhaps his publisher expects a new book each year, but I would prefer to wait longer rather than seeing a fine writer waste his talent.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniquely Compelling","review":"I'm a long-time fan of Burke's Dave Robicheaux series, but a newcomer to the Billy Bob Holland series.

Doc has run afoul of a mining company over environmental issues, to say nothing of the local Mob and some mondo bizarro Hollywood types. When Doc's teenage daughter is attacked and one of the biker suspects is later murdered, Doc is arrested. Though Billy Bob is out of his bailiwick and perhaps out of his depth, he accedes to Doc's plea for legal representation and the chase is on.

Some tracks work better than others. For example, Trucking has a lot of trouble getting past its chuggy, 4/4 feel while Warf Rat is a gem. If you are a Deadhead who likes jazz, this is a good choice.

I love Jazz and I love the Dead, but this is neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead elevator music.","review":"The sole reason to buy this album is if you have an office building and it's the only way you can get away with playing the Dead in your lobby. The songs are barely recognizable and the musicians are barely passable. In this form the music loses all it's energy and emotion; the qualities that made them 'Dead' songs in the first place. If you're looking for a present for your favorite deadhead, stay way from this one (I can't emphasize this strongly enough)!Definately *NOT* a disk for deadheads!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grateful Dead Don't Swing","review":"If you want elevator music for an Insurance firm, this cd is for you.

Meticulous attention from all the great musicians shed light on the harmonic possibilities and melodic strengths of the Dead's music. Anyone familiar with Jerry's bluegrass background, the frequent Dead jams with both jazz and country artists, as well as the Dead's own rock and psychedelic foundations know that their writing at its best naturally lends itself to reinterpretation. For us, the high points were \\"Wharf Rat\\" (1st take live - unbelievable, Coltrane Quartet-type vibe), \\"Scarlet Begonias\\" (latin-style, very cool), \\"Friend of the Devil\\" (the song is a personal fave), and \\"Ship of Fools\\" (southern R&B vibe - unexpected take on this tune). It was a joy to be part of this - check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Thing to Do For Yourself","review":"There are a lot of great ideas for your health - some of them so easy you won't even notice what you're doing.

The book was soo good that I read it in one night. It was so good to know that there is life after death and I will see my loved ones and not be in fear when that day comes. That same week I wanted more of Sylvia's works so I went to our local library and found \\"My Guide My Self\\". Boy was I disappointed. Here I found that this book dated 2/90 was the same EXACT book word for word, page for page, as the book I had just gone and paid $13 dollars for. I felt cheated. I don't know if Sylvia realized that we would find this out but I hope she addresses this and I feel an apology is owed to all who have gone to buy this book and then later to find out its the same EXACT book. Shame on you Sylvia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I was really looking forward to receiving this book when I ordered it through amazon.com. I was very disapppointed. I do believe Sylvia is able to see things that many of us can't. I don't, however, feel that she gets the whole picture. There are inconsistencies in this book, such as stating that she \\"frequently\\" does police work free of charge. A few pages later, it says she \\"NEVER\\" charges for her police work. Which is it? When she said \\"several months after my father died, my mother passed away. No great loss\\". That was it. If someone is truly spiritual, they would never make such a comment about the loss of any life. Especially their own mother. The reference to the \\"psychic dynasty\\" of her family strikes me as extremely arrogant. I think Sylvia and her family are into money. The bottom line. That isn't where it lies. She needs to seek help herself, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit on the melodramatic side","review":"I felt Sylvia Browne's Book \\"Adventures of a Psychic\\", was a bit on the melodramatic side. I couldn't find anything substantial about the life of, \\"Sylvia Browne\\", in fact I thought there was an awful lot of blaming the other person for all that went wrong in her life especially in the last chapter. I couldn't believe that anyone who claims to be such a tool for Gods good works could ever stoop so low, as to allow themselves to be promoted in this type of forum usually reserved for Movies, sports, and comedy specials, not spiritualists"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"One star is too much. I didn't know much about Sylvia Browne before I read this book, but I now know all I want or need to. This book left a distinct bad taste. The first 60 pages were devoted to chronicling the young Sylvia's social life and the succession of beaus that were supposedly in love with her, as well the various outfits she wore and how she styled her hair before going out on a date. Gifted or not, the whole book seemed boastful and conceited. Plus I really question the spirituality of a person that could dismiss her mother's death as \\"no real loss\\" and refer to her ex-husband as \\"evil\\" and proceed to slander him at every turn. She constantly wanders off in her anecdotes focusing more on details of crimes rather than psychic ability. This is a vanity book.

I found it very interesting but when I came to the section where she had decided that today's religion was out of date, so she started her own religion,(that is when I threw the book out in the trash.) If you want to know the truth, just open the good book, it's right there in black and white. I love the way people just change things so that it fits what they want to believe. Don't go looking for some psyhic to give you all the answeres. I looked up Slyvia's predictions online and found a lot that didn't come true. That was all I needed to know.

I also appreciated the point she made severaltimes; i.e., that despite her desire to help others, her abilitieshave not enabled her to guide her own actions.Brown contends that all people have psychic abilities . . . I'm notsure that listening to and/or reading ADVENTURES OF APSYCHIC will help you discover yours . . . yet if you're opento what might be a new way of thinking about yourself,you will gain better insight into the events that help shape your life.That Browne was also the narrator of this program addedto my enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sylvia Browne provides believable answers to big questions.","review":"Sylvia Browne's \\"would-be debunker-reviewers\\" in this group consistently focus on peripheral issues (such as her motives), rather than on the central issues of this book.

This book has opened up a new realm of thought for me. It answered some questions, that I have allways wanted to ask.

Read something by or about Eileen Garrett"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventures of a Psychic by Sylvia Browne","review":"I loved her story. She has a witty, compelling writing style.

In this book, it is more of the same. One might wonder if she is as amazing as she claims to be, why she doesn't take up James Randi's multi-million dollar psychic challenge. Please, Sylvia, demonstrate your abilities rather than just duping the gullible with fabricated stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A SOUL-OPENER","review":"As previous reviewers have said, I thought Sylvia Browne's book was terrific and I literally couldn't put it down either. This lady has such a refreshing sense of humour and she makes us understand things in a way which previously seemed rather intangible to comprehend. There are so many things in my life and in the lives of my friends and family which are unexplained in a spirtual sense; reincarnation, hauntings (in Scotland?) \\"coincidiences\\" and past lives as a whole are fascinating subjects which most of us shrug our shoulders at (out of fear and ignorance, I suspect) Sylvia is the real thing and I would really like to meet this extraordinary woman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only if you're out of toilet tissue","review":"What a load of tripe!

Even so, I didn't realize that she had faced so much sorrow in her life. Now that I have read her book, I see that she has had to deal with and overcome so much in her life, not to mention learning to use her gift to the best of her ability to serve God and to help others. And throughout it all, she has maintained a terrific sense of humor which is still very much a part of her today. I am more convinced than ever what a truly wonderful gift from God she is. I feel blessed to have been made aware of Sylvia. She shares openly and honestly about the other side and the meaning of life in general. Her book is an absolute must read! I look forward to any future books by or about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Dear Sylvia, Thank you for sharing your experiences. Life is a maze and to see someone who is more in-tune to our spiritual world within our senses share your experiences is so inspirational to me and others who I have talked to, especially when we are continually trying to find our way and learn life's lessons. I truly believe that most people like myself who tend to be the person everyone turns to for help and advice really need to have access to someone like you who exumes sincerety, practicality, and a Love for God.

The only negative would be the look, it's not the most attractive speaker I have seen with the washed black look or what ever it is, but that can be ignored. Mine is tucked under the TV stand with only the front visible. I don't think I would purchase other speakers in the Venturi line because of the looks. The others would be more difficult to hide, but if the price was right I could change my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds better than I was expecting and fantasitc price","review":"For the money, no better speaker.

If I hadn't already purchased front speakers, I would have 2 more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, Make sure you break it in.","review":"I recently bought this center channel speaker and it is very nice. Very clear vocals and audio. It did sound a little bright to my ears so I gave it a good break in period which is all it needed. Now I love it. So if you do decide to buy one don't be quick to judge it's bright sound, break it in first. What I did was run some bass heavy music through it all day while I was at work. I did this for about a week. It took about 100 hours to get the full benefit from breaking in but it was worth it. The woofers are just too stiff when it's fresh out of the box.Now it has very nice bass response. This center channel speaker could sell for over $200 and it would still be a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Punkrock","review":"There is absolutely nothing that Bodyjar can't do. The singer has a great voice, and it's good to hear how they express feelings in a melodic way like this.I really enjoy the variation in their songs.

I was really impressed with Holiday by Heaven 17, otherwise the rest was ???? Madonna should have done her own remixes!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge for yourself and listen to the samples before buying.","review":"My opinions on this CD stem from my enjoyment of industrial music and unique takes on cover songs.I agree with other industrial or techno fans that The KMFDM, Gene Loves Jezebel and The Voluptuous Horror Of Karen Black covers were really good. They satisfy my craving for industrial while providing a fresh perspective on hit songs.The Dead or Alive cover was pretty good as well. As far as most of the other tunes, I felt like I was listening to a close copy of the original. Is it a tribute to Madonna to attempt to perform and sing a song in the style that Madonna sang it? I don't think so. My idea of a tribute or good cover is to provide imaginative and creative angles on a classic song. A good example would be Garbage's version of a Beach Boy's tune in the song \\"Push It\\".Judge for yourself and listen to the samples before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribute -> Insult","review":"This cd is one of the worst blind investments I have made on music. The selection of songs is good however the good about this album ends with that. The Vocalists are generally incapable of recreating the spark of Madonna songs much less bring anything new to these songs. The vocals are weak, the mixing and arrangement of instruments (flat and monotone remixes and arrangements) further drown the vocals. I think the CD overall is very amateur sounding. I am suprised that Madonna even let this get printed. I think this CD can not really be a tribute except for the fact that it once again proves why Madonna is Madonna and everyone else is not. The only bearable songs on the compilation are the \\"Bed Time stories\\", and \\"Swim\\". The remake of Frozen destroys the song altogether, and is a definite career stopper for whoever did it.I have yet to see such a terrible attempt at remixing a group of musical intellectual material."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"One of the worst compilation albums ever. The idea was great, the outcome was not! \\"let's speed up or slow down Madonna songs!\\" must have been what they were thinking. No great \\"re-mixes\\" on this one.

I wish Amazon.com gave back money for music that stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\"Industrial\\" Representation of Madonna's songs","review":"Yup, that's what this album is mostly about -- an Industrial take on Madonna's clever songs. This is the sort of album that *grows* on you!!!It is quite interesting to see how the different artistes interpret some of these songs. I don't think it's fair to compare it to the way Madonna orginally did these songs. It has a very late-90's feel. Quite brilliant.My favorite tracks are (in the following order):12. Swim (Spahn Ranch) 1. Holiday (Heaven 17) 9. Material Girl (KMFDM) -- very freaky! 2. Like a Prayer (Loleatta Holloway) 8. Bad Girl (James Hardway)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...it's the worst c.d I ever heard","review":"I'm a fan of Madonna and if Madonna do a suicide we can understand why: this albulm. When I heard that a tribute to Madonna was done I bought this cd with the thought that it coulb be great but isn't the case... Bad arangement, bad vocal, bad re-mixe... It's like garbage-dance song all the whole cd and nothing can't save it. Maybe the volume 2 will be better...(I wish!)

To me, these was the worst tribute that i've ever heard.I was really shocked when i listened to most of the songs done by those sort of 'weird' hardcore Artistes. Anyway, there's no comment for certain artistes/groups or band like Dead or Alive, InSoc. & Berlin cause i listened to their albums. To the rest, pls don't even try to insult her musics for the next Vol., maybe (hope not).

I would suggest not buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagintive, creative pop with a British feel.","review":"This record, of course, is to be shunned by those who cannot look past the fact that is a top 40 record, but if you listen closely, there are some incredibly imaginitve and creative moments on this recording. Produced by Terry Brown (of early RUSH fame) the opening track, Any Colour, shows right away this group can hammer out a tune with driving rhythms and an upbeat feel; in essence, it sets the tone for the record. The highlights of the record are songs that run the gammut between soft and furious; One for the Mockingbird is lyrically a sweet sort of goodbye or yearning for a lost love, once again the band uses different sounds and textures that are unheard of in most popular music yet this one is about as radio-ready as you can get. The title cut and I've Been In Love Before round out the diverseness of a group who proved that you could stretch the boundaries of conventional pop. Terry Brown also deserves a good deal of credit as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST SAY NO","review":"You probably remember this 80's schlock band for the ubiquitous \`(I just) died in your arms tonight', and yes it's just as horrible as you remember.

Skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but... what happened to these guys?","review":"After rediscovering '(I Just) Died In Your Arms' on a local radio station, I went on a hunt to find this track to add to my music collection. My quest eventually led me to Cutting Crew's 'Broadcast' CD. And as a pleasant surprise, I discovered that all the other tracks were gems in their own right, and there were even a few familiar tunes I didn't even know they performed ('I've Been In Love Before', 'Life In A Dangerous Time'). It's one of those discs where I love listening to every tune from beginning to end... a rare find indeed. And it's 80's pop/new wave- one of my top fave genres to listen to! The best of both worlds...I've heard of a second album by this group, but my efforts in finding it on CD have been fruitless. Sadly, \\"Broadcast\\" seems to be Cutting Crew's only enduring contribution to 80's pop. But considering how much I love this disc, I am happy to see that they took full advantage of their brief moment of glory. Good job guys.'Late"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Crew Got Screwed","review":"Laugh though you may, this has been one of my favorite albums of the past 10 years. Maybe some of that has to do with my nostalgic feelings for 80s music, I don't know. But, I'm telling you, it's a good album.

I listened to it on many a teenage night as I lay in bed. When I got rid of my old stereo, the turntable went with it and my vinyl sat forgotten collecting dust.Recently, I got \\"Broadcast\\" on CD. I don't know if it's been remastered or what, but the sound is extraordinary. I hear so many new sounds and instrumentation that I didn't remember hearing from the vinyl.Regardless, this album remains an excellent piece from the '80s. While not groundbreaking, they do have some creative moments. Gems include the wonderfully uplifting \\"One For the Mockingbird\\", the beautiful \\"I've Been In Love Before\\", the straight-forward rock of \\"Don't Look Back\\", and the soothing \\"Sahara\\". The big hit from this album was the ubiquitous \\"I Just Died in Your Arms\\", which holds up well after 15+ years.This is one of my favorite albums from the '80s.

There is a lot of good song writing here and good production, too. There are tempo changes, dynamics, the keyboard sounds are rich without being brassy. The sound is very textured without being cluttered and while polished, does not suffer from the usual excesses from this period. While all the songs are good, best tracks are Sahara & The Broadcast. These guys were definitely a notch above their contemporaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GEM of a CD!","review":"Forget the 80's nostalgia aspect - these are GREAT songs! The melodies & hooks are all there - if you can look past the obvious \\"period-type\\" production, you'll find some awesome pop/rock material. Besides \\"(I Just) Died In Your Arms\\", \\"I've Been in Love Before\\" and \\"One For The Mockingbird\\" still send chills through me - little goosebumps and all! Sure, if you think Limp Bizkit are the Be-All-End-All of songwriters, and nothing else is worth your time, you will probably not appreciate it. However ... speaking as a musician & songwriter myself, this is one cream of the crop CD, not to be missed.

This is the first time I've been really disappointed with a purchase, but these gloves are pretty terrible, even at this price:-One of them is noticeably larger than the other.-Stitching is awful--the interior lining of one glove was never stitched into place, so looks like I'm going to have to fix that myself on a pair of NEW gloves I just purchased.-The dark purple cuffs look like leather--they're not! They're made from cheap, thin fabric. These gloves were assembled using the minimum amount of leather possible, then described as leather work gloves.Spend a little extra and get something better, or spend $5 at the hardware store and get something that you don't expect to last anyway.

I can't believe Martin Millar is not more widely known and loved. Over the last ten years, he has honed his craft, through \\"Milk, Sulphate and Alby Starvation\\", and \\"Lux the Poet\\", to a new high point in \\"Dreams of Sex and Stage Diving\\". Don't be deceived by the surface of nihilism, farce and hard humour. There is a deep thread of optimism here, which steers clear of whimsy.

I don't know anyone who goes to a hospital to celebrate birth, or hangs diapers and rattles on their house on December 25th. I think kids might confuse babyshowers or birthdays with \\"Christmas\\", and eventually parents will have to explain the real meaning anyways.

It is not. The book's conversational, rambling style is easy enough to read, but I found it lacking in the kind of substance that inspires reflection and action. Anecdotes, generalizations, and flowery writing abound. Clarity of purpose does not.As a Catholic Christian, the statement that the Eucharist has such power because \\"it is founded in our food experience\\" and \\"food is powerful\\" finally prompted me to give up on \\"Radical Hospitality.\\" The Eucharist is powerful because it is Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This book made me feel hopeful regarding christianity again.

It's sometimes breathy or semi-whispered, but it's also a deeper, more dynamic, more potent voice than Drake's.It would not be unfair to say that if Drake were still alive he might very well be doing something very similar to what Sylvian is doing here.A must."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant music","review":"If you like real musical creativity, get this CD.

A couple of the other alternake takes are interesting for their slightly different arrangements. Is it all worth 25 dollars? No. RCA strikes again.

First of all, the Memphis Record (1987) was a single disc and didn't include all the songs. Moreover, at the time, the Compact Disc was a newly marketed format and these early discs lacked fidelity due to technicians filtering out the tape hiss which removed the fidelity too. The '87 package was remixed considerably different from the original stereo mixes. Now it sounds like it did originally..the way Elvis wanted it. All the luster has been restored.

I wouldn't suggest reading this book unless there isn't another one within 10 miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"I have always been a Belva Plain fan. I couldn't wait for her books to be published! After having read her latest two: \\"Fortune's Hand\\" and \\"After the Fire\\", I'm disappointed! Both of these books are just not up to her earlier works. I can't put my finger on it: is it the characters, the plots, the writing? They just left me with a blah feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have read all of Belva Plain's novels. This book was so disappointing. The beginning of the story captured my interest but by the middle it became boring. The ending sort of fell off a cliff--it was as tho the author couldn't think of an ending and it sort of abruptly stopped. The characters were stilted and I felt no sympathy for any of them. The main character, Robb, starts off with such high ethical standards and just throws them to the wind. It was so unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises more than it delivers","review":"It was so disappointingly predictable and \\"boilerplate\\". I suppose, afterall, how many different ways can you describe a romance and marriage, with all its many forks in the road. \\"Evergreen\\" was the first Belva Plain book I ever read and it spoiled me for the rest. That book truly captured my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Belva Plains typical wonderful work!","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book, and even then it was an halfhearted attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Belva Plain winner!","review":"Even though the \\"outcome\\" for Robb was somewhat predictible, I really enjoyed the smooth flow of this book. I did, however, wish that more of Lily's life would have been included and followed throughout the story. For awhile I was afraid that she wasn't going to be mentioned until the very end. My thanks to Belva Plain for continuing to write such successful and enjoyable material!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Through struggles- we grow.","review":"Fortune's Hand's, the title speaks for itself, is about the choices you make in life for good or bad and where it takes you. The characters are struggling and dealing with what life has given them through the choices they have made. There are plenty of surprises along the way with one at the end, if known, could have changed Ellen and Robb's relationship for the better. Through their secrets and struggles they grew apart because of the drastic steps they took along the way. In the end Ellen said, \\"after the mistakes, the turmoil, the triumphs, and the joys, if you are left with love, you are left with everything\\", says it all. It is a good read and I enjoyed the entire story. Thank you Belva Plain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Great!","review":"Prehaps I'm a romantic at heart and therefore like the happy ever after endings. Although Robb seems to get everthing he deserves, I still could feel Lily's pain even after the ending. I would have felt that Lily was vindicated if maybe she had had children. This book is very similiar to Plain's Promises. The difference is that the end seems to justify the means more in Promises than in Fortune's Hand. Good read, but the end just leaves somthing missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the book price","review":"I got Fortune's Hand from the library on a whim. I have never read Belva Plain. This book had no action or excitement for me. I did, however, finish it. I am happy that Ellen found her true love in the end. Plain's old titles don't look interesting either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'd like to get my money back on this loser of a story by Belva Plain. One-dimensional characters for whom I felt little empathy were disconnected emotionally except for a last-ditch effort at the end to connect events. Over-acted tragedy after tragedy...I kept with it hoping that it would meet Belva's usually better standard but in the end it was not worth the 'read'. I cannot think of who could be a bad enough actor to take on any of the roles in this if it were a mini-series. Awful, boring cardboard characters. My advice? spend your money on a better book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough character inter action","review":"This book didn't go together well. We meet Lily in the begining but don't get to follow her life in parallel with Robbs. It would have been nice to see some more of her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't dare hope to achieve!","review":"This book was terrible! Small town boy makes good, and boy, does he ever pay! Loving? wife can't accept his ambition and earnings, because this would mean she has to leave her family home, and cut the apron strings to an insulting father. How does she expect to support an extremely handicapped child for the rest of his life? Sorry, I just don't see where Robb was such a bad guy. Another thing that really bugs me about Belva Plain books is that her characters speak as though they are 80 years old and living in the turn of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The title and subtitle promised something this book did not deliver.

This book is not at all good for information to develop creation science in the classroom or any youth class. Very wordy, on and on, all over the place.

During the first use, it worked great then started giving low battery signals. We opened the battery case and found it full of sweat and the battery was rusty. After changing the battery, the rust returned after the first use.My husband contacted the technical department at Oregon Scientific to see if a gasket was missing. Their only advice was to send it back to the dealer for replacement. Future attempts to contact the technical department were ignored.If there is no gasket to keep the battery case waterproof, we believe that a replacement would do the same. This unit will not give satisfactory performance unless the battery case is waterproof. We don't want a replacement if it is like the first unit.My husband enjoyed the radio that came with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is my tree?","review":"I was so excited to receive these seeds and as I have a \\"green thumb\\" I expected to have several little trees for my yard.

It works as advertised as any other Oregon Scientific item does, it just has a fancy paint job.If you are a Ferrari fan, then this is something to throw in the collection, if you just need a stopwatch, there are plenty of others that will do the job.One of the features that I liked most was the interval timer, whereby you are able to set a predetermined interval let say 1 min, and then it would mark the interval with a alarm. You could also set it to beep a count down as the alarm approached. It is very useful for timing the start of a road rally, or as an exercise training tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, rare old hillbilly boogie","review":"Raspy, rattling hardcore hillbilly music from the wartime and postwar era (1939-'53, roughly), from a Brother duo transplanted from the Kentucky hills up into the Great Lakes region. This is urbanized hick music, with strong doses of blues and jazz standars creeping into the mix, classic hillbilly boogie and bop from the years when the \\"new\\" country sound was still up for grabs. These guys had a rough, thoroughly authentic sound -- not polished or slick like the Nashville scene was becoming, and they recorded mainly on tiny independent labels like Mellow and Universal (uh, no, not the same Universal that swallowed up MCA in the 1990s...), although they also did some sessions for Decca which also appear on here. This is rare material that must have taken years of super-collector nerd adventures to gather together, and fills a nice gap in the country music saga. If you like your country crude and enthusiastic, then this is a mighty fine disc for you to check out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I really liked The Stranger in Us. The casting was interesting and the story was something we can all relate to sometime in our life.

It's about some high school football player/ Elvis fan who lived in the same part of the country as Elvis and the impression that Elvis left on him.

Save yourself the money and the aggravation of getting ripped off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best melody","review":"Soul of an Angel alone is worth the price of this CD. Harper without trumpet in quartet format is rare. This is one of the very best Harper melodies. Emotional & spiritual. The Tanksley solo is also outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Harper's best","review":"Billy Harper's best recording is an LP called 'Capra Black' which includes his compostions such as 'Cry of Hunger' and also a mixed choir to very good effect. Harper's unmistakable sound and Coltrane' s power are all there. Unfortunately as is often the case, the people who own the master tapes have no idea of what they've got , and don't release it on CD. In the meantime 'Soul of an Angel' and 'Somalia' are both must haves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Re-recordings Not The Original Versions","review":"The two big hits here, Happiest Girl in the USA and Funny Face, are atrocious re-recordings. I don't know if that is true of all the songs, but I bet they are not the originals either. Some of the other songs on the CD like Do I Love You and That Was Yesterday are ones that I wanted to add to my collection.I wish the Consumers Bureau or somebody could stop these rip-offs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mini-mixer","review":"Well first of all I've done business with Behringer in the past and have NOT been disappointed. Second, it's a christmas present so I won't get a chance to try it out till then. I owned a power mixer that I got through another musician, it was used, but I never had a problem with it, but I ended up having to sell it due to hard times and got a good price for it too. Behringer products are a good investment for the money. I would suggest checking them out first before buying anything else. I've owned alot of equipment in my time, and I'd have to say Behringer has never let me down. I'd consider them 1st before buying anything else. Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This mixer is very affordable and definitely worth the buy. It has 100 presets that all have a purpose and actually exceed the expected quality. 8 channels is just the right amount for anyone new to live sound and its pretty easy to figure out when they provide a diagram of the wiring so you know how each knob affects the others. It's also very nice that they included cd inputs and you can actually apply effects from the mixer to the cd input. I will be using this with my small metal band for practice and local gigs."},{"rating":"1","title":"great mixer with one major flaw","review":"everything about this mixer (and the other xenyx / eurorack mixers) makes it perfect for touring on a budget - - lightweight, inexpensive, and decent sound. the only problem, and i've heard this from so many people who use these mixers, is the power supply. after using my 1202FX for 6 months, on connecting the mixer to power, flames and smoke shoot out of the control room outputs, right above the ac adapter socket. and the power adapters are not availably separately! the logic being that since the mixer is so cheap, just buy an entirely new mixer in order to get a replacement power adapter. and i do. over and over. these mixers are disposable, that's terrible. but they work great! so gamble."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"I received this it was a demo, heck it was brand spanking new, and what a good deal i got.

It's really easy to use, and lets me use several microphones at once, balancing the volume of each. I don't use the many effects that are built in. The basic functions of the mixer are very straightforward. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after less than a year","review":"Considering the price is so cheap on these, I took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. To say that I used it \\"rarely\\" is an understatement - maybe once a month when I have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vDrums and a bass DI through my powered wedges. That said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume ALL the way up.Aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. However, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.Pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when in the first hour or so","review":"The sound is as expected when it's working. However, after about an hour or so of running, the mixer would output distorted noise. It sounds exactly as if the the source volume is too loud and is clipping all the time, only the output volume is actually very low. At first I thought my cables were defective, but no matter how many cables I switch, it works good for awhile then start to have same problem. I didn't start attributing it to the mixer itself until several month later. Now, whenever it does this, all I have to do is cut the power to the mixer and plug it back and problem goes away...for another 30 min - 1 hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Reverb!!!!","review":"Im a pro singer and this has the very worst reverb ive ever had from any equipment.

I hate Blue LEDS, but this is quite easily the brightest one I've got. I wear glasses and I can't even see the board powered on. Not having a power switch is all kinds of suck: Behringer could have put one in. The Effects are kind of novel most are some variant of echo, or channel switching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mixer for Podcasting","review":"I've only had this mixer a short time, but so far I'm loving it. For $100 you can't beat the features. I use it for Podcasting and it seems to have everything I need. I prefer my mixers at an Incline, so I wish it angled toward me, but I can make a stand for that.I also bought a Behringer UFO202 USB Interface to plug in to my computer via USB and the 2 of them work great together. The one thing I noticed was that it comes with 99 effects, but nowhere in the manuals that come with it does it list what each effect is. I did find a PDF online that list them though. Here's the link:[...]I would recommend this mixer if you are Podcasting, doing any home recording or need a mixer for your band to practice with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mixer Great Price","review":"Nice small mixer with good features.The FX feature is good for changing the acoustics for different places you use it.

The packing way below average. As a matter of fact, it was the only outer box without any cushioning. After seeing those UPS and FEDEX delivery videos I would not pack a UPS or FEDEX shipping item in such a poor packing.

Over a decade of photographing the most beautiful places in the state of Oregon culminated in this outstanding work. While Terrill has continued to publish many books, this one is something he will likely never match, simply because this book contained the creme de la creme of his work. With all due respect to the great Ray Atkeson, this is arguably the greatest scenic book ever published on the state. Published in the hey-day of Westcliff's state based themed books, it was a standout then. It's a real shame it's no longer in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting.","review":"I thought it was fun. I loved the scenario! It's a place to write a book, no doubt about it! But I got really scared with everything happening around it! I jumped so many times. The story has a very interesting end and the puzzles are not difficult if you really pay attention. There's a lot to do and the mistery keep you busy all the time. I like games with a good story even odd ones. I liked this one. Hope you enjoy it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so tedious","review":"Don't waste your money or your time. All you are doing in this game is walking around the house and the outlying building clicking on everything about a zillion times. Several times, I had the solution to a puzzle (if you can call them that) and was unable to solve it because I wasn't clicking in the exact right location.

I liked the spooky Victorian atmosphere. But I didn't feel like there was a lot going on in the game. There were some creepy moments but nothing to make you wet your pants.

The game didn't guide you, but left you wandering around alot. We played it through to the end and I wanted to tell you...study the medical clues and the drawings.

I like adventure games when they are not all based on finding the right pixel to click on and when they are not soporific. Unfortunately, this is both. Frankly, it seems as if I'm back in the early '90's playing 7th Guest. The graphics are utterly disappointing, and very, very static. You constantly run into doors that all look the same and most of them are locked. The music is eerie, but so what. It seems there's nothing to do but open drawers, find \\"useless junk\\" or yet \\"another old tarnished candelabrum\\", or not very mysterious clues, or, at best, endless verbose journals that refer to a \\"terror\\" that is \\"almost indescribable.\\" Lots of British accents, some better than others, couldn't keep me awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Castle Tent!","review":"We ordered this tent because our little girls love to dress like Cinderella and Snow White and pretend they are princesses.

Regardless on where one stands on the use of shock collars, invisible fencing, etc., teaching a down-stay to a dog is not rocket science. With this product, the dog is shocked when he ventures away from the bed. This in and of itself is unnecessary and inhumane. But add to that the fact that dogs associate things that happen concurrently, and you've got the makings of much bigger problems than a faulty \\"stay.\\" The dog could easily be looking at, let's say, your child when he gets shocked, thus associating the two. This can set up a dangerous dynamic. Even if the dog is not looking at a particular person when receiving an electronic correction, this type of punishment could easily create fear or aggression issues. PLEASE consider simply training your dog instead of taking this seemingly easy way out.

What's comfortable about electrocution? It will surely cause more problems than it could possibly solve.

A child approaches a dog on this mat and the dog gets up to greet them just as the child reaches for the dog. The dog is \\"statically corrected\\" (otherwise known as being shocked) and associates the shock with the child. The dog can become fearful of, or aggressive towards the child. There are several books and DVDs on Amazon that can safely help you teach a down stay to your dog without punishment. Please consider spending your money on them instead. If you are having problems with your dog, please consider the services of a good, qualified, trainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Product","review":"As a Certified Professional Dog Trainer, I am rendered speechless at the thought of this inhumane product being offered on the market.One of the many problems I see with the product, is that how easily it could cause a dog to become fearful or even aggressive. It is impossible to predict what the dog might associate the shock with and consequently become aggressive or fearful. Perhaps it's the child in the room or another beloved pet.I don't even want to think about the torture that the use and misuse of this product could subject dogs to.Let's give dogs credit for being intelligent creatures.

The two 5.25\\" drives are typically designed to cover the human voice spectum, a practical range between 200 and 4000 Hz. The tweeter, however, is a little week in my opinion. It is a 0.5\\" unit with the crossover set at 5000 Hz. The high frequence signal, as well the low frequence one, should be well handled by the main speakers and the subwoofer. Few people can hear anything below 50 Hz or above 17K Hz. Signals in these spectrum are not directional. This speaker handles enough power in my 18x12 TV room. I am a budget orianted guy. Save the money but buy some meterial to make the room acoustically dead will be much more cost effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great center channel for the price","review":"I bought this to be the center channel in my living room setup. I own the DV-62 for my home theater setup, however, my entertainment center couldn't handle the size of that speaker, so I chose this one instead.I've been very happy with the purchase of this speaker. It made a huge difference over my previous center channel (some KLH model). They say the center channel is one of the most important pieces in your home theater, and this one delivers on that promise.I'd recommend any of the BIC speakers to anyone. I have both in-wall and floor standing models in various setups, and I've been extremely impressed with them, especially when you consider how much cheaper they are than their competitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the tweeter","review":"I didn't like the frequency response at all. This center channel made it very hard to understand certain people talking in movies. It had a huge hole in the frequency response. I temporarily put a cheap bookshelf back and the difference was incredible. I could not see that the speaker was damaged in any way, but maybe it was defective? I know the tweeter was working, but the bass was so high compared to the highs that it was awful.I retured it to Amazon for a refund, and got an Infinity PC350, which is just too big in my opinion, but it sounds great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamster heaven!","review":"I think these three packs of funnels for granchildren's hamster will give \\"Jack\\" a lot more space in which to exercise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT RECIEVE","review":"Did not recieve all the bushings in the\\"SET\\" (In the picture) Just recieved the small bushings.

The rust started to show from the first use even though I followed the care instuctions carefully and watched several videos on the Lodge site and on you tube to make sure i've done the right thing. Seasoned this thing over and over which equates to wasted time because now the Dutch Oven is unusable. This makes me very angry and frustrated because I now have to look for a new one. I tried to get away from the unhealty non-stick pots and also tried to stick to American made healthier products but everytime i used this pot black stuff was all over my food.

So far we have been using it for soups, stews, pot roasts, and even used it to cook a large chicken and it worked great. Also the factory pre-seasoning was great out of box too.

It will outlive you. Pass it down to your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for stews","review":"I like this dutch oven very much. I used it to cook pork roast with onions and apples, and it came out fork tender and delicious. The lid is heavy enough to make sure none of the moisture or juices evaporate while it is in place. It is versatile enough to use on top of the stove for stews and soups, it bakes in the oven for roasts, and it goes on the grill for beans and for anything that you want to impart a smoky flavor. Make sure you follow the directions for curing the pot, and clean up relatively quickly after use. I rub in a little oil after cleaning and I do not store it with the lid on. This traps moisture and leads to rusting on the inside of the pot. After using for a couple of months, it seems built to last a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Pot but Not Really Pre-seasoned","review":"This was the first piece of pre-seasoned cast iron I purchased and I was not thrilled with it. I own 3 cast iron skillets and thought this would be a nice addition. It's a nice sized pot, but the pre-seasoning is awful. Like some others have stated, the inside of the pot is not smooth. This makes it difficult to clean and reseason because it tears tiny bits of paper off of the paper towel and tiny fibers off of a fabric dish towel. I used it on Thanksgiving to make candied sweet potatoes and although they didn't stick, they smelled of metal while cooking and tasted like metal as well. Also, the condensation on the lid created rust. If this were available in natural cast iron instead of pre-seasoned, it would be great. I have since bought another in the enameled cast iron and use it almost daily. You get the same even heat but without having to season - and the food doesn't stick either (unless you burn it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust","review":"I know Lodge makes quality products but my dutch oven lid started to rust very quickly.

The pot arrived quickly (bless you Amazon!)and I was able to use it to make a \\"little or no knead\\" bread recipe I'd been wanting to try. Works exactly like all cast iron pots. Perfectly. I did season it when it arrived, only because I wanted to make sure, but it certainly was nice and black - exactly how a well-seasoned cast iron pot should look.

Since becoming the proud owner of this Lodge item, I find I turn to it for things I used to use our 3QT pot for more and more often. It has a wider bottom than a typical pot, and more surface area translates directly into more even and perhaps faster cooking.

Since you don't cook on the lid you must care for it accordingly. If you use the lid at all during braising, stewing, etc..it will collect water on the lid and you have to make sure you dry it off ( I even heat it a little on my stove top) and coat it with oil before putting it away. I stopped doing that and the lid very quickly got a lot of rust, but I cleaned and seasoned it and it looks great once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy","review":"This pot is very heavy, takes a lot of effort to lift (especially with a sore shoulder). Because of the spiked lid and porous interior, cleaning it is a chore and it blackened my spongeI recently discovered the joy of braising and thought a dutch oven would be more versatile than a brasier. My biggest gripe, this lid does not sit flushed on the pot so that both times I used the pot, (recipes had no more than 2 cups of liquid) the liquid 'steamed' out and left a mess all over my stove.I will use it because it was a gift and I appreciate the giver's good intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product.","review":"I have used my Lodge Logic L8DOL3 Pre-Seasoned 5-Quart Dutch Oven about a dozen times since I purchased it earlier this summer. Each use of this dutch oven has given me excellent cooking. Although I thought it's pre-seasoning was adequate I did season it again before it's 1st cooking. It's heating distrubution is excellent and this duth oven, although somewhat heavy due to it's cast iron, I am able to move it about rather easily, compared to my 7 quart dutch oven.

The unit is a fine basic dependable iron cooking vessel, good for baking, stews, and whatever you want.

His acidic wit and poignant prose is fueled here by his recent detox visit to the Betty Ford Center and his newfound kinship with REM, who backed him on this release(and also recorded with him as the HINDU LOVE GODS). Getting clean and sober never rocked so good as it does here. Zevon's smokey baritone voice is in top form, the production is supreme and there are contributions from the usual suspects (Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Brian Setzer, George Clinton)"},{"rating":"2","title":"modern society: so technological","review":"This CD is so astute in reflecting the kind of changes that people are expected to adjust to that it took me many years to realize that Warren Zevon was telling me things better than anyone else could. I did not think the music was what made me like songs like \\"Trouble Waiting to Happen,\\" but the music is good enough to make me feel like I woke up this morning and I fell out of bed if anyone asks about me. It takes talent to get things stuck in my mind like Sentimental Hygiene, which was not a way that people I knew thought about relationships. When I was going to church in Minneapolis, bringing up Sentimental Hygiene's line about driving up and down the boulevard was something which made people think I was crazier than they were. It took a shrink to convince me that, sure enough, sentimental hygiene was a major reason those people wanted me to get fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Majestic album","review":"Rooting through my dad's record collection I stumbled across this asolute gem of an album.

But I've also found that if you listen well, his music will reward you with its (often hidden) beauty. This is borne out by this album. The a capella singing group the Persuasions, of whom Frank Zappa (along with his wife, Gail) was an early admirerer and booster. This is album is evidently both a thank you to the Zappas and a tribute to Frank's music.That the Persuasions could sing some very tricky music in their own way and make seem so effortless should be evidence enough of their talent. Standouts are \\"Anyway the Wind Blows\\", \\"The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing\\", \\"Hotplate Heaven at the Green Hotel\\", and \\"You Are What You Is.\\" Their rendition of \\"Lumpy Gravy\\" is alone worth the price of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember when ...","review":"What a great piece of work.

In combination with the small JVC satellite speakers I have around the room (6.1 setup), I've really gotten that 'movie theater' sound. My only complaint, (and it's a small one) is that the sub's auto on/off feature will occasionally turn the sub off during long segments of time with no bass, such as a part of a movie or video game that's just dialogue with no music or SFX.

The majority of the book is the ranting opinion of an individual who certainly appears to have the best interest of Blacks in America at heart. However, his opinions are unsubstantiated (i.e., little, if any, evidence) and, to me, at times come of offensively sexist. I find that the author's opinions actually foster the very divisiveness that he apparently wishes to combat.I plan to look for another version of Willie Lynch's letter either: 1) without \\"off the wall\\" editorializing or 2) with analysis which is at least more sophisticated (e.g, substantiated with evidence) and less sexist/divisive than that offered by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO THY SELF - THE RESURRECTION","review":"MR.ALVIN MORROW GIVES INSIGHT, THAT AFRICANS IN AMERICA HAVE BEEN TAUGHT TO BE \\"BLACK-EUROPEANS WITH A EUROPEAN CONSCIOUSNESS\\", TAUGHT THROUGH THE EUROPEAN TEACHING OF CHRISTIANITY, THE EUROPEAN TEACHING OF HIS-STORY, EUROPEAN ILL-MORAL BEHAVIOR, ECT.

By the time we were two-thirds through the book, many of my students were beginning to doubt the validity of the characters.

I believe I've read all but two of his books and I've loved them all (Lamb and a Dirty Job are my favorites) but this book just didn't seem up to the standard of his other work. I felt it was very very slow to start and even once it go up to speed just wasn't that interesting a story. I love reading Moore b/c he rights the kind of books that have me laughing out loud as I read and I just didn't feel this book was all that funny.

This story was very different for subject, but still the same Christopher Moore. Wacky characters mixed in with the allegedly sane, adventures, sort of a good vs. evil - themes I've seen in all his books. I enjoyed how the story and the main character came full circle as well. It's a fun tale full of it's share of surpasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not compare this guy to Tom Robbins or Kurt Vonnegut","review":"I picked up this book because I've heard Christopher Moore compared to Tom Robbins and Kurt Vonnegut. Tom Robbins is one of my favorite authors and I think Vonnegut is alright too...All I want to say is that, in my opinion, it's insulting to Robbins and Vonnegut for Christopher Moore to be lumped into their, um, genera. If you're a Robbins fan, make sure to read some of this book at the bookstore before you buy it to make sure you're not wasting your money... One thought, check out \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang,\\" I recently read it and liked it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly amused.","review":"I have to admit that despite my love for A Dirty Job, I'm not a big fan of Moore's earlier works. Not only are some characters reused (which I don't really have a problem with -- nothing wrong with recurring characters!), he uses some of the same stereotypes in every book, it seems. There's always a mostly-high surfer dude. There's always a cantankerous (and probably homely) old lady. And of course, the earnest (if sometimes misguided) main character. I think what really rubbed me wrong in this book was Coyote himself. I know he is supposed to be a \\"trickster\\" spirit, but I found him more mean-spirited than anything. Especially when he steals Sam's car, sells it, and gambles away his bank account. I think you're supposed to find his naivet�� endearing, but I didn't.

Boy was I suprised and a bit embarissed. The movie was french with subtitles and loaded with lots of full frontal nudity of both men and women and it had lots of sex scenes and it was quite violent. The movie is about a group of Anarcists that kidnap the rich daughter of a politician and then torture and brainwash her to think for herself, pretty much everyone gets killed at the end. Not something i should have watched at 17 with my uber conservative girlfriend, my brother thought it was hilarious, his exact words. \\"Gee, nice flick Jor, you picked a real winner.\\" I get laugh out of it looking back on it all.

Right from the start the album just oozes cool, smooth melodies humming over stylish breakbeats. Beaucoup Fish is is the same vein as Second Hardest In The Infants, but at the same time it's a radical departure from anything they've done before. This is a fine album of Underworld, and they deserve recognition!

I needed something for the car, but this just made me want to drive off the nearest cliff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Underworld lovers...","review":"...but I really did not like this album. Yes...it is my opinion and I respect yours, blah blah, but I must have my say.I bought this CD on an impulse buy once, because of one or two songs (I think maybe 'Cups', or 'Jumbo') but the rest of the CD just pissed me off to no end...People talk about the complexity in the music...what complexity? It is just loops and loops with variations so conservative, one wonders if the musical complexity did exist on this album. As Richard D. James (Aphex Twin) put it so perfectly, Underworld is \\"watered-down music.\\" Especially this album.If you want complexity, musical genius, and pure, unabashed originality, then check out the man above, Aphex Twin. But it is not for the faint of heart...so maybe you Underworld fans should stay away :POf course, if this is your kind of thing...fine by me! But really, musical complexity? On THIS album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious and Addictive","review":"I found Beaucoup Fish significantly different from what I'd heard from Underworld beforehand (mostly just the Pearl's Girl album and that song from trainspotting). But that's a good thing! The more I've listened, the more I've wanted to go back in and examine every individual song in depth. Nearly every track has its own distinguishing bit of uniqueness, both from the rest of the CD and from everything else out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not as good as the other 2 albums.","review":"So, I was beginning to wonder why it was taking Underworld so long to release an album. I thought it was because they were doing their best to make this one another masterpiece. Spending tons of time in the studio to make it perfect. Turns out they just didn't have enough good stuff on this one. \\"Cups\\" is absolutely great. Wonderful beginning song, though not as good as STITI's \\"Juanita/Kiteless/To Dream of Love\\". Then, we go right in to \\"Push Upstairs\\". I like the beat, but the vocals drive me nuts. Not to mention track 9 \\"Push Downstairs\\", which is the same song with a slower, and much less interesting beat. \\"Jumbo\\" \\"Kittens\\" \\"Shudder/King of Snake\\" \\"Moaner\\" \\"Bruce Lee\\" I think are all great. The rest of the album turns me off a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Tracks 1 and 3 Alone","review":"This was the first Underworld CD I bought -- I like a wide range of music, but don't go too deep with \\"electronica\\"/\\"techno\\". But out of the ones I do have (Chemical Bros, Fat Boy, Orbital, Wiseguys) this one has a depth that goes beyond the others. The music has so many layers that I really have not gotten tired of it - esp. tracks 1 and 3. As someone else said in a review of another of their CDs, even their longer songs don't seem long -- I can't think of any other group I could actually enjoy listening to an 11 minute song from. Although its in a different style, I think fans of the Beastie's \\"Hello Nasty\\" would like this as well as they share some similarities in my view: great beats, good melodic hooks, and clever arrangement to create a really rich piece of music that you won't easily tire of compared to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"if I could give 6 stars, I would","review":"this cd rocks, that is all there is to it. Moaner takes you to another level, I reccomend loud, bass booming listening. And dancing, lots and lots of dancing. Kittens is another track that sticks out in my mind. This is a sound few have or will ever hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but damned good.","review":"One review I saw in the media stated that \\"as an artefact, Beaucoup Fish is designed to eerie perfection\\". I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment--there's something strangely beautiful about the songs on this and the album on the whole. The thing is, Underworld is best when they just let it all hang out, as in the Pearl's Girl EP, and don't get caught up spending the time to make something perfect. Some straight, hard techno is what is called for."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"dubnobasswithmyheadman is one of my all-time favorite albums. Their early music was so soothing and original, no other band has so successfully pulled off what dubnobass did. I truly commend Underworld for creating such beautiful music. Sadly, Underworld has gone down from there. This album features immature beats with uninspired synth. Their calming songs are not calming, and their hard songs are repititious at best. In dubnobass, the vocals were musical instruments in themselves, giving their songs a unique feel. In Fish, the vocals are completely ridiculous and just distract from the already drab music. If you loved their early stuff, then I doubt you will like this, so be cautious. A couple good tracks, but not worth the money. Maybe buy it used but I would not suggest ordering it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"From the first time i heard Jumbos pulsing baseline, i was hooked on Beaucoup fish. I will say with utmost comfidence that this is underworlds best album over Dubnobass and Second Toughest.Songs such as Cups, Jumbo, King of Snake, Bruce Lee and Push Upstairs still fascinate me as i marvel at the expert progression and song crafting that Emerson and crew unleashed with this album. I highly reccomend this to all lovers of electronic music and i can assure you there is no way you can be unsatisfied with this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The equivalent of a modern day opera...","review":"i was afraid the anticipation for this album would be its downfall. but underworld seems to ignore all the pressure and put out their most listener friendly album yet. after their performance on the DARK & LONG album, i wasnt sure these guys could top that sort of \\"take you in and make you part of the music\\" feel. however, B. Fish does just that. hyde, emerson, & smith break free of the underworld machine on this album to become actual \\"musicians\\".. a pleasant experience indeed...."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the finer electronic albums","review":"sometimes you just don't have to ask questions to buy a record. for me, UNDERWORLD provides that luxury. after hearing many reviews (including one from alex patterson from the ORB describing the album as \\"...one of the best i've heard\\") calling the album one of the greatest, i had to have it. i also didn't think that it could live up to all the hype, but i was wrong. how else can i describe it other than five stars? it is a fine collection of songs with an extremely broad range of sounds. no clear single stands out on the album, but it is truly incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody has forgotten.....(read to find out)","review":"Beacoup fish is awesome, i think im going to check out born slippy thing everybody's talking about, but otherwise i have to say moaner is the most amazing techno ive heard in a while, you cant survive that song without a reaction, i strongly recommend orbital #2 to everyone on here, more techno-ey, great album, beacoup fish is solid though, i have picky taste, and im not one of those people thats only into techno, my taste stretch from korn to billy joel, this is solid music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I listened to 'toughest in the infants' everyday for a month but there are only 2 tracks on this one that I like.

But know you're buying one song. : \\"eruptions of ecstatic melody\\"?? pleeze! did someone throw up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this album. It's a sad ghost of the genius of Underworld's previous efforts - mildly interesting at best, housey and grating at worst. I listened to it with clenched teeth the first couple times and put it away - it's not the kind of album that'll grow on you. Do yourself a favor and go buy Second Toughest in the Infants or one of their singles instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one CD that will grow on you.","review":"This was recommened to me by a friend who shares similar interests so my expectations were high. I was disappointed at first but now that I've listened to it for a while I'd have to say this is one of my best CD buys in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I didn't think that they would be able to do justice to another album after Second Toughest, but they did! Even better was the concert they put on at St. Andrew's Hall in Detroit, MI. A sold out show for about 500 people...unbelievable that they would grace us with this surprise performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beaucoup will Blow Your Mind!!!","review":"Underworld has done it again and continues to reinvent their music and themselves in this karmic and translucent album, Beaucoup Fish. They continue to explore a variation of sounds and melodies that blend techno, electronica, and jazz all into one. The tracks \\"Jumbo\\" and \\"Pushin Upstairs\\" are ones to check out for sure. And if you ever have a chance to catch them live, DO IT!! Believe Me, once you walk in, you will walk out a die hard fan!! This is a great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking new ground.","review":"Why, when artists move progressively into the future, do their audiences insist on keeping them in the little boxes they put them in when first discovering them? Miles Davis fought against this annoyance for the entire course of his career, but in spite of the critics' attacks, kept forging ahead, consistently breaking new ground.Beaucoup Fish is not Dubno. Nor is it Born Slippy or Second Toughest In The Infants, although it still sounds like Underworld. Opinions are like belly buttons - everybody's got one. It is my opinion that Beaucoup Fish is a total masterpiece and has given me even more hope in the future of electronic music. I've searched the internet for reviews on the album and everone's whining, \\"Well, it's o.k., but it's not 'Dubno'\\". Wake up people. True artists never look back and wouldn't be caught dead repeating themselves. As far as the few negative customer reviews on this page go, it doesn't take long to realize that they're severely out-numbered."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 killer cuts, the rest is forgettable.","review":"The 2 standouts cuts are Cups and Jumbo, which quite fankly are the best things you'll hear all year.

But overall, this CD is ok. Definatelly reccomended for all techno lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"In a couple of my previous comments i said some pretty unflattering things about Underworld (the words \\"annoying\\" and \\"boring\\" come to mind). Now I would like to take this opportunity to take back everything negative that I have ever said about them. right now they are one of my favorite techno bands. One reason why I hated them before has to do with my previous expectations of their music. Initially I expected them to be like Prodigy and the Crystal Method (those were the only techno groups I knew at the time). Of course I was disappointed at first. only after exposing myself to a lot of trance and house did I realize how good their music truly is; it is very subtle and hypnotic. Half the songs on this CD are very relaxing (Jumbo, Cups, Winjer, etc.)while some of the others have insane amount of energy (Moaner, Push upstairs,Kittens, Bruce Lee). Perhaps this album is not for everyone but it is amazing nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best!","review":"This is one of those albums that keeps getting better each time you listen to it, however, it still lacks the imagination that Underworld's earlier albums contain. IF you loved this album check out Secound Toughest in the Infants, Pearl's Girl Maxi -Single, Dubnobasswithmyheadman, and Underneath the Radar, you'll really be impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still pretty much for the electronica fans","review":"This album is just good enough for you to try to convert your friends to the sounds of electronica (which I love without understanding why). Kittens, Shudder/King of Snake and Push Upstairs will energize you (and your party), while the rest are somewhat easier listening for the most part. (Which reminds me- Does anyone know where I could find a good electronica girl to enjoy this stuff with? I'm at school in the middle of nowhere and everyone here seems to be an R&B head, including my sometime-girlfriend, which I don't mind, but my heart is in this stuff...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A STRONG ALBUM BUT NOT THE BEST...","review":"I EXPECTED MORE THAN JUST FOUR OUTSTANDING SONGS/KING OF SNAKE...YEAH.../ I LOVE UNDERWORLD EVER SINCE DUBNOBASS...HOWEVER THIS ALBUM IS TOO EXPERIMENTAL AND NOT AS SEXY AS THE REST.

Not a patch on their earlier efforts but still worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't be disappointed - but won't be over-thrilled, either.","review":"I expect any music from Underworld to be one of the best in it's class. Yet, don't expect any \\"Born Slippies\\" on this album. While there are many strong tracks, there are no anthems (see, that's how highly I think of Underworld, to expect anthems out of these guys). \\"Push Upstairs,\\" the first single (Track #2) was a letdown for me - nothing more than some layered beats and piano drumming. \\"King of Snake\\" (Track 4) may be the best track.. the spoken word vocals really mesh with the beats here. All in all, not too bad - but really could be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Person who has the CD","review":"This album is not so good in my opinion, Jumbo is the only song you really would want to listen to more than once.

There are some good grooves, and some nice bits, and it's certainly better than most other stuff out there, but it cannot even hold a candle to the other two Underworld albums. None of the beauty and transcendance is there, the songs are not as good. It seems like these guys just ran out of steam. Oh well, that doesn't take away from the fact that they made two of the most beautiful and important electronic-dance-music albums of the 90's. Two out of three ain't bad i guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beats","review":"This c.d has the best beats out of any underworld c.d I've ever listened to. This is one of thier best but I wouldn't recommend it to a first time listener because some of the songs are pretty abstract.

Landis' ability to develop his characters' feelings, personality, and thoughts throughout this book is most remarkable, especially with the lead character Judy. Though this book appeals more to young females it shouldn't be classified as a musician's book, even though it uses music as more than just a backdrop, it deals with the complexities of ones emotions and how people deal with pain, love, and anger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Sail","review":"This is an excellent product.

I had hoped Loparex's Easy Mask would solve the paint removal dilemma. It has not. The Easy Mask results mirror those of 3M's blue painter's tape.

Perhaps your doctor can refer you to a group or something else that could be helpful to you.The author here is just content to rant about how some people believe that breastfeeding should become the recommended form of feeding infants (which incidentally seems supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization) and that makes some mothers who can't (or who don't want to) breastfeed feel guilty.I honestly feel sorry for mothers who CAN'T breastfeed....a group that the author seeks to make larger for some strange reason......but why attack those who do?

(I've spent years working and exploring other countries and continents.) I was surprised to read later in life that Richard Haliburton was gay, but whatever.

I cant wait until i get paid so i can buy it.If you are a big Kelis fan like me you will love this cd to pass up this for your music collection.I cant ever give over the fact that Kelis isnt as popular as some of the rnb singers today.But i know she is the best, and so is AALIYAH.PS:go to www.ULTIMATEKELIS.com and support Kelis!!!!!you can watch her rare music videos,listen to all her songs and download photos, and AIM icons too...........thank u"},{"rating":"2","title":"a breath of fresh air!","review":"Kelis' new CD Wanderland + bonus track is something new. it's fun. the songwriting is great. her sound is something new. no doubt appears on this record, and so do a few others who compliment Kelis very well. My favorite songs are:Shooting Stars - this song is just pure soul - amazing.I Don't Care (which is the last hidden track on the CD) - a Jimi Hendrix vibe is going on in this song, it's the \\"Just Dont Give a F-\\" of the CDthis c.d. has an overall space/carnival/fantasy vibe to it. i predict this CD will amaze many music fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"bestCDever!!!","review":"I found this one in Vancouver today, and I was shocked to find it cuz like a year ago I tried to order it and I couldn't get it. Eventually I downloaded it but it was so worth buying!The best has to be Scared Money cuz it makes me think of heaven. It's so peaceful!, and the lyrics in that one are amazing. I also really like Daddy, Young, Fresh n' New, Shooting Stars, Digital World, Easy Come Easy Go, Get Even, Mr. U.F.O. Man, Little Suzie and the first hidden bonus track.Man I have a lot of bloody favourites! The rest are great to. I know that a lot of people would disagree with me and think that this CD is not that good, so I don't think this is for everybody, but if you're a big fan of the neptunes then you absolutely have to get this cuz that's what makes this CD what it is. That's why I got it. I only recommend this to neptunes fans cuz even if you like it regardless of being a fan of the neptunes, you can never truly like this product unless you love the neptunes!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW Kelis single - Milk Shake","review":"This is a great song, it has a catchy dance beat, great and very strange lyrics, and its produced by The Neptues (AKA N.E.R.D.), what more can you ask for? Well, I'll start off by saying that I've been hooked on Kelis ever since I heard \\"Caught Out There\\" and \\"Good Stuff\\", but I REALLY like her now that she has more \\"dancy\\" beats! This song is incredible! Oh, and this song isn't off the WANDERLAND album, I think its off of a new one that's still in the process of being made! And, also, there is another single called \\"Popular Thug\\" which is listed on this album, but the one I'm talking about has Nas rapping most of it, so I dunno if it's the original or not - but if you own the album and want 2 compair, visit www.mp3sfinder.com and download both of these HOT singles b4 they r removed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!!","review":"When I heard her first single \\"Caught Out There\\" I bought the album right away, it was great, I was surprised Kelis wasn't very popular.

I was wrong by a long shot. This is one of those albums that you could listen to over and over and over again and still want to hear it some more. My husband and I actually fight over who gets to put it in their car. We are considering buying a second copy!!! Kelis has definitely matured on this album, bravely exploring topics such as religion. Though I love all of the tracks, my favorites include Popular Thug, Scared Money, Shooting Stars, and Mr. U.F.O. Man. I do not understand why Kelis is not one of the top artist here in the United States. I hope that her time is coming!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Myth-Breaking Work","review":"Richard Middleton convincingly argues in this well written book that the influence of Pitt during the war has been hyped. Pitt showed no system for winning the war and his descents on the French coast were political expedients to avoid sending troops to Germany. Pitt was not Prime Minister as the office did not exist. Instead he worked as one of two secretaries of state, who, along with the Treasury, made up the ministry. The book focuses on the politics and administration of the war, and not on the battles and campaigns themselves. Interestingly, the author shows how historians before the early 1900s were sloppy, and how modern historians often rely on their work without doing their own proper investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starting point and explains material well.","review":"As a network administrator I have to deal with Cisco documentation all day.

It is obviously about the tragic relationship between Peter the Great and his son Alexis. The main plot is alternated with a subplot about religious fanatics who see it as their duty to burn themselves up, although they have a hard time working up the courage to do it. The world of St Petersburg in its earliest days is brought vividly to life. One sympathizes with the hapless Alexis, who flees to Italy, only to be lured back to his doom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak structure","review":"Although I very much like the LOOK of the ring, unfortunately in less than a week, the ring began to lose its shape because of the gap between the heads.

It does exactly what they say. It quickly displays the temperature and is great for scanning a surface looking for temperature variation. Wife is not pleased that I have tested the temp on everything I could find for the 1st day we had it. But then found it useful in pointing out where the air leaks are in our kitchen so I can go put more insulation under the house!I am very pleased and would recommend it to anyone. Only warning is read the directions. There appears to be variation on the temp accuracy depending on how far away from the target.

She should stick to acting. Even though I don't really like her movies such as Mean Girls, she at least can act pretty well. And she's not a good role model for pre-teens and teens...just look at her dancing! Lindsay Lohan obviously wants to be noticed, and if she's not careful she will become known the same way Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson are known. They are all three not role models that should be looked up to. Don't waste your money on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paris Hilton rubbed off on you...","review":"And that is not good.

I've only heard two songs and do not want to hear a third...From the cheesy cover of the CD to the whiney voice,proves that singing is not one of Lindsay's talents. What will she try next?

She fits in with all of thoes wannabes also known as Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson and many others. What has happened to good music?

I WAS SHOCKED that the rest of the album is NOTHING LIKE 'rumours' but sounds like a pathetic copy of Hilary duff's latest album 'fly'.

I'm not ashamed to say, I know this album well. Lindsay Lohan's first is a very harmless pop outing - girly and joyful with equal measure of ballads and \\"fun\\" tunes. Chances are it won't win anyone over, and the bland mix won't rise above the sea of poppy hits in any big way, but if you're not \\"above\\" some easily digested all-female pop-rock stuff, you might even find a few of the songs catchy. I especially fell for Lindsay's raspy club-sound, but unfortunately there's not much of that around on this album, so don't expect her rising to the ranks of say, Rihanna or Lady Gaga (yet?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an OK album","review":"Yeah, at first my best friend said that this was a really good album! So I decided to buy it. When I first heard it, I was like, this is what I bought? I was a little dissapointed. I thought she would be better than this. It's like, the album you listen to once or twice, then you're done with it. You can DEFINATLY tell she smokes. Her voice is pitchy. VERY pitchy. Sometimes, the notes she doesn't really hit, and it sounds awful. I would rather listen to William Hung."},{"rating":"1","title":"you've got to be kidding.....","review":"I am so sick and tired of actresses thinking they can sing. Just because you've been in a movie or two doesn't mean you have to run to the nearest recording studio and release a crap cd. First JLO, then Hilary Duff, now this garbage? These songs are nothing special and neither is this cd.As for the song \\"Rumors\\", Lindsay needs to quit complaining. There are worst things happening in this world than what magazines are saying about her. Most people have lives to live and really dont give a crap who she's dating or what she's doing anyway.

She didn;t even lip-synch right. WTF?!!? Hilary Duff is 100 times better than Lohan.

Please tell me that it's \\"Over.\\" This poor girl is tone deaf. She wouldn't make it past Simon on American Idol on her best day. So if anyone has done anything good, it's the producers who managed to make her sound even remotely on key. Now we know why she's always begging off live performances, claiming she's not feeling well. Even when she does perform, she keeps saying she has laryngitis. Sorry Lindsay -- you just have a BAD VOICE!! Bottom line: If you want to listen to overproduced, shallow, meaningless, forgettable pop that isn't even sung well, this is the album for you. Because being a cutesy poo actress under 20 does not qualify you to become a singer -- it doesn't even qualify you to become a pop star. Good grief, but Mandy Moore and Jennifer Lopez are starting to look like huge talents compared to this pop-tart du jour.

The lyrics are boring and the content seems to be up to the writing standard of a 12 year old. The album's lead single \\"Rumors\\" is just Lindsay Lohan complaining for three and half minutes about how she can't go anywhere without the media watching.Her voice isn't anything extraordinary either. In fact, it's terrible. She has no vocal range at all and the only reason she stays relatively in tune is because of \\"studio magic\\".I'm not one to usually complain about the quality of an album but I had a really hard time trying to listen to this one all the way through without falling asleep.Do yourself a favor.

As you listen to the album it becomes very evident that a ton of producers/engineers worked on Lindseys vocals to make her sound lukewarm decent enough! Overall, I have to give the producers and engineers a lot more credit because they were barely able to do the impossible, which was to get a complete album out of what I find to be one of the biggest insults to real musicians everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Disc Space","review":"I have to admit, pop music can be decent sometimes...Britney Spears' first album was annoying, but it wasn't THAT bad, an Jessica Simpson actually has a pretty good voice. But after hearing this CD on my younger sister's friend's CD player, I may have changed my mind. Just about every song sounds the same, and the lyrics aren't well thought out at all...Lindsay Lohan should have stuck with acting, first of all, because that's what she's good at. She's too young to be singing Christina Aguliera-esque songs, yet she does anyway.I'm not going to waste my time and energy by typing a review of the songs on the CD. All I can say is this album is musical trash. Don't buy it for yourself, don't buy it for your kids. People are always saying that we need to conserve our resources, so why not save a few trees and stop manufacturing this CD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Lohan is a very impressive, upcoming actress who shows considerable promise on the big screen.On the other hand, Lohan has such a sub par voice it makes me question the validity and common sense of the record company's decision to invest in her singing abilities. It's crazy to watch industry newcomers believe that actors/singers can easily make the transition from one stage to another if success is found in the first arena. 99% of the time, it fails, and Lohan is another classic example of this. Her CD is terrible, and subsequent videos are really bizarre (who is this fake blond?)Here's to vain wishing that Lohan will realize her error and never produce another album again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this cd....","review":"listnen to me this is a stupid cd the only good song on it is rumors but then agian the lyrics are simple and her vocals are bad...So i guess there are no highlights on this cd..and please buy cds like good charlotte,evanescene,green day,."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"For the love of all that is good and holy, do NOT buy this CD!

The only reason she is singing is because everyone TALENTED is singing.She should consider to sing about different things rather than boys, dumping boys and loving boys. She should really watch Hilary Duff and Kelly Clarkson for some advise unless shes made enemies with them and everyone else in the music industry.Stop singing, i dont understand how she cant realise that shes a bad singer. Her songs aint making it on the charts in Australia or the US. Doesnt that give you a hint!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be singing?","review":"I don't mean to be mean, but Lindsey Lohan cannot sing. I used to be a fan of her movies, but she's gone sour with bad movies such as mean girls and too seductive dance moves. The only reason she got a recording contract is because she's an actress. My cat could probably meow \\"Jingle Bells\\" better than she can sing. If you'd like to listen to a good CD, try Jump5, Hilary Duff, Diana Degarmo, Carrie Underwood, or Third Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A much less talented version of Hilary Duff","review":"Some people should just NOT produce an album. . . . Lindsay Lohan is one of those people. She should really stick to acting. She can't sing. The best part of her songs are the instruments. Her songs are catchy, but not good, and rather annoying. I only like 2 songs on the other album, the rest annoy me. Honestly, Lindsay, stick to acting!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsay has spoken, I'm glad I can listen.","review":"I had no idea that Lindsay had talent in the musical field until I saw her on Freaky Friday. I was impressed, so I decided to give her debut CD a whirl. I'm surprised at the reviews here. I find the CD to be listenable. Not only does Lindsay make a mark as an actress, she also makes a mark here. I knew the comparisons to Hilary Duff and others would be inevitable. Rumors is not the only good track on here, I also love and recommend To Know Your Name and Something I Never Had. I'm glad that I listened to this CD because I would have been missing out on some great material. I would also like to say that I'm in my mid 20's and I happen to enjoy this, so this doesn't appeal to just the younger generations. If you enjoy pop music, I would definitely suggest this.

John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi wrote all of the songs, Ashlee Simpson did more effort in writing than Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay did co-write four songs, but that's barely any effort whatsoever. Lindsay doesn't sing either, it's all enchanced.

Yes, my parents had \\"teenyboppers\\" too, but people still listen to the Beatles...will people listen to this 50 years from now? Lindsey obviously is not doing this for the money- she just wants to inflate her ego, and obviously her record company just wants to cash in, irregardless that they are helping suck the creativity out of music.

She is not originally a recording artists, as most of the world knows due to the fact that she began through movies (The Parent Trap to Mean Girls), so she is definitely not banking in solely on her voice, which CAN carry a melody just fine, though she fails to truly pull it off as her own. Half of the lyrics speak a sortof complainy \\"I'm a celebrity, leave me alone\\" tone, with Rumors most clearly spelling it out. Lindsay's other songs dictate the normal teenage gooshy love spirits as most albums from 18-year-olds do. For now, until Lindsay discovers her own voice, America must understand that she is just banking in on her celebrity.I have confidence in her to do better next time.

Same goes w/ being a role model. She totally lip synices (sp). She was caught but they did a cover up. Also you cant even reconize her voice in this.

Worst cd Ever DONT BUY IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsay Speaks up, and makes a noise","review":"With so many teen pop singers out there, it's difficult not to label each as a knock off of the other. Now that Lindsay Lohan is thrown into the mix, one wonders what she might sound like an imitation of, however, this \\"Mean Girl\\" proves that her sound is all her own. \\"Speak\\" may not be anything revolutionary, definitely not a classic by any means, but no one can deny it as a fairly creative, pop, party album. Songs like \\"Nobody Til' You\\", \\"Magnet\\" and \\"Rumors\\" rock the house. \\"Symptoms Of You\\", \\"Very Last Moment in Time\\" and \\"Over\\" show some more depth. However Lindsay truly shines with originality on the mid-tempo 80's sound of \\"To Know Your Name\\". If you what you want is an easy listening pop album, skip over Hilary, get Lindsay Lohan's \\"Speak\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE, LINDSAY, GET JAZZY AND NEPTUNES ON NEXT CD PLEASE!","review":"(...)PLEASE PEOPLE SAVE YOUR MONEY!

She sound like Ashlee Simpson on crack. Lindsay, news flash: JUST BECAUSE YOU ACT, DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN SING!! That's how RUMORS get started (to cone a phrase).

Please Lindsay shut up, and go jump off a bridge. Her beauty is all covered with tons of make up and plastic. Please, Lindsay go back home and live with your parents and take some voice lessons.

John Shanks's production was good, but it did not save Lindsay's very weak voice. She sequels in her songs too often, it sounds like she's using voice enchancing all the time.

Not only does Lindsay Lohan's irritating voice make me want to shoot my foot, these songs are kinda bad. Well,crap to be honest. Most of the lyrics don't make sense and is it just me or do all these songs kinda sound the same? Yeah, probably, because they've all come from the same manufactured sound studio where you don't have to actually have a strong or even pleasant voice to churn out any crap you please.Now back to Lohan's voice. It's not only not powerful, listening to it for a while I realised it is actually annoying. And I mean real annoying.

One way is that her voice has a very bad sound, she sometimes sounds like a robot's voice instead of hers. I can't figure out who told her she had a good voice but she doesn't. \\"Rumors\\" was put on \\"NOW 18\\" and I'm sorry it did because it shouldn't have been.

Its bad enough your a actress turned singer, but at least put some more originality into your songs. The best song is the hit Rumors which is a amazing track and is sort of J.Lo-Esque But Still.

It's all Lindsay trying to be a rocker... think: All of Ashlee Simpson's Reject songs. The lyrics are awful and have no feeling behind them. One song the chorus actualy says \\"I'm not ill, I don't need to take a pill\\" as if that is brilliant.. and that's the chorus that repeats over and over.... What?!

I like her movies, but after her recent change in clothes and such, I'm starting to like her even less and this album takes the cake. The one thing I hate about this album and Lindsay is the fact that she thinks she can sing with a real band, I'm Sorry but she can't. She doesn't have the voice for something like that, whereas other artists (like Diana Degarmo) Totally have the voice for it and can back it up. However, Lindsay can't, and tracks such as Nobody Till' You and Very Last Moment in Time show this clearly. Do yourself a favor, dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm...DON'T speak","review":"Well, this is just another fine example of what's wrong w/ the music biz. Teenage actresses, who posess no vocal range (let alone talent) are making hit albums. EEEKKK! Lindsay's singing is so monotone, just like Hilary Duff. Unlike all the Hilary Duffs and Ashlee Simpsons, Lindsay is a VERY talented actress. She often recieves rave reviews, and stars in excellent movies. Sadly, she has taken advantage of her talent, and acts like all the Paris Hiltons of the world. What happened? Her singing was good in Freaky Friday, but it has become so dull. This isn't music. It's just sex appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lindsay who?","review":"OMG, this CD is awful!

Lindsay doesn't cut it. She is definatly no where near the good music of Britney Spears.However, with that wasted-music contract running around known as Hilary Duff, she does beat some of her competition. Unlike Duff, Lohan's voice doesn't get totally on your nerves as she has some sort of emotion backing the words coming out of her mouth -- Unlike Duff who \\"sings\\" without emotion and in one tone.But when it comes to the pop sensation of Britney Spears, she doesn't have it. Britney's first 2 albums still reign supreme. I'll take Baby one more time and Opps over this any day.Outside of their carrers... Lohan is just as trashy as Britney, only without the charsima and like-able, upbeat personalty of Spears.Acting wise.. The girl has talent, unlike the joke known as Hilary Duff and the girl with dead acting talent, Britney. But that has nothing to do with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead God...help us all....","review":"This is probably the worst song and album of the year!

I think people are just upset with her image-so am I, but image doesn't make music. I am really impressed with this album's music, but not its vocals. Lindsay isn't a very good singer. And how can someone who's been doing acting all their life suddenly say their 'passion' is music? I think one of the biggest reasons Lindsay did this was to keep up with fellow teen queen Duff. I don't particularly mind-I think Lindsay can work in the music world, and I think her stuff is way better than Hilary's.

Just because Lindey got lucky with a few choice movie scripts, she thinks she can rush out some hackneyed, sudsey, thoughtless pop album, just to \\"win\\" once again, in her war with Hilary. It might work, because people are fascenated by her bad antics, mistaking her tabloid foldler as being \\"more mature\\" and \\"cool,\\" then being nice to people and obaying the law. Whatever.

She proves that when we thought we'd hit rock bottom with the 2nd wavers of supersaturated diva trash (J. Simpson, Kelly Clarkson, and the like), the well is a lot deeper than we'd hoped. Surely to god we're scraping rock bottom with Mrs. Lohans' 1st Big blowout hit. She's already enveloped in A&R manifested controversy, wet clothes, and dirty 'accidental' rumors.

I listened to the album anyways, since Lindsay is one of my favorite actresses, and i realized that she actually could sing and was good.

I dont know they just don't hit the spot for me. The tracks that really get me going are Symptoms Of You, Over, To Know Your Name, Very Last Moment In Time and Rumors. I think she should lean more towards the pop edge for her next venture and stray away from the rock vibe because i think we have too many of those teen punk-pop queens out there already.

Not at all the same type of material.But I must say that I think Lindsay is a beautiful, smart, and talented (in acting) girl.

Their war-dogs arrangement lacked originality and spark and that was one of the best songs on the album. Try one of their later albums when they were NOT trying to party and play.

This work is an exercize in nihilism; it means nothing. Cage wants his \\"music\\" to be uninfluenced by him. Why write then? The \\"music\\" is a series of words minus vowels, manipulated by computer to be void of any suggestion of real words or sounds, let alone any musicality.The music and choreography, per Cage in the interviews included, were written with no knowledge of the other. This is not hard to believe.I bought the tape to use in a Survey of the Humanities course. I will probably use it, or part of it, but as an example of bad modern art. These old men in this film are fraudulent. Pitiful.There are two positives. One, it shows the difficulties of filming dance. Movement seen on a stage vs on a screen are point-of-view difficult.

Very well constructed. Be sure to uderstand that the price is for only one speaker, Amazon shows a pair, but that price is for each one, not a pair, but still its a excellant buy, compared to higher name brands. Only con is that try to find a online store that uses Fed Ex, I had one speaker shipped by UPS and the carton was tore,and the top of the speaker had lite damage. The other speaker I bought to match I had shipped by Fed EX with no damage.Trick is to find a closer vender to you with less freight handling from mulitple trucks. Happy listening.

I couldn't find any speakers locally that had 15\\" woofers like my orginal sonys (and sony doesn't make them any more). I did find some speakers with 12\\" woofers but they were cheap and I blew the midranges in 2 days.Took a chance on these and have no regrets. The midranges and the tweeters are crisp and clear and the bass rocks the house. I love them so much that I have 4 of them for my right and left front channels. There is also protection built in to prevent damage when I get too wild."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply fantastic...","review":"These speakers are simply fantastic. The bass really does shake the house. Extremely clear mids and highs. I don't see the need for any other speakers if you have a pair of these bad mothers. If you want sheer, raw power then this is the speaker for you. For the price, it's phenomenal.Just one tiny con. The cut-off protection sometimes kicks in before I can reach the ultimate level of sound. It's just a hair too senstive in my opinion. The good side to this is you could never blow out the elements, but I wish I could override it somehow.I recieved mine for Xmas 2003 and they still sound as good as the day I hooked them up. I was thinking of geting another pair to hook up to my receiver but I wasn't sure if they were still being made. Low and behold here they are.

The reintroduction to the masculinity in black male singers, song structure and approach; the emergence of stars and the collaboration of hip-hop sampling with R&B all lie with Teddy. He is a student and master of the form. Who else could take the melody from Boz Skaggs' 70's hit Dirty Lowdown and flip it into a hit ! Nobody caught it!

The really only complaint I have about it is the price I paid for the cassettte version of this at Walmart $12.99 for a tape!! HIGH!! I remember when tapes were $8.99 or even $9.99.

I was really looking forward to the release of this album and couldn't understand how they changed so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was boring. It's too repetive. It was weak!!!","review":"A friend of mine gave me the Finally c.d. as a present. I was very excited about it. I had enjoyed their last c.d. \\"Another Level\\". That was an awesome c.d. I must admit that I was very disappointed when I heard this c.d. It was sooo boring. I mean, I know that these guys seem very sensitive about their female relationships, but it almost seemed soo depressing. It was also very repetitive. What happened to all the spunk and upbeat songs???!!! I still love you, but you need to come up with something a whole lot better next time!! Peace out Blackstreet.. Keep it REAL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Blackstreet, Why?","review":"What a disappointment!!!! It's okay at best. The only reason that I keep this CD is because \\"In a Rush\\" will probably be my wedding song, it's wonderful, and #4 sounds like the Blackstreet I know and love, but the rest of it is kinda suspect. And I'm salty that I had to go to their website to get a password to hear a song on a CD that I already paid for! What's that all about? I don't appreciate that in the least! I will have to hear someone else's Blackstreet next time before I buy it, because it's I can't go on blind faith anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowest Level...","review":"While Blackstreet's second album unquestionably took R&B to \\"Another Level\\", this one took it to it's lowest level. No original sound whatsoever. There is nothing distinctive here. The first 4 songs should appear on a rap/hiphop album. After that, Blackstreet seemed to run out of worthwhile material and relied on fomulaed expositions to finish the album. This wasn't worth the wait. Fans can only hope that their fourth outing will be the real successor to \\"Another Level\\" because this one just plain sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time has RUN OUT!!!","review":"I am VERY dissapointed in this project headed by Riley.It lacks a certain character and focus that the last Cd had.The changes in the line-up didn't help the group build on what 'Another Level' started.I hate to say this (and MANY OTHERS feel the same!!), Blackstreet is NOT WORKING TEDDY!! Give this concept up and reform GUY!! I really hate this Cd, and Riley tried to be cute by having a 'hidden track' encoded on this CD for play on computers!! I don't have a PC, so I miss out.I would not recommend this to anyone, and the single with Janet has the same music from Cameron's 'Horse And Carraige', which was unique.I guess Teddy has truly lost it if he has to rely on other's ideas.LEAVE IT ALONE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is great","review":"The music is great and the words are great. It is fantastic! I gave it one star because I was lying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The highest heights of disappointment.","review":"The CD starts off with a blast but after the fifth track (\\"Drama\\") the only song worth listenig to is \\"In A Rush\\". The CD crash lands with a resounding boom. The enhanced CD track project is destined to be a consumer nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLACKSTREET RETURNS!!!","review":"What a great new album from the genuius of Teddy Riley. The excellent \\"Can You Feel Me\\" samples the great 1980 Jacksons track, \\"Can You Feel It\\", \\"Drama\\" is exactly what it sounds like,it's dramatic with dueling female vocals that border on the edge of pretensious groove, the title track that I swear I hear Michael Jackson thrown into the background, the excellent remix of \\"Take Me Away\\" with another Jackson sample this time 1969's \\"I Want You Back\\", the hypnotically moving \\"Hustler's Prayer\\", and the extra funky \\"I Got What You On\\". Keep up the good work Ted and crew!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I bought this CD the day it came out, and it's great. Lots of variety in the tracks...although lyrically it's far from groundbreaking, the production is tight. The only major problem is that stupid hidden track...it's a good song, but it's a major hassle to access."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was left disappointed","review":"After the first 2 cd's by Blackstreet, I was looking forward to their third. I guess I'll have to wait for their fourth. Their first CD is permanently in my car. This CD will be sold back to a used CD shop. I gave it 4-5 go throughs to see if there was something there, but it never clicked for me. I don't think they should give up or break up. I just think they need to do what's best for them. The first song where they keep repeating \\"Give the people what they want\\"...well, what we want is somebody who doesn't suck up to us and will fully utilize Teddy's creativeness. It did have a good beat though. Do better next time !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak. Just weak.","review":"I don't see why people are always talking about the \\"Sophomore jinx\\", because the second albums from most people(including Kurupt, Nas, and Black Moon) are pretty cool, but the third albums often aren't very good. Look at Jay-Z and TLC, Nas. They all made good sophomore albums. They all disappointed me with their third albums. Blackstreet did two great albums(although I hate most pretty boy R&B sh*t), and this one stinks like a skunk. I only liked \\"Think About You\\". The rest is garbaggge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FINALLY was a real disappointment","review":"That's why I am selling the CD to Wherehouse Records in order to get some store credit. Word of advice Blackstreet, you would keep a loyal fan following if you would not compromise on the quality music we know you are capable of producing. Plus, fans are really forgiving if you take a little longer to put out a good album. Take the hint from Silk, Sade, Maxwell and others who took time to produce quality music. (P.S. Teddy ease up on the singing, your strength lies in writing and production)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"What happened to the back to back classics? Ballads and romantic solos? If you're a collector, it's a buy. If you're looking for works similar to Another level, it's not on Finally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel B. a buy","review":"The eye-trance jacket describes itself as \\"full-length emotional & intelligent trance traxx\\", and it delivers just that. Daniel B. has assembled an extraordinary collection of mature, sophisticated trance hits - the tunes you'd expect to hear in the clubs late at night after the crowds have thinned. You won't be disappointed by duds on this CD - there aren't any. No breakbeats or sudden tempo shifts either - just pure, consistent and mellowed German trance. The tunes are not mixed, but the purchase includes a 3rd CD containing a special 71 minute mix by Daniel B. A great value and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent time saving menus","review":"In anticipating major foot surgery, I purchased this book to prepare and freeze 2 -3 weeks worth of dinners so all my husband would have to do is reheat a meal each evening. Each meal makes more that enough for just the two of us. I was able to fix a different meal each night, and freeze what was leftover. Everything was execellent and very simple to fix. The flavors stayed after freezing and reheating. We especially liked the spaghetti sauce. I will never buy spaghetti sauce again ! The menu ideas were appreciated also. I found that I can substitute lower fat ingredients in some cases without lessening any flavor. This will be one cookbook I will use quite frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Books out there","review":"This book has very little useful information and has repetitive recipes. It is also very inflexible...you would have to recalculate your entire endeavor should you NOT want to make every meal as listed in 2 week plan or 30 day menu's. I also couldn't locate and ensure the coordinating software would rectify the inflexibility. Take a look at this at the library for recipes only. Then just go buy the competitor 30 Day Gourmet book and software!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work for too little reward","review":"I was attracted by the concept of this book - home-cooked meals there when there wasn't time to prepare them. I decided to try the two week entre plan first and gradually assembled the ingredients over a couple of weeks. I set aside a Sunday when I knew I could work almost undisturbed. This was some marathon! Discounting preparation the night before and clear-up it took me nearly 12 hours. Still, I thought it may be worth it. The draw backs of the meals are the necessity to plan and remember to defrost the night before (they take at least this long to thaw). My family are also less than enthusiastic about the recipes and also claim they have that frozen taste. I may use a few of the recipes in future and cook those in bulk (the spaghetti sauce was good) but otherwise this is not a project for our family."},{"rating":"2","title":"a system that works","review":"This book was a great purchase for my family and I. I have used the technique and it has saved me considerable time in the kitchen and money in our budget. I am a full time working mother of 2 children under 3 and it affords me extra time at the end of the day with my children and husband. Cooking time is cut in 1/2 and the clean up time is almost non-existent each night. Most of the recipies are easy to put together, have normal ingredients, and the author gives you tips to adapt the technique to your own family recipies. And amazingly, I did cook for a whole month in just 2 hours one Friday night and then 9 hours the next day. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice execution, too inflexible, lacking some info","review":"The lack of nutritional information is a huge oversight. The menus are pre-planned for 30 days. A mix and match system would be better for those of us who don't eat certain meats or veggies. Because the grocery lists are pre-built around a 30 day menu a simple alteration of a major ingredient in several recipes reduces the simplicity greatly.All that said, in providing 30 day meals for healthy, non-allergic, total omnivores who don't track their intake this book is very well planned and executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not real impressed","review":"I do not recommend this book. Lots of repeated recipes, space that could have been used for a little more variety. The only reason I am giving it two stars instead of one is for it's information on freezing food. I wasted my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"If you are not a devout Christian, you may find this book as offensive as I did. There I was, thinking I was going to get a cookbook to help me get homemade meals on the table a little more often...but what I got was a bunch of proverbs to begin each chapter, and a table talk discussion guide (excuse me, but I think I know how to talk to my own family) that was filled with Jesus questions. As a Jew, it offends me to have spent my money on a religious tract when there was no hint whatsoever that that was what I was purchasing. The funny thing is, if I had known ahead of time that it was full of religious content, I could have made a decision to just ignore it and try the delicious-sounding recipes. But being blindsided by the authors and the publishers left such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm unable to even consider trying them. The book is back in the box, on its way back to Amazon. I hope the next person who gets it is at least forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 hours of cooking makes a smooth month of dinners!","review":"We love this cooking plan. The book includes shopping lists and delicious recipes. Freeze the sauces in zip-locks, then simply heat later and add fresh pasta or rice and salads. Unfortunately, the publ. tells us it is out of print. get it while you can. Im buying 4 today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very wholesome","review":"The recipes here are just not healthy enough for me. We don't eat a lot of meat and this book relies on the comsumption of meat. For example, for one month's recipes you should buy: 4-6 lb. brisket, 8 lbs ground beef(she says buy more if needed), 1/2 lb. ground turkey, 9 lbs. whole chicken, 5 and 3/4 lb. bonesless chicken, 2 lbs. chicken pieces, 4 strips bacon, 5-6 lbs. am, 1 lb. sausage, 1 lb. veal and 3 ounces pepperoni!! Keep in mind that this meat list is for DINNERS ONLY. I could never serve my family that much meat! I was hoping for more healthy creative meals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lo-Fat Menu had NO TASTE","review":"This was the first OMAC book I tried. I was so excited that they had a low-fat entree plan so I made the whole 2 week menu. What a dissapointment!!!!!! I nearly gagged on the Mandarin Orange Chicken, and I was serving that meal to guests. The Split-Pea soup had no flavor and the recipe for Italian Tomato Sauce made everything it touched gag-worthy. I am so glad that I checked this one out from the library instead of buying it...a great dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of The Same 'Ol, Same 'Ol.","review":"If you have any of the prior published versions, there is nothing new in this current one that justifies the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scam","review":"I borrowed a copy of Once-a-month Cooking from a friend and loved it so much that I decided to order my own copy, and this is the copy I ordered. I did notice online that the cover looked a bit different from the one I had borrowed, but figured it was just a matter of updating. I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND THAT SOME OF THE BEST RECIPES I USED FROM MY FRIEND'S BOOK WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COPY I NOW OWN! Two examples are: Mimi's Nutritious Bread and Oven Barbequed Chicken w/Cheesy Biscuits. I'll be re-borrowing my friend's copy to get those and other recipes that I want to keep using. There were several others I wanted to try, but waited until my book came.

This book makes it a bit difficult to stick to that, but I substitute low-fat, low-cal and veggie where possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success in the kitchen!","review":"This is a good book for walking you through the process of once-a-month cooking. I could not use the high fat recipes, but was able to devise my own plan and carry it out using the guidelines included in the book. I simply substituted my low fat recipes and worked from there. OAMC has been a great success here because of this book. This book motivated me to do more Net searching on OAMC. I will be doing more of this type of cooking in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A can of this and a package of that. . .","review":"With time at a premium, I could just fill my freezer with prepared fajita mix, lasagnas, or Hungry Man dinners from the supermarket in order to have meals in minutes at the end of a long work day. I was looking for recipes and a system to prepare nutritious meals in advance -- meals that would be healthier for us and taste more homemade than the prepared foods -- and hoped this book would provide it. The recipes in this book, however, use a lot of processed foods, just like Swanson's or other convenience food products. I was pretty dissappointed in them.However, if you and your family enjoy frozen or boxed casseroles, then you will probably enjoy these meals. I can see growing families who already 'go to the freezer and get the box' getting a lot out of these recipes and this system. I should also note that these are budget-conscious meals -- again, a benefit for growing families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once a Month Cooking","review":"I have the first edition of this cookbook and Table Talk.

I could not have been more disappointed. The pace was slow, the characters uninteresting. The main character, Rina, spent the book alternately cleaning and cowering from noises outside while waiting to be rescued by Decker. I read half the book and will not finish it.

Now i want to order the others and get started reading to find out what happens to the 2 main characters. I don't generally read murder mysteries, but somehow the violence in this one was balanced with the peace-loving culture of the Jewish Yeshiva! I bounced back and forth to google to read more about vocabulary and Biblical references, so I feel I learned a few things while reading. There were a few items that dated the book, the use of beepers instead of cell phones, and a description of a computer print-out that sounded dated. Not to be picky, it just gave me a little pause to realize it wasn't an ignorant author, just earlier writing! Otherwise, a wonderful read!

I was looking for something to reaffirm our decision to homeschool, and it didn't do tha for me as much as I would have liked, but it was really interesting, and although it doesn discuss the bad aspects of going to school, it isn't down on school at all-- just helps people recognize where problems might lie and helps to address those issues.I think this is a great book for all parents, those homeschooling and those traditionally schooling-- any parent that is interested in helping thier child learn to love to to learn will find this book to be full of good information."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read...","review":"This book is a very quick read. Because the whole time you should be waiting for something worth while, and it never comes!Donald Miller crudely spills his hypocritical thoughts. His stereotypical beliefs (that he shows no signs of changing). And his polarized views on life.There is little in this book other than his mostly uninteresting stories which are laden with a gloating undertone. He seems to be proud that the stories of his life show a tangle of loose ends and painfully slow realizations.Metaphors and images are recycled annoyingly throughout the book. It could easily have been two thirds its actual length with the amount of repeated content.I wouldn't say don't read. We can all learn from mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Call to Luke-Warmness","review":"This book is about \\"me\\".It's all about \\"me\\". It's about the activities and thoughts of \\"me\\". It's about how cool \\"me\\" is. It's about how the world revolves around \\"me\\". It's about \\"me's\\" deep and not-so-deep thoughts.What's alarming is that Donald Miller and people like him seem to have a lot of influence on others. The success of this book has made Miller a popular speaker among both Christian and secular audiences. A movie is being released based on this book. In the book, Miller ponders how great it would be if Christianity could somehow be considered \\"cool\\". He has accomplished this. He's made Christianity seem \\"cool\\". But it's not great.

I may have made a mistake by reading all these negative reviews here, but I'm finding I agree with some of them to an extent. It's funny because I am seeing both sides here, both good and bad, about the book. Yes, some of the stuff he wrote about is a little self-obsessed, but some of the stuff he wrote sparked real passion in me and furthered my relationship with God. I think I just had a moment of realization (an epiphany, if you will) that you cannot take ANYONE'S word for anything, except God's. This is just more proof to me that people, no matter who they are or what their intentions or how close to Christ they are, can lead you astray. To conclude; read the book (it has some good stuff in it), take from it what you will, and trust God with all your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready for a different type of book on Christianity","review":"This book reopened my eyes to Christianity. This is not another \\"self-help\\" book, but it helped me more than any book I've read (except the Bible). Miller puts it all out there in this book.

I lament the brief popularity of this slightly heretical book and any influence it might have had to lead to a more laisser faire kind of Christian life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book that needed a better proofreader","review":"Loved this book, one of the few I have reread. He writes so honestly and lyrically about the struggles of being a Christian, particularly in this culture, where coolness is everything, and no matter how hard he tried, he had to realise that Christianity will never be cool. One thing I never thought about before was that Christ came to take you away from your self absorbtion, which is our biggest disease.My only quibble is that someone (Mr. Miller or his copy editor) should have done a better job of catching the spelling mistakes: \\"Patty Hurst\\" should have been \\"Hearst\\" and \\"towing the line\\" is actually \\"toeing the line\\" to name but a few. Apart from that I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had some Good points","review":"I was told by a lot my friend's that \\"Blue like Jazz\\" was a must read... Now that I have read the book, I am not to impressed. Don seems to ramble through the whole book. Granted, he did make some valid points but overall I would not recommend this book for others to read. Come on Don the problem with Christianity is not just the \\"right wing\\", Republican, and church going people. Granted they have tarnished the imagine, but you should just judge these groups. We need to love all, Republican's or homosexual.

I HATED it...the author just rambles on and on about his life, mixed with his opinion on spiritual issues.Few things I didn't like:1) I questioned most of the dialogue in this book. The conversations are so contrived that it seems like he just made up mock conversations between him and other people to make a point. That made me question everything in the book.2) The author paints every fundamentalist christian with the same brush. They love GWB, they are against abortion, they give 10%, and they condemn people different than them. I read with disgust as he writes about these \\"conversations\\" that he has with church leaders. Then, of course, he talks of the conversations he has with the hippies, who love everyone but don't know christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I am just a few pages into it but, while modestly interesting, I am finding it hard to understand what the rage is all about with this book. His \\"confessional\\" and self-effacing style is commendable. However, it doesn't add to crying need for true Christians to become serious students of their faith. It adds to the comfort seeking of our age but, not much so far, to pointing the reader to Christ.

I am going to give my quick 2 cents.I read most of this book, excited about what pearls of wisdom I could gather from this man's reflections on God, and all I got was self-important musings mixed with cheesy, nostalgic imagery. This book lacks substance and it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"authentic","review":"This book was truly worth more than the amount of money I spent to purchase it. The nonreligious thoughts he offers on Christianity are not only influential but they are valid to every individual. I not only cried, but literally laughed out loud! A \\"must read\\" for every Christ follower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Told from the heart","review":"This book was recommended at Church as a good way to help us relate to the world around us. I agree with that summation and often found the book to where I was...somewhat confused at times and wondering what religion is all about. The writer expresses his heart honestly which is often a rarity in a Christian book. He writes more about a connection with God than about organized religion and it is quite refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it.","review":"The book was very good - it is very simplistic which is a relief from the self-righteous philosphical types. It uses stories to explain very difficult issues such as why Christ had to humble himself and come to earth to save the world. It is an easy read that will impact your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"This was an easy but unrewarding read. Unlike the stunning coexistence of humility and confidence found in the \\"Confessions\\" of St. Augustine, Miller shocks with his ability to combine insecurity with arrogance. While I appreciate his call for Christianity to be relevant, Miller's attacks on the religious, political, social, and cultural establishment are more about his own frustration with societal acceptance than they are about really living one's faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for","review":"This book was incredible. It made me feel human again. Donald Miller is a wonderful writer with incredible insight. Not only was the book really fun to read, but it gave me a new direction on the way I feel about chirstianity. It got down to what we could really be thinking about if we choose to make it our lifestyle, instead of the stupid stuff that some of us become obsessed with. This book is about God, love, people, and a relationship with God that is the ultimate in spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Like Jazz","review":"Hey casual party-line thinking Christian - why not drop your guard for a brief respite and hear a voice in \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" that questions where Christianity finds itself today - short on acts of love and well practiced in condemnation of those not like us.Why does Miller find a group of hippies in the woods to be more accepting of people in their fallen state than most churches on a Sunday morning? What can we learn from a \\"cussing pastor\\" or Andrew the Protestor? This Lutheran learned we can be more caring, loving, and active in helping others. A fun easy read that delivers many thought provoking stories and insights.Drop the heavy theology for a moment and pick up a book filled with real life and real people struggling to find faith that has meaning- a faith in Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was painful, but.....","review":"It was painful, but I managed to get through it. I will confess that I felt an urgency after reading lengthy segments to get my Bible out and read through a Psalm or two, or a chapter in Matthew. It was sort of like needing to take a bath after wallowing in the mud. So many reviews have been made, but I wanted to add one thing of my own. In his book, Donald Miller has created a God from his own imagination to worship, a God that is OK with him as he is. The God he refers to is simply not the God of the Bible, but the God of \\"whatever\\". It's not cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"One of the best books ever written! It has a bit of everything, but it never loses its central theme. It is also not difficult to read and very heart warming. I can't wait to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a jump start","review":"I recently finished reading this book in one sitting, and found it to be humorous, honest, revealing and helpful. I haven't been feeling much of a connection with God lately (still don't either), but I think this book cracked the door just enough to know that I am loved. Definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying","review":"Blue Like Jazz is more like a collection of essays or editorials than a story book. Donald Miller gives us insight to how Christians should act through his own personal testimony. Although this book is not everyone, I suggest high school and college level students who want to get closer in their walk with Christ, buy this book. I don't want to say too much about the topics in the book because I would just botch whatever message Miller so perfectly penned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a pamphlet","review":"I thought at first that the book was going to go somewhere, perhaps share real deep insights on living out spirituality. Instead it just rambles.The author lacks basic knowledge about other paths of spirituality. i.e. He talks about Buddhism being about \\"rubbing a fat guy's belly\\" to grant wishes. That's pretty insulting toward most serious Buddhists.If I were you I'd just read \\"The Message\\" - don't bother wasting your time on this pointless rambling.To REALLY get a grip on real-life Christian spirituality, read some spiritual classics like \\"Practicing the Presence of God\\" by Brother Lawrence or \\"Imitation of Christ\\" by Thomas a Kempis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money....wish I could give it NO stars!","review":"I bought this book because my Bible study was reading it. The first couple of chapters we read were good and I decided to buy the book, what a mistake! I have not finished reading this book because I cannot get past the fact that I believe this author is a liberal Christian who bashes the Republican Party and President George W. Bush. In the second chapter, he and his protester friend go and protest an appearance by the President Bush in Portland and when the protest gets heated, they are disrepectful to the police by claiming that the mounted policemen's horses are not a weapon. I'm sure this guy has some good points, but I am returning this book because I'm not going to support a guy with these kind of viewpoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Read from top 2 bottom!","review":"Whatever you think of when you think of a good book, This IS NOT! One of the worst I've ever read. Want proof that God exists: THIS guy has a best selling book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...I would read it again and again","review":"This was the first book I read by Donald Miller, and I was hooked! I love his style of writing. He is honest, funny, quirky, and really likeable. He's someone you'd want to sit down with and drink coffee. He is able to answer the questions you'd never ask, or write down the thoughts you'd never say. He writes openly about both spirituality and just about life in general. I would recommend this to ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me blue...","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I expected a book about a man's search for and conclusion to finding God. However, the God that Donald Miller found is a bit short of the God of Scripture. Too often his solutions to his search were to better the world. If God is who he says He is, then when you find him you have no way to do anything but just worship Him and continue to worship Him. The state of the earth is so minor to the state of those that don't believe Him.I wish Donald spent more time thinking of Man's state before God."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most honest books I've read in a long while...","review":"For anyone looking for an antidote to \\"churchianity\\" and feeling like being a Christian means being a clone... Miller makes you take a hard look at whether or not you're living an authentic life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not even finish this book","review":"This book was a complete disappointment. According to my kindle, I got around 75% done with the book and finally gave up. His stream of consciousness writing is confusing and boring all at the same time. Usually we want to get in the authors head, in this case all i wanted was out. He does not develop his characters at all and instead expects the reader to know the people he casually mentions throughout the book as if we had been old friends. Also, to be honest, I did not believe many of his stories. When he recalls interactions with people in his past and gives their supposed conversations, it is flat out unbelievable. I understand an author must paraphrase occasionally, but human beings just don't interact or talk like that. Sorry Donald, you may be fooling all those people who reach out to your books looking for some key to help them unlock their faith, but you failed miserably with this book. And that is coming from a Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh..post-modernism.. nothing new.","review":"I thought he put forth some decent points, and told some interesting anecdotes in this particular book, but, for me, it ended up being just another post-modern view of the \\"Christian\\" experience, and world - one in the endless line of modern pop-Christian tomes, maybe the defining one, but overdone, and under-achieving in real content nonetheless.If you want to read a book with legit content, that is still accessible, pick up something by Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, or any number of other Christian authors who have really been taken hold of by the gospel, and don't just like to opine about it, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"the new \\"mere christianity\\" for the post-modern world","review":"i loved this book...it has been so long since a christian book has connected with me on a heart level. i wish there were more people like don miller in this world who can be in the world and yet not compromise...incredibly refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Recommendation","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend and it was all he said it would be. Donald Miller speaks with realness and there are times when you will have to re-read a paragraph it is so good and so deep. Other parts of the book are funny. If you are a fan of Miller's, you will not want to miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe Bohemian","review":"IMHO Miller is either confused or dishonest. On the one hand he talks about God as though he believes the Bible's description, on the other he muses about \\"the gods\\". At best he is motivated by a desire to meet the agnostic or unchurched halfway, but I have a problem with his \\"the ends justify the means\\" approach.At worst, his goal in writing Blue Like Jazz was to portray himself as hip, cool, and cutting edge. He seems desperate to impress the \\"in crowd\\", and thus doesn't hesitate to rip into \\"Fundamentalists\\" (whatever that means), Republicans, and Evangelicals. You know, man, like it's cool to rip them because everyone KNOWS how BACKWARDS they are...just read the newspaper, man, it's as clear as mud! Yeah Don, all the cool people hate those unenlightened Fundamentalists, so you're safe...you're IN baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated","review":"I was a bit excited to get a copy of this book as I've heard a good deal about it. So I picked up a copy and read it in a day which is a bit unusual for me. All in all I was extremely disapointed in every aspect imaginable. Donald Miller spends the entire book rambling as if he were on an acid trip. His jesus seems to be more the type of say a hispanic fellow (Heyzeus)who sells drugs down on the corner. He preaches a gospel of love without justice; one in which a hippie jesus comes over and wants to chat and share his bong with you. Holiness is apparently not all that important, but then again love is all that matters. Blue like Jazz is a waste of time and a hindrance to anyone's spiritual growth..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onward, Merlot Christian soldiers!","review":"\\"Blue Like Jazz\\" gives us Christian spirituality, Donald Miller style - in Miller World, well-off Deaniacs/lapsed NCC scion abound, fundamentalists play two-dimensional heavies, Catholics get a walk-on or two, and African-American churches are invisible. It also involves sad conversations with girls he wants to date but can't, frequent shout-outs to Amnesty International, and occasional self-absorbed musings as to whether he is self-absorbed. If you finish this book and still want to be a Christian, congratulations; you're made of strong stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever!","review":"I give this book two stars rather than one, because the writing style is interesting. The content? That is a different matter altogether. I am a long-time Jazz fan. My love for Jazz music is subjective. So is the \\"christianity\\" of this book. The problem is, Christianity is not based on subjectivism, but on objective [absolute, transcendent] truth.I'll keep the book on my shelf along with other volumes on music and worship--not because the book is about those topics, but because I like Jazz music, and the word JAZZ is predominantly displayed on the book's spine. Does that sound like a non sequitur? So is this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read New Seeds by Thomas Merton instead","review":"A well-meaning friend gave me this book so I was obligated to read it. I can't believe that a person who i know to be a truely loving human being would recomend such a hateful book. Miller is obviously non-religious as there is no real theological base for most of what he says, that does not stop him however, from being an ideologue who insults other faiths which are not his own Buddhism, Islam, ect. If you want to read a great book that will really get you thinking about the Christian faith read Thomas Merton's New Seeds Of Contemplation, especially the section entitled Moral Theology Of The Devil. It's theologically sound, Non-religious and comes from a true love of Jesus rather than a true love of self like this book seems to be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"Burns me up to see such tripe getting media attention. My five-year-old niece can articulate more deeply-considered thoughts than Miller does in this utter waste of time.I thought that after we got rid of George Bush, shallow thinking poorly presented would stop being cool. Sigh.My old lit. teacher would call this book, Mental Masturbation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started with high hopes...","review":"I had high hopes for this book when I started, hoping for a view into one man's developing spirituality. Instead, I found just one more self-absorbed, pseudo-spiritual tome lamenting the fact that we are all flawed in some way, the world would be so much better if we recognized this, and why can't we all just get along?I really wanted to like this book but just can't. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it's not the Prayer of Jabez","review":"When used as an adjective \\"Christian\\" is often synonymous with \\"bad.\\" This work on \\"Christian Spirituality\\" is consistent with that.Miller's insights are fair, but hardly need the meandering set up. Maybe it was contractual obligation, more than creativity that made this work so long (read tedious).It's disappointing, to say the least, if this is what passes for profound spirituality in evangelical circles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A note to Mr. Miller","review":"Your book was a huge disappointment. Your prose is a doze. Obviously there's a commercial market you wish to fill for someone preaching apseudo-Christianity that involves only love of Jesus and appeals to the ideological and political left. This market niche will snicker when you tweak traditional and evangelical Christians, Republicans and those that believe in hell and accountability. The concept of sin, evil, judgmentare not going to play well at places like your hedonist Camelot (Reed College). You believe that if you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior you can get away with all kinds of perversity (drug and alcohol abuse, infidelity and promiscuous sexuality).You may believe yourself to be a Christian but you are a postmodern relativist that seeks to corrupt Christianity into the kind of principle-less creed that rationalizes any behavior. Look in the mirror Mr. Miller you are a secular humanist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus? or Don Miller?","review":"I realize this is a work of apologetics (an argument for the Christian faith), though not in the traditional sense. It's not like Augustine's City of God or more modern works such as G. K. Chesterton's Orthodoxy, or C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity. I really wanted to like the book, but in the end I couldn't. When I read Augustine, or Chesterton, or Lewis, or Oswald Chambers or any of several dozen others I could name, I hear Jesus speaking. When I read Blue Like Jazz, all I can hear is Don Miller, with a big dose of smug self-righteousness perched on his shoulder. I know he ends the book with a chapter on Jesus, and I trust that he really does know Jesus, and more importantly, that Jesus knows him; but I couldn't see Jesus because Don Miller kept getting in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real","review":"I think that this book was written with the intent to be honest and expose a human being and their relation to God. When Don mentions smoking and swearing, I tihnk it is being said becaseu thats exactly how it was. He didnt say it was good, or bad, he just said it because that was how it was. Read it, get what is good from it, and he wasnt saying we should be like him. (don) just read it, and take what is good. I tihnk some people are taking things way to critically. sometimes being so concnered with everytihng being so.. \\"good\\" like... not swearing and such, well, sometimes you miss a point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I had seen and heard a lot about this book, but never took the time to read it until it was given to me by a friend a few weeks ago. I finished it a couple days ago and was really impressed-Miller took on a lot of difficult subjects-guilt, love, church life- and used his own experiences to make them relate to the average person. Not a very difficult read, but it definitely will get you thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be a trendy \\"Jesus Follower\\"","review":"Mr. Miller writes passionately and gives good examples about how we can love our neighbor as ourself and love others as Jesus does, but when it comes to to being in the world but not part of it, I wonder if the author has really looked that closely at the teachings of Christ.His goal of the book seems to be an effort to show the world how cool Jesus is and how uncool those who follow the fundamentals of the Bible really are. Rules are for losers, so lets just love everyone like Jesus and not reject everyone for their wrong actions. After all Jesus never had any enemies...right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about agenda...","review":"I really enjoyed the first 100 or so pages until he started creeping in the Republican bashing. He talks about churches having agendas and I couldn't help but feel he had his own agenda to distance himself from the Christian \\"Republican wackos.\\" (His own words) In the same breath he discusses not holding grudges or feeling anger. Sorry Don, you lost me at wacko. But it's ok, Jesus still loves flaming, bleeding heart Liberals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor???","review":"I felt this book was poorly written. This was the first time I had read anything by Donald Miller. If I had to guess I would say it was written by an adolescent. I had a difficult time following the author's \\"musings\\" and never assumed there was a point to anything. He seemed to ramble on and on with random thoughts. It reminded me of times when you start a movie and you keep thinking it's got to get better at some point, and in the end you're quite disappointed that you wasted valuable time. I have to question the capability of the editor..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is Pathetic","review":"This book is like the blind trying to lead the seeing. Mature Christians who read this book cannot fail to see through this young boy's agenda. Sadly, this is the genre of so-called Christian books that has become popular in recent years. The authors portray themselves as the disillusioned sinner or rebel without a cause who finally comes to realize that Jesus actually loves them. They realize this despite the hateful treatment they have received from all the Christian hypocrites. Because of their new and superior understanding of grace, they are now in the position to enlighten us and to judge all the self-righteous hypocrites who comprise the church. Don Miller observed this formula for a succesful Christian book, applied it, and sold a lot of books. It is that simple. As far as Christianity goes, Miller is ignorant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Cat Christian !!! (bible anyone ???)","review":"Don Miller writes an immature diary that somehow is supposed to liberate all of us uptight believers from an overly restrictive faith. Here is the deal: Shock the reader with totally hip sin, espouse cynicism towards conventional Christianity, ask thought provoking questions, have no answers. Don Miller is the king of Cool Christians- just read this doo doo and he will teach what he deems as \\"fake\\" and \\"real\\".I'm not totally sure what his goal was, but it clearly missed the marked for anything spiritual.A friend of mine raved about this book and now is buying it for everyone. She gave me a copy and I was very disturbed by his self righteous, and judgemental attitude (the very thing he attempts to indict!)This book has distorted one of my good friends thinking and I feel it is a detriment to anyone trying to walk closer with Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Wait For The Movie.","review":"Educational and entertaining. A fun trip tagging along with Donald Miller as he learns not to major on the minors. How he can know so much, and still believe in tithing, I don't understand, but \\"oh well.\\" The chapter on \\"Confession\\" is well worth the purchase price. Read This Book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Like Jazz","review":"Thought provoking book. Great insight and challenge to both Christian and non-Christian readers. The author's sense of humor catches you off guard and makes laugh out loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!!!","review":"This is the best and most original book i have read on Christianity in years. I am buying copies for my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling all legalists--please read and put us out of our misery!","review":"As a right-wing conservative, I feel God would have me say that.....I LOVE THIS BOOK AND I LOVE YOU DON!!!! This book was the start of my journey out of religion and into authentic Christianity. It takes the dread out of evangelism and makes befriending the secularist an adventure we've been missing all along. It also helped me understand how anyone can be a liberal democrat (hey--they want justice and peace, just like I do). This author is my new favorite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Church in crisis? Donald to the rescue!","review":"Thank goodness! Over 2,000 + years of boring old tradition, square churches, and legalism can now be corrected by Donald Miller. This guy moves from Texas to Oregon and realizes he needs a bigger suitcase to move Christianity with him: Extreme faith makeover, Christianity addition. I discerned two points from this book: (1) smoking and drinking are not sins and (2) Christians don't all think like fundamentalists. These revelations hardly require you to invest your time and money in blue like jazz. Take Calvin, take Hayek, take hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for young people and old alike","review":"I liked this book very much and would recommend for any young person searching for God. I believe anyone that has spent any time searching for the meaning will be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received an incomplete book...","review":"Although I really liked this book, I do not know the ending. The book I received was missing the last 30 pages of it and replaced with another portion of an earlier chapter. I would have appreciated a proper copy sent to me instead of a refund. I would expect for a company like Amazon to review what is being sent from their vendors. The book came quickly, but now I have a copy of an unfinished book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Air","review":"It was refreshing to read a book about Christian Spirituality by someone who is not A.) sealed in a protective cocoon of fluffy Christian church sub-culture, or B.) trapped by a rigid, legalistic Christian ego. In \\"Blue Like Jazz\\", Miller tells of his journey through life, searching for God and searching for answers, and the colorful friends he meets along the way. He is honest about his faith (and lack of it at times), his questions about Christianity, God and the church, mistakes he has made in life, and his attempts to dispell the \\"them and us\\" mentality that prevails in the Christian church. It's nice to read an honest book by a Christian author that does not attempt to fit in on the family bookstore shelf with all of the predictable devotionals, \\"read the Bible in a year\\" books, and Christian self-help books. This book is a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed My Life","review":"This is an exceptional book; it was literally a book (along with \\"The Pursuit of God\\" and \\"The Pleasures of God\\") that changed my life. It taught me how to love people without sitting in judgment on them.Miller is honest, funny, transparent and gutsy in sharing his own faith journey into \\"Christian spirituality,\\" which is his phrase for the Christian life. At the same time thoughtful, beautiful, practical, and funny, this series of vignettes will challenge and encourage any person already a believer in Christ and demonstrate to any who are not believers that not all followers of Jesus are hateful, mean spirited and cruel.I've recommended it to dozens and everyone who reads it is glad for the discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"For me the writing was dragging and boring.Was very glad I didn't pay very much for the book will pass it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"church basher","review":"As a Christian, I appreciated certain aspects of this book. That said, this author starts on a personal rant against conservative, church-going Christians that starts somewhere near the middle of the book and spirals to such a personal agenda that I wanted to throw the book by the time I got to the final chapters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"Miller is too busy trying to convince Christian readers that liberals and hippies are good people and conservative Christians and their churches are bad that he neglects to make a strong argument about Christian spirituality, which is what the book is supposed to be about. Blue Like Jazz lacks both organization and depth in its content. I'd say pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Challenging","review":"It's one of those few chances that I've had to read devotional material with a grin on my face and conviction in my heart. As the reader follows the simple journey of the author's faith, he cannot help but yearn for a more simple faith as well. To cry and yearn and question and struggle and think like Don does would be a blessing. To live and learn and grow and change as Don does is equally a challenge. The material will push your buttons no matter what perspective you come from, but the key is to take it for what it's worth. It's one man's experience with God. It's not normative for everyone, but it's nonetheless real. So, sit back, enjoy, and learn much from the delightful little faith-adventures of Don (especially the sexy carrot and the astronaut)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Like Jazz","review":"This is a book well worth reading. It is appropriate for late teens and early twenties since it covers life in a university. It has a great spiritual depth and we have used is as the basis of study in a small group of men. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful Memior!","review":"Finally, someone has written a book on what it feels like to experience faith. There are so many \\"how-to\\" and \\"here's-why\\" books on religion that we often feel alone in our struggles and doubts along the road of life. In Blue Like Jazz, Don Miller opens his life and soul to let us all know that we are not alone. With a sometimes biting humor and brutal honesty, Miller shares his journey of faith. From his fatherless upbringing to his ministry on the campus of Reed College we learn about the struggles of his walk of faith. The chapters are titled topically but the narrative more-or-less follows a linear chronological time line. This is an easy, approachable book on religion and faith. If you're a seeker who's never been drawn to christian literature, this is the book for you. I'm already re-reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book for teens.","review":"If you want to give your teenager the message that it is okay to use drugs and alcohol - and that God doesn't care if you're high all the time as long as you love - then Miller's book is the one for you. What is damaging about this book and its message is in what it DOESN'T say. Oh, another person for whom to buy this book is someone who likes penguin sex.I find it disturbing to know how popular this book is among bible study classes for teens, as it gives the idea that Christianity requires nothing of those who believe. In fact, it encourages people to remain stuck in their self-absorption, sinful behaviors, drug use, etc. What Miller presents here exalts the hippy lifestyle and discards/attacks mainstream Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft-spoken radical","review":"Blue Like Jazz caused quite a stir as I read it and discussed it with friends. The easy transparency of Miller's self-examination energized me to look deeply at my own spiritual motivations. It appears that Miller has grown impatient waiting for spiritual renewal to rectify cultural unfairness and now embraces secular humanists to speed the upheaval. Beware of soft-spoken radicals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Blue Like Jazz is a good read, and I ordered a couple used books for two of the young men I mentor. The price was right, and though the books weren't in new condition, they were in very very good condition. I'm pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change Your Mind, Change Your Life","review":"The novel \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" is one of the most interesting novels I've picked up in the past couple years. Donald Miller gives us many thoughts on Christianity as well as his own struggling faith.What I love about this novel is the raw, real, raging, person that Donald is portraying himself. He's real. That's something hard to come by these days. I think this book gives him credit that he isn't one of those people that tries to sell us a \\"feel good religion\\". He's completely honest! It's hard to be a Christian! It's not easy to feel judged by the world, as well as inside your own church!I think that its awesome to see a book like this become a movie. I think Hollywood should take more books like this and turn them into movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read For Anyone!","review":"This book is amazing. From page one I was not only interested in Miller's life but his perspectives and the spiritual process he went through with each lesson he learned about himself, the world, and God. In today's society where spirituality is often actually hidden by religion, Miller uncovers a world where love, grace and Jesus (among many other things) can work within us to live a fulfilling and meaningful life. I highly enjoyed this book, as it points out many simple basic principles about the love of God that myself among many others have lost in the hustle-bustle of today's society. Miller is funny, thoughtful, and most importantly honest...I read a friend's copy & bought my own when I was finished so I could lend it out to all of my friends. I just bought his other two books and know that if they're half as good as this one (which I'm sure they will be), I will enjoy them & learn from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I was given a book for my Birthday - the name I will not mention - it was a Christian book that was written as though the writer had all the answers. But the truth is, we, as humans, do not have all the answers. We are lost, confused, and often very doubtful. In Blue Like Jazz, Donald Miller shows these feelings in his life. Instead of hiding insecurites and doubt he opens them up, so that we can see that there are people who feel the same way we do - that being a Christian, doesn't mean you have to be perfect. Miller also shows that we don't just become Christians, and that's it. He shows that it is something that we work at everyday, and that there will always be something more that we need to do. It is a beautiful book, and I would reccomend it to Christians and Non-Christians, alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pristine condition","review":"Book arrived in pristine condition. This book is very inspirational and a good reflective read. Highly recommend this book. Thank you for the quick service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting stories","review":"Miller shares his stories in a raw and honest manner. There are nuggets of wisdom interspersed with lots of rambling. Descriptions of friends and their interactions make for good stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic Post Modern Thought on Christianity","review":"This book is Miller's account of walking through life in his twenties and moving from Texas up to Portland, Oregon. He comes to a greater understanding of his faith through various experiences including friends he meets at Reed College, known to be one of the most liberal schools anywhere. His writing breaks out of the mold of the traditional Christian style of writing and looks at things from a post modern type of viewpoint. He's not afraid to dig down and explore why do we actually believe in what we believe rather than simply accepting because it's something we've grown up with. He has a way of making beautiful word pictures similar to the title \\"Blue Like Jazz.\\" I enjoyed his honesty and authenticity of admitting struggles and failures and recognizing that he's a broken person as we all are. I recommend it as a perspective towards Christianity outside of the standard recipe for Christian literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hip to be square?","review":"This was another paint-by-numbers \\"memoir\\" from a christian trying to make christianity seem cool and in touch with the world. The author covered the bases, he told a story about getting drunk (which he seemed to do after only a few beers and felt sick an hungover afterwards, just to throw in a \\"drinking is bad m'kay\\" spin...what guy gets that drunk after 2 or 3 beers anyways? Then in his quest for relevancy an hipness, he mentions seeing a lesbian couple in the park. \\"Oh how edgy!\\" Ever been to Atlanta in the spring? The rest of the book continues with jaunts into other supposedly controversial topics like being exposed to pot, etc., but yet somehow he still comes across as a naive but morally intact christian.If this is a christian bestseller, it only goes to point out how out of touch the church is with the world around them. Do we really have to get our \\"hippness\\" from living vicariously though this authors supposed \\"liberal christian lifestyle.\\" ...As if."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Like Jazz","review":"My pastor's wife has started a book of the month type of club and this was the first book she asked us to read. This is definitely not the type of book I would have chosen and after having read it, I felt like it was one of the worst books I had read. It might be my age (58), but I felt like this was a waste of my time and Christian reading material. In talking to others who have read it, they told me it was because I have led a somewhat sheltered life and the man who wrote this book was really a \\"hippie-type\\" who never seemed to grow up. I know it was a diary-type book and I don't like that either. Maybe I was picky, but I would never suggest this to a new Christian or a friend for that matter. That is also why I don't want to rate this book, as for me it was lower than a one"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dopey heretic!","review":"I mean the dude obviously hasn't spent much time actually listening to jazz. He thinks it doesn't resolve. He thinks it doesn't resolve so much that its lack of resolution ends up being a metaphor for G-D or something. But, um, maybe the girl he was trying to impress by telling her he was into jazz was too polite to tell him this, but jazz does indeed resolve, not in the way a Speilberg movie does, but in the way that any art that deals in abstraction does. (I know Evangelical Christians, even hip ones who are not afraid to use words like \\"jazz\\" get a little uncomfortable around abstraction.)Anyway, I just thought you should know the book is based on a dopey conceit. Listen to some Bechet, some Mingus, some Thelonious Monk, or some Von Freeman and then read whatever you want. The music itself will bring you closer to G-D."},{"rating":"1","title":"if I could give it negative stars I would","review":"Don't waste your time or your money. Stabbing myself with a dull pencil would have been more enjoyable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Theology","review":"Blue Like Jazz is what happens when a person suffering from ADHD and bad theology has a need to sell books to make a living. We have been set free from relying on our feelings to guide our faith! It doesn't matter what our fleeting feelings tell us, we have an unchanging and graceful God who will never leave us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up!","review":"This is such a great book for seekers as well as mature Christians. Donald Miller is honest, humble and forthright. He gets to the crux of what it means to Walk the Walk with Christ. He shares thought-provoking, refreshing answers to the questions every Christian has. I find his style and attitude endearing. Some who are more conservative may find it a little irreverent, and therefore may find this book is not for them. I will continue to read this book again and again throughout the course of my life. It has deepened my faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those books where you say, \\"I'm not crazy\\"!","review":"There are three books that I've read that left me with the thought, \\"I am not crazy afterall!\\" This book is one of them. The others are Frank Viola's Rethinking the Wineskin and George Barna's Revolution. If you thought you were only Christian with divergent views on church, theology, the Bible and culture, these three books are a great help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think about what you want before you purchase.","review":"It is, in fact, stated that is \\"nonreligious;\\" however it is more so, laden with post modernistic views of Christianity. I have no idea why some Christian recommended this book to my wife. The book out rightly overlooks the fact of God's Law and Grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glib, wrong, pointless","review":"Page 103 contains the stupidest paragraph I have ever read in 35 years of serious book and other reading. Miller dispenses with all philosophical argument about God on the basis of his personal feelings. It is an epistemological nightmare of the highest order, but, oh, so clever...The man should not be taken seriously. That he is, is a testament to our decline as a church and a nation. It is all BS (in Harry Frankfurt's understanding of the term.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile Read","review":"I've read this book cover to cover, highlighted text, took notes, tagged pages, and now, after several months, I've started looking at it again. Wonderful insight on faith. My son recommended it, and my daughter is now reading it. Across generations, a must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"Donald Miller finds a way to write spirituality into real life. He speaks truthfully into how Christians can have thinking brains and believe in God at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great choice for new and seasoned Christians","review":"Like Anne Lamott, I love Donald Miller for his honesty and ability to laugh at himself and accept himself and others. The collective Christian community does far too much judging and not enough loving, and Miller doesn't mind saying so. He touches the tenets of the Christian faith with the soft candor of a good friend. One of my favorite thoughts he includes is that (and this goes for everyone) if Jesus met him on the street, he finally felt that Jesus would like him. We ministry folks always aim to communicate this critical point, but lack something real and raw to make it stick. Kudos to Donald Miller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Like Jazz","review":"This is one of the most refreshing books I've read in a while -- absolutely winsome and genuine, a free spirit in the sense that the ancient King David would have meant \\"uphold me with Thy free Spirit...\\" If you like to \\"ride upon the heights of the land\\" this is the book for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Soundtrack! A MUST BUY.","review":"As usual, Christopher Franke gives us music designed to create a mood to it's extreme limit. His dramatic crescendos in the end title track and track 5C are breathtaking. Fans of Babylon 5 should see this as a must buy CD, and non-fans will appreciate it's rich mood-setting tones. This music is the best example of why music is so important to television and movies. Without it, the episode it was created for would not have had the dramatic mood it needed. (This was the music used in the final episode of the Babylon 5 series) Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Dependable Product","review":"I bought this for my 11 year old son and was looking for a dependable product.

First off, it seemed to be cheaply burned from an old vhs tape onto a disk. Second, there seems to be confusion as to what is on volume 1&2 (breaking and history were to be on 1 but were on 2, etc). When it comes to the juru short hand forms... it gets weird. The practitioner does a couple punches while slapping his arms... then the combat application shows a grab and sweep (huh?). You can pull some useful techniques and ideas from it if you are willing to dig (or are running out of new moves in traditional systems), but as a martial art tape, it looks sloppy, tense, and confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"Don't be misled. This is not an album of original artists singing these songs. It is a compilation of studio singers doing cover tunes and not very well at that. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vintage Footage","review":"I was expecting some modern footage but the cover is misleading, there arent even any jet fighters. The film only covers from post WWII to the fifties, there wasnt any 80's, 90's, 00's or even any 70's footage. Its all black and white or colorized and goes on about the experimental studies and effects of nuclear explosions. This is something you can watch for free on you tube or at the library. I gave it an extra star because it does show vintage footage of interest to people and coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Nicely done look back at teh roots and some of the main players of early hot-rodding.

The songs are very catchy and well written. I got this one after my friend gave me The Moon and Antarctica. I'd recommend that and this album if you like Modest Mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"This EP is GRREEAAT!!!!","review":"This CD is GRREEAAAT!!! If you like Modest Mouse and you haven't heard this you're selling yourself short. IT's incredible, It came out after Interstate 8 but before Lonesome Crowded West and it rocks. IT sounds like they had a lot of fun making it. Songs like\\"Summer\\" and \\"The Waydown\\" \\"karma Payment plan\\" are wonderful and have something to them that just isn't on any of their other albums. I highly recommend this for anyone, esp. Modest Mouse fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I am a fan of modest mouse at least most of there stuff I didn't like long drive loved moon and antartic and thought lonesome crowded west was good this one however has only one good song to offer the fruit that ate itself is a great song well worth downloading better than any song on long drive or lonesome crowded west but the rest of the cd is garbage so save your money and download that one song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jazz from Paris","review":"An unbelievable collection of three compositions (one by Petrucciani and two by Miller) that showcases the soloing capacity of each performer. Kenny Garrett and Marcus Miller are definately the highlight of the disk. The Petrucciani chart, Looking Up, shows not only the compositional mastery of the pianist but also allows Marcus Miller to shine like no other. A definate must for any fan of the mid-90's jazz scene. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD IN A LONG TIME!!!!","review":"This CD is great. Listen to it once and you will be hooked. It has everything from guest appearences from Jay-Z and DMX to hot beats and phat lyrics. The song We Here Now is the best on the CD. Holla Holla is alright, but many others are much better - World's Most Dangerous, It's Murda, and the opening intro is tight! I'm not big for intros but this one is worth listening to. Buy this Cd and you will not be disappointed. This could be the best of 1999. Many others are sure to come out as singles but get the whole thing.

I'm mainly writin' this review to stick up for Ja, everybody comparing him to DMX and saying how DMX paved the way for the likes of Ja, how DMX is the founder of this style. True they sound the same. However, Ja came out before X and would have dropped his solo joint before X but was already under a contract with Cash Money Click that he couldn't get out of. When they couldn't get Ja, DefJam went after the next best thing, X. So Ja paved the way for X."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mix of the best","review":"Ja Rule is a mixture of the best on the hip-hop scene, hands down. Who is the best, you might ask? In my view it is the late Tupac Shakur & The Notorious B.I.G. Ja has the fantastic word craftsmanship of Tupac, and the unique delivery of the Notorious one. With that combination how can you not be the best? Ja-Rule is the answer to rhyme skills,in the absence of Tupac & Big, just as Allan Iverson is the answer in the absence of Michael Jordan to basket ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant get enough of it","review":"Cant get enough of this cd, the bass in this cd rattles my car like no other.

Let's see... Let's Ride has a nice west coast feel, very nice work here. Two of my favorite songs are \\"Suicide Freestyle\\" with Case (wow is the only word I have) and \\"Only Begotten Son (the intro gives up a hint at Rule 3:36). That song is very deep, hitting hard on every level. The collabo with Jigga and X is tight also... I hope these three team up again. I don't know why Ja Rule went the way he did, but I promise you'll like this CD. Ja Rule is at his best... his lyrics are tight, and the beats match his style well.

And with astounding titles like \\"Kill Em All,\\" \\"It's Murda,\\" and my favorite \\"Murda 4 Life,\\" shoot, that's creative... Lyrically, there are few artists from any part of the world who can match Ja Rule's complete lack of talent.

Well believe it or not , this is an extremely good cd. If your tired of hearing the half-sung , soft rap you hear on the radio, you may think Ja Rule is the last person you'd look to buy a cd from. Venni Vetti Vecci,is Ja rules best (and not to mention ) only good contribution to the rap industry. Though Ja Rules material has gone down hill, I in no way want to discredit the original cd he was able to make.If your looking for a good rap cd to buy , this is probably one of the best you'll find. Disregarding skits, you can play the tracks all the way through and almost everyone is worth your time. This is the style I believe Ja Rule is true to , and i'd like to see him bring it back . The album full of hot beats, and well written material , reveals the true Ja.In conclusion if your a true rap fan , looking for something good to add to your collection , dont't miss this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helix at their best!!!","review":"This is the pinnacle of Helix's power. The album smokes from beginning to end! Even the ballad, Dream on rocks. I think what makes this record stand apart from their earlier gems is the production values. Mike Stone really did a good job here. Brian Vollmar sounds as ferocious as ever and songs sound clearer and crisper. Highlights include title track, Wild in the streets,shot full of love, High voltage kicks, She's too tough(covered by Def Leppard later), Kiss it goodbye(your ass) and my personal fav, love hungry eyes! 1987 was a good year for me overall and this record certainly helped. Buy this if you like good, solid in your face 80's metal. Also, these guys were talented musicians who could really play. I kinda lost track of them after this and Paul Hackman's death. Get it and you'll like it!!Cheers...."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an excellant CD","review":"I remember listening to this on casette back in 1987 and having to end up buying it on cd as I basically destroyed the casette by listening to it too much. The opening track of WILD IN THE STREETS to the end track of KISS IT GOODBYE are great tracks. A song off of the album WHAT YA BRINGIN' TO THE PARTY is such a great track. SHE'S TO TOUGH IS A GREAT SONG which I honestly prefer over the DEF LEPPARD version. I thing that DREAM ON is a great ballad track for the album. This cd is all in all a great ROCK/HEAVY METAL album.

Where error does not exist, peculiar use of the English language makes reading it painful.The gunshot wound chapter is particularly disappointing.

In addition, if you gently shake the knife back and forth, you can distinctly hear that the blade isn't held very secure inside the sheath. Again, you get what you pay for.All in all though, I would definitely recommend this product if you're looking for a cheap prop that you won't be tossing around or jabbing vigorously.

The book is very good at explaining the process, and explaining each of the sections. It has plenty of review problems, which are similar in difficulty to the ones on the test itself. I read through the entire book (which is much smaller than my official SAT review book, I might add) and took one practice exam.On the day of the exam, I felt confident in my abilities, and wasn't shocked by the exam; in fact, I found it much easier than the SAT. My scores reflected that; even though I only have a 1410 on the SAT, my ACT score (first time!) was a 34, including a perfect score of 36 for the science section and a near-perfect 35 on the critical reading section.

Prayers for Bobby opens up all these doors and asks many questions: about faith, God, homosexuality, the family unit. I wish everyone could get along so tragedies like what happened to Bobby never happen to anybody ever again.Many of my favorite films are coming-of-age dramas.

Unfortunately since it was all Japanese with no subtitles I couldn't understand the whole thing (especially the new scenes). That being said, when it comes to anime, I prefer subtitles over poor quality dubbing. Something just seems to be lost in the emotions conveyed by the characters when it comes to english dubs, especially when the english voices themselves are generic and emotionless.

The dubs clearly exist [they are available on VHS] so they are only shooting themselves in the foot by not releasing them. How do they expect to attract a new (younger) audience by releasing them in a form that will not sell? (My kids unfortunately won't watch anything in black & white or not dubbed). Note that this short-sighted action is equivalent to releasing DVDs of old TV series and then stripping out all of the original music but without the excuse of \\"not being able to release the music due to excessive royalty costs (examps- WKRP IN CINCINATTI, THE FUGITIVE, etc\\".

The book is not a chronological account and jumps from subject to subject which can sometimes be frustrating to follow. But its brief account is not tedious and it brims with hope for humanity.

Acting is wonderful, but the casting of the characters is a bit of a give away of the plot. I had never read the book and had heard great reviews of this movie. Immediately guessed who the baddy was because the character cast was just out of place. Acting was superb, but here is the downside.... the story line is DRAGS along.

To begin with it was a poor effort at reducing the six part mini-series to a less than two hour movie. The actors were bland, their parts underacted, their effort very lacking. The chronology of the events was disjointed, the story line weakly developed and the significant events underpinning the plot were lacking.The character Connie was not depicted well, we thought, especially considering the significance of her observations. Nor was the description of Ricky Tarrs' experiences well explicated. These two characters contribution to the story is the foundation of the investigation of the mole.No, one can not expect to reproduce in two hours what was successfully done in six, but it would have been better to leave this screenplay on the shelf.If one had not seen the mini-series, one would be lost to the significance of the true story as LeCarre had written it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so excited to see this movie, but it turned out to be really boring.","review":"Honestly I do enjoy spy movies and dramas.

So, I read the plot summary on Wikipedia and decided to give it another go. The second time, I finally got the gist of what was going on, but the film never does much more than plod along.

Granted, the part of \\"Smiley\\" isn't one that projects vivacious glee, but whereas you can see the intricate gearwork turning in Sir Alec's portrayal of the main character, Oldman's version is expressionless, opaque, boring, and, (worse) not even particularly thought-provoking.You figure out what has happened, and who the real Soviet mastermind of the whole sordid mess is very soon, and the rest of the movie is just pro forma tedious boredom. Oh, Colin Firth does make a game attempt to inject a little life and passion into this moribund mess, but in the end it's all really a waste of time.

If you are a person who needs action, however, then don't watch this...it is more for the people who love battles of wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Oldman!","review":"I love Gary Oldman and in this remake of, I believe, Alec Guinness original TV role in a memorable series he does an excellent job, for someone trying to emulate such an accomplished actor in a role he was made for.For anyone with an interest in the inner workings of the British Intelligence Organization, with its strange methods of employment post-WWII then this is an excellent movie to watch, not really the slash and hack of the Mission Impossible but for what it lacks in adventure it makes up in period and sophistication.Gary Oldman in a great role, perhaps he might make a series of it as a more in-depth, realistic role than the 007 franchise ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alec Guinness is George Smiley","review":"The movie, while good, does not do justice to the story. You need to see the Alec Guinness mini-series. I love Gary Oldman and he does a good job but the story is too neat, too easy, and worked too hard to fit into the 2 hour movie format. After watching the Gary Oldman version it just slapped me in the face how really good the diabolical chess match with Karla was in the Alec Guinness version, especially considering it was 1979 vintage. Even with that comparison there were still several very good scenes in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an original type of spy movie and was very good.","review":"This one was original because it shows a perspective of national security or spying that no other movie I've seen has depicted. Basically one guy was in charge of the whole British dept along with a small team under him. Everyone else was below that, figuratively and literally--on lower floors of the building. Whereas moles and missions are more fun and exciting in other movies of the type, in this one they're more realistic and the details are thought out better. But I was also not bored at any point.And the guy who's relegated from the spy world to teaching kids was a great touch. An untamed man who had known comradeship and sailed the wild seas, so to speak, thrown back in with kids and able to show them how Englishmen aught to be and to bring along one of the outcast kids a little bit. That was a small part of the movie but, again, really a great touch. Classic British culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"tinker,tailor,soldier,spy","review":"slow at the beginning but, as you carried on watching you got into it if you like these sort of movies you should enjoy this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine cast, potentially good story, dull film","review":"The pace of this film was glacial: Two hours of dour expressions, slow pans right-left-in-out, and unintriguing filler scenes like the one with the bee in the car. This viewer went into blissful slumber several times. Even M. Night Shyamalan's films are fast-paced by comparison, and they always have a WHOA! ending. There was an effort to close the flim with a bang, but it came off as a whimper.And the blu-ray quality is not one you would use to demo your new plasma, a purposeful choice by the director no doubt.What a waste of excellent acting talent this file is."},{"rating":"1","title":"tinker tail... whatever","review":"I marveled at the ever-so-long 5-star analyses/critique/comparisons of this current version to 6 hours of Guinness. Not much of this is easy on the eyes or the brain. Oldman's robot-like performance, the garbled mumble of most of the British, Hungarian, Russian, etc articulation, plus the dreary venues/cinematography brought this equation to mind- slooow + confusing = boring. A huge yawn for me and for anyone wanting this thing to get off the ground, I wanted to be entertained, not burdened by a bunch of unremarkable talking heads being 'intellectual spies'. But then you have to be a major Le Carr�� fan to find this even interesting, much less entertaining.

In a brilliant performance, Gary Oldman plays a British Intelligence officer who is brought out of retirement to investigate allegations that a mole exists within the organizations upper ranks. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy has a great screenplay, score, and what I consider to be Gary Oldman's finest performance to date. Though I felt the plot was a tad difficult to follow, with its myriad twists and turns, the film is a rewarding experience, filled with nuanced performances and an engrossing premise. It's certainly worth a watch for anyone into high-stakes espionage stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie.","review":"Now, its never going to replace the BBC TV Series because you got more information from the original of 6 hours thanyou can possibly get from an hour and a half, but the acting is amazing in this one too.The old BBC Production had the best English Actor they could get AT THAT TIME.I feel that they did the same thing with this movie version.

Set in 1973, the complex - a bit too complex at times, perhaps - plot utilizes flashbacks to unravel much of its story.Written by Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan and directed by Tomas Alfredson, the movie doesn't go for the cheap thrill or the easy stunt, relying on intellect rather than action-movie antics and pyrotechnic special effects to generate its suspense. The tone is subdued and carefully modulated, the pacing slow and deliberate. And fine performances by Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, et.al., and an appropriately chilly atmosphere make for enjoyable viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of itself, and disappointing.","review":"Full of itself, and disappointing. Hard to follow at first until you realize it's trying to more complex than it really is. I am perfectly fine with movies that move at a deliberate pace, but this one falls into a slow pace and never builds any real steam. This slow pace seems to be another factor contributing to the filmmakers' belief that the movie is more momentous than it is; the slowness isn't sophisticated pacing, as with some movies - it's just slowness.

The result is a real mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nap at home for free...","review":"This is clearly not a movie for everyone, judging by the disparate reviews seen here.

I wasn't shocked by the identity of the mole and didn't even care that there was a mole!I can appreciate that people were able to enjoy the film; I just wasn't one of them!

However, my wife was bored through most segments and I doubt my adult children would even watch it. The story is 'old-school, cold war, spystuff.' LeCarre is a master spy novelist and I have read many of his books, including this one. The movie settings are amazingly dreary and period accurate! The actors nailed the characters and were believable. The intrigue and tensions created were climaxed nicely and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! There is very little computer generated special effects or razzle-dazzle, gratuitious action or violence etc. It is reminiscent of the \\"Spy Who Came In from the Cold\\" with Richard Burton . . . or the \\"Ipcress File\\" . . . type of movies.

Now I have enjoyed reading Le Carr�� and the TV series was exciting but I cannot get enthusiastic about this film. I thought the direction was very muddled. The plot (this won't give away anything important) is about the efforts to track down a \`mole' in the upper echelons of the British Secret Service. The whole film jumps back and forth between the present and the past, and I was never sure exactly which I was watching. One of the protagonists gets shot in the end (as a traitor?) but another is dispatched to Moscow and yet another to Siberia. Were they all traitors? Was it in fact a conspiracy? I just thought the whole thing was a disorganised mess. The two stars are for the authentic Cold War atmosphere and the quality of the acting: but -1* for the direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious in the extreme","review":"I'll tell you why I say it's tedious. There is no attention to characterisation whatsoever. We are given no clues as to the motivations of the characters. They just go about doing mysterious 'stuff'. Colin Firth gets in a whole sentance explaining why he went over to the russians. It's just a pity the sentance is banal.Because the characterisation is missing, the movie is an endless parade of events happening to people we know nothing about and care about less. The plot is built up slowly and it requires intelligence to watch and decypher; that doesn't make it an intelligent film - just one in which the plot has been finely chopped. I'd rather join the dots in a children's play book.I gave it one star for the faithful recreation of the 70s, another for the photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly done. Unworthy of Oldman","review":"I have seen many of Gary Oldman's films and the man really intrigues me. He is probably the best character actor of our day and yet he does not seem to get the better films. Regarding this film, the story was a bit confusing - too much going back and forth in time. If I could say anything to ALL actors and actresses of today it would be \\"Take diction lessons!\\" Everyone speaks in whispers with marbles in their mouths. This is the reason I love older movies - movies of the 30's, 40's and 50's....one can understand everything EVERYBODY says. I had to turn on the captioning to understand what was being said in this film. Jeez!! I will continue to watch Oldman's perfomances but this was not one of his best.

If you like confusing plot lines that move back and forth in different time zones without letting you know you've moved back ten years in time, or forward again, then this is the movie for you. If you like to watch people sitting in a car, for no known reason, endlessly swatting a fly...with no apparent relation to the story other than an artsy symbolic message for the directors and movie critics to ooh and ahh, then this is for you.About 3/4 of the way I finally gave up trying to figure out where they were goimg...I didn't care who the mole inside the spy service was.

In this case, LeCarre's main character George Smiley is by nature undemonstrative and secretive - both characteristics difficult to use to move the plot forward.

This could easily have been a 3 hour movie, and still much would still have been missed. What proves my point as an example, is Smiley's meeting with Karla is only mentioned in a conversation over drinks. Instead of showing the actual face to face, which is an important turning point in the story. The lighter!

While worth viewing, it is hardly even approaching the peak of it's genre (held, in my opinion, by films such as The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now, and The Bridge on the River Kwai: better movies with better DVDs) and isn't worth a purchase. However, those other films come as highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not gung ho about Gung Ho","review":"This is an action adventure film made during the propaganda era of WWII.

A lot of subjects are given very cursory looks and you will need to add extra books to your collection for in-depth coverage of more of the details.Reading this book and its predecessor will definitely get you a solid grounding with .NET, but you must do it with a computer in front of you working through the examples and case studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent presentation of topics.","review":"The authors never seem to stay focused on the topic at hand for more than three or four sentences.

Charlie Brown is supposed to be a kids-only universe, where adults are not even audible, let alone seen. The grown-up animation looks nothing like the peanuts - it's as though modern animation had been cut and pasted into the show.

I think Schulz probably died before he'd actually finished the drawings himself and someone else continued to finish the video by adding adults. \\"It's the Pied Piper, Charlie Brown\\" is such a dissappointment with adults.

If you enjoy watching mice Riverdancing and squaredancing, and like the old \\"corrupt Mayor\\" routine, then you will enjoy this video.

Instead we have ADULTS TALKING & discussing their problems. Through out the entire show, I kept thinking of the way it should have been told.Now this is not the first Charlie Brown Special to include adult voices, that violation goes back to \\"SNOOPY's REUNION\\" where the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm owner talks for no reason at all.The bonus material is not specific to this special, it is more of a general look at the making of these specials.

I have not needed a tripod to capture soccer action, and it has delivered bright sharp action shots consistently from the sideline. Will try it with indoor sports next. I tried the active VR from a moving car and the images were sharp as well. The major drawback is price, but there does not seem to be an alternative for such a high quality lens unless you jump up to the $4000+ range for the super fast sports lenses. Another reason I committed to this lens is that it is supposed to accomodate a teleconverter with good results.

To the extent that I tried to find a book about this thinking it had already been printed and I had missed it; only to find out that it has not been printed yet.

The Will of the Empress is certainly more mature than the Circle of Magic, but I doubt that it has been written that way to discourage younger fans of Briar, Tris, Daja, and Sandry from reading it. I was especially impressed with her handling of homosexuality through Daja (and passing mentions of Lark and Rosethorn). She introduced the relationship the way any other relationship would be introduced, and never treated it as anything other than what it was - a perfectly normal occurance. Showing younger children that the entire world isn't straight and white is no small task, especially with a well-loved series such as the Circle of Magic, but Tammy does it with style."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Tamora Pierce","review":"I am rating this book very low as I normally love her books.

Instead I got a whole lot of pages of temper tantrums, misplaced trysts and political maneuvering ... For example the 4 have the same fights over and over, the intimacy between the characters and there love interests usually blends well into the story, in this book it was like she was trying make a statement, which she repeat over and over.

A much better read than some of her other stuff, this takes the characters we know and love from the Circle books and reunites them again. There is some backstory mentioned she didn't write in the Circle Opens series, leading to a disconnected feeling, but that could have been intentional. Some of the problems and scenes feel forced, and I'm very upset with Ms. Pierce for stereotyping Daja the way she did (read to find out), but overall it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised.","review":"After hearing mixed reviews about this book, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it and ended up reading it all in one day (even though it's a fairly thick book!).While I wouldn't say it is one of my favorite of Pierce's books, it was still a good read; every time I thought the plot was beginning to wrap up, something new would be thrown in- but not in a way that seemed out of place or didn't make sense.I was also surprised (in a good way) about the development of Daja's romance, and the way the four main characters have grown up- their personalities reflect this and yet they still feel like the same characters from the previous books.In short, not one of Pierce's best books but still very enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't read all of the Circle of Magic and the Circle Opens series' yet, but if you already have then I think you will probably find this an interesting read and worth the money to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do NOT look at the map!!","review":"Very good book, will be enjoyed by anyone who liked the earlier series (Circle of Magic, The Circle Opens).But DON'T look at the map in the front of the book.

I read it twice in one week. It is one of the best Joshua books thus far. It came at a time when I was searching for answers - answers to why some churches are not meeting the spiritual needs of their families. It made me realize I was not alone in not having my spiritual needs met at church. Fr. Joe has such a strong insight into each of us and knows how to tell us how Jesus would respond. I would strongly recommend the book for anyone in search of answers about their faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I've read all of Girzone's books and this one ranks definitely at the bottom of the list. Although he did stimulate some heavy pondering on my part about the role of the bible, other than the tearjerking opening scene with the little boy this book left me flat. Since he's a retired priest I've come to expect some level of Catholic theology but in my humble albeit Protestant opinion this book went over the line.

It appears to rely heavily on oral recountings by individual soldiers and civilians as well as official military formation histories. The book does a good job presenting the salient features of a complicated battle over difficult terrain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American experience","review":"Surely, as another reviewer pointed out, this book is a look at the American experience in the battle. However, that doesn't keep this book from being amongst the best about the Battle of the Bulge. Toland makes you feel like you are there. The chapters are broken up so that the book is highly readable and very fast paced. An excellent work of military history that makes you feel like you are there. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"This is an outstanding book. On the one hand, it appears to be a serious historical work with careful and extensive research. On the other hand, it captivates the reader's interest as well as any novel. I think many who might not like wading through a stuffy historical account would find this book highly readable. However, the cast of characters and the number of places is near dizzying. This book contains a number of battle maps, but I think a thorough reader would want a good european atlas nearby. I will have one at hand the next time I read this book (it is certainly good enough to be re-read). This book will wet your interest to read more about the Battle of the Bulge and other World War II european battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bulge book to begin with...","review":"I can't claim to know if this is the BEST book ever written on the Bulge as I haven't read all of them. But, as someone who was looking for an easy to read introduction into the overall scope of the Battle of the Bulge, I can highly recommend this work. Lots of fascinating first hand accounts from civilians caught in the struggle as well the the GIs and the Germans fighting the battle on both sides. Also, there are several detailed maps showcasing the major engagements as the conflict progresses. A good jumping off point that could lead to more extensive study of the Bulge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toland like Ryan","review":"Battle is one of the more accesable books on the Battle of the Bulge.

It will appeal more to a young-adult audience as it is a very typical sword and sorcery fare. I will say these were among the first fantasy novels I read and I enjoyed them at the time; they were instrumental in starting me on a lifetime of reading. When I re-read them when I was older, although I found the story flatter than I did as a youngster, I still had fun with it.

But a few stories redeemed the whole book and made it worth the purchase price. The Competitor, Wasabi, and Delta Boys are three great stories that sizzle and guarantee a happy ending. The Competitor is not your typical anonymous sex story. Wasabi shows how even older gay men can get someone off and Delta Boys has a great spin on the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" military hook up."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Your Mind Wanders at Mass","review":"great little book.

I am a huge fan of Stevie Wonder, and \\"Do I Do\\" is my favorite song from his entire catalogue. It really swings, with great guitar and percussion as well as some nice horn flourishes...don't forget Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet solo, either. :) The rendition of the song on this disc is AWFUL. Yes, I know karaoke versions don't sound exactly like the original record. However, this one sounds NOTHING like how \\"Do I Do\\" is supposed to sound. The production company transformed the song into an unrecognizable smooth jazz mess.Mind you, I do like jazz records...but not jazz records that are supposed to be R&B; dance records.

The song is classic 80's Brit-pop with guitars, guitars, guitars meeting lyrical hooks that catch the listener with each listen. The lyrics are thoughtful and the excellent rhythm section carries each song, subtle underneath the rave-ups, stand-out on occasion. Almost the perfect pop record.

Book consists of Leys' notes, nothing more than an outline of what the book might have been if he had put some effort into it.

The Batavia half is over too soon and the second half of the book has nothing to do with the Batavia. It's about the author sailing on a ship called the Prosper.

I have both copies, mainly because I was curious to see how Bert Sugar re-ranked some of my favorite fighters. For example, Sugar Ray Leonard moved from #56 to #25. Overall, this is a well-written, entertaining book. It's probably not logical to rate fighters from different eras, but the concept is hard to resist for a boxing fan, especially one interested in its early history. As with many others reviewers, I don't agree with some of Sugar's rankings, but overall his list makes good sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read","review":"Very easy way to learn the basics about the greatest boxers in history. Burt Sugar is the best for a reason. Some nice stories and details. But basically just 100 thumbnails."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gentleman C grade","review":"This book 'reads' as if Mr. Sugar spoke into a recording device rather than actually writing the words. In other words, much of the book sounds like spoken rather than written words. Also, Mr. Sugar places some fighters at a ranking that is hard to understand. For example, Gene Tunney defeated Jack Dempsey twice and fought Harry Greb. Jack Dempsey was famously battered by Greb in sparring sessions, fought infrequently after becoming champion, did not fight black fighters. Yet Mr. Sugar places Dempsey ahead of Tunney. Ultimately the ranking of fighters is a difficult proposition, but consider that Mr. Sugar places Dempsey well ahead of Larry Holmes. Can you imagine the thoughts Mr. Dempsey might have had, if he looked across the ring and stared at Larry Holmes in his prime, rapier jab intact?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've always admired and respected Bert Sugar for his intelligent and often humorous analyst of boxing history and the great fighters of the past, however, I must sadly say this book was terrible. Aside from an occasional comical quote or commit the book was simply silly and insulting to any boxing aficionado. For example, Bert actually ranked Joe Frazier higher than Carlos Monzon and Marvelous Marvin Hagler in this publication. He did this despite the fact that Carlos Monzon and Hagler were vastly more dominate fighters in their eras as well as having far longer and more glorious title reigns. Also his decision to not include all-time greats such as Lennox Lewis and Michael Spinks was ridiculous especially when you take into consideration some of the fighters that did make the list.

It is refreshing to see a minority film in which the characters are not stereo-typed with street language and poverty jokes. Instead you get a refreshing script that could have been written for any actors. Darrow Igus turns in a strong performance as the doctor hoping to conquer society thru his army of zombies. Unfortunately, the film is only 72 minutes, much of it padded with musical performances (all geared toward selling the sound track) Because of this there is little room for character development and motives. The zombies are not flesh eating gory zombies. They are mind controlled victims of musical lyrics. There is enough horror to make this enjoyable and I hope this offshoot of Full Moon continues to produce further pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies in the world!","review":"This movie is very poor.

This disc contains 15 (16 if you count the \\"hidden track\\") tunes including the two that managed to crack the pop top-100 in the mid-60's. This group had much more potential than the powers at Motown chose to develop. Had they been given the material and attention a la the Marvelettes or Martha and the Vandellas, their name would be equally as recognizable today. The possibilities are evident in the Norman Whitfield-penned \\"Needle In A Haystack\\" and \\"He Was Really Saying Something\\". If you're a Motown fan and would like something beyond the ubiquitous super-girl-group material, this is an excellent find.The sound quality is typically Motown - sometimes muddy and harsh and the entire disc is in mono but that in itself doesn't negate the enjoyment of hearing these hard-to-find sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last!","review":"We Motown fans who have been nagging the label for 30 years to release a Velvelettes album can now at last stop whining. Here it is, all their single sides, a few unreleased efforts and great packaging and notes.

Many, many names of places, persons, misspelt. Military acronyms used without any explanation. Descriptions of battle situations (many!) are also confusing: Who just shot who exactly? It's like drowning in a swamp of dreary facts, with no decent analysis of anything. The author has taken no trouble at all to inform, be precise, explain. Lots of people quoting: but who? The book is an endless puzzele. The author made a mess of it, which is about the only thing doing any credit to the war he describes.Ernst Frankemolle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality at Low Low Price","review":"We bought numerous sets of these t-shirt/sweatshirt combos.

It's incredible to see how he clearly has an idea of what the images should look like, but even as they're being constructed in front of the documentary camera it's difficult to see his vision -- it only becomes really clear when the final print is viewed. The documentary itself is \\"camcorder-gritty\\" and that works for the most part, but I would've liked more detail in places. This documentary is also a fun look at the widely-varied people of the United States. This is definitely a film I will recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"I posed for Spencer in Buffalo","review":"Beautiful, funny, eye-opening. Is Spencer a genius? Beats me.

We had 1800 models (including a former Congressman!) show up and pose naked at the Central Terminal in Buffalo NY August 15, 2004, with as many aged over 50 as under 30 (a first, we were told). I have never seen so many people so happy to be anywhere. Overheard: \\"I knew I'd run into someone here from work - why did it have to be you?\\" This video goes as far as it can to capture the Spencer Tunick experience. Will you break down and watch it naked? Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quietly Hypnotic","review":"Joe Strummer lovers may need a few repeated listenings toget into this CD because it's much more sedate than his otherworks...a few tracks could even be characterized as \\"lounge\\"music, but it is definitely worth buying.

I managed by myself but carrying up stairs was tough I had to slide/push it up. The assembly and instructions were very simple - I had no issue and no parts were missing. The hardest part to assemble was putting the door on at the end of assembly.

He is an engineer and deal with far more complicated issues everyday. When we contacted the company about this they said they would send new feet and screws for attachment. We waited two weeks with nothing before calling again. Once we received them, and they didn't work either, we just tried to report the serious assembly problems to any product engineer and get a return label and full refund for this awful product.If you want something in similar quality but probably more reliable customer service, go to IKEA-you can buy two like this that are better looking anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied :)","review":"I'm so happy I got my order yesterday but this item is very heavy I had to ask my boyfriend to help me lifted it up.

Creating Impasse was a collaborative effort of writers, actors, technical crew and artists. The result is a charming experience that delves into how we can drop into that dark place of immobility and stay there practically unaware we are deep in a rut.

The film gently explores how six people unglue their psyches and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor quality, beware","review":"I purchased these speaker stands because they were the cheapest I could find. I have small satellite speakers that are extremely light, so I figured that this would be a decent solution. Out of the 4 stands that I bought, 2 will absolutely not work as far adjusting height (they just slide down to the lowest position), and one had screws that were stripped out on the base. I can make repairs and rig the stands to work (just to avoid the hassle and expense of returning), but I had to do it over again I would not buy these stands. I'll leave it at 2 stars because they were so cheap, and they do look nice, but remember that you usually get what you pay for, and in this case, maybe a bit less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly disapointing, but not at all bad.","review":"I love this movie, but having also read the book, I'm slightly dissapointed.

It was an awful movie, not faithful to the book at all (oh yeah Frank Peretti the author, was in the movie!)!!! There is no one part that was entirely faithful. It was such a good book I was expecting so much more from the movie. I mean they had about 5 seconds devoted to one of the coolest parts in the book, and they even screwed that up! Wrong characters and everything. Abel Frye did not hang himself there ten years before, he never even exsisted for crying out loud! Let's just say, if you're going to make a book into a movie do it well or don't do it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"AIR BUDDY AND SPY KIDS AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL","review":"I had high hopes for this to be a creepy thriller but it had more of an after school special feel to it. This movie is geared towards younger audiences and I would hope that someone older than 21 might get something out of it but likely not. The eccentric forensic scientist was annoying and the scene where the first kid gets decontaminated was laughable. In a far fetched twist to the plot, the real threat shifts from devil worshipers to an invasion of big spiders. The nuclear family and their crime solving dog was just a little too perfect for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action, Action, and more action!!!!","review":"I was very surprised with how well this movie is made!!

This is based off of the book by the same name written by Christian author Frank Peretti (of whom I am a huge fan) and it follows the plot line perfectly. This movie addresses many of the issues that teens face today, like peer pressure, ridicule, and conflicting beliefs. Frank Peretti pulls you in and doesn't let go of you until the last page and the movie does the same- which is what really counts in a movie. This is one of the best movies that I have seen recently and, if you want to see a good scary movie or a good Christian movie, this is highly recommended for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is far better","review":"There's little I can say to recommend this movie to you other than the fact that the book is great. The movie takes a complex and entertaining book with well-thought out Christian themes and over-simplifies both its plot and moral story. Please don't judge the book by this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"I think if you're a young teenage Christian looking for a movie that will make you feel like a good guy, you'd probably enjoy this movie. I don't really see anyone else liking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangman's Curse is Bad Filmmaking","review":"Frank Peretti should stick to his day job of writing b-grade Christian horror novels. His presence as an actor in Hangman's Curse ruins an otherwise B-grade after-school-special-esque film. His acting is so bad it causes unintentional laughter. The movie is full of stereotypes and bad acting. The plot is preposterous and illogical. And of course there is the big Christian message of \\"Jesus loves me\\" in the end scene. This movie is badly acted produced and directed, and is not worth 101 minutes of your time. Christians need to learn to make better films without overt agendas and bad acting, or the whole genre will suffer. And again, anyone who let's Frank Peretti act in a movie of his own B-grade novel should be damned to hell for all eternity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good...","review":"I personally did not like this film. It is absolutely nothing like the book. The book is awesome compared to this movie. There are so many things that the movie left out. I was totally upset how they didnt mention God or Jesus in the movie when they do in the book. I also didnt like how boring it was and how predictable the whole movie is. The book is very surprising and makes you want to keep reading.. In my opinion, I think the book is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LESSON!","review":"The Hangman's curse is a great movie it sends a lessons that most High schools can relate to. and sadly some times bulling can result to a tradgic event like in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is WAY BETTER!

I personally could not stand the way they change everything and took all the details out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor presentation","review":"When I orginally got this movie I thought it was going to be a horror movie. Maybe a B horror film at it's worst. This movie would have been ok if I was watching it on an \\"Afternoon Special\\" and I was 13 years old again at it's best. I also didn't think that this movie would have had Christian undercurrents as well. It would have been ok if it would have said that on the back of the DVD and I would not have watched it. I was very disappointed in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and embarrassing to watch","review":"Some time back, I was handed a tract by a well-meaning Evangelical Christian. Unfortunately, the tract was inappropriate aside from the fact that I didn't invite that kind of conversation with this total stranger. The tract was so full of stereotypes, straw-man arguments, and childish scare tactics (little pictures of souls gnashing their teeth that they hadn't committed to Jesus before they died) that it made me wonder if Christians just check their brains at the door when they go into church.And then there's this DVD. While it's tempting to be offended by the stealth marketing (I wouldn't knowingly have paid money to be preached to), I actually found myself embarrassed for the people who made the movie. It reveals a lot more about the insecurities of the moviemakers than it does any spiritual truths. The real message of the movie? Christians can be cool, too. As long as they don't think too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I've seen in last five years...","review":"People, save your money...find better way to spend two hours, especially if you are older than 5 years.Compared to this movie, Spy Kids (all three parts) are real Master-piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"RX Nutrition","review":"The RX Nutrition DVD's are VERY well done.

However, for those of us who are fans of Tina Turner and Whitney Houston, when their indivigual segments appear, trust me, they literally own the stage and crowd.Whitney's duet with Mary J. Blige was fantastic. I Will Always Love You was over the top. When all the Divas came together to sing I'm Every Woman, Whitney was the best of them all.Tina Turner's segment, especially with Elton John, rocked the building.The other Divas who appeared, were no match for Whitney and Tina."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIVAS OH OK","review":"I ordered the tape version. I must say I was disappointed that Whitneys songs were edited. Its not right, and others. Tina did an excellent job with proud MARY. She proves age is just a number. Turner is a Diva indeed! Brandy what was going on there, she was terrible. And really shouldn't of performed if she had a sore throat. But to me she sounded the same as she always have. Having Cher come out to Tinas song wasn't a good ideal. Tina could of handle that by her self. People were jumping up, hopefully for not Chers lip singing. Mary J. Blige i'm not a big fan of hers, she did alot of screaming. Whitney could of done that song much better alone. Faith Hill is ok she came out to help Brandy who needed it. Leann is a stunning young lady, and she'll get even more better with time. Whitneys I will always love you was great. Though she could of done better. See her performance at the Artisa 25th celebration. She really did an excellent job.

Each time I saw it, it seemed like the audience viewing it with me was totally different demographically from the times before. This is my new all-time favorite film. I respect the opinions of the people who say they hated it and that it was 2-1/4 hours of their lives wasted. I respect that opinion; I just don't understand it. The acting is great, the scenery is great and it deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. I guess it's also a matter of personal opinion whose performance was better, Heath's or Jake's. From a technical standpoint, Heath Ledger nailed the role of his career. Ennis Del Mar was a more nuanced character and had several more shades of grey than that of Jack Twist. However, Jake Gyllenhaal's talent can't be denied and I think in some ways I was able to embrace his character much more easily than Heath's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brokeback Mountain DVD","review":"One of the more lousy movies out there. It is always interesting to see how non-cowboy/western people believe everything Hollywood puts out there for viewers who believe their spin on things of which the general public know little to nothing about. Perhaps, these viewers believe these fallacies because this is what they want to believe instead of beliefs based on unbiased facts. That being said, the large majority of \\"cowboy\\" representation in this movie is a farce. I mean really, what is Hollywood after here?

I was left with just random mumblings. I have not read the story, but I'm thinking it is probably much better than the film. I can see that there was a good story to be told within, but it was just not explored. I am sorry this movie wasn't what it could have been. I don't recommend it.

One thing has bugged me though. For a good production, they let it go out with what I consider a major mispronounciation in the ending song. Maybe only a westerner would know, but the word in \\"get along little dogie\\" is pronounced with a long o--it means stray calf. The singer says doggie, which is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving Title","review":"It does say Latin American version but guess what? I thought it was in dubbed in Spanish but its not. It's the English version I have-very disappointing though.

I must say I didn't like the movie but my wife did and she is the one who made me purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the first or the best","review":"This is not the first movie with a gay love story as the theme and it is not the best. The first true gay love story I saw was a wonderful movie called Big Eden. It was much better than this movie in its story telling. Brokeback is about a violent and sordid gay relationship. It is a beautifully filmed and well acted soap opera. If you would rather see a movie about true romantic love and commitment, check out Big Eden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overrated!","review":"I went into this movie wanting to like it, I really did. But I just didn't and here's why:For one, Heath Ledger is almost impossible to understand. He mumbles throughout the whole movie!I also never really bought that they were in love, they just like having sex with each other. If Jack really loved Ennis, why did he cheat on him?The movie wants you to feel bad for Jack and Ennis, but I felt sorry for their wives who they lied to and cheated on.The editing was bad, it was difficult to tell how much time had passed. The actors did not age well. It just didn't look believable at all. Putting a mustache on Jake Gyllenhal doesn't make him look 20 years older. It makes him look like a kid playing dress up.The part where one of them says \\"Why can't I quit you\\" is laughable in its cheesiness.The one good thing about this movie was the beautiful scenery and cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Responding to Reviewer Kyle Bob \\"tyrone\\"","review":"It is sad to see that, while the world is evolving intellectually, some people's brains seem to be de-evolving.Brokeback mountain is more than a Gay movie. It demonstrate love as an universal subject, which anyone with half a brain can understand. But obviously not you.My advice to you: keep these comments to yourself, or you will attract many angry letters to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"If Universal is smart, they will delay the release of the \\"SPECIAL COLLECTORS' EDITION\\" until they can add something with more \\"meat\\" to it. Brokeback Mountain fans are very disappointed. This is evidenced by the lousy reviews given this edition here at Amazon. Many of us were hoping for the inclusion of the legendary \\"hippie\\" scene that was deleted from the original release, as well as a director's commentary, and possibly a commentary with Jake and Heath. Maybe when this \\"special\\" edition doesn't sell, Universal will sit up and take notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the lines you will here again","review":"this is another movie that is as close to the bok as you will see"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film, but digital copy blocked outside America","review":"Warning to foreign buyers: I already own this movie on blu ray, and it's definitely a 5-star experience, but I bought this release purely to obtain the digital copy.When I opened the box, I found that the digital copy is accessed via the Universal website. When I try to access the download, I'm refused because I'm in Australia.It doesn't concern me what the reason for this blockage is, it amounts to theft. Nowhere on the product page does it indicate that the digital copy is blocked in other countries. If I had known that the digital copy wouldn't work, I would not have bought this set. I feel that I've wasted my money, and I won't be buying any further Universal discs that falsely advertise digital copies included."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a story of trying to be with the one of love, gender doesn't matter","review":"The unfocused, teary stares of each of them, especially Health Ledger (Ennis Del Mar), is so familiar to anyone who has yearned for a loved one out of reach. As a recent widow I could relate in my grief to those stares and found camaderie and comfort. The story is universal. It shouldn't matter who the players are. We are souls who love."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC movie","review":"Forget all that you've heard about this movie as the \\"gay cowboy\\" film...if you have a problem with that (in which case, there are other issues at play with you that I won't go into), never fear. The only strikingly \\"gay\\" scenes in the movie are done with early on and they are done with sensitivity and grace.Rather, you should think of this film as a simple, if heartbreaking story, of unrealized love. Featuring absolutely stunning cinematic scenery and incredibly subtle performances by the cast, this is a love story for the ages. Among the best movies of the last decade - it is impossible to watch this movie and not be moved by the sheer grief and passion simmering beneath the two rough-hewed main characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart stopping. Wonderful","review":"I have watched this 3 times. Each time I am more deeply moved. The heartbreak, the sincerity, lonileness, greatest love of all, next to that of man for God, that of man for man. Sex is just a passing expression of the great depth of devotion and need. A story of love, not a story of lust.Jim"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly Beautiful","review":"I have seen this film 5 times in the theater and everytime I cry for Jack and Ennis. Both try so hard to do what life expects them to be. The women in this film are very talented actresses and I cry for their characters as well. Society's rules throw these two men into a life of sadness and want for no good reason. This film is beautifully done and the scenery is breathtaking. It is a gift to the world. As a straight white married women I learned that gay love is as powerful and beautiful as mine is for my husband. I learned so much. Love and acceptance is what Jack Twist and Ennis DelMar wanted and that is all they wanted. I cry for them.Silk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I watched Brokeback Mountain with Natasha my girlfriend last night. She had already seen it in the cinema when it came out, and ordered it as soon as it was available on DVD. It is a beautifully shot look at the way wandering cowboys worked and the often harsh life they lead. It's amazing to think that the story is set as recently as the 1960s since it almost feels as though it was set in the nineteenth century. The landscape itself has a timeless quality. The soundtrack was particularly haunting, certainly moving my girlfriend Natasha to tears in several places."},{"rating":"1","title":"agreed...

Devoid of any exploitation and containing little violence, \\"Brokeback\\" emerges as a wonderfully written, skillfully directed story of two men, circa 1963 that are unable to share their love openly. The performances range from excellent (Jake Gyllenhaal and - especially Michelle Williams) to the amazing, career-defining performance of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar. Known beforehand as a pretty-boy Austrailian Actor, Mr. Ledger masterfully keeps Ennis Del Mar's emotions as tight as a balled-up fist as he is incapable of to show Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist the depth of his love. The final 30 minutes of this film are as wrenching and honest as anything committed to film. Don't miss this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio, anyone?","review":"I just received my fullscreen DVD copy full of anticipation. The quality is top notch with the exception of the sound. I had to turn the volume to full strength with little result. And let's face it...the soundtrack is a vital part of the success of this masterpiece. Is there a solution out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special about this Collector's Edition","review":"This \\"Collector's Edition\\" is a big disappointment. Not only is the transfer exactly the same as on the previous releases, there are not many new extras, anyway. The space of the second disc was probably not at all required. The biggest disappointment is that again the three hour Director's Cut of the movie is not made available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open space for an open mind","review":"Beautifully filmed movie! Mr. Lee deserves his Oscar. You have to keep your mind wide open to watch this movie; as wide as the cinematography allows you to. Keep in your mind and hearts the human sensibilities and emotions portraited by the actors. You don't have to be gay to understand their relationship; there's no sexuality in the human spirit, but only in the love that we feel for each other in the purest sense. I found myself teary eyed at the end of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say That Has Not Been Said Already?","review":"A phenonmenal movie through and through! It is sad that so many people are still holding prejudice about homosexual people. The world we live today function on acceptance, and it is through accepting others for who they are that we have the great nation we live in today. Perhaps it is time for people who say that this movie is spreading homosexual propaganda that if people do become gay from watching this movie, then perhaps these people are already gay to begin with. True love has no limit, and if people can just put their prejudice aside, they will see this movie as the great movie it truly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't get me wrong","review":"the film is a fiver, but this collector's edition didn't quite cut the mustard with me. The package is nice, and the cards (one a replica of the one Jack sent to Ennis!) are great, but I'm mainly interested in the bonus material, and that was pretty mediocre. A lot of comments from people involved in the film, or film people in general, but especially the exclusive 'reactions-to-the-film' segment should have probed deeper into the reactions of the average American movie-goer, both good and bad. Since the film caused controversy it would have been fitting to address it properly to show that many movie-goers actually changed their minds about homosexuality after seeing the film, and that the film transgressed this theme.The overall impression of the bonus material is that of an internal affair, which is a pity since this film is very much addressed to the public. That's its strength.An interview with writer Annie Proulx wouldn't have gone amiss either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most perfect film ever. . .","review":"As a movie aficionado, I make a practice of seeing films that pique the intellect, the imagination, and the heart. Ang Lee's tour de force is a team effort (as evidenced by the \\"extras\\" on the second dvd) that bursts the bounds of all three standards of measurement. There is not a flawed frame in the entire film. I have watched Brokeback Mountain numerous times and I find it an honor to make the journey so lovingly scripted by McMurtry and Ossana. Everyone involved deserves kudos for sweeping courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a beautiful movie","review":"Brokeback Mountain has got to be one of the best movies this year. Why it didn't win the 'Best Picture' Oscar I'll never know. Being an Aussie, I am soooo proud of how far our little Heath has come!! Not only him, but the whole cast did a really respectable job. I've always loved Michelle Williams (I was a big Dawson's fan), and even though she really wasn't in the film that much, she did an amazing job when she was. The casting of Heath and Jake was just perfect. I really recommend you all see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a classic.","review":"I won't tell the story, which you already know, and I won't indulge in fancyadjectives. Simply said, this film will last. Its reputation will not only stay atthis elevation--it will rise.Well, a few adjectives: it is spare. It is honest. It is devastating. It is true.It is (so far) unique--one of a kind.The people who made this $14 million dollar film (which has grossed $82 milliondomestically and $150 million in theaters alone, with double that to come onDVD, are heroes. The director, the actors and actressses, the writers--they allworked for relatively little money by Hollywood standards, and they managed tomake this staggeringly good film. Again, they are heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Your Time and Money","review":"Perhaps one of the best movies ever made. Concise, Intense, and all the actors performed incredibly well in the movie. Completely focus on the purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brokeback Mountain, I Solute You","review":"This movie is a breakthrough from all the corruptions corporations have done to the movie industry.Brokeback Mountain is an extraordinary love story, in an oppressive time. I wish I can say that I would have wanted to see them together in this movie. Unfortunately, THAT would make this movie a fairy tale, since the world has not developed to that point of tolerance yet, and certainly not when and where the movie takes place.Nevertheless, Brokeback Mountain is a breakthrough for humanity, and I pay my salute to the actors and makers of this movie, for making this movie possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, Remarkable","review":"I loved this film. I have always been a big E. Annie Proulx fan and the movie certainly did her short story (of the same title) the proper justice.Aside from the absolutely breathtaking cinematography and perfectly customized soundtrack, this film encompasses the turmoil and heartbreak of an impossible love story. It is sad and touching and yet also a harsh reminder of the current of prejudices that comes up hard against homosexual/homosocial behavior.I praise Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger for their performances. They managed to be both passionately sexy and boyishly uncertain in their characters...tough and yielding simultaneously. I imagine they have done the author of this story proud. There was very little deviation from the original text, which, unfortunately, is a rarity. In my humble opinion, it will be difficult for either of these actors to top what they have done here. Bravo. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"People, don't lose your cool","review":"In the world we live in today, people have begun to let themselves grow out of their prejudice and restricted standard of living to become open, accepting people. There are, however, a few people who are not ready for the progress, and hence leave negative reviews about this movie.Brokeback Mountain is a fantastic movie about two men hopelessly in love in an oppressive time. This movie is a significant step towards a free world, but it alone is not enough. It would take a lot more masterpieces like these before everyone is ready to accept the movie, and the Oscar Board to nominated a movie featuring same-gender love. Bombing angry letters on review board is not going to do anyone any favor.Just mark that comment as inappropriate, and let it be done with that. There is no reason to lose your cool over a stupid comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"After viewing the movie for around the 12 time already, I cannot say that I am surprised by the stream of 4 and 5 star reviews on Amazon.

Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Is the World Punishing True Love?","review":"A reviewer recently wrote that the two men are cheating on their wives, and viewers are tolerating that. What this reviewer forgot to answer, is why.The reality is, these men were forced into marriage. The relationship was doomed to fail from the beginning, and if it was another time and place, they would never have got married, and would, instead, spend their life together as they should.Viewers understand that, and that's why people loved these two characters, even after the tragedies they caused. The movie utilized true drama, and thoughts, protraying a love story that will last till the end of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Sad, Touching","review":"I don't wanna talk too much, but to summer it up, the movie is very well done, the acting is great (especially with straight actors in the lead!!!)

Ang Lee, you are very good, Heath & Jake are simply AMAZING"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new classic","review":"A stunning, heartbreaking achievement.

We decided not to continue in a straight setting as the movie stars in this movie did, we divorced and lived happily ever after-32 years now. Our prospective families and children love us both. No regret,no mistake! We made the right choice and the movie is the right choice!!!!Unlike hiding love and loosing that love without resolution as in the movie, we will be buried together and God loves us too. I don't think I'll see people who hate and judge (as only God is impowered to do} in heaven. Buy the movie,open your eyes, you MIGHT JUST GROW IN LIFE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a movie that has storyline!","review":"I am sure that all of you have already read the many reviews about this movie. So instead of giving out spoilers, I just want to say how much of a breakthroughs this movie is to the movie industryAmericans have always had a reputation for being simple minded. Part of the reason is their tendency to judge something by its cover rather than what it truly is. So many people focus their attention on action movies that they never stop to appreciate the beauty of the plot.Brokeback Mountain has set a new standard to the film industry. It shows people that we are no longer brainless robots that believe in propaganda, but intelligent beings who have the mind to appreciate beauty and stories. I would give this movie a 10 star, but there is no such function."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of 2005","review":"This is a wonderful masterpiece which no recent movie can compare with. Definitely the best movie of 2005. I watched \\"Crash\\" a couple of weeks ago, it was a good movie, but I still cannot figure out how it beat Brokeback Mountain for Best Picture at the Oscars. This is a landmark film that will be remembered for generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is This Really a Western Movie?","review":"The biggest difference between Western Movies and Eastern Movies is probably that, while Eastern Movies shows turn of events, conflicts, and survival by clinging to the soul, Western Movie are mostly just Laughs, Anger, Fear, or Tears. Rarely are messages so woven into the movie that it cannot be understood, only felt. So I was quite surprised when I saw two major Western Movie stars acting out a movie that is so delicate. This movie, obviously, moved my very spirit, but I was more surprised to find that the western society is able to produce a movie with such degrees of beauty. Perhaps there are still hopes for the movie industry after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended viewing for all","review":"Well-done movie that approaches if it does not indeed capture Perfection in every scene, character and nuance. You do not have to be either gay or a cowboy to like this movie. It is probably the best of the year and richly deserved the praises heaped upon it, contrary to Fox News' dismissal of the film in favor of \\"King Kong.\\" I saw both films and King Kong is a B action movie. Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece and the best Western (yes, it is a Western) romance I have ever seen.Unlike lesser films, there is no preaching, no moralizing, no grandstanding; nor does El Depresso hold the audience in too tight a grip. There are no debates about homosexuality in this movie and don't need to be. It is not a \\"sad\\" movie or a \\"happy\\" movie. Just watch. Worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"i saw this movie and found it boring and it seemed to drag on too long for me. i must say that this is the only movie that i've ever watched all the way through that i actually jumped and cheered when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice scenery, little else","review":"I couldn't agree more with Mary Wells' review.

This movie was nothing new, just basically the same sad plot about two men falling in love ending in tragedy and sadness. YAWN. Boring. Whatever.

It's a Lifetime movie at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"As a movie and measuring the entertainment value, this movie really has none. Just because it is different does not make it good. The characters are not very believable and the story lacks substance. A man who is straight all of his life and then one day wakes up in a tent with another man. Choosing to cheat on his wife just because of an urge. Fine if that is the story, but how can you feel for a character that does not feel he should be responsible to his own family? The movie should have been stronger is its portrayal of the consequences one must endure when you do something so vile as cheating. Basic Instinct the movie comes to mind. He cheated and had to go throw some serious hell because of it which he justly deserved.I still give it 2 stars. Though the acting was bad, still has some minor entertainment value but best served to wait until it comes out on a premium cable channel. Not worth spending extra $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon offering Brokeback Mountain and Walter Mercado in Package Deal","review":"I was not planning on buying Brokeback Mountain, but it was offered as part of a package deal with the new Walter Mercado DVD (which I knew my Girlfriend wanted), so I bought both.

After i saw the movie, all i could think about was how unbelievably depressing this movie was. These men, are just two guys who happen to fall in love with each other. And this doesnt seem to be the kind of love we have today. This is soulmate, eternal love...the kind that seems it will go on for ever. And then this tragedy happens. (And Heath Ledger's acting in this part was incredible). You really start to think about how much he wanted to live his life with Jack, but he couldnt because he was afraid that it end in one of their deaths, but it still does. And i thought that maybe if they had had their life together, this might not have happened, and that's the tragic thing. This movie has really made an impact on the people who have seen it. Some people are too narrow minded to see beyond the \\"boringness\\" of the movie. Not all movies have to be action packed to be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Film with Universal Themes","review":"I'm not going to repeat what has already been said. I have to say I loved this film for many reasons. The music score is haunting and excellent. There is a good reason Gustavo won the Oscar for his compositions. Acting is top notch. Heath Ledger raised his acting credibility by leaps and bounds. I am truly sorry he did not win Best Actor for his heart wrenching performance in this film. Lee's Direction is inspired and the cinematography breathtaking.For those who would condemn this film, I ask that you give it a chance. Brokeback Mountain has no agendas. Brokeback Mountain's themes are Universal and important. This film is a gift.

Like all of the best, it rips at your heart with a wrenching, soulful ache that will not end with the credits. Heath Ledger is simply perfect, as are virtually all of the actors in this film; Ang Lee again nails a place and a time (Sense & Sensibility) with razor-sharp attention to the detail. I so hope that people everywhere will see this movie - it is much bigger than a \\"gay romance\\" - it is about holding things in; about all of the things that keep us from what we want and who we love; it is about all of us. And don't fight the choke in your throat, just cry. It's one of those rare things in life that is truly - cathartic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light-years beyond the hype","review":"I went into this movie thinking that I would hate it, from all of the pop-culture movie critics, but as a movie goes, Brokeback Mountain is wholly englightening.

Not only did he stayed true to the story, he enhanced the emotions, and the essence to the story for the readers. The master filmtography, the extraordinary music, and the fantastic actors in this movie further enhances what this movie brings to its viewers, which is a true demonstration of humanity.This movie deserves all the honors it received.

Just because it was the first of its kind or different does not automatically make it any good. Another year of the awards season and another year of great disappointment. Million Dollar Baby last year started the downward slide for me. Everyone talked about it but it really wasn't that good. Same with this movie BB. For purely entertainment value it has no substance. My wife personally hates any movie that advocates cheating on your spouse behind their back so that does make her a little biased.So from an entertainment value perspective, this movie just doesn't perform. It is a good one to maybe rent for a few dollars, but if you buy it (and you actually have a taste for entertainment), then you will be greatly dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie","review":"...with beautiful scenery, which tells you how bad the movie was... you passed the time watching the scenery"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star for Michelle Williams.","review":"I'm gay, but I am not convinced that these two Bisexual men are profondly in love. Why,when,and how did they love each other? I didn't find in this movie. I think their love story has no sense and pretentious. The only best factor of the movie is Michelle Williams'performance. She deserves the nomination in both Golden Globe and the Academy Award. I really appreciate Ang Lee's the Wedding Banquet,but not this one. In fact, I think Brokeback Mountain is the worst film directed by him. I'm very disappointed with it. I don't wonder why it didn't won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

The two cowboys were victims and later they turned their families into victims of adultery, pain, and betrayal.Many couples got up and left the theatre and it was only a quarter full at best even after the Academy Awards.

I will bring my children and my grandchildren and my parents and my cousins and my aunts and uncles and I don't care about the sex. I want to see that joy over and over again even when I know it has to end in tragedy. In fact, the more wonderful it is, the sooner and more painful the ending has to be. If this movie has a flaw it is the heart stopping abruptness of the post card with DECEASED stamped across it. I needed some music or something to mark the occasion.

Every scene is almost a stand-alone story. And there isn't a single scene that I didn't wish would last just a few more minutes. Not a snoozer in the bunch. From the first scene, where Jack and Ennis are eyeing one another outside the office, the tension between them begins to build. By the time Ennis and Jack decide to switch places on the mountain, even a blind man could tell you it's going to turn into a love story. You already know that one night, real soon, those sheep are just going to have to sleep alone.The rest is a 25 year history of a secret love affair. A quarter century of pain and suffering by two men who couldn't or wouldn't risk bringing the jagged, broken pieces of their lives together, even though they knew how perfectly they fit together. In the end, they run out of time and options. It all becomes a story of what could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate!!","review":"Everything about this movie is first-rate: acting, photography, musical score, editing, and Ang Lee's directing is over the top. I usually prefer wide screen editions, but found the full sreen edition to be just as good. \\"Brokeback Mtn\\" is currently my go-to movie; I've watched it seven times, replayed the love scene even more! It stands as one of the best love scenes ever made with superb acting by Gyllenhaal and Ledger set to that haunting theme.This was my second movie purchase from Amazon and I am very satisfied with both transactions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, yet sad","review":"Brokeback MountainMain Cast: Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne HathawayA raw, powerful story of two young men, Ennis a ranch hand and Jack an aspiring rodeo bull rider, are sent to work together herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain, and what had otherwise been anticipated to be a rather uneventful venture, will soon turn into an affair of love, of lust, and complications that will spand through 19 years of their lives. Through marriage, through children, and through the mighty grip of societal confines and the expectations of what it is to be a man.First, this movie begins in 1963 and during that time, to be gay was absolutely against society rules. Also, if you're hoping that this movie will change your beliefs against people being gay. The movie can't, you must keep an open mind, you have to decide for yourself if you enjoy this or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a masterpiece, but not for everybody's taste...","review":"I found this a little too long, a little too slow, a little too sad to rate five stars. Worth seeing once, it is an honorable effort to portray the power of forbidden love between two modern-day cowboys who would obviously vote Republican on all but gay issues, and perhaps even on some of those. Now that the film is a couple of years old, I think it is safe to reveal that one of the leads does not survive the film. That was the most disappointing part...we come to care about the men, yet one passes from this world with only the briefest of depictions. I was surprised it did not win the Oscar as best film, but the awards were given out before I saw the movie. Now that I have seen it, I think it can be fairly called one of the ten best films of its year, and one of the three most talked about, but not deserving of the top honor for its season. Good performances for sure, but the script could have used some trimming and some punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I caught this on TV and found it kind of a boring cycle of hurt and comfort with a predictable ending.

Ansel Adams would have been proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is waaay overrated","review":"Now I probably would've given this movie 5 stars had it not been for the overwhelming number of people who rave about this movie and that it should have won Best Picture. But I'm starting to see that movies such as this are way overrated. This is just another arthouse type of film. Not an epic as is suggested by some reviewers. I don't care about homosexual issues in society, I don't care about those family relationships and I don't care that it didn't win Best Picture. This film is disjointed and I don't see how Heath Ledger's performance is so great. I could barely make out a word he said. Throughout the whole movie Ledger and Gyllenhaal speak with fake, texas cowboy accents. But I guess these are the types of performances the academy unfortunately respects so much.

No, I am NOT one of those gay hating baptist (if you want to be gay cool whatever) but I am a sane enough individual to admit that this movie was completely a gay parade of nonsense. The plot was in my opinion absolutely boring and idiotic. This is the message I got from this movie, \\"When your atop a mountain and your all alone or your married it's okay to screw your buddy, because it's okay to be gay.\\" Honestly, come on! You have to be honest with yourselves. This movie was just sad in a way that makes you wish you wouldn't have wasted your time. I was hoping to see a beautiful love story that would have helped me understand the love and connection gay people feel. Will and Grace demonstrates a better example. The two men in this movie cheated on their wives and were sex addicts. And if people think that is the greatest movie of all time then they are really delusional."},{"rating":"1","title":"mumbled lines and bad acting","review":"The only redeeming thing about this movie is the scenery. I am not giving this movie one star because of the sexual content. I am giving this movie one star because of the acting.

My advice, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moral issues aside, hasn't anyone noticed that this film just wasn't that good??","review":"I don't care what you think about the moral issues portrayed, this was just not a very entertaining film. It did not deserve such hype. It was extremely slow, and I'm sorry, but Heath Ledger's character was just not likeable. He was a drunk and a terrible father and refused to make a commitment one way or another. How can the struggle about his sexual orientation be compelling when he wasn't even a decent guy on so many other levels. I applaud the director's concept of show-casing bigotry, etc, but at least give us a character who's worthy of rooting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragic love story, nothing more","review":"Forget that they are gay, it doesn't matter.

I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay Love Minus the Eroticism","review":"Many beautiful nature shots can't redeem this dull and overly long flick. There is no real chemistry between the two main characters. The one sex scene is dark, frantic, and anti-erotic. Other than for some rough housing, there is little to make one think these guys are attracted to one another. Too much time is spent on their separate lives. It would have been interesting to get a glimpse of their inner lives, perhaps their fantasies, given they were so adamant about getting together at Brokeback Mountain every year while they were married to women. This director clearly knows nothing about what attracts one person to another."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll call it what it is: boring","review":"If it wasn't about a Gay couple, no one would have seen it.

I did enjoy the commentary by Lee and his partner in crime Schamus for 'Crouching Tiger' so I was looking forward to something like that.
