We have a German Shepherd, our Vet said many of them are not food motivated, and our trainer also recognized the dog is not food motivated.

The knife has been used on board a boat(freshwater)and in a few months was rusted out to the point where tools can no longer be opened. They were stiff to begin with, and now that they are rusted no longer useable. This was to be a replacement for my 30 year old Victorinox Swiss Army knife, but the Swiss Army knife is again back in action.Maybe this knife was never intended to be used in a boating environment, but those of you who are boaters, beware that this is not the product to use onboard.

Of all the great features that the tool has, it is the abilty to deploy 4 tools from the handle w/o opening the tool into its pliers configuration that is the most useful addition to this model. The tool that most of us use the most is a knife and 2 of the 4 \\"external\\" tools are lock-back knives, one serrated and one straight edge.

I have had alot of experience with a lot of different multi tools, and I find that, by far, I use the knives most often. So to have them on the outside is a convenience beyond compare.

It went on to win the 1961 Tony award for Best Musical and has since become one of the most frequently staged musicals by high schools and community groups. The score by Charles Strouse is bright and lively, and Lee Adams' lyrics are clever, especially his satires on the popular music of the day.Columbia's original Broadway cast album is still the best of the 4 available recordings. The London cast with Peter Marshall proves once agan that the Brits just don't understand American performing styles. The dreadful 1963 film tries to turn it into a showcase for Ann Magaret, and the 1995 TV version with Jason Alexander is curiously short on fun.

I thoroughly enjoyed Wobegon Boy. I found myself reading long passages to my wife as we lay on the beach. She didn't mind the interruptions in her reading either. I guess, then we really both read Wobegon Boy. It probably helps to be a PHC listener since many of the book's characters are familiar to us through the radio show. Even those unfamilair with Keillor's show, however, should enjoy the clever writing and gentle barbs at college culture, public radio and small town Minnesota life that Keillor dishes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks, Garrison!","review":"Garrison Keillor, who hails from my neck of the woods, has done a fine job of Wobegoning in WOBEGON BOY.

Those sections were so terrific, that I wished for a lot more of Wobegon, and a little less of the rest of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"An overly long, silly submergence in all things Wobegonian. Keillor's first attempt at a full-length novel ..., and it shows! There are some inspired passages here and there, there are some entertaining chapters, but mostly it's much ado about very little -- and mostly not very funny. One keeps asking oneself, \\"Why am I continuing to plow through this book?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully Funny and Wonderfully Nasty","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read, but under the humor is an undercurrent of anger, in the best sense of the word. Keillor has been pigeonholed as the \\"Prairie Home Companion guy,\\" and his overwhelming success as a radio personality overshadows his great great writing. The sidestory of John Tollefson's involvement in a \\"farm restaurant\\" and the hippie/New Age building contractor who eventually...oh, I won't spoil the plot....is worth the price of the book. At turns laugh-out-loud funny, nasty and sentimental, I've reread this book twice for the sheer pleasure. His best novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keillor at his best.","review":"Warm,funny and down right brillant.

The book is the first that I've read that really doesn't have a plot. It is a gathering of short stories strung together to tell the life of John Tollefson and his ancestors. The book really has no driving force to move it along, but it somehow still manages to move along quite enjoyably.I certainly will consider reading further works of Mr. Keillor's. If you are just looking for an easy, comfortable read then you ought to consider this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I really enjoy Keillor's sense of humor and the compassion shown in his Mr. Blue column. However, this book, my first foray into a Keillor novel, was a huge disappointment. There were a couple of funny passages, but in its entirety the book was excruciatingly dull. I never felt a connection with the main character- he seemed whiny and aimless, dreading the future, and ultimately content to end up as a hausfrau. None of the characters were deeper than a caricature, and their limited, stuttered development was shown to be pointless at the book's conclusion.Perhaps it was asking too much to hope for some sort of epiphany from John. But if this book had meaning, I completely failed to see it. There was no warmth, no spirit, no greater understanding- I simply read a boring novel that went nowhere and tossed it aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Prairie Home Companion\\" in print...","review":"Hey, I love Garrison Keillor! The book was cute, witty, and sharply written. Keillor has a way with words, so much so that we feel pity and alliance with our \\"Wobegon Boy\\" from the start.If you have wanted to take a retaliatory stab at Political Correctness, make fun of your parents, and tell off your boss, read this book. You can do all, at least viscerally, through Keillor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, smart","review":"More stories of the stoic Norwegian Lutherans of Lake Wobegon from America's favorite humorist. I was amazed that a book with such a straight-man low key sense of humor was able to make me laugh out loud so many times.Some of the things (living in New York City, life in academia) I could relate with; in these areas I found his views funny and at times even insightful. More interesting, however, was the fact that I was so compelled by those things with which I have nothing in common (Scandinavian immigrant culture, Minnesota in general). Keillor is a great communicator who reaches across cultures.Although I'm familiar with Keilor from NPR, this is the first novel of his that I've read. One is forced to like the flawed protagonist John Tollefson; and I found myself appreciating the low-key dry humor of Minnesota Lutherans as well.An easy, entertaining read. Funny. Occasionally insightful. Recommended.A trivia note: in discussing Norwegian National Day Keillor gets the date wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Solid Outing By Keillor","review":"Reading a Garrison Keillor book (except for the bizzare Book of Guys) is like laying on a couch next to a fire under a comforter while the rain falls outside. Wobegon Boy continues the Keillor streak of writing \\"comfortable\\" literature. The characters are solidly defined, the dialogue is witty, and the situations that arise in the book are sharply told.There aren't any surprises in Wobegon Boy. The subject is one that Keillor has visited many times. But, then again, one doesn't buy a Garrison Keillor book to be surprised. One gets his books to rekindle the feelings of home and family that one possesses (or wishes they possessed) in their minds. And Wobegon Boy is more than adequate to meeting this task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outside and Inside Kangaroos","review":"Although this book contains incredible photographs I am reviewing it unfavorably based on the age range (4-8). I bought it to use in a Kindergarten classroom. The pictures are too explicit revealing internal organs, stomach and undigested food, the womb, leg muscles and tendons. Luckily, I looked at it before putting it in the classroom. I feel that the students would have been frightened, not only by the graphic nature of the pictures but also by wondering how the pictures were taken. Akin to a dissection book.

I was very disappointed when I received it and set it up and it didn't work. The iPod portion worked fine but neither of the doors on the cd player worked. One just opened and closed repeatedly by itself and the other side wouldn't open at all.

The brainchild of Swedish guitarist (where else?!)Thomas Wolf, this could be an Yngwie CD, but with a more vocal hook oriented style. The production is also excellent, and the playing flawless. These guys started as an AOR band, but this latest (4th) album is radically different, and if you like the speed kings of yesteryear, go for it, technique is back!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Listening music","review":"I love this product and enjoy playing it while I am reading on my Kindle Fire HD.

This book finds Matt Scudder still sober and attending AA (Alcoholics Anonymous). In his spare time he's trying to prove that an accident was actually a murder. While he's not doing that, he's looking for a couple that made a child-porn snuff film.I highly recommend this book for all hard-boiled mystery fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please add color !!","review":"I just received this book, and although the content does meet my expectations, I must say that some figures are of disappointing poor quality (3D protein representation for instance). I haven't seen the original German version, but it looks as if the English (American) editor has saved a few bucks by simply copying the figures on a B&W copy machine. This is outrageous ! We are living in the 21st century, and any 10 years old computer geek is capable of producing high quality color figures with a decent scanner ! Given the price (70 dollars !), I can't give more that 2 stars !"},{"rating":"2","title":"K&N For Crossfire","review":"Easy to install and fit perfectly. Would recommend to my friends K&N and purchase again. Delivery was fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of bad marital advices","review":"The book starts with how supposedly miserable the marriages that our mothers had because these women put themselves after their husbands and children. It asserts the importance of retaining the wife's own identity as an individual by keeping her maiden name, her \\"me time\\", and her career. It also says that men should help with the household chores too because marriage is after all an equal partnership. I like this way of thinking so I decided to buy the book. But it continues with recommendation to have sex affairs with other men (and/or women as well!)in order to stay single-minded and happily married. It also recommends to have sex at least with 10-20 different men before you say 'I do' to your husband-will-be so you know what you're getting from him. And don't bother about your husband's feeling, you must tell him the exact number. I couldn't help but wonder what actually the author's definition of a successful marriage is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book EVER!","review":"If I could give this book less then 1 star I would. There really is no helpful advice for a successful marriage, only an author with disdain for and type of traditional marriage. I almost found it offensive. I kept waiting for the book to get better but it never did. I would compare it to a very long, poorly written, magazine opinion article. Don't waste your money on this crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"Good Quality product. Our birds really enjoy it.

Takes a lot of patience...but he is nibbling this more than any others we've tried.

These pellets actually smell \\"good\\"--sort of fruity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windsom bar stools","review":"The stools were very easy to assemble, the air lift works great. One of the plastic handles broke off a week after I bought them but it did'nt affect the air lift. You can replace the handles with something else. I love the look of my stools. They are very sleek and modern. They don't get a lot of wear and tear because I do'nt use them daily. So they will definitely hold up for quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price.","review":"Assembles quickly. More sturdy than I thought they would be. For the price, you can't beat them. Fit perfectly under the countertop in the kitchen. Nice rubber ring on the bottoms so the tile floors don't get scratched.

Perfect for kids or not too heavy adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bar stools","review":"These stools have been great so far.

Long story short, they are not super supportive and don't feel very sturdy. If you're in the 190-200# range, they will not stay up at the selected height and will eventually sink down to the bottom position.I don't feel comfortable sitting in them and do not feel they support me well or safely. Too bad, they look nice, now they are just ornamentation for the kitchen bar. They may be cheap, but in this case you get what you pay for. Not recommended, unless you weigh less than 120# and don't mind no back support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stools","review":"This is a nice pair of stools for the price.

I recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I couldn't be any more thrilled with this purchase! These stools are a great value for the price. Shipping was super fast (2 days). The fact that they are adjustable and swivel at this price point is amazing. Sure the padding could be a bit thicker, but they are far more comfortable than your standard hard wood stool. They look amazing in at my kitchen counter, and look much more expensive than they were.

But when they arrived I was pleasantly surprised by how well the functioned and looked. Well that lasted about two weeks. After a couple weeks of use the one chair does not adjust any more. When you sit on the chair in lowers itself to the lowest position, and when you get off it raises itself to the highest position. I have played around with the lever for adjusting height but nothing seems to help...... oh well, at least one still works for now. It never fails for me, you get what you pay for, and I didn't pay much for these chairs. Now I am looking for replacements....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This stool was not abused and only lasted 6 mos. The vinyl is ripped at the stitches.

We called Winsome Wood customer service and gave them our item number printed on the box, the representative at Winsome told us this was not their product at all. The company logo did not appear on the box or the name Winsome Wood Airlift Stools. We did our research online to find a customer service number for Winsome based on the description on Amazon.

I'm 26 and don't sit down for dinner - so I wanted it to be a bar atmosphere. I purchased an over-price bar from El Dorado and needed a bar table and chairs. I bought the package with the 2 chairs and the table and they were simple to put together and look great. The only thing is the top of the bar table is like a weird material. Not glass or plastic or wood or MDF... Almost like a black chalk board but not. It seems to be designed this way as an anti-slip technology but it is different. Good height for a bar table and good price with the chairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice table to go with chairs","review":"I recieved this table along with Winsome stools.

These chairs look great and feel solid.The only reason i've not given them a 5 star review is due to how thin the seats are. Not perfect, but for the money they can't be beat.

Needless to say, i've sent it packing back to that store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish, sturdy bar stools - well worth the money","review":"Simple assembly (less than 30 seconds), very sturdy and made of quality materials.. telescoping shaft seems to work well and doesn't slide back down when you sit on it.

Since I bougut them seperately, I would consider the quality and materials used might be different. Will call customer support to see if they will replace the set that is falling apart and report back. After all, a company can't control the quality of everything they make and mistake could be made, but I want to see how they treat the customer after the sale, that is what will set them apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADJUSTABLE BAR STOOLS","review":"LOOKS GOOD, WORKS WELL SO FAR & VERY INEXPENSIVE. SO MUCH SO, WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THEM TO 2 OF OUR FAMILY FRIENDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctioning Chair","review":"I would have given these chairs a 5 star rating, because the chairs are just like they look in the picture. The reason for the 2 star rating is that one of the chairs doesn't have a proper seal for the pressure when the chair is raised. In other words, when the chair is at it's maximum height and someone sits on it, it will slowly go down to the minimum height after about 20 seconds. So it seems to me you are taking a gamble by buying these. Hopefully the other working chair will withstand the test of time.On a separate note, the accompanying table (sold separately) had a big chunk dinged out of the top edge of the table, so I cant recommend that either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I said the same thing about some other tables I purchased at the same time, but the review is the same: poor quality. I realize that in order to get a truly exceptional table, I would have to spend a lot more than what I did for these tables. I get that. But for what I did pay, I thought that at least I would get something that was...a table. I'm not sure these even qualify. The tops of the tables are heavier than the cheap bases. And it doesn't take a genius to figure out what happens next...the fall over with even the slightest bit of weight. They were so bad, I sent them all back and just built some tables out of scrap wood...and the ones I made were better.

It was a gift and I am somewhat embarrassed that they fell apart so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite what I'd hoped for but acceptable","review":"The laminate on the top seems questionable. I'm almost afraid to use it. The edge strip doesn't look sealed to the top piece. The shaft doesn't fit down into the base all the way. I'm not sure you could fit more than one person at this table. It also doesn't seem to like standing still.

What a great deal !!!The only other bar stools i found like these, claimed to be leather (The reveiwers on that web site, claimed they weren't sure if they truly were) for an est.$219 a piece, so at this price point, these cant be beat!!! I was able to assemble them quickly, they look amazing, and i saved a ton of $$$ which is always a plus !!! Would highly recommend this product if ur looking for a stylish, and affordable bar stool. Only had to make one minor adjustment to be made, which was an easy fix: the bolts to attach the seat, to the base, are a bit to long. Which can be felt thru the vinyl cushion. You can procure new bolts locally, use 6mm(dia.) x 10mm(long) bolts, with a (1.0) thread pitch, that will fix the problem.

I was skeptical at first purchasing the table; however, setup was very easy and use/functionality is great for small spaces. The only recommendation I would make is be cautious of what items you put on the tabletop - certain plateware/glassware can leave markings like a chalk board. Not a big deal since the markings are hard to see unless there is direct and bright overhead lighting. Overall I'd rate the product A-."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great counter stools","review":"I bought four of these for my counter level island. They work very well and look great.

Looking at how the seat attaches to the base, it should be a very simple modification to replace the seat portion of this stool with a much more comfortable padded seat - any unscrewable seat from another chair could easily be attached to this base - or make your own. Problem solved! For those who complain about the table getting scratched up after minimal use - why didn't you coat it with a layer or two of varnish before your initial use? Pleased with the base of these stools immensely - great buy at two for $69 with no tax and free ship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Stool for a Neat Price","review":"I ordered these stools to sit at my kitchen counter. These are very nice looking stools! I have to agree with other reviews stating these stools look far more expensive than what they are. I only ordered one set, but will definately be ordering another. The assembly was very simple and took maybe 10 minutes for both. The artificial leather will make for easy cleaning. The fact that they have adjustable height and swivel makes these stools a plus for any intended use. I wouldn't recommend these stools for individuals over 200 lbs.

When you sit on the seat, whether you weigh 120lbs or 200lbs, the seat falls down at least a foot. If you're here to save money, don't, step it up.

Anywhere, it is not a big deal, I use a long knife push it out.For the second, the holes on seat and the holes on the support can not be aligned! Apparently, it is a defect product, I have to use file to make the hole on the support big to bolt the seat to the support.So, unless you have mechanical skill and want spend time to figure out, do not buy the returned production!

The top sits down unevenly and the weight allows for little flexibility in top rising. It is a shame as the manufacturing and materials seems to be very high quality, but the design is horrid.

If I increase the heat control, I get drier waffles that are much browner on the bottom, but not on the top (it's still white). I've had to flip the waffles over to get browning on both sides.Not only the cooking woes, but also the fact that it's heavy and clunky, add up to making this a NOT recommended waffler choice.When I can, I'll find a $15 Toastmaster and toss this crappy VillaWare waffler into a Goodwill donation box."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word for this and it starts with S","review":"Come back here and write a review as soon as you get over feeling foolish for not having listened to these reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"ad is misleading","review":"the ad said vise jaws, not vise jaw, I recieved only one jaw. vise jaws normally come as a set,not happy at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Popeye to be restored in 2007 by Warner Brothers!","review":"In general I like the Digi-View Cartoon Craze DVDs.

Nothing is going to snap off.4) Great engineering.Cons:1) Why include a mini screwdriver? Many Leatherman reviewers have said that this item is easily bent.2) When pulling one tool open, they all come out to say hello.3) You need to open the pliers to get to the tools.4) The worst part of a brand new tool is that the locking mechanism is TIGHT. Watch your fingers when trying to pull open and close the short sharp-edged tools.Conclusion:It's my second favorite tool, right after the Victorinox SwissTool RS.(but the Swisstool's \\"bull-nose\\" pliers can't get-in close like the Leatherman's)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great tool","review":"This and the Victorinox tool are probably the biggest multitools on the market (I'm not counting the Kershaw locking plier, since it's really in a separate category). The Super Tool has thicker handles which allows one more tool per side than the original Leatherman. I especially like the serrated blade, which is very impressive. Another big improvement is the locking mechanism, a big improvement over the original. The rounded grip doesn't cut into your hands like on the earlier version of this tool, and the extra size and length of the Super Tool make the ruler more practical. I own a couple of dozen multitools from various makers and this one remains one of my top 3 favorites. It might be a little heavy for some people to carry around on their belts but I don't mind the extra heft as the extra size makes it a much sturdier and more impressive tool.

The only thing missing were any instructions. However, it didn't take long to figure out which part went where and which screw to use for that part. The table and chairs went together without a hitch with all parts fitting together well and being nicely finished. The table is just the right size for a two year old and should serve well for several years. The materials and construction are such that it may last to the next generation! I weigh well over 200 pounds and the chairs are sturdy enough to support me just fine as I play with my granddaughter.Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The tabletop was broken when we received it and two chair legs didn't fit.

I was looking for something that would last seeing as I have another boy on the way. It's made of real wood and metal hardware. The table and chairs can take the weight of a grown man and are sturdy enough for me to not worry about it tipping over if my son climbs on it. My kid won't go in his highchair anymore he'll only eat at his table. Oh and with the finish pencil and crayons wipe right off. Would highly recomend and look forward to purchasing another kidkraft product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful set!","review":"I bought this set for my 2.5 year old daughter. It was super easy to put together (I had my 11 year old nephew do it!). It's very durable and washes very easily. My daughter already got some crayon on the chair, but it wiped away easily. I do have a table cover on it just to make sure it stays clean. It comes with two chairs, and I will probably want a total of 4, and I know KidKraft sells the chairs separately, so it's easy to add more if you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty disappointed","review":"I bought this table for my kids for Christmas. I was really excited to get it but wish I would have opened it before Christmas eve when my husband put it together. after he has it fully put together and set up under the tree I noticed the top of the table was cracked in more than one place and one of the chairs was missing a piece to the back of it. I really like the look of the table but the flaws bother me a lot.

I opened the box and pulled out the 1/2 inch. The blade has visible pits and dings. The edge feels like a saw blade. I pulled out the 1/4. A burr on the edge, but not bad. Same with the 1 inch. Then I looked at the 3/4. You have to wonder how this set got out of the factory. I have several Frued blades and bits, including a new Super Dado, and really like them, but this is ridiculous. I expected to have to sharpen the chisels when they arrived, but not to have to grind out large dings in the blade.

This thermostat has all the features, but is only compatible with heat pumps. The Hunter site and Amazon don't give a lot of info on this, I found out when I opened the box (can't return that one) and read the manual.

The intertext for Pym's 1958 novel is clearly Jane Austen's EMMA, with the main character again trying to offset the end of narrative possibilities for herself that marriage brings. Philip Larkin praised A GLASS OF BLESSINGS as the subtlest of Pym's comedies, and although it's depiction of grace operating among the very respectable and genteel is very charming and even ultimately moving it is not one of her funnier books (in part because it is told from Wilmet's point of view and she, unlike Pym's more disadvantaged heroines, is so limited in her outlook). But the novel is pretty joyful nonetheless, and its depiction of a 1950s London gay subculture at the end of the book is fairly fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful................","review":"This Movie somehow really grabbed me. The Acting was really good and the plot was great. As funny as it may sound it had some deepness to it which really pulled me in I Highly recommend This Movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I am at a loss for words for how absurd this was. Not over the top enough to be camp, but this story line should be. Dreadful actors playing dreadful characters dreadfully. Stupid plot points, closted politician in a gay B&D secret society BS, parades his bitchy shallow BF around all over town. There are stupid twists, boy goes to a doctor and gets mystery treatments that keep him young, which serves a stupid purpose near the end. Actually at a later time in the film he's the only one that actually looks different. It seems to be some half baked attempt to be a Ken Russel or David Lynch film. Maybe it was daring when it got made, but it's dumb by today's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and disjointed","review":"For me, this movie just didn't do it. The story was too loose and none of the characters were really likable at all. I'm American--Perhaps this movie is more interesting if you're Australian and understand the country culture and the treatment of gay people through the history of the country better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Celtic? Nah","review":"What a lovely book this is, full of happy blond children lavishly photographed amidst charmingly rustic settings. However, the knitwear they're modeling, although clean-lined and attractive, isn't \\"Celtic\\" at all. Yes, there is one Aran-ish tunic in the collection, but unless you are a thirteen-year-old, it won't fit you. A terrific disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not inspirational","review":"This book is geared more towards the beginner, as the variety and patterns in this book are not really inspirational to more experienced knitters.

Skillet Too Hot To Handle!","review":"...Aestherically, the skillet is beautiful and certainly looks and feels sturdy; the problem is, it OVERheats! At 200-250 degrees (which is just one notch above the \\"keep warm\\" control, a full boil occurs--essentially overheating. For instance, when doing a pot roast which requires about 2\\" of water, at 200 degrees, the water boils away within twenty minutes. To add to this, when the \\"beautiful\\" glass lid is in place, too much steam not only escapes from the built-in vent hole, but the lid actually bounces enough to allow liquids to spurt and bubble out--all this at just 200 degrees. One month ago I contacted the manufacturer, asking them how I could correct the problem willing to take whatever measures necessary myself--they have not responded to my letter which gives me cause for concern about the company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mix up on the play list on mine--still okay...","review":"The Cd is fine for my purposes as a beginning guitarist. The Cd is fun and it will definitely help you improve your blues improvisation if you work at it. Having said that, I would have thought that whoever put the listing of tracks together would have had someone edit it for correctness before going to press. Does a listing error detract from the Cd's benefits--no (if you can properly pick out the key). I'm finding that there are lots of blues guitar background tracks \\"out there\\"--check 'em out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool!","review":"This tool is invaluable when used for setting hinges! Hold the hinge in place, push the drill against it and know that it's centered in the hole. Works just like a Vix bit only you can pop it out the holder, flip it, put it back in the holder and voila', now you've got a driver to power in the screw. I've gone through three sets as they tend to grow feet and walk away. :(December 16th 2009 EDIT:My latest one has lasted three years. The housing eventually cracks at the corners where the bit slides through. I ended up just buying single piece set to replace the holder. The springs on the vix part (that push against the retactable head) have held up and have not failed. I have replaced all of the drill bits and screw tips countless times. I have not yet seen a better setup than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be standard equipment with every power drill","review":"This tool is such a slick innovation that it really should be standard equipment on power driver/drills. You just flip the tip to drill or drive. The auto-centering feature on hinge holes is brilliant, plus the spring loaded sheath works to keep your drill bit in place in soft wood with raised grain. The sheath tip bites the wood a little and keeps the bit from dancing away into the softer troughs or the wood.The only complaint I have is that the shaft that holds the bit/driver and sheath has an ever-so-slight wobble to it when spinning freely in the air. Oddly enough, it seems to function perfectly regardless of the wobble. It would appear that the wobble is nullified once pressure is applied when drilling/driving. It may simply be gravity pulling at the apparatus when it isn't loaded with the pressure of the task."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best jazz CDs.

Da Capo have downsized these volumes each year, and at less than 200 pages, this is the thinnest yet. JT Leroy's selections are lazy and predictable, with none of the big names featured being represented by compelling, innovative work. Robert Christgau is typically verbose and incoherent on minstrelsy, and Ingrid Sischy's conversation with Camille Paglia is banal. Tributes by David Ritz (on Ray Charles), Greil Marcus (on Buddy Holly) and Tom Roche (on John Peel) are heartfelt straight reportage, while other pieces are mere news items. Every day the web shows the literary sub-genre of music writing is healthier than ever; other than cost-cutting, there is no excuse for this showpiece anthology to be so lame and lacking in vitality."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was De Capo thinking?","review":"And the hoax of J.T. Leroy was asked to be editor because...?Maybe next time around De Capo will return to using editors who are 1) real people, 2) respected and qualified to edit such a seemingly important collection, and 3) valued more for their insight instead of bringing someone else onboard who, regardless of whether they exist or not, is wrongly assumed to be so ultra-hip and edgy that the name alone would sell more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw away your money and support fraudster J.T.Leroy","review":"The editor of this book is forty-something Laura Albert, pathetic phone sex worker and con artist masquerading as a victimized street youth infected with HIV after being prostituted by his own mother.

Don't support liars and greedy publishers without principles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited by a musical failure and literary fraud","review":"Just go to the website for Laura Albert's band Thistle, conveniently linked to the J.T. Leroy site, download one of the samples, and decide for yourself if Da Capo has any credibility with this book at all.

Possibly/Probably because this was a collective acting epic instead of focusing on one or two certain charachters(e.g.Chow Yun-Fat),it's not percieved as accesible as Woo's other films.Strangely,co-directorial credit is given to HK charachter actor Wu Ma but Woo's fingerprints are all over this one.From the brilliant,pre-credit gunfight in blazing daylight to the then-obligatory destroy-all-mansions shootout,Woo's engaging,hypnotic style is clearly evident.Thoroughly enjoyable \\"heroic Bloodshed\\" from the man who made it a household name.

Antione Fuqua had a real feel for the Hk style gunfights and editing, but that all has to be backed by good characterizations. This film was much the same way.Co directed in part by Wu Ma and John Woo (it's obvious Woo didn't write this). The plot concerns itself with the death of a head triad and the internal struggle over who will take over. There are many doublecrosses and scenes of nervous gangsters. But I really couldn't follow the film well. I have watched it twice now and I still can't remember any characters names and the causes of some of their actions.Overall, the plot is cofusing- VERY confusing. The gunplay sequences are perfectly filmed and show much of the technical skill he later had perfected in Hard boiled. one big problem in the end is a very unfunny sidekick who makes jokes (mostly slapstick uuuggghhh! )."},{"rating":"1","title":"far from the best","review":"This film wouldn't be so bad if it had a little more characterization.I believe this movie was co-directed by Wu Ma.A lot of gun play that seems to be missing the spark that most of John Woo's films have.A little overloaded with the male bonding,and plenty of gangsters trying to look cool.All in all,it's rather unipressive,and seems more like a spoof of one of Woo's films."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOMAN, GODDESS, OR JUST PLAIN PERVERSE","review":"BRIDGET CHRISTINE CONNOLLY IS SWEPT BACK TO 400 A.D.

I really enjoyed reading about his childhood growing up in France and his arrival in America.Pepin is also very witty and funny (at times making me laugh out loud during my commute, which illicited several curious stares from other CTA passengers!), with a certain french charm. The recipes are also look very good and there are several I'm planning to make.My only problem with this book (and why I didn't give it 5 stars) is because it was too short!

His personal story takes the reader through his trials and learning experiences of cooking in schools and restaurants in France, and later in the USA. The writing reads like a enjoyable story. I found it interesting in reading about how French cooking schools teach their students. I learned that Jacques Pepin was instrumental in developing \\"healthy\\" fast food when working for Howard Johnson. Now when I watch Jacques Pepin on his cooking show ; I feel like I know him. His writing is charming and easy to read. If you enjoy cooking and are interested in learning about what it would be like to work as an apprentice and eventually become a Master Chef ,this book will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this unless you already own Mere Christianity","review":"The reviews on this page are erroneously coupled with The Shepherd's Notes (like Cliff notes, but by the Shepherd, one supposes) to Mere Christianity, NOT the book itself.

My intent was to have a study of the real book and not someone else's view of the book.Once I figured out the book was not what it was being sold as I had to reorder and have the real MERE CHRISTIANITY shipped next day to get them to the inmates on time which cost me a bundle. Typically people who do prison ministry do not have a \\"bundle\\" to spend so I had to bite the bullet on that one and I am very displeased with the publisher as I view the naming of the book and the front cover as being very deceitful.

Much to my disappointment I received some sort of cliffnote-esque walkthrough of the book instead, called Shepherd's Notes. While it said Shepherd's notes in the title, I just assumed that was part of the ACTUAL book title since the author said CS Lewis. CS Lewis did not actually write this Shepherd's Notes version, which the description said he did. All in all this book might be helpful if I actually had wanted it?

The overall construction is poor. The parts are made from aluminum and not the stainless steel. One bit broke in the second screw. I called Amazon at 866-660-8114 before ordering. The rep said that all Makita tools and accessories are made in either the US or Japan. Not true! This set was made in China.

Probably because I was using the Instey bit system, which was working fine. I discovered that this is actually faster and dose as good or better than any system I've used, if you don't need to use an impact driver . You can purchase any broken drill bits or countersinks at Home Depot as well. Tips can be released with the turn of an Allen wrench on my model but maybe on a more updated model they have a quicker method. Either way it's better than a press fit,since sometimes the tip has a tendency to come out in use or be too difficult to get out for replacement on those types.

If you're looking for an entry point into the world of acoustic blues music performed by the original artists, then this is it.I highly recommend this recording due to the clarity in which Big Bill's intricate finger-picking guitar style and heart-felt vocals are captured. The quality of the recording is very good compared to much of Bill's earlier repetoire. In fact, this is about as close to actually experiencing Big Bill play live as any of us will ever get.My favourite cut is the last track, \\"Sixteen Tons\\", a traditional song recorded by many artists, including Pete Seeger and Merle Travis.

You are led to believe that it is Caroline talking, but then the narrator says she failed a test \\"even though Caroline had helped her with her homework.\\" Huh???Next paragraph says, \\"no matter that she was her sister\\". Her who???? What the heck is Luanne talking about.Then, still thinking the person narrating is Caroline, it talks about how it feels to kill another human.

Not so, the metal on both pairs was not firmly attached to the base, causing it to move left and right during use. The ball on one of them flew off the metal and hit someone in the head, not cool!

If you have an old AGP desktop that's running sluggish, this card is a good upgrade on a tight budget.

The card worked right out of the box. Windows XP SP2 didn't have native drivers, and the ones on the CD were very old, but a download from NVidia's website and it was up and running quick. This model is fanless, which is nice, because there are less moving parts to fail. All in all, I got exactly what I expected for $57, and few headaches.

Aside from the fact it's ridiculously short, the vast majority of music is just relentless action music. Now, don't get me wrong. A little of that is fine, or even a balanced mixture. But when it's pretty much all that way, I think it just gets annoying, and heavy-handed. The redeeming factors about this CD though, that keep it from a one star, are the love theme (Track #4), and the very majestic triumph theme in the final track. It's really pretty!

Eight pancakes easily fit on the surface at one time. I haven't tried to fit an entire pound of bacon on it at once, but it looks like it is big enough for the job. The heating element gets up to temperature fairly quickly and maintains its temperature consistantly. The only problem that I have found is that the the surface temp. is not distributed as evenly as I would have liked.

I fell in love with their music after one play. The extended, full concert is absolutely great. I only have one problem - on the original LP the final song was \\"The Parting Glass\\" which was the perfect song to end this concert. It's still the finale but Columbia Legacy has added two more after it. They were recorded earlier than the Paddy's Day concert but were included on the original album - WHY? They are great songs but why pretend that they were part of the original concert? There was enough material without including these two extraneous songs from an earlier concert. Despite the grousing about these two songs, this CD is highly, highly recommended to all fans of the Clancy/Makem tome and to all fans of Irish music.

Unfortunately, this performance is not at all close to the high standards of the original soundtrack recording of 1960 with Herrmann himself conducting. The conducting on this cd is insecure, and the sound is very muffled, though Mcneely picks tempi that correspond fairly well to the original ones. The original tracks aren't available commercially but I would also put Herrmann's own rerecording on the Unicorn label above this one. The Unicorn cd is slower throughout than both this cd and the OST, but the conducting is of much higher quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT THE TOP OF THE ART OF FILM SCORING","review":"Can one deny that Bernard Herrmann's score to \\"Psycho\\" belongs in the top five of all-time great film scores? I think not.Joel McNeely and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra have performed the score masterfully with every thrilling, as well as subtle, chord.Purists may \\"scoff\\" that this rendition differs from the one conducted by Herrmann in the film, and to them I say \\"So what?\\"This is merely one ensemble's interpretation of the work of a master as seen and played through the eyes of composer/arranger McNeely.In other words, it's worth the money to buy and savor one's purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Nightmare of Fear and Depression","review":"Hermann fans could argue for years over which work from this incredible composer's canon is his best , but I think all of us would place PSYCHO somewhere near the top. This \\"strings alone\\" journey into despair must rank as the most depressing album in history. Listen to it from beginning to end and you'll need therapy. Hermann jerks you around relentless with his \\"Prologue\\" music, then lays on a sort of existential despair, and then segues into edgy, nuerotic tones that indicate a fractured mind splitting apart even further. This new recording captures this horrific music with crystal clear tones and perfect performances. You don't need the film -- you only need the score. OH MOTHER, BLOOD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately not very good","review":"I had high hopes for this re-recording. Everything is sort of OK but it misses aggressiveness. And it supposed to be 'nervous'. This re-recording doesn't make me nervous whatsoever. And it sounds like you are sitting in the back of an empty church while the orchestra is playing in front of the altar, like one big reverb-pit. That's allright for boys choirs if you're into that but Psycho (I think) supposed to sound almost like you're in a dead room. And that's where Danny Elfman comes in. He did an excellent job on that lame Gus van Sant re-make so there's at least one thing that came out right from that movie. The problem with that one is that it's incomplete but it's way, way better then McNeely's version. Go for Elfman's version. Money well spend (and better art-work)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was okay, but i bet the one done by Herrman was better.","review":"It was okay, but not near as good as from the movie.

Regardless of one's musical tastes, there is something for everyone. Each of the songs are intricate and appealing on several levels. The recording quality is fantastic, and sounds great on any system! this was back in 1986, and is still some of my favorite music today!

Fisher-Price (Mattel) customer service told me to replace the batteries and if that didn't work, return it to the store. After a month the receipt was long gone and changing the batteries did not help. The toy still says it's phrases and plays music but without the bouncing it isn't very much fun. It's too bad because my daughter loved it while it lasted. For 19.99, I think it should last longer than a month. This isn't the first Fisher-Price toy I've had trouble with lately.

Or at least up to the late 90s when the book was first published. The author was not able to get permission to use all the images she wanted, so the book sometimes explores and examines a piece of work that is no in the back. Still, a wonderful study if a tad dry and sometimes with a dusty feel. In other words, it seems outdated and much of the information seems still in the process of being worked on and polished. The imagery of early man has changed greatly in just the past ten years and there are now many images, museum displays, and books out there that could take a whole another book to discuss and debate about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent/Terrible","review":"The location was beautiful but the only part of this movie worth watching was the star caliber performances of the extras, particularily \\"Island Moron #13 (Man with Shades)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't even turn on","review":"I purchased one of these 2 months ago and I have already sent back 2 of them because the led light will come on in the front of the screen but the screen will not power on.

Not sure if the previous reviewer has the same model, but mine has a thermostat and shuts itself off and restarts itself to maintain a comfortable temperature!!! It heats my 3 car garage from 15 degrees to 65-70 degrees in less than 10 minutes and easily maintains the temperature without running all the time or cooking you out of the room. (And my garage is far less than 3000 sq. ft.) It also has adjustable gas setting from high to low and everything in between. You can turn it on high to get the temperature up, then lower the setting to maintain temp. It is a bit loud on high, but not obnoxiously. It is possible to hold a conversation next to it on high without having to raise your voice too much. That is my only complaint... which is minor in my opinion. So, pick one up and ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody, Atmospheric score...highly underappreciated.....","review":"This score is definately along the same lines as Dolores Claiborne, or the quieter moments of his Mission:Impossible score. Elfman's musical palette includes mostly small string ensemble, piano and his signature wordless choir. There's also some interesting percussion sounds. If you liked the \\"Betrayal\\" cue from M:I, then you'll enjoy this score. The main theme from Extreme Measures is subtle but beautiful and Elfman creates variations on this theme in every cue. The suspense music is ferocious (The Descent, Elevator Madness), with blaring horns and schizophrenic string playing, but the quiet tracks are sooo subdued and achingly sad (Hard Guys, Tough News).... This score is a diamond in the rough -- worth any film music fan's attention...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring score!","review":"It's seems like Dolores Claiborne, but there is no melodic.

As far as a true historical account, it is neither well researched nor well documented. There are no footnotes and only a brief bibliography.

It is an interesting story, but far more attention to historical research and accuracy would have made it a far better book, and a real history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book everyone (history buff or not) will enjoy","review":"I am a history buff and I thought I knew everything about the Civil War from school but I was wrong.When I read this book it changed my view of the war because she wrote down stuff that no one would have known of except the ones who lived it.It was the best book I have ever read.Even though she is my aunt its just that I never knew it was like anything like the indians trail of tears because they dont teach you things like this in school.So I recommend this book to everyone history buff or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eroded Idealism and Hope Reborn","review":"\\"We tried to change the world, but the world changed us...\\"The 30th reunion of the class of 1969 frames this thoughtful and moving book. It's told in alternating (then and now) chapters and follows a handful of graudates through Vietnam(an extremely harrowing segment), cancer, adultery, and other life changing experiences. O'Brien explores the choices his characters have made and the reverberative consequences of those decisions. At it's core 'July July' explores the loss of youthful innocence and the accompanying idealism and shows what these characters have adopted to replace that absence or void in their lives. O'Brien also shows how -- given the right reminder (like a reunion) this hope and love of being alive can sometimes be reborn. I found this novel a gripping and very moving reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot, anyone?","review":"Yes, Tim O'Brian is certainly a very good writer... his command of the language, his characterizations, narrative, dialogue, etc. Unfortunately, I expected a lot more when I bought this book. It's an interesting slice-of-life, made better by some interesting characters and scenes. But what else?I didn't expect a rock-em sock-em thriller - I expected a story that has a beginning, middle, and end. He gave us the beginning, but the middle just went on and on, all the way to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Sorry, Tim, this is not one of your best efforts, and a major disappointment after Tomcat in Love. I was one of the few people that laughed out loud with Tomcat, a comedic triumph! I've also loved all your previous books which in one way or another deal with the Vietnam War and its impact on the American psyche. This one did not make me laugh or cry - it was just dull!! Too many characters and I didn't really care about any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unrealistic","review":"While there are always a few shallow and uncreative people who hold on to past grudges and longings with a vengeance, after thirty years most people, even average folks, get on with their lives and learn a little bit . The rampant cynicism and narcissism and obsession with the past in all of O'Brien's characters just comes off as contrived and unrealistic. It made the book predictable and boring, seeming to be more a therapeutic exercise for the author's own demons than an exploration of the experiences of this age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Chill in book form, but with more substance","review":"Tim O'Brien is a great writer & I really love his subject matter. This book deals with the fading generation of the 1960's, those that lived through it and who are now meeting up at their 30th high school reunion. Funny and on-the-mark, great characters & dialogue as usual. Not a masterpiece, but a very enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"More like a collection of Short Stories","review":"O'Brien has replaced Don Delillo as the most relevant living writer in the US. Okay, but this book is not his knock-out punch. It is more like a collection of pretty good stories very loosely tied together by another, weaker story. Sometimes, it feels like this was the book that O'Brien wrote to get himself exerpted in all the \\"important\\" magazines - not a bad ambition, but doesn't do much for those of us who fished out the cash to buy the thing after reading 40% of it in the New Yorker. Also, I frankly don't buy the myth of baby boomers as the great generation, and since I couldn't participate in the myth, I couldn't participate in the book. Some great stories and great moments, but on the whole the book is forced, stagey. I recommend that O'Brien go back to doing what he does best - write real novels, like Tomcat or Lake of the Woods, and not worry so much about getting himself into fancy mags."},{"rating":"1","title":"July July","review":"I had heard of O'Brien while working at a bookstore. After reading this book, I can say with certainty that I will never pick up another one of his books. This book starts off with a group of people coming back for their 30th reunion. The ones that aren't lushes spend their time with various other vices (acid, men, etc...). All I can say is that if this is middle age, I guess I've already lived the best years of my life. Not a single character has a satisfying life. Even the ones who have made it financially, have ... personal lives. On a bright note, O'Brien's writing is impressive, it's just his story line that leaves ALOT to be desired. Overall, a depressing look at middle age filled with regrets over what wasn't done and nursed gruges over decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, current themes","review":"O'Brien does a nice job weaving the lives of the characters away and back again.

One day he forgets his route and his mother has to do it. He has lots of problems but his biggest problem his Ramona. Ramona is a four year old girl. Every day Ramona is upto something. Henry has to get an idea to get rid of Ramona. In Henry and the Club House Henry has to deal with Ramona and a clubhouse that he is working on with his two friends Robert and Murph. I think every one from 7-11 should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality book","review":"The pages of this book were flat and not written on. However, it was so aged that the first night I read this to my son a page near the front fell out. I continued reading around half a chapter a night. 5 days later, the book split entirely in half. Very annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Convenient Slow Cooker.","review":"As everyone mentions the real advantage of this slow cooker is that you can brown things on the stove without using an extra pan. But you can also make your gravy in it without using an extra pan (just take your roast & veggies out first!) and you can use the stove to quickly heat your slow cooker to boiling when done with browning. This reduces the chance of bacteria growing while your slow cooker is warming up. I have no complaints. Just remember that this thing is never really \\"off\\" unless it is unplugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow cooker","review":"I used this several times quickly after receiving it. Very versital unlike traditional slow cookers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooks Very Well","review":"One of the better features of this product as opposed to the regular type of slow cookers is that you can use the pot to cook meat on a stove for browning before adding a variety of other vegetables. Once the meat is browned, you can place it back onto its cradle for slow cooking. I've cooked a variety of meats and vegetables according to the directions, and I've yet to be disappointed. You don't have to be a great cook to make some very decent meals. The only feature lacking would be a timer and automatic shutoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, but.........","review":"Have had this Slow Cooker since February, have used it several times, and each time my disappointment grows. The cooker has a rounded bottom, therefore it doesn't sit flat on the stove when browning etc. I have a ceramic top stove and it will actually spin on the burner which is dangerous if I don't hang on to it as I'm stirring or turning the meat. And it's rounded bottom prevents it from sitting flat on it's heating element. I brown meat in this on top of the stove on medium heat which is supposed to be part of the versatility. If that is what caused the rounded bottom, then the versatility just went out the window.As other reviewers have mentioned, one has to be very precise when putting the lid on or it falls in.On the good side, it is easy cleanup, light weight(leaning towards flimsy), looks nice and works great for keeping food warm on a buffet. Would not be able to recommend just on those points though due to price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Lining.... doesn't burn food","review":"I've had this crock for years. It was great at first - it seldom burns food and the lid fits very snugly. Its also not hideous to look at. However - DON'T drop it, and be fantastically careful about the lid. With mine, the teflon completely wore off the sides of the rim. Flaked off, so it may have made its way into some food, and in case you don't know, teflon is highly toxic. The crock tub is also very thin metal and obviously the target of cost-cutting. For a 50 dollar crock, I expect more. MUCH more. It is handy to cook in it on the stove top. But the peeling teflon rendered it unusable. Stainless steel may be better - most foods in the crock cook down and bleed their juices out anyway, so sticking concerns are overblown. Its temp control was very good. It hardly ever burned anything, even on high, which is really only meant for cooking things for an hour or two, tops, anyway. I had a ceramic crock before this and that burned EVERYTHING.But be wary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid doesn't seal anymore.","review":"I loved this crock pot for the first two years. I like the oval shape because so many more things fit in it, like chickens, etc. I thought the nonstick surface scratched too easily. It still cleans easily, so that's ok. After 2 years of occasional use, the lid doesn't seal anymore. This metal pan has warped just enough that I can see daylight between lid and pot. The bottom line: it was not a good value for me, since crock pots depend on the tight seal to cook properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"temperature settings don't work","review":"Had high hopes for this slow cooker based on Amazon reviews, but based on my first attempt (buffalo stew) this device should be renamed \\"fast cooker\\". All four temperature settings resulted in overcooking. Even at the \\"keep warm\\" setting the stew continued to boil, so the stew turned into mush. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that \\"Versatile\\"","review":"It's my first slow cooker and I love it. It's easy to clean, light-weight, and cooks evenly. I have not had any problems with the lid because thanks to reviews on this site, I have been very careful. As far as browning ingredients in the pot before slow-cooking is concerned I have found the surface area a little too small for proper browning- so, if you wanted to brown 1 cut up chicken you wold have to do it in 2 or more batches otherwise you'd end up just stewing it (which doesn't save you any time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY MOST EMBARRASSING DINNER","review":"I have a 4 qt West Bend Slow Cooker and have absolutely LOVED it. Since it has been used so much over the past 14 years and our family has increased in size it was time to get a new one. Having had such wonderful meals with the last West Bend model, I purchased this 6 qt slow cooker and it sure cooks VERY SLOW. My aunt & uncle came over 2500 miles to see us and I put on a roast and some potatoes 6 hrs before dinner. I put it on medium level for cooking and checked it 3 hrs later and the pot was barely even warm. So I turned it up to high for 3 more hours to cook. Dinner was still not up to par and I had to microwave the potatoes to cook them more (and they were still too firm). I even had to microwave the roast some to make sure it would be warm and cooked in the middle. I was very disappointed with this crock pot. However, it is very lightweight, a nice size, and easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommended","review":"This slow cooker is light, versatile, and EASY to CLEAN! It ALL goes into the dishwasher (except the heating element of course). Its a good size for a family. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS ONE!!!","review":"After carefully researching all available slow cookers amazon offers, I chose this one--and have not regretted it!!! You can brown the meat on the stove (if you choose) then transfer it to the slow cooker base, add your additional ingredients, dinner is on it's way and you don't have to check on it again. It looks great sitting out on the counter (my kitchen is stainless steel and black and this blends right in! It's oval shape takes up less space, and it's pretty enough to bring to the table. It's perfect for pot lucks and school functions and cleanup is an absolute breeze. This is my first slow cooker purchase and I am a convert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the negative reviews","review":"I researched this purchase to the nth degree (my 1st crockpot) and almost didn't buy this model because of the negative statements about the lid and the heat.I have found both to be true to a small extent. The lid will occaisionally slip when I'm putting it on (no big deal) and if you set the temperature above the lowest setting (medium +) it will, after a long period of time, really cook, but not to the extent that it harms the meal. I've now had this crockpot for about 9 months and have cooked dozens of wonderful meals ranging from stews and soups to roasts and I must say it is a GREAT crock pot. It really is versatile in that you can make an entire meal using the single pan, take it from the oven top to the cooker base, store it in the fridge and warm it the next day all in the same pan. Easy and simple. Even with the small imperfections I wouldn't trade this cooker for any other. Don't worry about what the worriers say, this is a great crockpot for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't control temperature","review":"To qualify this bad review, I will say that this product has the potential to be great. The lightweight size, the nonstick coating, the clear lid, and easy cleaning are the highlights of this product. However, the knob that controls the temperature has no off setting, and slowly migrates from medium or low to the high settings. You can imagine what this can do to your recipe. I have ended up removing the knob and using locking pliers to keep the temperature steady. Without the knob, the controller gets insanely hot and really burns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine cooks too fast!","review":"Mmmmmmm, interesting; most of the negative reviews here are about this slow cooker cooking too slowly, some virtually not cooking at all. Mine cooks too fast. It didn't come with a recipe book, but I used a tried and true recipe from another book which calls for cooking on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3 1/2 hours. In 6 hours, my meal was over-cooked. This wouldn't be a good item for someone who works out of the house 8 hours a day and couldn't be around to watch it. The only reason I'm not rating it One Star is because of the shape and the ability to brown on top of the stove in the same pot. Now, that's a convenience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I kept this slow cooker for less than a week. When I realized I'd be cooking for hours - often w/ acidic foods like tomatoes - in ALUMINUM, I ret'd it. Amazon was amazing and easy w/ all of that. I spent more for a cuisinart slow cooker, where the ceramic cooker comes out and can be set on the table (and even looks decent), and I totally love this machine. Use it 1-2x/week, with great appreciation. But it's true about the Cuisinart recipes (I read about them somewhere): they cook MUCH FASTER THAN REPORTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oval slo-cooker review by west Bend.","review":"Good quality for the money.

My only complaint is it's hard to hold the lid on to drain grease but I've managed.Right now, it's cooking up a fabulous veggie soup, this weekend it did Sausage Corn Chowder and its wonderful to start chicken and noodles on the stove, get the noodles cooked (boil) then move it over to the base to finish up.

I had been spending far too much money on takeout every week (and my 13 year old son had just tried to eat a frozen burrito before I could even get it into the microwave) when Sunset magazine ran an article on the \\"new\\" slow cookers. I did some research and decided this one was the best for the money -- and I have NOT been disappointed. It's totally changed the way we approach dinner in my household -- for the better! I only wish it were bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very aptly named. Love the \\"versatility\\" of this slow cooker!","review":"I absolutely love this slow cooker. The convenience of browning and cooking in the same pot is really a time and mess saver.

West Bend keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Crock Type Pot","review":"Great product, works well, the name fits, it is versatile, and the clean up is very easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it actually cooked","review":"I agree this is technically an attractive piece, presumably quite versatile, however, the primary purpose of a slow cooker should be to cook. This does not. The highest setting after hours barely reached above 200 degrees. My first effort was a \\"stewed\\" chicken type of dish. After 6 hours, it was still largely raw. If you read several slow cooker recipe books, it seems the underlying concept of the slow cooker is to surround the food with heat - thus the typical cooker is a crock insert inside of a shell which has electric heating elements surrounding the crock. This gives you a constant surrounding heat. This unit (and I assume others like it) trade this design for versatility. Thus, the heat rises from the bottom (why I assume the \\"crock\\" is thin metal - to conduct the heat). I gather from my experience, this just does not work as efficiently as the traditional type. I replaced this with a crock insert unit. I would definitely not recommend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermostat malfunction","review":"My voice joins the chorus of complaints about this item. None of the four settings affect the thermostat, which is on permanent high. My 8-hour soup cooked in about an hour and a half at the low setting. Foods boil on warm. I was very disappointed in the cooker because, aside from the thermostat problem, it is a nice product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"Just wanted to add my positive review to this cooker. My wife and I got a Rival crock-pot for our wedding. We picked it out at the store, instead of reading online reviews. After a number of frustrating weeks with it, we went online and saw we weren't the only ones eating burnt meals from that pot. So we returned it and ordered this one from Amazon that weekend. We have been really happy with the results and hadn't realized how good some of the recipes were until we cooked them in this cooker. We were so happy with this cooker that we ordered it for my Mother-in-law's birthday. She's never had a slow-cooker before but we're confident if any one can make her enjoy them, it will be this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for that non-stick coating!","review":"I purchased this slow cooker because it has such a good review from flylady.com.It is a very accurate cooker but because of its nonstick surface deteriorating I rate it as a two. I cleaned and packed up this cooker in it's original packaging after every use because of the glass lid and non-stick coating. Unfortunately the lid is rimmed with metal and everytime it is placed on the cooker it rubs against it. I have had it about a year and the coating started to flake off after a few uses. So, you may ask yourself where does all that flaked off nonstick (teflon?) coating go? Well, into my family's food. If you are concern as I am-don't purchase this."},{"rating":"1","title":"B Raburn","review":"This was a replacement for an older one I had--The unit doesn't get WARM enough to even simmer foods..I have used it three times...I advise anyone looking at this DO NOT BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory, poor in performance.","review":"I asked for this for Christmas, after reading the good reviews. It made so much sense to me - from stove to oven to crock. Perfect! But while it's a nice idea, it doesn't work well at all. Having the heating element solely on the bottom means it doesn't cook evenly. No matter what temp I put it on, I never got a good simmer on my soups. I tried roasts in it (surrounded by liquid) on both high and low temperatures, and they came out hard and barely edible. My cheap Rival worked far better!It says it can be used as a griddle as well, but the base is so small, you'd only be able to make one sandwich on it, or two pancakes.I've used this a half dozen times, and it's about to be given away.

The temperature knob was damaged and broken as well. West Bend was very helpful in replacing the knob for free. What I was not aware of, was that the knob damage also indicated that the temperature gauge was messed up. Only after several tries cooking pot roasts that took THREE DAYS to cook even on the highest setting, did it occur to me that the temperature of the plate was damaged and was too low even at the highest temperature. I don't have experience with slow-cookers, so I had assumed I was doing something wrong. I sent the bottom back to West Bend who agreed to replace it free of charge, but I'm still waiting. I give them points for customer service. I wish I had paid more attention to other commenters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Manufacturing Quality Control","review":"We ordered this particular slo-cooker because it was highly rated by Cooks Illustrated Magazine. When we received it, it didn't work. You plug it in and . . . nothing. You look on the bottom of the unit and then you understand . . . it was manufactured in China!! I hate to say how many time I have purchased electronic products made in China that don't work at all or don't last very long. The US Company that decides to shift their manufacturing to China needs to insist on better quality control. I'm going to try and get another one from Amazon and hope that it works. Until quality control improves, we all need to be wary of Chinese made products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"This is the third Versatility Slow Cooker by West Bend that I have purchased over the last 30 years. The advantage to West Bend's Versatility Slow cooker is that you can brown the meat, etc., on the stove and then transfer the pot to the accompanying hot plate. The new cooker does not get hot enough on high to even maintain a slow simmer and the pot is a low quality very thin light metal. I miss the old style terribly. This is definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this slow cooker","review":"I had West Bend's previous version of this slow cooker and loved it. I only replaced it because it was 24+ years old and began to worry if the wiring was still safe, although it had no obvious problem.I originally replaced my old faithful with a new programable crockpot which boiled everything even on low and produced dried out food. When I saw that West Bend had this updated version I ordered it right away. Once again I can actually cook something \\"all day long\\" and not have dried out food.I love the variable control knob because your choices are not limited to low, medium, or high. You can place it between settings if you feel low might not cook fast enough, but medium might be a little too high.The only improvement I would like to see is a metal utensil safe interior."},{"rating":"2","title":"This slow cooker is awesome!!","review":"I just retired my two other crock pots after using my new West Bend Versatility Slo-Cooker.

This one, which I've owned for about 9 months now, DOES NOT COOK SLOWLY! The tender, fall-apart kind of results you expect to get from meat cooked in a crockpot are NOT what you get with this thing. It's convenient to clean, store, & re-heat; but roasts turn out rubbery, vegetables don't get done, & soups don't do any better than they'd do in a pot on the stove.

The flexibility of using it on the stovetop or in the oven, and storing it in the refrigerator is fantastic. And it's nonstick. Using it about 4x a month, I loved it for the first 3 months. While it is dishwasher safe, I hand washed it because of the nonstick coating, and after about 12 uses, the nonstick coating was beginning to flake. Yuck. Worse though, just after that, I used it on the stovetop to brown meat before putting it on the base, and even over a very low stovetop flame, the pot \\"popped\\" and warped. The pot no longer sits snugly on the base. I called West Bend's customer service about this and was told that it was common but would not affect performance. However, since then, it has not been distributing heat properly a recipe that cooked in 8 hours previously had to be left overnight and still was not done. What a waste of $70.

I call her my Nano Irish Wolfhound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FLIMSY","review":"Very flimsy and not sturdy. My 11 month old Akita can push the latched door open with ease. Beware the iCrate has a very thin gauge wire. I returned these for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in quality","review":"Very disappointed in the quality of this crate. I expected it to be like the other I ordered. My other crate has 2 latches for the doors, this one only one and the doors did not close all the way. If a dog wanted out of this crate they could collapse it easily. When I took it out of the box I was surprised how small the wire was and that a couple of them were bent even though the box was not crushed or bent. I really like my Mid-west crate that is the step up from this one with two latches on the doors and much better wire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely High Quality","review":"42x30 is huge. Bigger than you might think. But for $60, you might as well give your pup that little bit of extra space. Similar products are sold elsewhere for upwards of $100.I received my crate in the factory box, with a divider, and plastic pan to go underneath (in case of accidents). The divider is great if you have a new puppy and expect him to grow big enough to occupy the full cage. You don't want to give him/her too much space too soon for fear that the find a space to use the bathroom inside.The double door also helps. It allows you to position the crate any way you want and still have complete access to your pup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awkward to set up","review":"But well worth the hassel.

Attached this crate to the exercise pen and the puppy uses that for eating and drinking and little bit of playing. Went together no problem and no escapes. Highly recommended for the great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fine after a year","review":"We got this a year ago and it still looks like new. It is easily as good as far more expensive products we saw in the pet store. It's sturdy and easy to move and clean. Now that my dog is bigger we still use the divider to make a small partition, which allows us to store her stuff in one part of the crate while she still has the majority to live in. She feels safe and happy in her crate and goes there happily on her own whenever we are not interacting with her. We've got a 10lb Morkie and probably should have ordered a smaller crate, but that's not the fault of the company, I just wasn't sure how big she would end up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry","review":"Works great for our medium size rottweiler. Put her in there at night so she can't roam and have accidents in the living room. She seems comfortable and goes right in when we tell her it's bedtime..

It's nice and tall and spacious great price and easy to take with us when we travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like side door","review":"I must admit that I ordered this iCrate by mistake. I had previously ordered the same sized iCrate with one door and in my haste, ended up ordering the double door model. It is a few dollars more but thee side door has proven to be advantageous. The crate takes up much less room when positioned sideways and this has come in handy several times. The crate is well constructed, takes down easily and has rubber feet that protect the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUPPIES CAN ESCAPE!!","review":"My sister and I got puppies a little over a week ago. I initially thought these crates were great! At first, they were exactly what we needed....a place to put the puppies to sleep and keep when we aren't home. Well, after about 2 or 3 days, my sister's pup figured out how to unlatch the door and was getting out. After hearing a little squeek in the hall last night, I discovered that my puppy has now figured out how to get out of the crate, as well. These dogs are only 11 weeks old and can get themselves out. We will definitely have to come up with another solution for putting them up because this totally defeats the purpose of a crate! Wish I had something better to say. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice","review":"Received w/broken box, not sealed completely so bottom of crate were bent.

Very dipappointed in this product. do not buy,,,,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe for pet & disappointing quality","review":"When I received this product, I removed it from the box and immediately threw the box away in the local dumpster. Big mistake! After setting it up 2 days later, I discovered that the plastic pan was cracked but still functional. I had been very pleased with a similar product previously puchased from Walmart (ASPCA), but in a smaller size. Since my 4 month old Border Collie puppy was growing quickly, I definately needed to upsize her crate. An experienced vets assistant helped me with the first assembly. The retainer locks seemed flimsy and proved to not hold the ends together. The puppy easily escaped from its confinement in less than 5 minutes. I am now using plastic electrical ties to keep the pieces together. As you can tell, I am still sorry that I threw the box away and wish that I had explored the gauge of metal & construction in more detail. The double doors and the carrying handle are useful considerations."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Crate Will Make You Name Your Dog Houdini!!!","review":"The crate seems decently built, however the lock is too easily opened. Within minutes of leaving our 3-month old chihuahua alone in the crate, with his paw, was able to push the latch and slide it to the unlocked position and quickly push the door open.Update: Bought a couple of small caribineers from Home Depot to secure the latches. This prevents our pup from opening the doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the idea cage for any dog","review":"I love the size of the cage and the ability to make it smaller and move the center piece as my dog grows.

The I-crate has only one latch but the crate is well constructed and the metal wire is quite sturdy. I can't see how 2 latches would be of any benefit unless the breed was especially aggressive. Of course, a bigger crate would have a larger door and need 2 latches. A large dog might also be better handled by the standard crate. I like the fact that the I-crate is a little lighter than the standard model which makes moving it or transporting it easier. The included divider was just what was needed and can be moved gradually to increase \\"living\\" space as the dog grows. The pad purchased at the same time fit perfectly and could be removed easily even with the divider in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice crate for price.","review":"I got this crate from Amazon warehouse and was told there was damage to the box. Unfortunately there was a little damage to the crate as well :( The crate is large and spacious for my Golden Retriever and folds down quickly and is easy to put in the trunk of a Honda Accord. The construction is good for a normal dog, but I can see if you had a large aggressive dog this crate could get bent up."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy and roomy","review":"This crate is exactly what i was looking for. perfect size for my yorkie. very sturdy and i like the fact it has 2 doors so that i can position it in different areas if needed. the price?

There is no way that a dog could open this on their own. the latch is very sturdy and pretty hard for my child to open it as well. assembly was very easy...i just unfolded it, followed the directions to do the last tweaks on it and it was finished! couldn't be happier with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great crate for our labradoodle","review":"Crate was packaged well enough and seems to be made pretty well, particularly given the price its offered at.

Someof the welds have sharp points which can injure yourpet. The end door has so much \\"slop\\" when latchedthat you need to use a twist tie to keep it properlyclosed otherwise even latched you can move it in andout at least 1 to 2 inches.

I was ready and knew that some times dogs/puppies can get out of these, as mine sure did. But I was not expecting her to get her teeth caught in between the really wide spaces with the wires. My poor puppy was screaming and crying, I had to get her loose which was not easy, it left me shaking for an hour after wards. And my poor pup scared. Needless to say, the wire spaces need to be SMALLER. And I went with a plastic carrier type crate for my puppy. Some have complained about the door being to flimsy, but no doubt safer for my puppy. Very disappointed and no longer feel these are safe for ANY dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cage","review":"Easy to put together, has double locks on the door, light weight, tray in the bottom for easy wipe down, handles attach to top, perfect for my large dog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Side door doesn't line up properly","review":"This crate is nice, the only problem I have with it it that the door on the long side kinda drops down. Being that it drop down it's hard to latch, if you lift up on the top though it slides right in. It's just a little hard for my 5 yr old to do. Otherwise, you can't beat the price in comparison to pet stores or even WalMart for that matter! The size is just perfect for our 6 month old Yorkie and he has room to grow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great crate for growing pup","review":"We recently got a new Goldendoodle pup and wanted to get a crate that had an adjustable divider that we could move as she grows. The iCrate has been great, and it's not too hard to move the divider. The only reason I'm not giving the product 5 stars is because the top locking mechanism doesn't quite match up, so sometimes it's a struggle to get it to lock all the way. It still works, though, and overall I am very pleased with the crate.As others have mentioned, it does ship in its original packaging only. I think if it's going to ship like that, they should make the box sturdier to prevent any damage during shipping. Ours came without any problems, but I can definitely see how it could cause some issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little flimsy but gets the job done","review":"It's a little flimsy on top, but it's not like I'm going to sit on it.

I also have a Lhasa Apso (similar to a Shih Tzu) who could definitely fit in there comfortably as well.One of the things I REALLY loved was how FAST it shipped. I used the supersaver free shipping which is an estimated 7-10 days.I ordered it Tuesday morning and got it on Thursday. I'm tempted to give it a 5-star rating just for that.Overall, I'm satisfied.The seller is great!

When it is closed, it doesn't close flush and leaves a gap of 1-2 inches. That is enough for a dog to get his paw caught in there and seriously hurt it. I can't accept the side door like this with my little Yorkie. She hates being in any cage and would stick her leg in there and surely hurt it while we were gone. I should have bought the one door type and I would happy with that. How frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective side door latch","review":"This is very poor quality on this crate.

His incredible vocals, backed by a solid band performance always makes me look forward to another release. Before I had listened to the songs of Chris Rice I had never wept during a song. Now I have discovered at least one song per release that is so poignant and touching to the life of an everyday guy like myself that I can't help but internalize it. Yes, touching. Yes, I'm a guy. Hard to understand maybe but I assure you that his music will touch you if you are willing to let it influence your life. My only comment of negativity is that by the end of the CD you are left wondering why he doesn't vary his musical style more. Sometimes you realize that tracks 2 and 7 (for example) sound similar musically, but the lyrics are different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing?

Growing up, I only listened to Christian music, but got out of the habit when I went to college years ago.

The maps are not detailed enough, it's still moderately slow (but not bad), and the bottomline is, for a place like the bay area (ie basically urban territory), you're better off just getting a decent hiking book or paper topo maps; you'll actually have more helpful information that way. Perhaps in the next generation of electronic topo maps things will change, but forget this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed account of the disappearance of Amelia Earhart","review":"Spring .. 1937.

It's the Who","review":"Good introducition to the band and probably the best compilation available to the casual fan. For a more complete collection of Who songs it would be better to buy some of their albums in addition to this one. Who's Next, Quadrophenia and Tommy are Essentials to any serious collector, but this collection will have pretty much all of the songs that anyone has heard on the radio. I'm not a fan of their 60's material, so that is the reason for the 4 stars. Otherwise, the Who made some great music. They have never been one of my favorite bands, but they were one of the biggest and most influential bands to come out of the 60's and into the 70's. Along with The Rolling Stones, Led Zepellin and Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"these are two discs of the finest music money can buy.all their big hits like i can see for miles,wont get fooled again,pinball wizard and 5.15 are featured here.this is one compilation which should be there in your cd collection along with live at leeds from the same band.five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST WHO GREATEST HITS EVER","review":"The Who are also one of my favorite bands.

It is brittle, metallic, and painful to listen to when you play it on a studio setup with Focusrite 24bit/192khz DAC's!I agree completely with the reviewers who criticised the sound quality. This disk is insanely overcompressed, there is no sense of space between the instruments, and the highs are tinny and brittle.This worked as an intro to the band, but I'm going to replace it with \\"Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy\\" and the remastered \\"Quadrophenia\\", which are supposed to have great sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I became hooked on The Who in 1975.

Since then, I found that The Who is such a great British Rock band and a landmark in the story of Rock music, in the same level of the Beatles, the Stones, Led Zeppelin or other magnificent British Rock packs (Yes, ELP, the Kinks, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, etc.).I'm sure there are other Who compilations still available, who will satisfy classic Rock purists more than this \\"Ultimate\\". However, if you're just trying to increase your knowledge of how good British Rock became in the 1960s and 1970s, this The Who collection at no doubt will lead you to get later their entire album collection.

So buy both and be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW the who are amazing!","review":"This collection is amazing! It shows the who may be better then the stones! Pete Townsend is one of the greatest songwriters ever! John Entwhistle is a great bassit and songwriter (boris the spider, my wife.) Keith Moon is the 2nd greatest drummer ever ( behind J Bonham.) Add a singer like Roger Daltrey and u have a great band! Pete's a good singer 2, listen to eminence front. Wont Good Fooled again is a classic, & Who Are You might be their best song. I really dig the intro. This greatest hits blows away the stones 40 licks by a mile!!! There is no dip in quality like on that cd, plus, the material is just better. Also, u get some great liner notes about the songs. Baba O'Reily is a stunning song, i really like the part where pete sings.

It was so bad I popped in my Who's Better, Who's Best AAD cd to hear if maybe my recollection of the sound was wrong and I was correct this cd is terrible. I think it was remastered for the license plate rattling generation. Those that never heard the WHO will probably like this but it's not the real Who sound. I just threw my copy into the trash and will never purchase another Jon Astley remaster or a UTVRECORDS product.It's just a terrible, terrible sounding recording that is nothing like how the Who sounded."},{"rating":"2","title":"what????","review":"first off, this is the who's debut album...haha?

Ja rule is probably the most overrated person of all time cranky reviewer, and the biggest sell out to the hip hop industry.

The only problem that I can hear is that some of the songs don't sound like thier mastered right. Some of Pete Townsends guitars sound like it was recorded in a freeway underpass compared to the more recent remasters from the actual albums the songs originate from. But still, this is a definitive collection, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Who collection!!!","review":"Look no further. If you want a greatest hits collection by the WHo, this is the one to own. Not only has it been richly remastered, but the songs are numbered in chronologically order, so you get a sense of the history and the development of the band. IMHO, their peak years were 1969-1971, and this era is well represented by \\"Pinball Wizard,\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" \\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" \\"Baba O'Reilly,\\" and \\"Bargain.\\"The collection concludes with \\"Eminence Front,\\" and while I love this song, it makes me miss Keith Moon on drums, not that the replacement drummer isn't solid (he is), but he doesn't play with the liveliness and spontaneity that Keith had.There is no reason to spend your money on single disc compilations that will inevitably be missing some of the band's big songs. Get this two disc set now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best collection for The Who.","review":"Alright, what we have here is a 2-disc set containing The Who's picks for their best songs. Since I own all of their studio albums, their live albums, and some rare other items, I think I can say that they are one of my favorite bands. This collection pretty much captures all of their essential songs. Everything is here, from \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" to \\"My Generation\\" to \\"5:15\\".... the list really goes on. This is all a casual fan needs... and if you're a collector, I guess this is still worth adding.Also, I know that some reviewers are really upset with that guy \\"ZEPPELINISGOD\\". Well, if you read his reviews closely, it's easy to see that he's just kidding around, and he really hates Led Zeppelin with a passion and he thinks he's impersonating how all of Led Zeppelin's fans are. Well, don't take him seriously, his real Amazon name should be \\"ZEPPELINISCRAP\\" or something like that. Whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, completely unlistenable remastering","review":"I was recommended this collection as the best compilation of The Who hits. And indeed, the selection of songs is great.But what does that matter when the listening experience is dull and flat. If you turn it up, everything is getting loud and tiresome with no impact. If you turn it down there is still no impact, and it is still tiresome and dull. I simply can not listen to this. It may work as background noise when you are cleaning your house, but for an enjoyable listening experience, go digging for original, non-remastered releases.True musical enjoyment is impossible with this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"Im a newcomer to classic rock scene, but the WHo certainly fit. More controversial and outright nuts than the Beatles, the Who created some very catchy memorable hits. For the most part, they are here. From the classic rock mainstays of Baba oreilly and Behind blue eyes, to the quirky Boris the spider, My generation, Pinball wizard, Wont get foled again, Join together, Who are you....It is a very extensive and well chronicled collection of songs. Very much worth ever cent you spend on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who...Rock...End of Story","review":"...The Who are truly the godfathers of punk. Oasis would not exist but for the Who. Second, Keith Moon, the so called unknown drummer, on his worst day is far superior to Ringo on Ringo's best day. Ringo's son, Zack Starkey, was Moon's protégé! To compare the Who to Duran Duran (whom I do enjoy) is like comparing steak to hamburger. Pete Townsend is the quintessential lyricist. Roger Daultry's voice and stage presnece is legendary. The late John Entwhistle is Bassist of the millennium. And Keith Moon is truly the greatest drummer of all time. With that incredible lineup, it is no wonder that the Who has been considered one of the greatest bands ever. Even after 40 years when you think of great rock bands, the Who is near the top of the list. 40 years from now will anyone remember Oasis or think that they were relevant? Probably not!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT COLLECTION, BUT...","review":"Each cd is only about 70 minutes long. Why couldn't they just add a few more tunes to fill them up? Also, \\"Athena\\" is missing, so this really can't be considered a complete hits collection. However, what is here is great and the remastering sounds fantastic. If you want to shell out a few extra bucks, get the import edition. It contains \\"Athena\\" and a few other cuts not found on the US version. Rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT CD, BUT CHEATS YOU OUT OF 5 SONGS THAT ARE ON THE UK VERSION","review":"This is a great CD, but could have been a greater CD as it cheats you out of 5 songs that are on the UK Version of the same title.The U.S. version is 2 discs with 35 songs total.

Probably the latter, by the same friends and family members who heavily edited (and had the audacity to change Emily's words in) the first printings of her poems.You will note, if you read the reader reviews posted here before this one, that two out of three amazon.com readers believed they were reading a diary actually written by Emily Dickinson herself.I am frankly distressed by the publication of a book that does not make its fictional nature more obvious and upfront."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great work of HISTORICAL FICTION","review":"I just bought this book to help me do some research on Emily Dickinson and did not realize the \\"diary\\" is actually fictional. The \\"novel\\" is so well done that you will believe that you are reading actual diary entries written by Emily Dickinson. There are even editorial notes throughout the diary to help clarify the entries. The prologue doesn't even clue you in to this \\"April Fool's\\". I was flabbergasted when I was halfway through the book and so happened to glance at the back cover and realized this diary was actually fictional! Very well done! Very well done! No matter, it has helped me understand Emily Dickinson's poetry a lot better . . . Jamie Fuller threads throughout the diary actual events with likely events . . . oh it's brilliant. Absolutely brilliant! Bravo! I am laughing hard still from the shock of discovering my error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive title and even more deceptive content!","review":"This book is fiction and yet when I picked it up I thought I was getting the actual diary of Emily Dickinson! The writing is similar to what Emily might have written in her diary but she did not write any of this. The author takes way too many liberties with this title and deceives those of us who are true fans of the immortal Emily Dickinson. Read Emily's poetry instead and you will find a living diary directly from this beautiful woman's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Received as a gift","review":"I love, love, love it!

And since the zine itself is about pinball and rock and roll, the 7\\"s had rock bands singing about pinball. The music is quite varied, and as with most compilations, so is the quality. However, the good songs are good enough to make up for any weak spots. Strong points included tracks from Mick Collins' Dirtbombs, The White Stripes, Bobby Conn, and the Fireballs of Freedom, all more or less garage punk tunes, althought the one man band number was interesting as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for sensitive breeds","review":"I sprayed as directed, but my Burmese rag doll cat fled from the room.

This was their first extended car experience - 2900 miles, 3 nights in motels. We sprayed Quiet Moments on their bedding and on the blankets in the rear of the vehicle each morning before driving for the day. No crying, no howling, just curious cats during the drive and they mostly rested.It is difficult to compare to not using the product but, on the 4th day, a quick ~600 miles, we did not use the spray because we were running late. That day the cats were noticably more active in the car. They were clearly not as relaxed as they were for the previous 3 longer days when we did spray their areas.We would recommend the product and definately use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"My cat is pretty calm except for when there are a lot of people around.

The narrator is bad, the soundtrack is cheesy and repetitive, and most of the biographical information is presented in a way that keeps it from being interesting.Even at six times the price I recommend buying Ken Burns' \\"Baseball\\" documentary, by far the best thing I've ever seen about baseball. But if an 18 hour documentary is too much for you to watch, then I would recommend the \\"When it was a Game\\" series. Anything but \\"Baseball's greatest Legends - Diamond Memories\\". This set is so bad that I was only able to get about 2/3 of the way through the first disc and I haven't even bothered looking at the other two discs that came with it.Please, save yourselves the money and most importantly the time.

As soon as I picked it up I fell in love with it. It plays easier than my 6-string.I am still trying to figure out the built-in tuner... I just have this complete inability to tune a guitar easily. Now I don't know if this was just my own idiocy (probably was) but I already snapped the E string second from the bottom trying to tune it. Got a nice sore on my hand too. I feel terrible for being so careless! So I recommend buying an extra set of strings while you are at it!

If every man payed attention to the little details that make for a good relationship, we'd probably see the divorce rate plummet. This simple book does just that.

Don't want to burst any bubbles here, but it was disturbing and troubling in light of things I've read about Hollywood. Then there was the killing of a most innocent dog for no reason and a bloody stabbing to boot. The ever present \\"subliminal\\", token sex and violence that must now be included. Why do we accept this \\"stuff\\" in movies, and then come to be shocked about real abuse and violence in our society? And what were the real life motives of the actors participating here? Was it just for the money? Who would step up to draw the line? Ah well, nice photography though. I really wanted to like this movie, but after all is said and done, I can't recommend. Too bad.

First of all I was expecting a lot more from the combo of Willis and Murray. What a combo, but they didn't do anything. I turned this off after an hour and much deliberation of whether or not this movie was worth watching more of. This movie was a fantasy trip of someones idea of first love. Please do not let your children watch it, its really not for kids, let alone adults. I tend to believe that this movie represents an adult's fantasy about childhood first love than anything else.

One runs away from family, the other from a scouting encampment. Top notch cast, script, and acting. Very artistic camera work with tremendous attention paid to every detail in every shot, even the stuff in the background. The film is highly yellow tinted for emotional effect. Probably not suited for viewing by pre-teens for promoting running away, dancing in public in underwear, and lots of smoking.This film would have been much better without the constant smoking promotions as product placement through out the entire film. Perhaps a good idea to teach your kids how product placements in movies work so they can grow up to be aware of them.

That was it's only appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The young boy, one of the main characters, had a terrible speaking voice. It got harder and harder to listen to him.

However, they are appealing to each other in a unique friendship when they decide to run away together in their own great adventure. Bruce Willis can play the role of just about anything, and in this captivating story, his acting performance is excellent, along with all the other characters.

That was a film about two sweet children falling in love and running away together, and their misunderstanding parents, teachers, and even a scout master. It was actually made in the era depicted in this film, and it is loaded with charm and the wonder, energy, and optimism of childhood. This film really ought to be classified as a remake. It suffers horribly by comparison. All the characters are stiff and depressed, and depressing. Even the children. A comparison of the two films illustrates and emphasizes the ravages of 40+ years of drug culture (both psychiatric and illegal). I could barely tolerate this lifeless dud of a film.

The look still has some appeal albeit the novelty is gone, it looks like a film made by the Instragram app. Bill Murray is excellent in another version of his broken man character but overall this film should be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too quirky","review":"The previews showed you a cute quirky cast. Didn't realize that it would go from cute quirky to just strange. Didn't care for the movie at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a gift...","review":"This movie DVD purchase was a gift for my sister-in-law. I'm told she loves the movie, so I am giving it 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ensemble cast","review":"I had high expectations but found it to be quirky, difficult to follow and uninteresting. It was a real disappointment. It was a waste of my time and the $3.99 rental fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cinematography, Quirky plot","review":"The good: Two 12-year old eccentrics find friendship in each other. The bad: it's odd, unrealistic, and accentuates character flaws. At best, it's a spoof. At worst, an awkward plot that lurches from one silly episode to another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"A great collection of fine actors. The two young people were outstanding. Good flick. Like a Cohen brothers movie. Makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Wes Anderson's best!","review":"The collection of actors in this Wes Anderson flic compares to none before! From beginning to end, any Wes Anderson fan will love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and wonderful. An perfectly \\"Wes Anderson\\" film.","review":"Brimming with complex relationships. Youthful charm and understated slightly surreal humor. This is one of Anderson's best. This combo pack is how all movies should be produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch if you don't like precocious children","review":"I don't understand why so many people who previously disliked Wes Anderson like this movie, for me it is one of his least successful efforts - actually not unlike one of those skits where kids read the lines from presidential debates, or maybe one of those ads where toddlers speak like adults. Here all the action is with two children, who mouth words that are clearly coming from an adult (and hipster) mind. Painfully boring and unoriginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"just such a bad movie... don't waste your time watching this. The acting was bad, the story-line was inane and it tried too hard to be indy and cool, but it just pissed the mark altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like new and meant it","review":"This DVD came with no scratches although it was used. I had no problems watching it all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over my head or just boring?","review":"I was hopeful when viewing this movie because of the great cast lineup. But one-third into the movie, I started watching the clock. Never a good sign. By the two-thirds mark, I didn't care if I watched one more minute because the story was meandering and nothing was relatable. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!!!","review":"What in the world? I attempted to watch this movie 3 times! I figured I must have missed something being that there were so many 5 star reviews! I found the characters annoying and the plot unbelievable. Sorry, just didn't do it for me.

We would have watched it for 10 minutes before turning it off had the reviews been honest.This movie is very slow, the plot isn't coherent and headlining actors have very minor roles. I'd consider them cameos really.This review will probably be down voted into oblivion, although I felt compelled to write this since the movie was so bad.

Have you ever been to a place where every single person was quirky and acted exactly alike? No? Neither have I. Not a single character in this movie even remotely resembles an actual human being. We seem to be transported to planet Quirky which is inhabited by a bunch of clones who all act and think alike, and thus who are all extremely annoying. I used to like Bill Murray (back in the \\"What About Bob\\" days), but he seems to have gone off the deep end in his movie choices over the past decade. Save yourself a massive migraine headache and avoid this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"I watched the movie for about 30 minutes and couldn't watch anymore. Although I appreciate and enjoy quirky, independent films, this completely missed the mark for me. I couldn't connect with any of the characters because there was really no character development. It was as if the screenwriter and film maker said, \\"lets put together some crazy, quirky characters and see what happens.\\" For me, their experiment failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty","review":"I thought the plot was very novel and witty. I hesitate to call the film cute, but the characters were adorably precocious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"My husband and I watched this on Christmas Eve after all the presents were set up and under the tree.

There was no point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impresses","review":"I wanted to see this in the movie theater, but missed it. I am glad I only paid 3.99 for the rental.

It was awful, I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie! package delivery was quick","review":"I gave five stars for a great movie. Also, Amazon was quick to deliver my purchase.The combo pack allowed me to get the digital copies in itunes. note: this was difficult in the past i had issues downloading digital content because of false time expiration issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie","review":"I thought this was going to be a fun movie with interesting interaction between Bruce Willis and Bill Murray, instead it turned out to be a movie on badly raised children doing stupid dangerous things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Just awful. Boring, dull, poorly done. Hard to say anything good about this film. I couldn't survive more than the first 20 minutes before I had to turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and uninteresting","review":"Just boring. Turned it off because we couldn't get into it.

It garnered a great deal of press and I don't really know why because so many of his other works are, dare I say it, better - but this is a sweet, even if slightlly off-putting addition to my collection. Even if your not a WA fan, it's still a good movie to have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange movie, quality of stream very good","review":"Overall enjoyable and funny yet a bit dark.

Also, there's a part in the movie where a girl strips down to her underwear and bra.

Word of mouth reviews from others had been good.But when I realized the child actors in the movie are in a sexual relationship and the young teen actress is in her underware for quite a few scenes, I was disenchanted.What is wrong with the parents of these child actors to allow them in a movie with such sexual overtones.Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing free gift","review":"I ordered the Blue-ray/DVD of 'Moonrise Kingdom' and got an e-mail stating that I get the Amazon Video On Demand version for free. I thought this was a pleasant surprise until I went to view my video library and it was listed as a 24-hour rental that expires in one month. There is nothing in the e-mail that I received indicating that this video is a rental or that it expires. Granted, I did not order it and was not expecting it, but the e-mail was misleading enough that I'm giving the video 1 star even though the movie itself was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"great cast - stupid movie","review":"The only thing I enjoyed was the location shots - since much of it was filmed in Rhode Island - not new Zealand!! The plot was ridiculis and not even funny.

It's not as good as 'Life Aquatic' but its better than 'The Darjeeling Limited'.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie","review":"I loved the music, the visuals, the young actors, and the story. I tell everyone to watch it and have listened to the soundtrack countless times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant as always","review":"I absolutely love this movie. The first time I saw it, I left the theatre with a renewed belief in true love and scouting, even though I don't think I ever stopped believing in either. Wes Anderson is a unique director, but you can see his hand in every single shot of this film. It's artful, quirky, and lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and magical","review":"one of the best true love stories I've seen. Captures the wonder of childhood and first love better than any film i;ve seen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Murray and Bruce Willis together","review":"This will be a cult classic. The cast do a spectacular performance by creating fictitious community that draws you into the lives of coming to age youth's with a odd tainted love spin. Bruce Willis breaks his tough guy casting with his great performance. Bill Murray is Bill Murray, always a top performance. Entire cast does a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"Saw this in the theater but I was distracted so I missed a lot. I'm really glad I bought it and watched it again. Cute and made me laugh too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"Funny movie, and super witty. There are a few scenes that I find inappropriate for kids that age, and can't imagine that parents would allow their children to do that for a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids Movie","review":"It's a movie for children and young teens. It's so corny that you can hear the corn popping.

Great movie!","review":"Paid 15.. Wanted to pay 10... It was a gift so I had no choice but to pay the ridiculous prices of dvds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eclectic film with hard to follow plot","review":"Basic Boys meets girl moving, and Tween discovery in the 1960's. The depiction of the \\"Khaki\\" scouts, was funny and and a hazy romanticized reflection of the BSA at it's high point.Unfortunately Bill Murray's character along with Bruce Willis' where very one dimensional and uninspiring. While these actor can absolutely pull off dead-pan roles, it just didn't see to work in this film.The films tempo build a sense of anticipation, vaguely like a clockwork orange, but never pays out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever!","review":"it was amazing. Wes Anderson did it again! I love this movie and believe everyone should watch it! thanks so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Cute and Quirky.","review":"Great film about young love, family, death, and most of all adventure. The main characters were written perfectly with their own strange issues and lovable qualities. Wonderful cast with some of my favorite actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best Wes movie, but solid.","review":"Looks great. Was a lot of fun. Feels like a culmination of the stylepresente in all the others. Good date movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Quirky Movie: Could Be Called a 60's Escape from 'Meatballs'","review":"I expected a bigger part for Bill Murray and Frances McDormand but they actually serve as a back drop for this 1960s humorous stereotype of summer camp boy scout life featuring a very different marches to his own beat scout who sets off on his own with a frustrated homebound girl on the Island where she lives. If you got Napoleon Dynamite and liked it, this may be your movie. Otherwise this may not be your film. I enjoyed the film, mildly funny, unique story, some very unusual surprises and certainly off beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely Interesting","review":"This is a quirky movie that is so interesting you just have to keep watching. I love the acting in this movie. The humor in this movie is quite dry, which I really love. It's a keeper for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely movie","review":"I truly enjoyed this movie. It was sweet and campy and just a treat. I always like the work of Norton & McDormand. Willis was a pleasant surprise. Definitely not his usual character & he did a very nice job. Murray was also very good in his part. The kids stole the show, though. Jared Gilman & Kara Hayward were so perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for a diverse gathering!","review":"Very off-the-wall, funny, poignant, and able to entertain people of varied interests... I show this one when I don't want to offend people's political sensibilities, and don't know whether certain dramas or darker comedies or cult classics would be appropriate for all whom will be watching. No one has failed to enjoy it thus far, and my friends and family are a diverse lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonrise Kingdom is a nice place to be from","review":"The story is unusual with delightful characters whose outlook on life does not in any way meet the normal standard. Both of the young people live their lives in a manner that adheres to their own standards. In doing so, they create an atmosphere of good cheer and good sense. The rest of the characters are unable to come to grips with those so far out of the mainstream, and are to be pitied rather than admired. It is a genuine good feeling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonrise Kingdom","review":"A funny, poignant film centering around two bright, independent and eccentric preteens. Their worlds are seemingly very different and they are being parented by dysfunctional adults who seem to have tunnel vision. These adults are misguided daily by their own baggage and have little energy left for their families. Only the offbeat camp leader seems to have a clue. When these preteens befriend each other and fall in love, we see just how desperate they are for love, understanding, and normalcy. A very funny, feel-good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth seeing again","review":"Highly recommended. The young actors were impressive, and I enjoyed Ed Norton in a different type of role. See it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and endearingly odd - a charmer","review":"We really enjoyed this film. It's odd, but in a really good way, in an endearing, sweet way. I like movies that don't fit an archetype or neat little predictable box. My 18 year old son son saw this in the theater this summer, and raved about it, so the rest of the family was eager to see it when it was released to DVD/Instant. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mood Movie","review":"Wes Anderson has a great sense of place and humor. His characters are at best described as \\"quirky\\" which adds to the fun. That said while his movies are memorable you have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy them. There is a lot of nuance and subtlety that can be hard to appreciate when you are watching a movie at home and are tempted to do something else in front of the TV. But if you can make a quiet space for yourself this movie with reward you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"A sweet, quirky, funny movie by a great director.that parents and kids will enjoy.

This is a rare find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor video quality.","review":"The video quality was so poor I couldn't stand to watch it. Way out of focus. The film wasn't compelling enough for me to want to get past the poor quality, so I can't really review the film in a fair way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!","review":"I'm sorry I rented this movie, if you can call it that. I've rented or watched films by this director a number of times and have found them to be weird/bizarre/stupid/pointless and poorly scripted and/or acted. Never again will I waste my time on such a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying hard to be quirky and witty","review":"I watched this movie because it had a 94% rating from Rotten Tomatoes, which I had never seen for any other movie before. Let me be very frank here: this is the type of movie you would expect from some untalented french director who thinks he is an artistic genius. This movie is not witty, nor funny, nor smart nor are the characters likeable, interesting or quirky. Moonrise Kingdom is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, primarily because the viewer is acutely aware every minute of the movie that the people behind it were trying hard to create Oscar material. Moonrise Kingdom is a waste of time and money, and not even Bill Murray can change that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of cd's and movie","review":"I like anything by Steve Tyrell - wish he made more cd's. Also, like all the American Songbook cd's by Rod Stewart. The Christmas cd got bad reviews in the paper, but I liked it.

Just my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Ever Watched","review":"The TV previews of this made it look really interesting but it was really lame.

The kids are great (& so is Bruce Willis!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of Anderson's best","review":"This has a great story plus the visuals are beautiful. The editing is perfect. But best of all is the acting - how could you possibly miss with Willis, Murray, McDormand, Swinton, Balaban - but I want to say extra praise for Norton, Schwartzman and the two kids Hedges and Hayward (not a firm). Actually everyone was great. And don't forget Keitel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Anderson film in a while","review":"I really, really liked this Wes Anderson film. I am a fan of the director but his last few films hadn't had the same level of charm for me, especially Darjeeling Limited. However, he really puts together a great movie this time around, getting excellent performances out of all of his actors and actresses. Highly recommended. Also, I normally hate child actors with a passion but these two did really excellent jobs since, it being a Wes Anderson film, they weren't asked to be extremely melodramatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun fanciful coming of age story","review":"This was a good cast and the camera work was artistically done. The island is picturesque and feels just like how I imagine life could be like on a small New England island town. There were some cringe-worthy intimate scenes, but nothing felt gratuitous. It was an enjoyable, smart piece of story telling - something rare compared to the many mindless action movies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic sleeper, on par with Princess Bride.","review":"Its slow start with understated humor pulled me in. Its ability to poke fun at all kinds of institutions we hold dear made me like it. Its quiet examination of how we raise brilliant children made me love it. At times I laughed so hard I had to pause the movie. Moonrise Kingdom is a sleeper on par with Princess Bride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"This movie was very artistic and beautifully done! It was addictive to watch and is now one of my absolute favorite movies now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Wes Anderson has a near-perfect command of this movie. His sets, dialogue, characters and plotting are immensely intelligent and entertaining. There was one disturbing scene of sexuality but otherwise very good story, very good movie.And as usual, Jason Schwartzman steals the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie especially if you have to live with characters like this.","review":"Odd group to some but good acting, good story, and just like reality for those that have to live with the odd.

WAY OFF BEAT. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Surprised they got the actors to agree to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"I rented this film because it featured several of my favorite actors - Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand.It turned out to be a colossal waste of talent. The basic plot - two pre-teen kids run away when they fall into mindless infatuation - could have been interesting, but the screenplay fell far short of the basic premise and the two lead child actors were simply awful. Could-not-act. Truly painful to watch.As for Anderson's directing, he doesn't seem to know whether he wants to be John Waters or a kiddie-porn anime director. How this film ever garnered enthusiastic reviews simply befuddles me."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, make it stop","review":"This is the worst waste of time and money ever. No real plot.

At least 20 laugh out loud moments, with a handful of deep belly laughs. Shock, surprise, and true love. Absolutely brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative but disturbing","review":"I enjoy Wes Anderson's creative filming and directing and that's evident here. Love the khaki scouts and Bill Murray's character; I wish he had more of a presence. I found the 12-year-old troubled tween lovers disturbing, though. And if you're an animal lover, warning: a dog is killed in one awful scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, low quality of streaming video detracted significantly","review":"Moonrise Kingdom is a great movie. The artistry and precision of the scenes constructed by Wes Anderson have always been fantastic. The low quality of the image in the streaming Amazon video were disappointing and distracted from the movie significantly. I won't likely make future purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style...","review":"I guess this movie is not my style. Neither my husband or I enjoyed it. It was entertaining in some areas but I guess we were expecting more of a comedy and it was hard to tell where exactly the storyline was headed. We both fell asleep and didn't bother to watch the end. It is very artsy and some of the shots were gorgeous. The costumes & sets were great to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"No great","review":"I didn't think this movie was nearly as funny as some of his others, and the quirkiness just seemed contrived.

It got great reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, and I have no earthly idea why. The plot was slow and pointless.We fast-forwarded to the ending just out of sheer morbid curiosity. What a train wreck.

I just wanted to see it again.However, the amazon's streaming video quality was quite poor. And considering the great film it was quite frustrating experience watching in poor quality that I had to pay for.Amazon have began growing on me like being very sneaky with their services.You pay for something that is never what they are promising you.The same with their prime membership. They say there are tons of free movies and shows, but good lick finding them.Guess what there is no such category as free TV shows or Movies.Kind of lame of Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I was very bored throughout the film.

Done in a play type film it brings a Quentin Tarantino style of film rated for family. A must see and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Anderson's Best","review":"Wes Anderson is the most under-appreciated director of this generation. Sure, his fans are quick to expulse praise, but the general film-watching public has been slow to warm to Anderson's brand of quirk and charm.Moonrise Kingdom takes all of the Anderson trademarks and bakes them into a touching story about adolescent love. As expected, the writing is sharp, the direction precise, and the attention-to-detail mindboggling. With every subsequent viewing, you'll notice new details in the background and begin to smile at your favorite lines.The Blu-Ray version is stupendous. The transfer is clean and the extras are adequate. What more do you really need? At some point, it can be expected that a Criterion version will arrive, but for those who cannot bear the idea of not owning this masterpiece, you won't be disappointed with this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE ..... moonrise kingdom!","review":"This movie is just adorable!

At times funny, but mostly not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky for Quirky's Sake.","review":"It's a cute film, but a trifling, insignificant one. Loaded with talent -- Norton; Willis; McDormand; Murray.....all of whom are kinda window dressing on a story of a goofy scout, and his serious-acting girl crush, who run away together. Charming as the two kiddie-leads may be, I can't recommend it......a quirky film that I had almost forgotten having seen once the credits rolled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and weird","review":"Don't know why this is so highly rated. Yeah, the child actors did great but Bruce Willis and Ed Norton? Weird, disturbed characters that added nothing to their previously stellar resumes.

You've got to be kidding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie!","review":"I watched this movie with my dad a few days ago and we both absolutely loved it. I was so shocked that my dad did, because he is a tough critic, and he absolutely adored it. So this is my Christmas gift to him, and I totally recommend it. It was done in such a wonderful, unique way and such an adorable story. Awesome awesome awesome.Oh, and Amazon gave it to me free on my computer as a rental! I was so surprised :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another score by Wes Anderson!","review":"'Moonrise Kingdom' has the same look and feel as Wes Anderson other films; festive colors, hilarious dialogue, and brilliant actors come together to create a moving story.

The whole movie is \\"tongue-in-cheek\\", but charming and quirky and, ultimately, pretty sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything except the script","review":"Awesome set design, funny costumes, beautiful soundtrack, nice key turns from solid actors like Bill Murray...the only thing missing is a screenplay and direction that makes you give a damn about the story and people in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eck...","review":"Could NOT get into this movie....sorry I rented it...didn't watch the whole thing...do not recommend it....confusing...and odd...rented it for the actors but was disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zany!","review":"Truly a product of its time, it is wacky but poignant, a little cliche', a little bit naughty, but certainly fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - Not what I expected from Thompson Center","review":"Very low quality for a Thompson Center product:1. Very poor fit considering the rifle has very close tolerances. 1/4\\" gaps between forend and frame.2. Plastic swivel stud is easily broken. Will not withstand a small bipod.I would not recommend this forend if you are concerned about either of the two items above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book if you're not jewish","review":"I bought this book because I genuinely want to learn Hebrew. I bought a few books from Amazon and this was one of them. The other books were great; this one, not so much! Sure, the book teaches you the alphabet. But, under each letter, the book lists a bunch of random Hebrew words with NO transliteration and no pronunciation guide. So you are left to wonder whether you pronounced or even read the words correctly. This books assumes that everyone learning Hebrew is jewish and has knowledge of the Torah. Therefore, if you're not jewish, like me, you are left to wonder what the words you just read mean and even wonder if what you read was read correctly. Do not buy this book. Terrible investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful At All","review":"I'm a bit bewildered that this book has been highly rated by many readers. It left me absolutely flat. Aside from a reasonably good explanation of the vowels, I felt helpless with this book. The author's approach toward learning a language completely failed to connect with me. I was expecting to be led by the hand, and instead felt abandoned. I consider it a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a buy!","review":"I have been struggling with the Hebrew letters for years. All the standard grammars introduce you to the letters and then whoosh! You are looking at pages of unfamiliar symbols that make your head ache and your heart sink. This book is a godsend. It takes you slowly but surely through the letters and you put them together in small words at first and being rewarded with quick results, you end up doing more than you would have done without this feeling of achievement. The text is not patronising at all and just one week after purchasing this book I can read the Hebrew Bible making the correct sounds; I might not know what I am reading but I can now get on with that stage! If you are struggling at the same stage as me (proto-beginner) invest in a few bucks and get going with your Hebrew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even my seven year old is able to follow this","review":"I purchased this book for myself but my daughter who showed interest in the language is also able to easily follow the text. This text begins with a single letter and builds one sound at a time until you are able to read independantly. I do suggest that if you are going through the book to quickly and seem to have trouble, go back at least several pages and keep practicing. I personally love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Resource!","review":"This book was awesome. I learned more in one weekend than I had in the previous two years of self-study with other methods. I was so impressed that I bought the child's version for my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOV","review":"This book was very good for me because I just needed a refresher. I think it would be hard to learn from scratch from this book without a tutor, but for those with a tutor or just needing to brush up from long-ago Hebrew school days, this was effective. It will help me to appreciate Friday night services and the beauty of the liturgy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand how anyone would review this positively","review":"I purchased this product because, in my haste, I confused it forHebrew in 10 Minutes a Day, which I rented from a library and took with me on Birthright (don't tell the library).\\"Hebrew in 10 minutes\\" is a practical guide to conversational hebrew, structured to help readers associate hebrew words with the idea or action they mean. \\"Learn Hebrew Today\\" is the epitome of decades of awful language instruction. Its the very icon of language instruction based on the ridiculous notion that showing someone a page of foreign text with no context or even translations will make them suddenly think like a native.If I'm coming across strong, its because I suffered through 9 years of hebrew classes under the assumption that I wasn't good at languages before discovering that most language programs are as sensible as reading a stereo manual to a classroom aloud and then telling them they should all know how to build a radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book with one drawback","review":"This book is as good as everyone else says it is, but I have one problem with it. There is a presumption that the reader is Jewish and is familiar with the Prayer over Bread etc. The prayers are presented with no transliteration other than the letter by letter descriptions. Fortunately I happen to know a couple of the prayers, and have Jewish friends who can help me with the others. But if you are approaching Hebrew from a more secular direction, and you don't know the common prayers by heart, then you might look for a different book.If you grew up hearing those prayers on a regular basis, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Way to Learn","review":"I received this book yesterday and went through the first few pages today. I was actually reading and speaking Hebrew - it was awesome!The book is a soft-cover, workbook style that is not at all intimidating. The type is large and easy to read.The only reason I'm not giving five stars is, as another reviewer has stated, the lack of a pronunciation guide. In order to tell if I'm using the correct pronunciation, I had to keep flipping back to the original lesson.I'm glad I bought it and am looking forward to learning more Hebrew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sad stuff","review":"I hate to write anything bad about the irrepressible music and spirit of the great Meade Lux Lewis, but anyone interested in blues and boogie piano should look for other recordings than this one. Lewis plays a terrible quasi-honky-tonk piano and he is accompanied by an anonymous guitar player and a bassist, who seem to be sleeping on the job. The overall idea behind this recording seems to be to capture Lewis' music as some kind of an 'oldie' thing, which is as far from the truth as you can come.If you want to hear vintage Lewis - which is truly awesome - check out the recordings from 1939-1941, or The Blues Piano Artistry of Meade Lux Lewis (1961) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Must Have CD Of Fall !","review":"I'll keep this short. I've been a fan since \\"A Beautiful World\\". By the way If you don't have \\"A Beautiful World\\" you should pick it up ASAP. Track 2&4 are my favorite. I think the only misstep was the track with Lil Wayne, but the rest of the cd is so good it makes up for it.The Music and tracks really flows. This is a must have cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"And he's White too!!!","review":"OH MY!!!! Robin Thicke's album is incredible. I didn't think his album was going to be good until I heard a few tracks when he was on The Steve Harvey Morning Show and he played a couple songs off his album. This boy is BAD!!!! I bought the album and then downloaded it onto my IPOD and every track is really good. He did an excellent job and I hope he makes more albums in the future. My sister who doesn't care for White artists too much,actually took the album, listened to it, and came back an hour later and said \\"I'm in love with a White Boy\\". That let me further know that Robin Thicke's album is tight. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isnt there 0 stars.","review":"This album and singer is beyone awful. Listening to it is so physically painful that my ears literally bleed after a couple minutes of his high pitch squeeling and screeching. He sounds like a castrated boy from the tabernacle choir. I saw him on American Idol as a guest singer, and listened to some more of his music, because I figured he cant be as horrible as he was on the show, but he proved me wrong. Its like trying to listen to Justin Timberlake imitate Prince imitating Michael Jackson imitating a 12 year old boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISSAPOINTED","review":"WOW - this has to be one of the worst cds i've ever heard! I was SO dissapointed by this artist - based on the reviews i had read and knowing his dads work - I expected SO much more! This cd makes Michael Jackson look over the top BUTCH!!!!!!! Its wimpy, wispy and beyond efeminate. i cant even find anyone to GIVE this thing too! Sadly - this cd is an F in my book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar over salsa...and nothing new","review":"From all the hype, I thought this album would really be something new and special, but it's the same mindless beats played by computers and drab over-enhanced, studio sweetened vocals. Just what kind of hormone or technology does it take to make a grown man sound like an eleven-year-old boy? Wouldn't it be nice to hear a guy sing who actually sounds like a guy? There is just nothing real or subsantial here."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE AND JUST PLAIN HORRIBLE","review":"You need to list \\"0\\" stars here, there is no option for that? Because this is what I give this CD. I don't think anybody who can ACTUALLY HEAR could think this guy can sing?? Anyone can sing in this fake high screeching voice, just try it, you'll see. He's taking everyone for a ride with this. People will buy anything today and think it's cool (because they want to look cool.) but this guy just ain't happening. This guy is far from cool; he's laughable. I can't believe people are this stupid to buy this act. This is a no-talent guy riding his dad's coat tails. Oh brother. What saddens me the most is how stupid people really are to like this [...] and call it music? What's the draw in making some adult man sound and sing like a five year old?? This guy's a joke. Either that or else everyone's gone deaf. I actually cringe with embarrassment when I hear this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Dumb Dumb","review":"This is some of the worst music I have ever heard . I just can't believe what passes for talent these days. Really stupid lyrics and a ridculous voice. Woody Allen has more soul. I guess growing up with rich actor parents in malibu is what shapes the soul of a man these days! lol !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw this moron on CBS' Saturday Early Show...the worst","review":"It's been a long time since I heard such a ridiculously stupid performance. This guy sings is a falsetto voice and has absolutely no talent.I suspect young girls might like this moron, but it's just about the worst \\"popular' thing I've heard in years.It's obvious that I'm not into to much of the hip, current scene, but this is the lowest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Brother","review":"I-Yi-Yi-Yi - this is awful. Are we now just a society that accepts anything that comes down the pike? I asked my husband to sing up high like this guy and he sounded just like him and my husband can't sing a note! This is just pure commercialism at its worst. You're all being taken for a ride here. Are you really hearing this because if you are; how on earth could you possibly like this. This is embarrassing for a grown man to be singing in this style...he's awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution of Robin Thicke","review":"Wonderful sound. Someone to watch in the short term. Let's see if he continues to grow. This CD is better than A Beautiful World."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evolution of Robin Thicke","review":"This cd is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!! It has a little of something for everyone. Welcome, blue-eyed soul brother!!! I got the cd for \\"Lost without you\\" but, I love the slightly \\"nasty in a good way\\", \\"Teach U A Lesson\\".Also the sassy \\"Everything I Can't Have\\". \\"Got To Be Down\\" reminded me of a James Brown compulation with a guest. The whole cd is the S---!!!!!!! Don't sleep on it, play the whole thing and you will be pleasantly surprised. ENJOY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Track by Track kind of album","review":"This is a GREAT album if you want to keep it on repeat with out skipping or searching for a track. I have had to replace this twice now because I listen to it so much. I have been a Robin Thicke fan since Thick, and so far this has been my favorite. I have this in my car right now and I can listen to it weeks at a time singing every lyric, every syllable, every ad lib, and every instrumental without getting tired of it. I of course am a fan, but Would That Make You Love Me and I Need Love were the first two songs that I truly learned. I am eagerly awaiting another album dripping with soul like this one from Robin. His other are must haves as well. If you are a true fan you will agree with me that Something Else, Love After War and Sex Therapy are albums that take a few listens to get into, but Evolution is by far the BEST. I rate as a MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Incandescent Magic\\" Is Right.","review":"It certainly didn't take long before I absolutely lost myself in the hypnotizing splendor that is this album. Simply from first-listen, one's musical taste buds are thriving with stimulation in a constant state of salivation for more of this man's amazingly soulful voice and sensual, captivatingly laid-back tones. The beautiful subtlety at which he sings and effortlessly maneuvers through each track will enrapture you within each fleeting moment and leave you longing for more. At the very least, this is an excellent album to weave in and out of consciousness while you attempt to sleep during the late hours of the night. . . All the while in a constant state of indulgence. And if his soothing voice does, indeed, ultimately send you into the deep throws of a satisfying slumber, you will without a doubt - every time - awake within the opening piano keys and breathy falsetto of \\"Angels\\" - the absolute silver lining in a cloud of, well, more silver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, an album for the grown and sexy.","review":"Was that so much to ask for? An album that I can listen to all the through?...16 tracks of raw, grown & sexy, R&B.; I'm not really a radio listener, so this album could have passed me by. Thank God for videos! I was introduced to this album by way of the Lost Without You video. Aside from Robin just being fine as hell, the song basically \\"Had me at Hello\\" As soon as I heard it, I had enough faith in Robin Thicke to go out the next day and buy the album, I was not disappointed. This album is very addictive. If you don't already dance seductively in front of the mirror when no one's around, you may start after hearing this. If you appreciate a man that uses his falsetto, here's ya man. Where he really got me was when he threw in (track #7) which is basically Samba...WHAT! Muy Caliente!!!!! God, that was clever!Do yourself a favor bring in the new year right! This is the must have album of 2006-07."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best music I've heard this year","review":"I am new to Robin Thicke's music and I must say I was taken in by the music video, \\"Lost Without U\\" on BET. I ordered a copy of this CD from Amazon and I have not stopped playing it since I got it yesterday. My 14 year wants it and I'm fighting to keep it from her. I have become a big fan of him and his music. He is also nice to look at. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who really wants to hear good music. I truly hope it sells well, so we can continue to hear music in the future from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"Although there are a couple of songs that use adult language I am pleased with the album. I would recommend it if you like this type of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girlfriend Pleaser","review":"It doesn't matter what I think about it, my girlfriend loved it. That's worth the five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but it's too bad it got chopped and recut","review":"Well, this is certainly a step forward for Thicke. Sure, you can complain that it's a little more pop influenced, but that also means that this release is more polished, and I personally loved his first attempt, but was left with the feeling that it was too raw, and this one is much more focused. My only complaint is that the studio decided to cut half the tracks and replace them, which is what took them so long to get this one out. I have the \\"advance\\" copy of this one, and it is incredible. It's really too bad they switched out \\"superman\\" \\"Would That Make U Love Me\\" \\"u center me\\" and \\"Spend the Night With Me\\". If you can find them, you will see the perfect blend of Thicke's raw talent and some polished producing. Had they released the original version of this album, it would have won a grammy. sad"},{"rating":"2","title":"EVOLUTION at it's best!","review":"This is one album that I have been anxiously awaiting and I am SO GLAD that my waiting was not in vain!

Just play it from beginning to end, and you'll find some favorites that you won't get to hear on the radio. It's no wonder he's written so many songs for other famous artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Thicke is the truth","review":"I'm sorry but is Tammy La Gorce smoking crack!?!? How in the world could she with a clear conscious say that Justin Timberlake is to Robin Thicke what N'Sync was to O-Town? First of all O-Town was...to say the least...no where near the calibur of N'Sync. I say that because Robin Thicke has more MUSICAL talent in his pinky than Justin has in his whole body plus the rest of his former N'Sync crew. Robin Thicke had been writing and producing for big, multi-platinum and diamond megastars/icons for years before he brought us his gem of a rookie album, \\"I Like Them Thick.\\" Robin Thicke's music is light years ahead of anything Timberlake has ever put out in terms of lyrical content, musicality and orchestration. The analogy should've been more like, \\"Robin Thicke is to Justin Timberlake what fine aged wine is to grape juice. Don't get me wrong, I like Justin but we're talking apples and oranges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy purchase","review":"Quick shipping and in in greate condition.

There wasnt any difference between the two just the idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW a new artist that has a GREAT CD","review":"I bought this cd when it first came out, because I enjoyed the last one. THANK you for not letting me down. (like so many other have done by changing up the music or not changing when they should) I enjoy every song on the CD, music, lyrics, singing. What a GREAT CD, it's more r & B. The last cd was a mix of allot of stuff, but this one is just a GREAT CD! Pick it up you will be happy! I like the songs.. Lost without you, Can u Belive, and the very postive ASK Myself. Thank you Robin for a Great CD that I and enjoy over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Well I just received this CD in the mail from Amazon and bought it because I saw Robin Thicke on Good Morning America where he sang \\"Lost Without You\\" which I love. The rest of the CD in most cases is excellent - with the exception of one or two songs on it I think it deserves to do very well. I also like the fact that he doesn't only sing falsetto, and he sings in very different styles which really shows his versatility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album For Music Lovers","review":"I was recommended this CD earlier this year.. never got around to listening to it for some reason. Maybe it was the lack of hype or maybe it was because I had preconceived notions about Allan Thicke's son singing R&B (I had no idea of the type of work he had already done). Whatever the reason, I wish I would have picked this up earlier. It is a great CD that I can listen to from top to bottom. Definitely one of the better CD's I have heard in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Robin Thicke","review":"I have been as satisfied with this purchase as I have been with others in the past.

I have to admit that I was a bit surprised when I noticed that it was a white guy who actually sung it, yet my curiousity caught the best of me.I decided to try it out, and it's the best music decision I've made in YEARS! I can listen to this album for months, and I'm anticipating the next one. It's so creatively made, and on a few tracks I really do feel like I'm listening to Marvin Gaye! Additionally, this album isn't as much \\"Pop\\" as other artists have stuck with. It's mostly R&B; with a touch of Caribbean vibe on one track and even a tingle of Motown on others. This whole album has taught me (once again) to not judge a book by its cover. Robin Thicke is worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD","review":"is straight blazin.

Some seem to think that his previous cd was better than this one, if that's true I am going to have to order it , because I absolutely love this one . I have been listening to it non-stop since I got it . I usually don't like music with collaborations from rappers , but this one I can stand , Robin's vocal more than make up for that . I am very impressed with his vocal ability and talent , I'm more than suprised at how good he is . This cd is sexy and refreshing to listen to , the spanish flavor with the classical guitars is great . I gotta order my copy of \\"A beautiful World\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE'S JON B.?","review":"Well Jon B better step up his game because I think Robin Thicke is taking his place in Blue Eyed Soul. This is a smmmoooth album. The lyrics are deep and yearning. His voice is melodic and sincere. I always feel like turing the lights down low and having some Amaretto to this CD. My fav song is CAN U BELIEVE! He makes me believe in love again.I'll be listenin to this album for a long time. CLASSIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evolution in the wrong direction","review":"Thicke's first CD entitled Beautiful World was a great CD. Timeless in my opinion.

Amazing that he's being so favorably received!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD","review":"Robin Thicke has a smooth sound. A little soul mixed with a jazzy sound. I heard good things about this CD and it is true; it is a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Irresistible","review":"Now, I purchased Justin Timberlake's album when it first came out and I highly anticipated it. I even purchased his concert tickets. However, I listened to The Evolution of Robin Thicke a few times and I have to say that the album is just as good or even better than Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds. Robin Thicke didn't have to SexyBack or My Love all over the place and kept it smooth and slow and the album is still incredible. Tracks 1-12 are all amazing. Also, Robin Thicke, in my opinion, deserves a lot of credit because instead of running to Pharrell or Timbaland like JT does and did, he produced or co-produced all of the tracks on The Evolution. He deserves all the props in the world ... and he's just 2 soulful 2 be white."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing, well worth the wait!!!1","review":"First , I loved thicke since day one and I'm feeling his transition until Robin thicke the man, who is sure of his self vocally as a singer/songwriter. His vocal skills are on point his writing skills are so amazing. From beginning to end you will be so amazed by this disk. Even though yes, he is white and he is doing what some might call black only music. Once you listen to his music, you'll most def forget what race he belongs to an will be so amazed by how down with r&b he is. He is soul music without a doubt and has more soul than justin timberlake could ever muster up any day. If you want real soul music than Robin Thicke is the way to go!!! Buy the album and tell your friends to do the same, we need to support artist like him and keep them around for years to come. If we don't support him then we will only have people like cassie who can't sing or dance to entertain us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"I love Robin Thicke! He is amazing! His voice has such an amazing range. He is a combination of Justin Timberlake and Stevie Wonder. The whole cd is great. I even recommend his first cd - Beautiful World, but Evolution of Robin Thicke is better (if you had to pick one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Piece of Listening Art","review":"The first time I had heard of Robin Thicke was about a year ago when he released \\"Wanna Love U Girl\\". I started becomming interested in this guy and checked out his older stuff and loved it. So ive been anticipating this album for awhile and it didnt dissapoint. His vocals on here are amazing. All the songs have a unique sound and feel. I want this album to do really well, but the thing that shocked me was that when I went to buy a copy in FYE in my mall, they didnt have it under new releases or anything. I had to go searching under R&B for his name and I found 2 copy's of this album hiding in the back somewhere. Its really a shame if this album dosent do well, cause its such an amazing experiance. Please pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Record of 2007.","review":"Joni Mitchell's \\"Shine,\\" Richard Buckner's \\"Meadow\\" and Brandi Carlile's \\"The Story\\" were all masterpieces, but Robin Thicke's \\"Evolution of Robin Thicke\\" came out of nowhere and conquered my CD player for a good part of 2007.

Just a nice guy, whatever that means. Combination of his athletic prowess and psychologically effective approach reflects, I think, the author's no-nonsense philosophical makeup.Since the completely odd science comes only at the very end and is not really that important, one can tolerate it.Also, for an old fashioned reader like myself, the depiction of the upper echelons of the UK government as rational people is more satisfactory than a portrait of scheming nasties with agendas of their own.So, four stars for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring book","review":"Very boring.

Young drifting youth with troubled past enters one horse town terrorized by insane ex-con and his band of two. Simpathetic virgin girl and multi-ethnic whores, tuberculous gambler (Doc Holliday?), peg-legged bartender and even homosexual stable owners fill out the cast. Who do you think wins the stand-off? But it's not over. You have to find out the future of all the players and it is supposedly true. Sure. Skip this one and re-read Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Western","review":"The book is just awful. I've read all the Trevanian books and it's very hard to believe that the man who wrote SHIBUMI and THE EIGER SANCTION wrote this drivel. It's possible Trevanian is a Brit with a strange fascination with the American West, as in THE LOO SANCTION, and still doesn't have it down yet. The historical boo-boo on page 50 illustrates that all the overused and tired cliches were one too many. (Buffalo nickels were not minted until 15 years after the story takes place.)The personal introduction and postscript don't add anything to the novel. Who cares how he got the story? None of the characters are enduring or endearing. This book was a waste of printer's ink and my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely derivative","review":"Trevanian uses this novel as a soap box for ugly and racist diatribes against all non-Aryans in America. Cruel and nearly pornographic in its violence, Trevanian clearly derives his protagonist, Hamilton Leider from Hannibal Lecter. This novel felt \\"phoned in\\". The supposed historical wrap-up defies belief by even Trevanian's most ardent fans. I have read all of his/her books & articles and was thrilled to see a new book after a decade long absence. I will no longer scour the bookshelves looking for future drivel from this source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Looks like a must have.

The first was \\"Shibumi\\" followed by \\"The Eiger Sanction\\" and from there I was hooked on this great author.

I had thought initially that I missed one along the lines somewhere. After fifteen years, finally!

The story was simply an enjoyable book from start to finish. I spent a few very late nights with it because I just wanted to keep going to find out what would happen next. By the end of the book, you feel as though you know the characters, and are a part of the town of Twenty-Mile.

The commentary on contemporary themes and issues (such as extreme nationalism and the proliferation of militia) is rendered ineffectual, when framed by such a sensational, reactionary novel. Trevanian has succumbed to the \\"more is more\\" mentality that pervades our media, and it is our loss...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"The western has already been rescued from the dustbin by other writers. What on earth inspired this calamity?Almost every character is repulsive, including the main protagonist. Later we sympathize for him a little, but that's about it for any humanity in this tale.The villain is another cartoon stereotype derived from our movies. The supporting cast ... you couldn't care less. The plot is somewhat mindless and predictable, so that the \\"climax\\" is perfunctory. Not that there's much plot to be had. Violence happens, willy-nilly and without much reference to the story as a whole, mainly for shock value here and there.Whatever Trevanian's experimental/artistic intentions, let this book serve as a warning: consider meat and potatoes first, style later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Western with the Trevanian touch and a twist","review":"Trevanian only issue books every 15 years or so now, so this is a rare treat.

But \\"Shibumi\\" was still interesting, whereas \\"Incident\\" is totally uncompelling after the first one-sixth of the book. The negative sermonizing and one-dimensionality are much more pronounced here, though, and really wear on the reader rather quickly. The story and setting are bleak and heartless.And an overdose of exclamation points, which gives a cartoonish quality to the book, although he seeks to \\"recreate\\" a fictional history. Although some dialogue is amusing, it's hard to recommend even one portion of this book as worth reading.If you liked this book, you probably won't mind Anne Rice's \\"Servant of the Bones\\" and other similar disasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incident At Twenty Mile","review":"Incident at twenty mile is one hell of a pleasure to read, one of a kind. Breathtaking, riveting, and thrilling is a great way to define this book. \\"he had torn a strip off his blanket. One end tied to a bar and the other around his neck\\".Trevanians story tells about a deserted town a young, eager to please stranger carrying a homemade shotgun and a staggering secret. And a madman escaped from the Territorial Prison at Laramie, with two insane killers at his side. For the people at Twenty mile live in terror of the madmen. It is trilling in this way \\"the two men were pressed face to face, the landyard threaded through lieders strong fingers. He made a fist twisted until Tillman's eyes bulged\\". This story holds its ground and keeps you on your toes.Breathtaking, riveting, thrilling and much more is what this story is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intergalactic man!","review":"The song 'minataur' which was released as a single off this in 1969 turned me into a lifelong fan of synth music. Dick Hyman was certainly a pioneer in this at the time new genre of experimentation. He brought the synth to mainstream music, and out of the laboratories of universities. There were many electonic music lps out before this by unknown composers, but here it is used in a pop music context. I found it very entertaining if you enjoy exploring new musical territories. Of course the 'moog' used on this lp is not the same as the portable consumer product of today. as the other writer pointed out, he set the stage for future keyboard wizards. Real trippy stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best.","review":"I don't think this is a very good cartoon classic.

It was bad.My experience with this product is of very limited use; however, because of the severity of the discomfort caused by it, I have trouble recommending it to anyone.

Well that tape is quite old and I would like to have those speeches and music on CD now. The music is awesome. But the speech in the beginning of the original soundtrack set the mood for the music. The end speech was a great way to end the music (as it did the film). They had it right the first time. Too bad they had to change a good thing. I hope the powers that be release a new version with the speeches. Till then, I'll hold off on buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There ARE alternatives","review":"This recording suffers from bad mixing.

The solo trumpet that heralds a triumphant march that is easily one of the most perfect for a film about World War II. Glodsmith was able to write music that captured Patton's personality and along with George C Scott's performance, Patton is close to perfect. As a bonus, there are some tracks from the Goldsmith film Tora!Tora!Tora! This cd only gets 4 stars because the transfer is very poor. I hope that a proper transfer is made to honor Mr. Goldsmith's musical legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldsmith's PATTON - Royal Scottish National Orchestra","review":"If you're hunting for the PATTON score you know and love, this ain't it. Good music, as it goes, but lacks the energy and clarity of the theatrical release soundtrack. Without the pivotal opening speech delivered by George C. Scott, it just ain't the same. If you are not familiar with the theater score, this recording may suffice. In the same vein (not having possession of the theatrical release soundtrack for comparative value, so not knowing any better), I can say that I did enjoy the TORA, TORA, TORA score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Be Buying","review":"I have been looking for the original score on CD for several years, particularly for the GC Scott speeches. I thought I had finally found it, but was disappointed to read the reviews which said that they had been excised. I thank the reviewers that mentioned this omission. I will not be buying this album. However, from the number of disappointed purchasers, I suspect the original soundtrack would have a modest following.

Also, in my opinion, some of the music isn't as good as the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better versions exist elsewhere","review":"Altho the attempt was grand,the result was a poorly miked version of both soundtracks.

Nice attempt,well done,but lacking in sound quality and impact.

It's a mosaic structure that Bowes uses to take trips into the various corners of Western history, and it works beautifully. If you like your contemporary fiction to reflect the roots of where we came from, this book is for you. At once science fiction in its conceit of time travel, and fantasy in its methods. Time travel for Bowes seems to be an act of memory and remembrance. After reading this book, you'll have a hard time forgetting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, well crafted","review":"This is an interesting, well crafted novel of character, and of the marital relationship. You are privy to each of the main character's thoughts, although Francis is not introspective at all, and most of what you learn about him is through dialogue. He is the most problematic character, being such a good soul; it took me most of the book to accept him as genuine, not an idealized personality. Perhaps Godwin could have offered more insight into his attraction to Magda, or perhaps BOTH marriages occurred in part because one partner was ready for marriage to escape their current life.Bea McCandless is an appealing secondary character, and I liked what she had to say about novels (p. 270): the characters are like people she knew, \\"Only they're clearer, somehow, in your books.

Christian Slater's character has been in love with the young lady for sometime, and the misplaced affection he receives brings the situation to a horrible end. This film had a lot of conversational drama and very little action. Fans of Tammy Lauren and Christian Slater are probably going to want to own this film out of a since of completism, because both young people have considerable camera time. As a huge fan of Tammy Lauren myself, it pains me to see her talents wasted in this movie, but her ability to come off as real and true to the character she plays still stands out in the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Cooks taters faster than just putting them on the grate; only downside is that the taters stick to the prongs that hold them.

I'm not saying that this is intended to be a book geared towards Wiccans-in fact, Malbrough's other book is about invoking the saints, so I would venture to guess that he is not Wiccan at all. But if YOU are Wiccan, as I am, you will probably find little in this book...spells to make people fall in love with you? Spells to hex others?

But as you progress to the second and last third of the book, the exercises become progressively and unfairly difficult, and not because they are meant to challenge us. Instead, they are just poorly written.Problems in textbooks should illuminate, not obfuscate key topics in the chapter. When a major problem asks you to calculate out a complex situation, there should be more explicit and explanatory examples in the chapter text in order for a good student to go back and teach himself the principles that the authors are trying to test, instead of struggling to figure out what they are asking to begin with.

The action is limited to one day (unlike the careful development of time in other Beck books) and places an emphasis on the stupidity and brutatlity of Swedish police, and it's far over-the-top when compared to other works in the series, such as \\"Cop Killer\\" and \\"The Laughing Policeman.\\"Whatever you do, DON'T start with this one. \\"Roseanna\\" and \\"The Laughing Policeman\\" are better bets to ease into the Beck series.Ironically, the book ended up as an excellent Swedish movie -- \\"The Man on the Roof\\" -- that's subtitled in English and available used in VHS.

The the main maps of Australia and New Zealand are somewhat decent, but the maps that they give for each region, for each chapter or section, are so detailed that there is no way you can reference where about they are in that specific region.

The squirrels have figured out a way to get some food but not much. They hang from the current pole (not the pole that comes with it) by its hind legs, put their front legs on the bar and pick out some seeds. All-in-all it works great!! I would recommend it highly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the intended purpose","review":"I bought this too keep squirrels and racoons from getting into the feeder on my deck and eating all the seed.

We couldn't figure out how the birds were eating all of that feed so fast! Then we witnessed a deer sticking her tongue under the little trap door and sucking the feeder dry! Just a note--the squirrel proof designation can mean that a squirrel can not destroy it by chewing on it-which is true about this feeder. Also, this feeder deters most squirrels. If you have it hanging from a shepherd's hook they can hang by their feet from above and delicately stick their paws into the holes that the birds also use. Possibly hanging from a hook on your eaves would solve that problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely not squirrel proof","review":"Location is irrelevant. Squirrels either jump onto the roof or climb up the pole. Once on the feeder, they either hang upside down from the edge of the roof and dip in or they hang on to the side and reach around. Once they figured it out, seed consumption has gone from 40 pounds a month to 25 pounds a week. Squirrels are greedy and they loiter, making it harder for the birds to get any.

Big big waste of money! Don't even go there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed well","review":"I love the idea of this squirrel proof feeder, and I do like this. The only thing that would deter me from purchasing another one like this, is the fact that the bottom ledge that the birds sit on is closed. It collects water, and pools up which in turn, is absorbed by the bird seed and becomes stagnant. We have wasted several scoops of seed with this, because the seed becomes wet, and undesirable to the birds. We are looking to buy another type of feeder which I think the rain water won't collect on the bottom. Other than that, I liked it. It just took a season to realize that this happens, and therefore, wouldn't purchase this type again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Squirrel proof but not large bird proof","review":"I purchased this feeder not so much to deter squirrels but to keep the larger birds from depleting the seed supply so quickly. However, even though I have the feeder set on the lightest setting, I have seen the grackles and blue jays land on the perches and the perches do not close the feeder. Everytime I go out to press on the perch, it appears to \\"stick\\" the first time I press down on it - which is apparently enough to keep the perch from closing the feed holes. Even if the perch closed, the birds can easily just hang onto the sides edges of the feeder and get to the seed.

Although the squirrel went through a whole range of contortions including hanging from one of the pivotable arm-shutters, it was totally frustrated. Watching was at least as amusing as seeing one flipped off the YF. It took several weeks before the (wild) birds realized food could be had from the feeder.

We placed feeder out of range of them being able to jump to it. From past experience, it's better to keep them off completely because even if it is squirrel-proof, the squirrels will still damage the exterior of the feeder by chewing the paint off.The feeder comes with a plastic pole-mounting (post) bracket and some steel tubing sections - these were not hefty enough, so I discarded them, and built my own mount for attaching to the bottom of the feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as smart as the average New England black and grey squirrel","review":"This feeder had great promise for the first day or so.....until the squirrel figured out how to hang from the roof and not touch the bar...maybe some other areas of the country don't have the smart ones that we have here in New England..but I swear they are now laughing at me...outsmarted the average human-being...I must say in defense of this feeder..they don't stay on it too long..so less seed is consumed....but they still keep the birds away while they're gourging themselves..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirrel \\"Pruf\\" feeder","review":"The feeder has less capacity than it seemed and is not completely squirrel proof.

I was able to look at a Triassic fossil dinosaur footprint at one site and find some Devonian fossils in another. The Roadside Geology book is great for someone who only has a short period of time to explore a particular area.

I think Steven Sheil is a director to watch out for in the future. Hollywood could never have made a movie like this. How fitting that Mum and Dad is being released on Mothers day.

All the story revolves around the Remillard family and it makes you long for some contact with the rest of humanity. Also, the Remillard family's powers are poorly described and used.

Then after learning never to lock the remote, the cord slowly starts to tear from the base where it connects into the ipod. Ok. Then finally after just ignore the little kinks, it starts to send little electrically sparks from the headphones into my ear. I've had enough and now I have to go about purchasing a new one.

I use a hard case for my iPod, and it was inconvenient to keep lifting the lid to use the controls. It was about a week, though, when the cord cover by the connector started breaking. Since then, I've had to re-enforce the connector several times, and currently have a plastic casing over it with some tape to keep it in place. Not worth the price since it breaks so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, but didn't find it too useful","review":"This remote is mostly for outdoor use - very good to navigate the iPod while it is tucked inside your pocket, mostly with the keypad put on hold. Would have been great if the remote was wireless. It is not very useful indoors since you have to get near the iPod to operate the remote - you might as well put your fingers on the iPod itself.This used to come free with the 3G iPods, along with the leather case (that's how I got it!). I hardly use it since I have a wireless remote (NaviPod).Looks like it has been designed to work well with the Apple iPod carrying case. This is because, with the Apple case, there is no way to access the iPod controls when the iPods is inside the case. This remote has all the controls (except that we can't see the display), and a hold button on the side. It also has a simple clip to fasten it to your clothes.If your habit is to put a long playlist and play it while jogging, working out etc., this remote could be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"great then, even greater now","review":"this \\"anthology\\" of mostly traditional folk music is a marvelous trip back for those of us who sang along in the coffee houses and open air festivals of the 60's and early 70's. it ought to be just as enjoyable for listeners today -- they're wonderful songs, and barbara's a wonderful talent. happily, i can tell the earlier reviewer who wondered \\"what's become of barbara?\\" that's she's singing up a storm again, in better voice than ever, just back from a successful european tour and with a new cd just out: \\"what are you gonna do when there ain't no jazz?\\" ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara Dane on Don Ewell CD","review":"Those Barbara Dane fans looking for more by her should look up a CD titled \\"Denver Concert\\" under Don Ewell.

For old Beaver fans, though, the film had its (rare) moments. Christopher McDonald's portrayal of Ward Cleaver was very close, and he truly shone a couple of times when expressing irritation -- he captured the exact tone we used to hear from Hugh Beaumont, when his \\"Ward\\" was upset or angry. The effect, though brief, was hilarious.And we realize from this film that Ken Osmond's \\"Eddie Haskell\\" was a superstar of a television character, an unforgettable icon of teenage obnoxiousness -- and no one in the universe could ever portray Eddie with the same gusto, spirit and benign teen sleaze as Ken Osmond did.It's time for the old Beaver episodes to be put on DVD, so new generations can enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching just because of Erik Von Detten!!!!!!!!!","review":"The reason I originally watched this movie was because Erik Von Detten was in it.

But there were some things wrong like some of the girls were wearing miniskirts and nobody wore miniskirts until 1965 or in the late '60s. And also in the movie, I saw Wally (Erik von Detten) was kissing his girlfriend Karen (Erika Christensen). And Wally wasn't kissing any of his girlfriends in the original Leave it to Beaver series except in this one episode that was made in February 28, 1963, \\"Box Office Attraction\\", Wally's girlfriend Marlene Holmes was kissing Wally. But anyway, this movie is 10x better than \\"The Sandlot.\\" You can see my review on that movie too.

The only surprise here is that Penelope Spheeris wasn't tapped to direct, as this sort of project seems to be her specialty.

And his brother Wally Cleaver's (Erik Von Detten) best friend Eddie Haskell (Adam Zolotin) tells him to to something to make his old man proud. Like play football and his dad will buy him the bike and then quit the team after he has it. Beaver does to that.

This does not fit this need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price","review":"This thing come for such a good price with so much it's defiantly a steal my only complain is that some of the colors aren't and primary as i'd want them to be but some times they can be really handy.

It was a gift, and overall the person who recieved it really like it. SHe tells me the quality is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Low quality thread, low quality tools, low quality case. On three days of light use one of the arms broke off. After a few weeks one of the large sides broke off.The spools are always falling out no matter how well I stick them on. This didn't end up being worth the money. Maybe for a young starting newbie. I was getting back into sewing and had managed to misplace a lot of my tools in a move. Wanted to kick-start my new set and ended up buying all new tools on top of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like picking up your supplies?","review":"My wife has this storage system and we hate it. The button/latch mechanism that holds the box shut is positioned poorly. 90% of the time when you pick it by the handle the button/latch to open the box fails and dumps your stuff on the ground below. If we got this out more than once a year it would be in the trash by now but the usage vs cost of a new one doesn't seem worth it. Avoid this product, unless you enjoy re-sorting your supplies on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality and selection for the price!","review":"So I admit I bought this after looking at other kits and going that's all I get for $10-15? I'm not saying that with this one! The thread selection is great, it's sewing thread with good color selection and the scissors actually feel really sturdy. There is lots of room for expansion in the drawers, there was plenty of room to absorb my odds and ends from previous sewing kits. Needle selection is good and the odds and ends (pins, pin cushion, thimble, seam ripper, etc) all tuck away nicely. My only complaint is that the box itself is a bit flimsey when it's open and spread out. I don't think it's a good package for a smaller child learning how to sew that isn't patient and gentle with the kit but it's got more than enough if you are going to be fixing buttons, doing some simple by hand sewing and garmet modification as an adult or college student."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most understandable statistics book ever!","review":"Easy read, with plenty of worked examples and extremely relevant to food sensory evaluation.

It is breathtaking and simply some of the greatest music of our time - no kidding.The CD notes confirm this when Keith tells of a man that had been an assistant to the conductors at La Scala for 25 years. This man, moved to tears, told Keith after the convert that this was the strongest, most moving musical experience he ever had, even though he had heard countless concerts at La Scala. That sort of says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"solo improvisation","review":"La Scala is another example of Keith Jarrett coming to the piano, sitting down and opening himself to the moment. It is genius at work. I don't know of a purer example of improvisation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"...this is a pretty dull performance. There are just too many LONG passages where Jarrett is indulging in nothing more than mindless key twiddling, waiting for the muses to inspire, which they do all too infrequently. Just when you think he's reached his stride, he gives out like a dead battery. The Koln concert remains Jarrett's definitve solo performance. And yes, I know it's a Keith Jarrett hallmark, but the frequent crying out is distracting and obnoxious. This CD is just okay in a New Age sort of way, but I'm glad I didn't buy it. (Thank God for libraries.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jarrett Noodling","review":"Miguel of Seattle hits it on the head: mindless is just one word that comes to mind; boring, unfocused etc.As a trio and if you can stand the vocal orgasms of Jarrett the group swings.

I bought it just as I was starting my first FOH sound engineering position. Don't be fooled, there are absolutely no tips in this book. It does not in any way help a new or longtime sound guy. The only suggestion in the entire book was that a tube compressor might sound good on drums and I just told you about that.

No anecdotes about the artists whatsover and not even a few \\"road tales\\" sprinkled in... I can't think of anyone on earth that could find this interesting.

The guitars are brutal and the kick-drum doesn't stop for a moment. And the lyrics show the heart of these guys. They play with an intensity that shows their fervor for Christ. This is a must have for all Christian metal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empowered indeed","review":"A definite change of style for the mighty Living Sacrifice. With the loss of the band's founding member, vocalist and bass player DJ, Living Sacrifice has traded in their raging, technical, most excellent metal for a hybrid hard-core that is bringing new a new set of fans. This album is excellent. The guitars are very rythmic on this album. The drumming isn't as technical as in previous albums, but still very, very tight. The vocals are quite differnt this time. Guitarist and vocalist, Bruce Fitzhugh projects his throaty screams with ease. Once again dripping with the proclamation of their Christian beleifs, the lyrics are superb. Old schoolers will cut their hair when hard-core kids make them aware.El Kabong gives it four head bangs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supreme","review":"I really enjoy this album. It's just awesome.

Anyway, this cd is pretty good and one of L.S.'s best. I love how it starts off with the drums on the first song, in fact, I love the drumming on this whole disk. Lance isn't called The Machine for nothing. As for the rest of the album, it is all good and pretty fast, kinda like speed-thrash. I can't find one bad song on here. My only complaint about this cd is that is sounds repetitive after awhile. Oh well. I guess it comes with the metalcore territory. Plus, the enhanced version comes with the video for Reject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality stuff","review":"I have listened to this album repeatedly for the last 8 years and it still stands the test of time. This is the first Living Sacrifice album after the lineup change. A slight change in their sound from their previous albums, and I actually prefer their new sound. It's more complex and varied than their previous albums. It's also not as \\"death metal\\" as their previous stuff, and has evolved into more of a thrash metal album. They have slowed down the tempo in some songs and have chosen to be more subtle and technical with their music rather than a pure onslaught of guitar riffs from their previous albums. These guys have some serious talent and it shows. A high quality album all around"},{"rating":"2","title":"Benassi Bros Rock Again!","review":"I have to say, this is a GREAT song! I just had to get it! I only wish I could get some kind of music video DVD of it. This CD has 6 different versions, all of which are great! I am enjoying it very much!It is a very hard find too.

Lou has one of the finest voices in rock history and still does. I just saw the guy perform live three weeks prior to this review.Here is the problem:The sound of this album is soft pop - a far stretch from the doo wop infused rock n roll flavor that drizzled over this amazing singer's recordings from the 1960's.There are no live drums and the instrumentation is cheesy.If you are a die hard Lou fan, buy this album for your collection.If you are not a die hard Lou fan, try his greatest hits compilations or the albums Paint America Love & Beyond the Blue Horizon.Pledging My Love"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I received this album as promised 2 days before the due date.

Historically significant but repetitive and slow. Mao keeps it simple and focuses on the most important elements of successful guerilla operations. Simple and low tech are better in most situations.Bottom line...a highly recommended classic, just don't expect Shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginner's Guide to Understanding Guerilla Warfare","review":"Mao Zedong's, On Guerilla Warfare, is an excellent beginner's guide to understanding guerilla in all its aspects. It is clearly written and very easy to understand from a layman's point of view. Several important lessons can be easily gleaned from the text (like how support of the people is all important). In addition, it is a short book that can be read in a day or two. Rarely such books on warfare are brief as this one (except for Sun Tzu's Art of War).This book should be required reading for any military officer now serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. In spite of its implied communist overtones, the lessons gleaned from On Guerilla Warfare are completely applicable to the wars of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Swap Meet\\" Quality Knife","review":"With the purchase price, I didn't expect to get a super-high quality knife, but with the Schrade name, I expected something better than cheap, imported junk. This knife, however, is junk. It just screams CHEAP.The imitation stag handle is cheap painted plastic that doesn't even attempt to look real. It's like a cartoon version of what stag should look like. The steel is also obviously cheap Chinese steel. I think the original version of this knife several years ago was much higher quality.Like I said in the title, these are the type of knives you see laying out at a swap meet or a truck stop. You can get a much higher quality knife like this for not much more money. You can get an American-made Buck fixed-blade hunting knife for about $10 more that's worlds ahead of this in quality.This wasn't the screaming bargain I thought it was going to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I usually don't buy inexpensive knives, but I fell for the Schrade name because they used to make quality knives. This is a Chinese made piece of garbage that looks like something you would by for $5 at a shady carnival vendor's tent. The grip is made of hollow plastic and it is held together by a screw, not rivets and the fit and finish is extremely poor. There is not much of a tang extending into the grip as far as I can tell, so I can't imagine that it could take much abuse. The leather sheath is thin and cheaply made. The blade is heavy, but I can't speak for the quality of the steel or how well it holds an edge since I have thrown this in the back of the closet to put in the garage sale bin. Do yourself a favor and save up a few extra dollars and buy yourself a well made knife from someone like Boker or CRKT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"I really like the blade of this knife. It has some weight behind it and was fairly sharp upon arrival. I didn't really care to much for the fake stag handle and would have gladly paid a bit more for the real thing. This is definitely a good knife for camping or even hunting without breaking the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete trash!! Really!","review":"When I received this knife the handle was lose at the top brass trim piece and the knife was so dull you could not butter toast with this extremely bad example of a knife and the scabbard is starting to fall apart, if this unit has a warranty I am not a happy customer!This cheap piece of garbage is not even worth sending in for warranty service it would just be another waste of shipping and repair fees and guess what Schrade YOU STILL SUUUUCK A HUGE UNIT!!!

After he beats him Cincinati goes in the bathroom but the guy who lost tries to stab him with a knife Cincinati runs away. Thats the start of the movie.The only thing I'll tell you is that Cincinati ends up playing the man in his usual 5 card stud.This movie is simply fantastic(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your gambling money on this stinker","review":"There is a reason this film (and I use that term loosely) has not been released on DVD..

That's why it works. If you are like me you will enjoy this movie. Of course, you don 't know what like me means. What it means is if you like your men to be men, flaws and all, You will like The Cincinnatti Kid. Forget about Ann-Margeret and Tuesday Weld. This film belongs to McQueen. He is ably aided by Malden, Robinson, and a real man's dame, Joan Blondell.

Today lots of shows about poker and poker tournaments. This is a great movie about folks in that world, playing for high stakes, and wanting to be the best, the one. I very much enjoyed this movie, especially the end, when the kid really learned what was important in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot Going For It","review":"What has stuck with me all these years, since I saw it in the theater in 1965, wasn't the story but the title song by Ray Charles. I have never been able to get \\"The Cincinnati Kid\\" song out of my head.Now, I understand a lady in Chicago, Denise Brigham, has recorded this song on a CD called \\"Hotel Lafayette,\\" and the song sounds great! I'm glad others appreciate this great song.I've also always enjoyed poker; Steve McQueen and Edward G. Robinson are two of my all- time favorite actors and I thought Tuesday Weld and Ann-Margaret were two of the most beautiful women in their day.....so, with all that, this movie has a lot going for it. Did I mention how great the transfer is on this DVD? Wow, this was nicely filmed!Yes, the story doesn't have much spark until the poker showdown at the end of the movie, but that lasts at least 40 minutes! That ending is an excellent one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic by the King of Movie Scores","review":"A must for fans of John Williams.Reminiscent at times of Indiana Jones, Close Encounters, Superman, and Star Wars, yet still shining with its own worth. Fun, energetic, memorable and entirely charming.Oddly, the pure orchestral experience is marred by a \\"comic\\" recorded cannon blast used as percussion and one very distracting yet brief John Bellushi voice-over.If you only want the orchestral version of the 1941 march, look for it on the John Williams/Boston Pops collections. If you love the sound of John Williams' late-seventies/early-eighties scores, buy 1941!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best songs are missing on this soundtrack CD","review":"They recently brought 1941 on television. I just turned on when there were three women singing in the tradition of the Andrews Sisters. Even though the action of the movie did not grab me it was the music that kept me watching. The singing and the orchestral music they played in the ballroom of the U.S.O. was so great I wanted it in CD quality. After buying this CD I was very disappointed to find that all of the songs by the singing women, especially \\"Down by the Ohio\\", were missing.With only 38 minutes of music on the CD only half of the capacity is used. Absolutely not understandable they omitted the best tracks! This disc might be all right for the person looking for John Williams instrumental music only. For somebody who wants a CD worthy being called \\"Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" it is not complete and cannot be recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have this ultra portable DVD and LOVE it.","review":"This unit is so portable yet has a big 4.2\\" WS TFT LCD screen.

But i use my earphones and that is not a problem. I can't leave home without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely useable and sexist.","review":"The book is okay if you want to create sterotype characters or get some basic layout. The main drawback is the that while it does give some information and a few layouts, some parts are sexist. Many roles are typecasted as male or female. In the child development section it constantly lists males as agressive or addicted to sex almost from childhood while girls are more focused on emotions and shortcomings.It list bachelors as comnpletely mentally disturbed and says nothing about single women whats so ever or the behavior traits they show. Some of the information is misleading and disturbing.It may be good but it could be better if Dr. Edelstein used a more objective approach or reviewed her facts more carefully. It would also helped if she had an extra voice to add to the informaton or someone who isn't biased or misandranistic.Use this at your own risk if you want real 3 dimensional characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a psychology primer paired with a writer's guide","review":"The second edition of Linda N. Edelstein, Ph.D.'s WRITER'S GUIDE TO CHARACTER TRAITS provides over 400 reference lists of character traits from a range of behaviors, paired with tips on how to incorporate these traits into a plot and build upon it.

The author brings a unique perspective and includes relevant material. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is cumbersome and poorly produced. Kindle formats usually allow navigation to the table of contents from the GoTo selection on the menu. The creators of this book didn't format it correctly and excluded that feature. Some of the titles and fonts are inconsistent and the sentences break between paragraphs, making it difficult to read and hard to follow. And I still can't find the index, which is one of the key features in a reference book like this one. The producers of the Kindle edition did this great book a huge disservice. I can't recommend the Kindle edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After reading many wonderful reviews of this book, I was surprised to be disappointed by the content. Although some of the information about basic personality styles was useful and interesting, overall I felt the information was cliched and would not be particularly useful to me in my writing. I also was put off by the author's know-it-all tone that pervaded the book. She included real-life cases of people whom she had seen as therapy clients in a tone that communicated amusement at their struggles. The most useful part of this book to me was the glossary in the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writer's Guide to Character Traits","review":"This book here is fantastic at pointing out every little trait going in people!

The problem, though, is that for a writer it's kind of useless. One can pick up information on mental illness by reading other books which specialize in the subject. And if you need to be told all these things about people's personalities, then you're probably not going to make a good writer anyway. A writer of fiction needs to know about people and how they work, and if you really need this book then you've got quite a long way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource!","review":"This is an excellent reference book, especially for genre fiction writers whose characters often need to fit a \\"type.\\" This book's incredibly clear lists and excellent organizational layout, help the writer to sketch out the history and details of their characters. (i.e. My villain's a violent control freak, what kind of a mother would he have? or My heroine's a quiet librarian type, what's she like in a relationship?)Since the book is formed primarily from lists, without much extensive text, it is even more helpful to a writer who doesn't want to impede the flow of working on character sketches (or whatever) by reading something extensive.This is a really nice resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love lists that I can reference...","review":"1) I love lists that I can reference when I need them and that is how this book is organized. It isn't meant to be read from front cover to back but for you to jump around and use the sections you need.2) I'm sure this book could be the size of six volumes but the areas the author chooses to focus on are well selected and very helpful3) I'm finding that to keep some of my character true I can reference different aspects that make up a person and cut & past them into something that makes sense, people can relate to and has some consistency.4) Better understanding what drives an Obsessive personality or an Adventurer is opening up more plot options during my brainstorming session. This is a nice \\"research\\" book on people and what makes us tick."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"I am a writer of fiction and non-fiction, and was curious to read this book for myself after seeing all of the great reviews. I found the author's condescending tone to be a major irritation throughout the book. I also found the information to be condensed and not useful. If I want to create a character who is a serial murderer, I can research it myself instead of getting a brief checklist of character traits. This is the least helpful book on writing that I have read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tool for Layering Character Traits","review":"This book is valuable in a way that it helps you calculate what type of personality traits your characters might have. It doesn't say your characters must have these traits but that they might have specific traits or perspectives on things if they did X or think like Y. It helps layer your character, creating depth and understanding for human behavior. I refer to it when I'm stummped or can't figure out how a person might act coming from a background I have no familiarity with. I think it's a valuable tool and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO HELPFUL!","review":"I'm a fiction writer and this book has been my bible for the last 2 months.

If you are an amateur writer you can skip this book, mostly because the data is completely stereotypical and lack the little details that are so important for developing \\"tasty\\" characters. The career analisis part is somewhat useful but very limited. Remember that it can be a lot worse for a writer to fall in extreme stereotypes than to skip some minor career characteristics."},{"rating":"1","title":"No enthusiasm here.","review":"This is but a short \\"add-on\\" to Timothy Kearney's excellent review of this book. I found The Writer's Guide to Character Traits merely another textbook formula for creating wooden people. Stereotypical. Gives you nothing that would enable you to maximize these traits--qualify them for inclusive fitness into your story. At best, this book is good for (occasional) checklist purposes only. Far and away, in my opinion, the most USEFUL book on characterization is Karen Hood's Creating Character Emotions. ##### Before buying this book I would recommend reading Timothy Kearney's review. Re-read it.

Perhaps some \\"types\\" of people are already so stereotyped that Dr. Edelstein felt no need for inclusion.Oh yes, and did I mention that use of eyedrops and incense is a sure sign that the character is a marijuana user?Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful addition to any writer's library and resources","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by the enormous amount of valuable information that this ambitious text presented in an easily accessible and truly informational format. The examples given are clear and understandable and the information itself is invaluable. This book should be on a writer's shelf next to the Thesaurus and Dictionary. It will undoubtedly help writers to create more authentic characters and more realistic interactions between characters who encounter each other and a variety of scenarios as booksand stories unfold. I think it will be a great resource when authors are struggling with which type of character to introduce into their writings. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Simplistic","review":"A good writer is curious about people and how they behave and function. He/she has excellent observation skills. This book will generally not be helpful for that type of writer.There are a few interesting tidbids here and there in this book that may interest those who haven't studied, formally or informally, the field of psychology. However, if the serious writer is interested in learning about psychological disorders per se, they are better directed toward the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) put out by the American Psychiatric Association. As for the rest of the book, it's a noble attempt on the author's part (I gave an extra star for effort--it looks like it took a long time to put this book together), but the canned stereotypic descriptions aren't going to be helpful for the truly observant. Most serious writers will be better off relying on their own insights into human nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much depth","review":"When reading stories my favorite part is the character development. I always try to question my characters motives while writing. I was hoping this book would help with the psychological aspects I might not be as familiar with. When I opened the book I was greeted with bullet points of common traits of cliché sounding character like 'the Boss'. The entries are short and don't go into enough depth to be useful. Most traits are common sense or at least obvious to anyone who reads enough. It is hardly helpful for characterization and using this book may cause more cliché characters. I am not saying these character traits are not true in some situations, but if you want to make a unique character that stands out to the reader I wouldn't use this book. Before buying I would at least look at the later pages of the 'look inside the book' to make sure this is the type of book want."},{"rating":"1","title":"writers guide to character traits","review":"I was disappointed by this book.

While I appreciated the lighthearted, uplifting approach to daily quiet times I was hoping for something with more depth and insight.

Slyvia suffered such misfortune, from a cheating, ego-centric husband to arriving at her London flat with two small children and discovering the electric and phone had not been connected.

I find I'm gaining a broader understanding of her poetry thanks to this well written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Plath biography","review":"This is the worst of the Plath biographies; lurid, unscrupulous and shallow. For numerous reasons, this biography is unworthy of the attention of any individual with a serious interest in Plath and her work. This biography is virtually devoid of literary criticism; instead, its locus is Plath's sexuality. Rather than treating this subject sensitively, Alexander chooses to crudely fictionalize Plath's experiences, for, one assumes, maximum voyeuristic pleasure. I am also incensed by Alexander's treatment of Ted Hughes and the tragic suicide of his lover Assia Wevill: to paraphrase Janet Malcolm in her brilliant study \\"The Silent Woman,\\" he eagerly demonizes Hughes to the cusp of libel law. Luckily, Alexander's hateful assumptions about Hughes have been discounted by the publication of Birthday Letters and Plath's unedited journals. In summary, Rough Magic is a poorly-written, one-dimensional portrait of Sylvia Plath not intended for the serious Plath scholar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic well-worth reading","review":"Carl Henry's classic work speaks to the evangelical setting today much as it did when it was first written.

I'm a professional landscaper, and my hands get thrashed. But nobody knows that, because each night I exfoliate and moisturize heavily so that I can still have nice hands.This is a wonderful cream because it sinks in, doesn't sting cracked skin, and really provides long-lasting protection and healing. One tube lasts forever, in fact I usually get the gift set of small tubes of L'Occitane hand creams just for some variety, and I find that the three small tubes easily last me the year.The two things I dislike are the scent, which smells a bit like old-lady cold cream - not unpleasant, but a bit more perfumey than I like, and the cap, which is fiddly and hard to get back on once you've moisturized your hands.Other than that, this is a highly effective cream that works great for healing hands that have been in the dirt."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will purchase this again!","review":"I like this cream.

I was wrong. The writing comes off as frankly immature: the writer is trying too hard with her imagery, and not paying enough attention to her plot details. (In one paragraph, Edward takes a sip of the champagne and then a few sentences later, calls the waiter over to open it - good trick! And that wasn't the only one.) There were numerous copyediting failures as well, which are just annoying. The characters are not at all compelling.

It is a wonderful comedy with a great feeling for the relationships among the characters. Punctuated with sharp yet thoughtful dialogue, I found myself wanting more of it when the credits rolled.Carolina is primarily story of the character Carolina (Julia Stiles), the oldest of three motherless (and mostly fatherless) girls being raised by their eccentric grandmother(Shirley MacLaine). Despite the less than ideal circumstances of her childhood, Carolina has managed to pull herself up by her own bootstraps. But instead of leaving her less than perfect family behind her she chooses to embrace them and keep them an integral part of her life.

It is a movie about two things, finding the right person, and it is about what a family is all about...we all have those family dinners that you want to get up and leave right away as soon as someone opens their mouth...and this is the way that Carolina feels as she totes her date around, trying to impress the family.

CHECK THE RECIPES BEFORE YOU MAKE THEM!! For instance, there's a crustless cheesecake recipe, serves 12, 100 cal. Sounds great, right? Made from real ingredients. It even looks and tastes like cheesecake. But, I was a little concerned. It seemed too good to be true. WW placed the cake at 5 PP per slice based on the recipe. Further research at nutritiondata.com showed an actual calorie count of 266 cal per slice.I've not checked all the recipes, but do be aware that the counts shown in the book may be WAY off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly works","review":"I read this book and also joined Jillian's online weight loss program, I've lost a total of 8 lbs in 4 weeks, just enough to get me started. This book and the online program really works plus they dont try to sell you too many worthless stuff like everybody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide for Health and Wellness","review":"This book is fantastic. Jillian talks about diet and metabolism, and explains the scientific reasoning behind her ideas. But, what I love the best is the section on exercise. She explains why circuit training burns more fat and why certain muscle groups should be worked together and in what order. I find myself repeatedly refering back to that section when I plan out my work out routines. There is a fantastic guide to exercises for each muscle group, with photos to illustrate and very clear instructions. I'm so glad I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating","review":"I've only started reading the first two chapters of this book, and already I find myself considering new possibilities about how I view myself and food!Winning by Losing is 3 books in one.

This book is about changing the way you look at yourself, why you want to lose weight, what you expect to happen when you reach your goal, what are you willing to do to make that happen.

Actually there wasn't a single thing in this pamphlet that taught me something new. You can learn all of this through a google search of NILF (nothing in life is free). Some of the tips are: don't alpha roll your dog, initiate play and end it, teach your dog to heel, don't let your dog demand attention. Most people know these things, I think? I knew the pamphlet was short but I thought it would have some insightful tips and commentary, but nope.

No intro, no explanation of rational for information provide, just a list of actions to take with your dog. Even worse, I think much of this information is based on some outdated ideas and a belief that dogs behave just like wolves. To compound matters she simpifies (or misunderstands) wolf behave in such a way that her adivse is really not very useful.

It sounds like you would have to work with them for a lot of time and would have a pretty fat pooch when you managed to get him trained in the basics, and you would have to have him all to yourself to accomplish this.

Made a lot of mistakes in the beginning and paid for it. Biggest mistake was not taking the role of pack leader and as a result was challenged quite a bit. Fortunately, after watching a lot a dog training programs prior to reading this book, it reinforced what I had already learned and now practice from the television. Had I gotten this book first, I would have saved on a lot time in front of the tube.Anyway, this is a great little book because it gets right to the point without you spending hours upon hours with another book thats probably 200 pages or more. What is it 5 or 6 pages? So you are done in two shakes with more knowledge about how to properly interact with your dog as opposed to someone who may not have researched before hand or even had any prior experience with a canine.Highly recommend it for any first time dog owner!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pack Leader","review":"I got this book as well as 2 others by Cesare Milan for my daughter who got a new 18 mo old mix.

It's really slow, the surprises really aren't all that surprising (I just knew one key character was clearly in on it) and to be honest, I want to tell you right now whodunit! Honestly, don't waste your time on this especially when there are so many other better reads (particularly anything by Ellroy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster","review":"Jonathan Kellerman used to be one of my very favorite authors. There was a time when i couldn't wait for his newest novel to be released. Actually, I have quite a collection of his books in my library. But, unfortunately i believe Mr Kellerman is slipping. The last two novels of his which i have read (Monster being the most recent) were not up to his usual standard. My biggest complaint was that I did not care enough about the characters to wonder what was going to happen in the end. I also was dissappointed that Milo and Robin were barely mentioned. I enjoy reading about them almost as much as I do Alex Delaware. I sincerely hope that his next book reminds me of why I used to be one of his biggest fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monstrosity","review":"This is a tired old formula for Kellerman. The characterizations have become stuck, with no appreciable development. If Robin doesn't kill Milo then I hope someone else does. Talk about machismo, why the hell does Robin need to give her permission about anything anyway when its all lipservice. The same dialogues & the same same setting the only difference being the title. There is no life to this script & it becomes monotonous & predictable. Even Hercule Poirot was finally retired & killed off the same with Sherlock. Is this the end for Delaware or can he change, something should, e.g. Delaware without the smugness would be a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kellerman Slips","review":"The book is predictable and boring at times, but keeps your attention by throwing in some gore and horror. Like a car wreck, you know you shouldn't keep looking but for some reason you do. How DOES Alex Delaware keep that great house in the California hills without doing any full time work? And I'm sick to death of the one-dimensional relationship with live-in Robin -- they are two people who have no more meaningful conversations than their soppy psuedo-intellectual exchanges of about three sentences that precede their lovemaking, which takes place every time they run into one another. Give me a break. Kellerman could write a great book by delving into the characters as they solve a believable case, rather than trying to conjure up a horrifying yet \\"stretch\\" of a situation that permits only paper-doll characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted & tedious","review":"Reading this book makes me realize how much I prefer J. Kellerman's wife Faye's straight forward direct style of writing. This book, Monster, dragged on & on. It became so convoluted that it was hard to figure out its direction. I liked Billy Straight but this was no where near as well written. Dr. Argent was a difficult character to sympathize with. Her parents breezed in and out of the book too quickly. I did not care for Peake and was amazed that the killer had such an easy time getting in and out of Starkeweather and in & out of trouble. This book was very tedious and unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointing","review":"I usually quite like the Alex Delaware novels, however, I did find this one to be not only predictable, but farfetched. This book finds Alex and Milo investigating the death of a young psychologist who worked at a hospital for the criminally insane. Early on Alex begins tossing out theories that seem to be reaching at best and has you guessing at who the \\"players\\" might be, and who are, in fact, painfully obvious. This is definately up to the Kellerman's usual standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well thought out plot.","review":"A rather dark story with characters that are not especially appealing,yet the different feelings you get following this cleverly written venture into the minds of the criminally insane and the functional psychopath,has to make one wonder about the cost of being a product of a dysfunctional family, not only to the individual, but all the people he may adversely affectduring the course of is life.I had no problem with Kellerman choosing this type of book,as I've read Vachss' works which are much darker bycontrast and subject matter,and have some really off-beat characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best","review":"I'm happy to hear it wasn't just me that thought Monster was not one of Kellerman's better efforts. I am an avid fan of this series and this book left me wondering what happened. I had trouble keeping interested in this plot and that has never happened before. It had very little of the usual drama and twists and turns of an Alex Delaware/Milo Sturgis investigation. I hope his next effort is better. I would hate to think that this series has come to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is The Last Kellerman Book I'll Read","review":"I've read all of the Jonathan Kellerman books and some of his earlier books were well worth reading. This one, however, is sterile. Kellerman only goes through the motions of writing without developing his on-going characters and with scenes and situations that are unpleasant. I do not want to plod through an institution for the insane, endure the disgusting descriptions of the inmates, and read about gory murders without having some reward... either in the writing, the characters, a visit to somewhere pleasant - SOMETHING! This book is an unrelieved nightmare and any possible reader is advised that he/she will only put garbage into the mind without any reward or insight when the book is finished. I wish I'd never heard of it and I will read no more Jonathan Kellerman books. He has not developed and moved forward, nor have his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kellerman at top of his form.","review":"Alex Delaware is helping Det. Milo Sturgis solve two particularly grisly crimes -- a chopped up would-be-actor and a doctor at Starkweather, an institution for the criminally insane. Much of the action takes place at the hospital, and the descriptions and interplay in those scenes are wonderfully written. Mr. Kellerman dedicated this novel to the memory Kenneth Millar, the real name of Ross MacDonald, the creator of Lew Archer. Archer always dealt with family secrets and connections that intertwined through time. Mr. Kellerman followed the same route here with excellent results. I love this Alex Delaware mystery; I hope it's a \\"Monster\\" of a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual standard","review":"I was quite dissapointed in 'Monster'.Mr. Kellerman had done a real quality job in building the characters of Alex Delaware, Milo et al over the past number of books - this book adds zero to this.The book seems to have been rushed through - try his previous books - now, they are stellar !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"This was my first Jonathan Kellerman book. I must say I wasn't overly impressed. I figured out the ending of the book a quarter of the way through it. It seemed to me that he raised questions to try to divert the reader away from the obvious. He should have spent more time on the interesting characters. Instead of all the other page fillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed","review":"Monster started out with the potential to be a great listen but it never seemed to get off the ground. Too much dialogue that did not add to the story line or character development. I kept waiting for a surprise or a twist but the only surprise was that there was not one. A whole lot of verbage led up to very little content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster","review":"I am reading all of the Alex Deleware books in order. This one is very good. I wish they would make a movie out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"It may take 8-9 chapters to get into this book, but then it gets rolling, with just about as much gore and blood as one can take. There are probably more twists and turns than any book I have ever read. And just when you think all is figured out and the story comes to a close, you are thrown another curve, that is just amazing. One of the best Kellerman books I have read even though it was a bit shaky in the beginning. Gonna be haunted by this one for a long, long time. You may think you know how to figure this one out, but be careful, because I was sure, only to be fooled in the end. Still love the Delaware and Milo characters. They get along so well and the dialogue between them lends a tad of humor. This one is a sicky."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun but predictable ending!","review":"I wish everyone would get involved into the mode of understanding where some authors get their ideas!

Billy Straight was a much better book. Alex Delaware needs a rest. This novel, Monster, describes a psychopathic killer and his horrific murders. It does give an interesting insight into the mind of crazies, but I would prefer more description of the characters, and relationships among them, rather than the detailed, gruesome descriptions of the disgusting doings of the Monster.If you are looking for a great mystery, a page-turner filled with excitement, I recommend Michael Connelly's Void Moon. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS ON THIS ONE","review":"An avid Kellerman fan, I was extremely disappointed in this book. Boring and disjointed.

Sorry to give a negative review and intend to give JK another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kellermans need a sabbatical!","review":"The plot was comparable to Kellerman's other plots - interesting and attention grabbing. However, many of the touches that breathe life into Alex, Robin, Spike and Milo were gone. From page one, Alex was on the case, full time. How'd that happen? Usually Milo has to coax him in. And the police department was terribly tolerant of Alex from Jump Street. Also missed anything about Milo's life, and Robin, who's usually a little freaked out by Alex's activities was the perfect little hausfrau cooking meals and orering pizza. Even Spike was one dimensional. Kellerman got too wrapped up in the plot, ignoring the very qualities that make his books so readable. After reading his wife's Moon Music, can only conclude they're working WAY too hard and need some time away from the old word processors. The plot of this book may have benefitted from protagonists other than Alex and Milo.

I won't give away too much of the plot (you'd hate me for it), but rest assured, you'll be scarfing this one down in huge chunks of pages (as it always seems to be with Mr. Kellerman's novels). If you enjoy it, I reccomend going back and reading the other books in the series; Along with John Sanford, Mr. Kellerman is the slickest \\"Cop/Serial Killer\\" novelist in the biz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ride","review":"I plowed through this book in 3 days because I couldn't put it down.

I hope he never writes a book like it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow-moving Delaware novel","review":"I've read most of the Alex Delaware novels, but it's been awhile since I've done it. Unfortuneately, I was disappointed by Monster. I generally like Milo's and Alex's adventures, but this one just didn't seem to get its foot until halfway through the book. I felt confident Kellerman would tie all the loose ends and story threads together by the end of the book, but it took too long for things to start to come together and then it all came in a rush that seemed to require some fairly big logic jumps.The story also did nothing to advance the characters. So you could safely skip the Delaware novel and not miss anything in an otherwise great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"It wasn't too deep. It was an easy read.

Have not read any other Kellerman but was not bothered by the absence of character development others have complained of. I could not stand, however, his decision to focus on the detail of certain events.

His main characters are lifeless anymore, and to be honest, by the end of the book, I only wanted to be done with it and couldn't have cared who was doing what to whom. I have read everyone of his fiction books, and more and more I think his stories involving Dr. Alex are boring. The characters do not come to life.

Normally, a great book has you read more and more of it each day. It seemed that by the time I got to what should have been the climatic moment(where the \\"monster\\" is on the loose), I was reading less and less where even the conclusion seemed slow paced. Sometimes, the tediousness of investigating a case adds to the suspense. In this case, it seemed as though the book was fluffed up just to justify the retail price. I'm sure Kellerman is a great author who is prone to the \\"hit or miss\\" syndrome as others are. Monster, to me, is one of his misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Kellerman","review":"I gave Kellerman one more chance. I read a review in the Detroit Free Press.

Maybe Kellerman is bored with the characters of Alex and Milo...Billy Straight was a much better book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked \\"Monster\\" but missed the usual surprises","review":"I thought \\"Monster\\" was one of Kellerman's better efforts, but I missed the usual surprises he has at the end of his books.Another thing I've noticed(and I'd like to get some feedback from other fans)is that Dr. Deleware never seems to get a good meal at a restaurant. Anyone else ever notice this? It cracks me up. Also, he never can seem to get a decent cup of coffee.Overall, I thought the book was good. I always find myself having to restrain the urge to peek at the ending and end the suspense of 'whodunnit'. I guess that's just a sign of a good writer.Buy it. Read it.

Alquie's determination not to dismiss the philosophy of Surrealism as mere hedonistic tripe or pseudo-thought is inspiring, and he writes with a language that isvibrant and alive.We see the innumerable misinterpretations of the incandescent, sometimes impossible hope of the surrealist--Breton being taken for a Satanist, Nadja a glorified lunatic, etc--and Alquie does a slick job of essentially saying that while the surrealist philosophy (the ultimate combination of the real and the imaginary) may not be possible, it is worth dedicating a lifetime too. He redeems what to an outsider or skeptic may seem flowery (and surrealism is anything but) nonsense. Just by itself, this is one hell of a book and wonderfully written.

After paying Microsoft to help diagnose, it turned out that the culprit was NIS2005. Turn firewall off and everything works fine. There is no effective support from Symantec without paying half again for the product. Now a new problem has surfaced. NIS is asking to activate the software again (it was activated when purchased).

Bay of Souls seems torn between an Dellilo style life in the USA novel, and the usual Stone third world Conradesque action/philosophy thriller. Sad to say, but the academic parts, the creeping ennuie, the sudden adultery, minutia of modern life, etc. seem much more real than the drug crazed revolutionary danger parts, which is too bad because there are a lot of people who do the Delillo/Carver thing and not a lot who can pull off the headlong rush of Robert Stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"I've been a Robert Stone fan since way back, but I never finished Damascus Gate and Bay of Souls was a big let-down.

Hopefully, this is just a temporary diversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly up to Stone's standard","review":"Robert Stone has long been one of my favorite writers, but this book is terribly disappointing. The characters are flat, cliched and uninteresting. They are merely reruns of previous characters in earlier and finer novels. The action is predictable and mundane.

Go back to his earlier work for rewarding re-reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Adequate First Draft","review":"I was surprised to learn, after reading Bay of Souls, that this was Robert Stone's first in five years, because it seemed hastily thrown-together. I thought the story of Kirsten and Michael Ahearn and their son was wonderful and then more or less dropped. According to his blurb at the back, Stone had some interactions with Madison Smart Bell. I wish he'd written about Haiti, instead, essays, and finished the tale he started, which was like Updike with a little more edge. Maybe I'm just not a voodoo guy, but I was sorely disappointed with the promise of the beginning of this book set against its patched-together ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strickland, where are you?","review":"Stone's novels have always had holier-than-thou,pondrous protagnoists. But, they've always been brilliantly balanced by intense yet hilarious, real characters. Pablo lets 'A Flag for Sunrise' work (see, i can't even recall the main character's name.) Walker and the hilarious directors allow the seriousness of LuAnne in 'Children of Light'. And of course, the great Strickland, one of the most enjoyable characters in modern fiction, gets us through the flat and humorless Brown in 'Outerbridge Reach.'But in \\"damascus Gate' and now 'Bay of Souls', everyone is pondering their existence, no one is fun, let alone funny or light, nothing balances the Drama.

Here the characters seem flat and the prose is ordinary compared to his former lyrical masterpieces like \\"Hall of Mirrors\\" and \\"Dog SOldiers.\\" It is always a bad sign when writers start writing novels about writers and teachers. It means they are running out of ideas. And while Stone is a contemporary master, his last three novels \\"Outerbridge Reach,\\" \\"Damascus Gate\\" and \\"Bay of Souls\\" go from average to below average to downright bad. Time it seems has had a deleterious effect on Stone's storytelling ability, as he is forced to rehash age old revolutionary themes that seemed so ripe with pertinence back in the 60s and 70's. Still, I have no doubt that Stone can pull out an \\"Old Man in the Sea\\" like Poppa Hemingway did late in his career.

I was reading the book at the beach during a storm at night. It so effected me that I didn't want to walk my dog in the dark.I've given this book to friends to read and they've hated it.

The book has a thrown-together quality, as one improbable incident follows another. I will not reiterate the plot, as so many other reviewers have done this so sucessfully. But I have to agree with the consensus: the characters are not fully developed, and their motivation is unclear. It almost seems like Mr. Stone just decided that he wanted to write a book that was exciting, frightening, and sexy. Start with a sensitive family drama, then add a little in-the-know power politics, a near death experience while searching undersea for lost emeralds, some terrifying Colombian drug dealers, and end with wild voodoo ceremonies and the wreckage of his home life.

Worst example: The tenor in the \\"Kiss Me\\" quartet from \\"Sweeney Todd\\" sings most of his music wrong, or late, or early, or all three combined. Other examples of mediocrity include inane gender switching -- the Cassidy's singing \\"You Could Drive a Person Crazy\\"??? -- and a notable veneer of passionless performances.

But this play was adapted from the original book to be performed by a group of 6th graders. The age group it was intended for shows blatantly. After reading through it and reflecting on the play as a whole, I decided that it was pretty lame. Now, I'm not trying to impugn Mr. George's adaptation. On the contrary, I commend him for taking the initiative to put so much work into adapting a story like this for the stage.

The playing is beautiful and speaks of his classical training.Although contrasting style in the CD might have been welcome, his effort is quite successful.

The acting is wooden and two dimensional even though the actors are appealing. This is not entirely the fault of the actors -- the director let this be released without really knowing what he was doing. It had so much potential but that potential was not tapped.

What is Johnston's fixation with women marrying men they do not love because they're carrying another man's child, and then the child discovering years later, from the sperm donor, in the most convoluted and protracted manner imaginable, that he/she is being observed or protected by his/her actual father?

Don't buy!!!!","review":"I have this camera for a little over a year now and it is by most the worst camera I have ever had. It has been sent back to Cannon 3 times and it is still not working right and each time they tell me that I dropped the camera and broke the lens. When I told them I didn't and maybe it had to do with the shipping they tell me it can't be since the box is okay when delivered.

Charged a brand new battery and same result. Contacted Canon and for a charge of $129.00 plus tax plus shipping to and back, they can fix the camera. After researching, appears that this is a common problem for no reason the camera does not turn on. Quality of pictures and camera when working was very good. However, to spend all this money on a camera to be functional for 2 years and cost to repair being so high, shame on Canon to sell such a product. My recommendation, is stay away from Canon cameras. I will. Off to buy another digital camera and throwing this one in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I bought this camera and took it on vacation to Patagonia (Argentina).

There should be a safety lock so the lens doesn't just freely open if pushed. Mine got jammed that way in my pocket. Canon should refund buyers for this model since it doesn't last much more than a year or two based on others reviews as well. It was a waste of my money and now I have to buy a new camera. My $400 got me 2 years out of mine and now they want to charge $100 to repair since it is past warranty. It is unacceptable for it to break so soon after buying it brand new. The lens always seemed a bit finicky so I should have know there would be problems. Unfortunately I loved it before it jammed and had no complaints.

I like the way it feels in my hand and I'm pleased with the battery life. I purchased a 2GB card to replace the one that came with the camera and it's been the perfect size for me. The video is amazing, I was standing in the upstairs bathroom of our 2 story house and saw our little one jumping on the trampoline at the far end of our backyard, so I decided to tape it. Not only was the quality good, the camera picked up the audio, which I never expected!

But if you like a bit of order everey once in a while, if you want to hear people speaking in normal tones of voice (i.e., less than an hysterical shout) and if you want everything to work out well in an understandable way, then you should avoid this movie. The characters are cartoons and the setting is nothing short of claustrophobic, but that shouldn't cause any problem so long as you never ask the question \\"What's going on here?\\" I imagined that the movie took place in Los Angeles and that helped, but alas, it was India. It's not Mississippi Masala, but it is a darned sight better than most Bollywood films. The plot reminded me of British cinema of the 1960s and 1970s, and the acting seemed so much like slice-of-life that I had to consult my wrist-watch clock-calendar to make sure I hadn't boarded a time machine. But in the end it was all great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Indian Wedding","review":"I liked the film. It reflected beautifully the colorful, vibrant and vital culture of India.

The maze of characters and situations are so skillfully blended, the idiosyncrasies and taboos of the culture are so well-drawn.The acting is captivating and I found myself identifying with several characters.Even if you are not familiar with Indian culture or customs, you will enjoy this fascinating take on the Indian version of the Wedding Planner and the bigger story of love and forgiveness.Buying this DVD is totally worth the money.

The story of the girl who gives up hope on her lover to try an arranged marriage. The story of the wedding planner who falls for the maid of the house. The story of the college boy who learns to appreciate his culture.And then, the most shocking story of all, of the girl who thinks she lives as a stranger in the household and as the suspense builds you realize her shocking tale and how the house copes.Monsoon Wedding is a movie for everyone to enjoy at every level.

As chaos consumes the tradition-minded Verma and Rai clans, all bets are off--and some new ones are made--on who's pairing up with whom. Declan Quinn's roving camera spotlights the large and eccentric cast, but standouts are Shah and Vijay Raaz, the marigold-chewing nuptials planner who has eyes on a comely maid. Addressing the collision between West and East, as well as class difference in the hustle and bustle of modern Delhi, \\"Monsoon\\" is a buoyant, multifaceted comedy/drama that's as thoughtful and rich as a weighty novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the beaten path for me","review":"Normally, this wouldn't be a DVD that I would pick off the shelf, but I have heard good things about it, and decided to get it. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a good movie and I couldn't believe that it was almost 2 hours long....it didn't drag at all. Maybe just the smallest bit slow in starting, but the people were so interesting I knew it would probably get better, and it did. Interesting backdrop in Delhi....I can't imagine the crowding and the heat in India. Part of their culture is different, of course, but we have a lot in common. I liked the fact that there were several stories going on, and all loose ends got tied up. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a break in the ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"This is one of my top ten favorite movies. It's about a family in India coming together for a wedding. But it could be about any family anywhere. The highs and lows.

I thought my young granddaughter would love the colorful costumes and lively music. I'm fortunate the film was in Hindi and she is as yet not able to read the subtitles. The language was exceptionally coarse. I would have been embarrassed if she had understood the English words. Its also a strange movie in that it moves from a simplistic plot and cartoon characters into a story line of a pedophile uncle preying on a young niece. Spoiler alert! Then a big moral ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I watched this without any ideas about the script and actors/director. Probably have just read somewhere that it was a pretty good film. It started out slow, had my usual convictions about \\"ah..an Indian film, with people dancing and singing, and with funny accents when trying to speak English\\". But the film was funny, sweet, sexy & romantic, serious, dramatic and poignant all at different times. It turned out to be a most remarkable film, one of the best film ever produced. And best of all, the film was made in only thirty days, and was hit with things like actors' last minute withdrawals and casting of many first time actors/actresses. I'd never noticed!!! Better than most films Hollywood had produced since with budgets ten or a hundred times its size. You must watch this if you have the chance. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"I laughed, I cried, I danced, I gasped! The Indian culture was richly depicted through artful writing, directing and acting. The scene with Dubay on the rooftop in his underwear was marvelous and made me cry with longing for magical, mystical India. The colors, singing, dancing...I enjoyed every second of this movie. I'm hoping the video will become available...this is definitely a movie which deserves to be a part of everyone's video library."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD different from original movie--?","review":"I saw the movie in the theater twice. I just rented the dvd and I believe several scenes have been shortened from how they were in the original movie.

This movie is simply amazing. In Monsoon Wedding a stressed father, a bride-to-be with a secret, a smitten event planner, and relatives from around the world create much ado about the preparations for an arranged marriage in India. This film could never be \\"Americanized\\" because it is so richly envoloped in native Indian traditions that impact the people and the every aspect of a wedding. Scene after scene--what an exquisit departure from standard American filmaking tropes. The movie is a \\"feel good\\" film and an exciting ride. If you haven't seen it watch it.

And it took me a few minutes to identify with the dozens of characters in the movie. But once things went underway, the movie turned out to be simply awesome. It is by far one of the most realistic and well directed movie I have ever seen (Hindi or English). Mira Nair has done a fantastic job in extracting the best out of Naseerudin Shah and Shefali Shetty. Everyone has done a fantastic acting job in this movie. But in my opinion, the actor who really stole the show was the kid who played Naseerudin Shah's son. This is not your typical obnoxious Bollywood kid.

I liked movies such as Gosford Park, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, etc. But those movies usually had interesting characters, plot intrigue, and some humor mixed in to keep the movie upbeat at least a little. This movie had none of that. I did not care about any of the characters. It was mostly depressing (when not boring) and the sporadic use of subtitles was annoying and distracting. The plot was straightforward-almost like a documentary. My wife did not care for this film either so I am truly astounded by all the positive reviews. I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing English/Indie film","review":"When my family saw this film, we thought that it would be good. Strangely, we were disappointed. The acting and dialogues come across as faked. The costumes were Ok. The cast could have been better.

It looks like one long MTV video, or a hip, happening tourism commercial. Depressingly shallow, the movie never tries to convey anything at all. I felt like someone told me interminable, tedious, mild stories about their family, while the TV played in the background, and someone arranged flowers nicely in the foreground. The 'making-of' documentary on the DVD showcased the glibness of the director, so impressed by cellphones and computers side-by-side with pigs and saris, that she completely lost sight of the fact that texture does not make a tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 stars away from perfection.","review":"A completly inaccurate portrayal of Indian culture.

Some people compare it to My Big Fat Greek Wedding--which I did not like--but I really can't see any comparison. MBFGW was supposed to be a lighthearted comedy, where MW has humour and lots of drama, as well as a deeper look into the culture and deeper character of the protagonists. The music is beautiful and appropriate, the acting is fantastic (featuring many non-actors), and the plot is riveting."},{"rating":"2","title":"the 'subplot' is the best part","review":"the small sweet thing between alice and dubey is surreal and nice and real and fantastic all at once. I especially like the character Dubey. I think he is by far the best actor in the movie. Comfortably eating marigolds, fighting, talking on the phone, going home, finally dancing. I thought more could have been done with the boy from australia and the cute girl. I somewhat agree about the forced nature of \\"the bad thing,\\" though it leads to a very good scene between the father and that girl. Overall, the movie is a great spectacle, lots of energy and color and all that stuff. Not corny like Kama Sutra was. (was that her movie?? not sure.) The soundtrack is wonderful, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"modern Shakespeare","review":"This film has received enough positive reviews without my adding my 2 cents. However, I would like to make the point that this movie is closer to a Shakespearean comedy than any other modern film I've seen (although I don't watch films as often as some). Although the theme of incest is darker and more serious than the gender-bending found in some of Shakespeare's plays, it is of a kind with them, I believe. The bad guy is identified without a bloodthirsty revenge seen. The servants' subplot has about the same relation to the whole you would expect in Shakespeare. The humor is spontaneous and doesn't warp the characters, and at the end of the film, you feel you've watched something original that is affirmative, yet not manipulative. Highly recommended. I suppose the actual dialog won't appeal as much as the Bard's to those with a critical mindset, but for the rest of us who have just enjoyed ourselves, this film is a great experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, it's true","review":"When Mira Nair does her \\"director's commentary\\" on the DVD, she says that watching this movie is \\"like being at her dinner table for two hours,\\" so close is this to her own experience of being in an upper middle class, westernized Punjabi family in Delhi.I wondered how this could be so, as it doesn't correspond with popular conceptions of India today. Don't get me wrong--I found it hilarious, touching, visually beautiful--but I did wonder if it could be reality in any way. After the harsh truthfulness of, say, SALAAM BOMBAY!, had Nair completely gotten away from her documentary roots?But when I was in Delhi I met families exactly like this, and saw exactly how representative of a certain type of modern Indian family this is. I am so glad that this different slice of life is well represented by this beautiful film.The actors are brilliant, both the well-known actors and the first-timers. The actor who plays the wedding planner is particularly fun to watch. Definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monsoon wedding","review":"Wow!...It was a beautiful, entertaining, mavelous movie.

Nothing happens but a wedding. Anyone who has ever gone to a large ethnic family wedding and get-together will experience Deja-vu. Guys will find this about as interesting as an Oprah re-run starring Dr. Phil and filmed in Bombay. Predictable and boring. Left me thinking, \\"So what?\\" The music is a mix of Indian and Western dance music and is lively, though.

And this is about as stereotyped and cliched as it can get.There is also a disgraceful scene where policemen are seen almost molesting the bride when she is caught having sex with her boyfriend in a car.....as Mira Nair would like us to believe India lurks with molesters and predators be it inside the police or inside the trusted structure of family.Watch Lagaan instead if you wanna see what Indian films can really be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really an interesting film.. don't expect much...","review":"Went with really high expectations seeing all this positive reviews.

For most of the book the author admits to being a loving, nurturing parent. She doesn't let her kids cry; she co-sleeps; she has a lot of attachment parenting behaviors. However, in the interest of not making waves, she opens her arms to the more militant Ferber approach. Sorry, but I can't condone that and I wish she wouldn't have.Other than that a couple of her chapters are very good--like the ones entitled Temperament, The Generation Gap, and Half a World Away.This book just ends up saying: Babies are going to wake up; don't fret over it; do whatever you want to deal with it. Man, it could have been a much better book if she had stuck with what she does instead of what she hears about what other people do.

Although this was written from the opposite view point of Margaret Mitchell's novel, and I suppose the purpose was to tell the same story with the other view, so much of the story line did not match up.

As an African American Gone With the Wind lover, I was truly excited about reading the story from the other perspective. How disappointing! I'm not sure why the Margaret Mitchell Estate had such a problem with this book, seeing that it doesn't even resemble the story at all.

Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Done Without This One!","review":"Being a huge fan of Gone With the Wind, I had to read this alternative account of the story. And let me tell you, it is a completely alternative account! Only a small percentage of the story seemed consistent with the characters developed in Margaret Mitchell's novel. Some parts were downright bawdy and indecent--unnecessarily, I thought. The book redeems itself a bit by shedding some light on some curious situations in GWTW...for instance, why all three of Gerald's sons died in infancy. It also explores, seemingly authentically, the psychological effects of servants raising the children born into an aristrocratic life. Other than that--skip it.

WRONG. Many slaves were saved by Union Troops.Indeed liberated slaves lined the streets to cheer the Union Troops as the heroes and deliverers they were.This woman doesn't portray a SLAVE who ever knew the WHIP or the CHAIN but the kind of slave portrayed in the Real GONE WITH THE WIND: simpering wimpering and clinging to \\"de ol mastah\\".I thought we were past that LIE.A mess and any true ex slaves would be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE worst book I have EVER read...","review":"Like many GWTW fans, I supported Alice Randall and the publishing of this book.

The book (Cynara's diary) jumps around so much, the characters are sketchy and just not likeable.

Life on the plantation, Georgia, a spoiled heroine, the plight -- or well being -- of slaves before during and after the war, reconstruction, clothing, the essentials of food and shelter and survival, love and its tangles -- are barely covered, and at that without conviction or in an interesting,compelling, memorable manner.

The Wind Done Gone, (in my own opinion...of course) was rather lacking across the board in areas such as: voice clarity and consistency throughout the story, sentence structuring, plotting, story pacing, etc., etc.On any level of reading, I think it could be safely said, that it wasn't an easy read -- and not a very good one either. However, I did like the concept Alice Randall seemed to have in mind when writing this story, so I am very open to reading other works from her in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very quick read","review":"It took me 4 to 5 hours to finish this book. The writing style is simple, the plot is thin and the characters are shallow and uncomplicated. Familiarity with GWTW is required since this book could not possibly stand on it's own.

It was difficult to follow the relationships (To be fair, I listened to, rather than read this book.) Cindy's diary gradually reveals the true story behind her sale and earns her mother, Mammy, the respect she deserves. She attains, then disdains, what the \\"Other\\" coveted.

She becomes his mistress until Scarlett's death when they marry.It's called a parody, but it's not. It's a retelling of a fundamentally American story that needed to be retold. I read retellings of fairy tales as fantasy adult books like McKinley's _Deerskin_ and Yolen's _Briar Rose._ Those folktales don't have lots of fans who complain about the changes Yolen made to Sleeping Beauty.

She's been to Europe, outlived most of the O'Hara family and is meant to be a 'strong resourceful black woman'of her time, a role model. However it is as a cardboard cutout of such a role model that she works best, being two dimensional and altogether lacking in life!

DONE GONE is a terribly misguided attempted to \\"set the record\\" straight about the role of black females in 19th century America. Randall needs to do a lot more thinking and researching before attempting to do that. About the only thing this book will do is expand her bank account.

It is a joke of a book with no connection to Gone With The Wind besides the sticker on the front that claims its connection. I would not recommend buying this, or even borrowing it from your local library. It was a waste of my time to read.

The slaves in GWTW are not potrayed as stupid people. GWTW is about a women living in the South before, during, and after the Civil War. I'm sorry, but there used to be slaves. It is a part of history, and no one can change that. Margaret Mitchell could not change that, so of course she is going to include slaves in a book about the civil war.

I'm not sure what Ms. Randall was trying to accomplish by writing this book. It was very poorly written; the main character's thoughts jumped all over the place that the reader can't really follow them and understand the point - if there is one - that's being made. Cynara is supposed to be an intelligent person with intelligent thoughts, and I don't see that in this writing.Maybe Ms. Randall could have done a much better job of explaining plantation life from a slave's point of view if she hadn't tried to focus so much on Gone With the Wind. Her fascination with GWTW is distracting, particularly to one who has read it.

Moreover, from the description of Mammy in Margaret Mitchell's novel, she was hardly a temptress in the Sally Hemings mold...not even in her younger days!The book just isn't believable and I agree with the one Southern reader.

The characters and story of \\"Gone With The Wind\\" are not only etched in the hearts of millions of fans, but are copyrighted in law. To take those characters and use it in this manner is despicable and illegal. GWTW is one of the finest novels ever to be written and one of the best movies in motion picture history. \\"The Wind Done Gone\\" takes wonderful, classic characters and mocks & belittles them. GWTW was an incredible story of the Old South, a time and place that has been forever lost to the forces of political correctness \\"The Wind Done Gone\\" is nothing more than politically correct propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Actually, this book deserves less than a star but you don't offer that option. This book was so confusing I couldn't believe it. You need a road map to follow the characters. The only thing that made this book famous was the fact that the heirs to Gone to the Wind sued over it. If it hadn't been for that I probably would have never bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, but this wasn't it!","review":"I eagerly awaited the publication of this story, and read it within 24 hours of receipt.I agree that a book needed to be written debunking the romantic myths of GWTW and give a more realistic POV. Unfortunately, this was not the book. I found many (not all) of the characters far-fetched and I found it difficult to get a true feel for Cynara and where she was coming from outside of her conflicting feelings for Mammy and \\"Other\\".I also found the alternate names for the characters quite distracting, although I understand why it was needed, it certainly took away from the continuity and enjoyment of reading.As a \\"parody\\" (using the term loosely), it simply cannot be understood without reading or seeing GWTW.I was hoping for so much more, and was severly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"other\\" side of the story","review":"This was my summer to read the stories that have until now been silenced, edited, or lost in the telling of southern history--this is one that should be on everyone's list.

However, this novel fails miserably to even begin to satisfy that appetite. Ms. Randall sounds like she'd be an excellent and incredibly intelligent author, well suited to such a pursuit. Perhaps it's because I've just read CANE RIVER, an absolute delight of a compelling read, but I rather think not. I really have no idea why this novel fails so completely, but I'm glad I read it from the library and can joyously take it back and find something else good to read. I hope Alice Randall tries again; I'd give her another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick, good read","review":"Sometimes you read a book or see a movie and you wonder about the lives of the characters when they are not involved with the plot of the book.

I quickly bought from Amazon.com, receiving the book very soon. First, I was astonished at the size, only 210 pages, with very wide margins, all this in a 6 X 8 1/2 inch book. (Heck, I can write longer letters than this....) But as I read I went from interest to sheer boredom, very quickly. The idea was wonderful, but Ms Randall missed the boat by making it so short. She should have developed the characters, and should have provided so much more to her readers.Much sturm and drang about Mammy, not enough about \\"Other\\", nor \\"R\\", too much about \\"Garlic\\"...

Cynara, Cindy, or Cinnamon, whatever she calls herself in each chapter is the daughter of Planter and Mammy, making her Scarlett's half sister. She tells us she is more beautiful than her sister and that she is living with her husband R. She will also have us believe that Mrs. O'Hara was engaged to her first cousin and was also a negro. Oh, and Ashley was gay and having an affair with Prissy's brother. Oh, Please!Other than the far fetched story, the writing was disjointed and hard to follow. The author bounced all over the place, so much so, that you hardly know when or where you are.

Cinnamon and R, What? Honestly I think that you have to be a real Gone with the Wind fan to understand the story of The Wind Done Gone. Maybe a publishing of the original diaries may help, or maybe if Alice Randall would have changed the dialect and made it more of a story form, than a diary setting, I may have understood it better.

While it is true that miscegenation did occur on some plantations it did not occur on all of them. But she mainly missed one of the main themes of Gone with the Wind and that is the theme of the strong southern women and weak southern men.

I had such high expectations! Especially considering that some people had paid hundreds of dollars for this book on eBay before it went into mass publication. The writing style leaves something to be desired as the main character, Cynara, always asks seemingly inane questions about things only to ask even more questions for answers! It seems everything in this book was mainly \\"Is it this...or this is it?\\", \\"Do I do this...or do I do that?\\" and it goes on like that for 200+ pages. I do give Ms. Randall points for the main concept but the execution was terrible. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am currently struggling to read this book","review":"I have yet to finish the book because it is so poorly written and extremely hard to read. Judging by the comments on here it seems that anyone with anything over a 2nd grade ready level is also finding it difficult to follow. And naming charters \\"Other\\" just makes it even harder to follow them through out the book. I came here hoping that others that have finished it could show me a light at the end of the tunnel, but now I see I'm just wondering around in the darkness. I'll try to finish it over time b/c I really want to read it but to just sit down and enjoy it. I really don't see that happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book was barely readable. Thank goodness I got it from the public library. Trying to keep up with the characters from Gone With the Wind and matching them to the characters in The Wind Done Gone was difficult. I wish Ms. Randall had left well enough alone. Her account of the Slavery South left much to be desired. Maybe just in her mind a slave was cunning enough to \\"persuade\\" a white man or woman what to do. However, that is just not what our ancestors knew about. Had a slave been able to persuade or con his/her master, Black folks would be in a lot better place in society today. This parody is a farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A PARODY","review":"Ms. Randall doesn't seem to understand the term parody. This work is anything but a parody. It may be an attempt at criticism. Imagine Roots being written, seriously, from the point of view of the overseer or slave-ship captain. The book is simplistic in its structure, language and doesn't challenge the reader's intelligence. Quite the contrary, she believes her audience to be so slow that she hits you over the head with her correctness. She should try being subtle and develop her own characters without relying on a dead woman's creativity. I'm glad I borrowed a copy from someone rather than contibuting to Ms. Randall's wallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hysterical Hypocrisy","review":"Well, fiddle de de and la de da.

The premise is awe-inspiring, but the execution could have been so much better in abler hands.This is another example of Hype over Substance, which is unfortunate.... the book might have been a better read if it had been given a slow word-of-mouth buildup. As it stands, you can't separate the book from the publicity, which makes the author's average writing ability seem worse than merely average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much More Than Parody","review":"\\"The Wind Done Gone\\" is a miracle of a book. The ridiculous attempt to suppress it has, I hope, aided it by giving it the publicity it deserves. The author has compared her book to a patchwork quilt, and it is like that--full of marvelous colors and textures. It traces the life of Cynara, Scarlett's black half-sister (named, incidentally, for the woman in the poem from which Mitchell's book takes its name). Jumping backward and forward in time, the story brings to full, fascinating life all those who existed only as happy stereotypes in Mitchell's ponderous tome. But Randall's book doesn't depend on a familiarity with Mitchell's for its power. \\"The Wind Done Gone\\" is fully capable of standing on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG waste of money!","review":"This has to be one of the most boring, stupid books I have ever read and I do read alot! I, along with lots of other people, awaited with anticipation the publication of this book. I was thrilled when Ms. Randall was given the right to publish her book. It should have stayed on the shelf! I found it very insulting to my intelligence and so obviously a rip off of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" that only someone with their head in the sand for the last 60 years or has never read a book could think it otherwise! I think the story certainly should be told from the slaves point of veiw but it was written so poorly that it was very hard to find a story among the ravings of this woman \\"Cindy\\". I love history and have read it all my life. This book, however, was not history but an attempt to make a fast buck.I do realize that the book is fiction. However, when given a license to portray a time in history we must try to be as true to the story telling as possible. Better luck next time Alice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was The Controversy A Publicity Stunt?","review":"Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I opened the novel with an open mind. I eagerly awaited its release because I loved the whole Gone with the Wind storyline. However, after the first couple of pages, I was thoroughly disappointed. Gone with the Wind caught my attention in the first couple of pages. Wind Done Gone jumped all over the place and at times was utterly confusing. It was not a parody of Gone with the Wind, but instead more a competition of who was better, Scarlett (Other) or Cynara. Randall seemed to have an agenda with too many ideas trying to be put forth in this two hundred page novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Therapy Might Help More","review":"I have read all of the Gone with The Wind books, seen all the movies and love the whole story. I have also read everything else I can get my hands on, including Uncle Toms Cabin, Roots, Mandingo etc. I found this book preposterous in its story line and difficult to follow. I think that perhaps the author may want to seek some therapy rather than proposing ridiculous plots like this one. There is just something inherently wrong with these writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title - Bad Story!","review":"I read all of the reviews and heard all of the controversy.

Peace and Blessings!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i thought it would be","review":"ok first off i didn't finish the book but so far i am very disappointed in this book. yes gone with the wind was very one sided and sugar coated the slave days, I'm not disputing that. But this lady has ruined some great characters, like Mammy. Mammy would never have slept with Gerald, let alone had a child with him. She was a very proud person and thought Gerald to be below her, she work in the house of Royalty. Plus she basically Raised Ellen, she loved her like a daughter. So that right there has ruined the book for me. She jumps around a lot and it gets confusing. Also i was horrified when I read the bit about her being in the room with Rhett the night Bonnie died. That little girl was his life, I am just going to leave it there. I wouldn't suggest this book unless you really didn't care about the gone with the wind characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was hoping for MORE.

This pathetic book takes everything fine about GWTW and sullies it. In her author description in the dust jacket, Randall says she wondered about the mulatto children of Tara. Perhaps there weren't any! Poorly written and contributing nothing at all to the body of American literature, this book is a sad waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane garbage!","review":"I went to see this woman speak at The Margaret Mitchell House, where she was graciously invited and treated very well. She was incredibly rude, UN-gracious and really beyond description. For instance, when asked if she knew of Margaret Mitchell's aid to African American students during her life, she refused to acknowledge the speaker. She cannot validate her views, therefore ignores anything to the contrary. Now is that not censorship on her part? I also find her book is without value at all. She has dregged up all kinds of lame, inaccurate views of GWTW and seeks to make money off of some one else's talents. (Mitchell's). I not in agreement with the censorship of her book, or censorship in general. But after meeting this woman in person I can understand how the keepers of Ms. Mitchell's estate had valid reasons for their suit. She is an embarassment to the people she claims to vindicate. Even if all this weren't true, the book isn't even any good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOOK TONI MORRISON SHOULD HAVE WROTE.","review":"I give TWDG four out of five stars because Alice Randall knew the relevance in writing a novel that counters \\"white americas\\" beloved GWTW. The subordination of blacks in every relationship to whites is even more pervasive today. But the tragic mulatta is played out. Cynara lived in a delusion. I wish Toni Morrison would have wrote it because she would have not wrote it from a confused mulatto point of view. Mabey Toni Morrison is too intelligent to waste her time with nonsense such as GWTW to write a novel that debunks it. Thats why she wrote Beloved."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss?","review":"If the estate of Margaret Mitchell had not made so much noise about this book, no one would know it existed. Pick it up and read a few pages. It is not a parody, it is a joke. Save your money and get this one from the library if you have to read it. It's episodic and lacks a narrative with any continuity. Don't look to fall in love with any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn It !!!","review":"I love books and have read my favorites 10-15 times. I can honestly say that this book is one of the the most dreadful I have ever read. I don't have a problem with the author taking an American African point of view. I have a problem with the stardard of writing and the story line. Talk about someome making money off someone else. If you want to read a great book about the war from an American African stand point read \\"Jubilee\\" by Margaret Walker. This book should never have been printed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should never have been printed.","review":"The judge that allowed this disaster to lift ideas and outright quotes from Gone With the Wind should be kicked from the bench.

(Since when is dereaming gayness? And didn't he love Melanie?)Melanie killing a slave out of anger? (This offended me the most, because I have always loved Melanie)Rhett prefering this lame loser wannabe to Scarlett?It's an insult to GWTW.An insult to Margaret Mitchell. An insult to the south.Just because some plantations had mullattos doesn't mean everyone had to.If you have read GWTW, don't let this horrible, disgusting object cheat you out of your time, or your love for one of the most beautiful books of American literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived!","review":"For God's sake!

How disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy This Book on Many Levels","review":"The Wind Done Gone is a book to be appreciated and enjoyed on many levels. It is, first of all, a subtle literary parody which, in my opinion, will make any thoughtful reader reconsider assumptions about the history and myth of the antebellum South. At the same time, The Wind Done Gone can be read as a short novel that intrigues one as it flows from an arresting beginning to an effective and satisfying denouement. The narrative moves effortlessly, and certain lyrical passages can be savored for the language alone. Regardless of which aspect appeals, you will not be the same after you have read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ideal Left with the Wind","review":"\\"Waste makes me angry!\\" Declares Rhett Butler in the movie production of Gone with the Wind. \\"And that's all this is, a terrible waste.\\" I had similar feelings after reading The Wind Done Gone. When I first heard about it, I was instantly intrigued by the concept, but it didn't take long for my hopes to be dashed. This book had the opportunity to be the defining criticism against the 1930's idealistic memories of the antebellum era, and instead the historically void, angst-ridden and sex filled plot leaves you feeling empty.It truly is the anti-Gone with the Wind book, but if you take that dubious honor away, the book has no merits of it's own left to stand on.The reason I gave it two stars: One, the overall cleverness of the idea, however badly it was executed, and two, for the fun I had figuring out the GWTW characters from their \\"nicknames\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice Randall either didn't read GWTW or has a short memory.","review":"GWTW fans all know that Scarlett's father,Gerald O'Hara, was not the \\"Captain\\".

So I was very excited about this book. I kept laughing to myself just at the funny title. But it's soooooo disappointing. What a ridiculous plot. What a golden opportunity not only missed by a thousand miles but trampled upon until unrecognizable. Heck, it almost inspires me to try my hand at a version of GWTW from the slaves' POV just because I want one so badly -- a GOOD one, not a dumb one like this. What a letdown. This book is what Rhett calls Ashley in the original novel: \\"Dead Sea fruit\\" -- \\"something that appears to be beautiful or full of promise but is in reality nothing but illusion and disappointment\\" (Dictionary.com)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Opportunity Wasted","review":"I understand parody to contain humor of some fashion - there is nothing humorous about self-conscious, bad writing. Were we supposed to roll over laughing, holding our sides, at the conceit of calling Rhett Butler \\"Debt Chauffeur?\\" I hope not, because it's only an unsatisfying use of a thesaurus. Alice Randall had some interesting premises here: The idea that Ashley may have had a male lover in his past, or that Ellen O'Hara may have had a black person in hers... This could have been fascinating and such a page-turner, but in Randall's hands it's just self-satisfied show.I would have been thrilled to read a version of Gone with the Wind from the perspective of the slaves on the plantation. I'm a big fan of everything GWTW and have enjoyed, to some degree, all of the works that take the story as their starting point.

Randall completely alters Scarlett's whole existence, saying that she was born half African American, and the this new character, just \\"added in,\\" was Rhett's lover. It is a joke of a book with no connection to Gone With The Wind besides the sticker on the front that claims its connection. I would not recommend buying this, or even borrowing it from your local library. It was a waste of my time to read. With the confusing timeline (or lack thereof) and the messy family trees (most of which did not even line up with each other), I cannot even fathom why anyone would publish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing","review":"Being a huge GWTW fan, I felt compelled to read TWDG. I was looking forward to it, but was sorely disappointed. I was looking forward to the story told from the point of view of the slaves, which seemed like an interesting way to write this novel. The character of Cynara is nothing more than a mulatto version of Scarlett O'Hara, strong and independent, but also spoiled, indulged and self-absorbed.There was nothing new or revealing in this book, just a jumbled, disappointing mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parallel universe, rather than parody","review":"This is a beautifully written book - every word fits and every word belongs - GWTW is a long and memorable ballad; this book is the haiku that captures the shadows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader","review":"The first time i read GWTW i was going into 4th grade. I have read it at least 15 times since. I have also read lots of books with connections to GWTW such as Scarlett, so i was so excited when this book came out. While i was reading the book i got so depressed. It was filled with such bitterness, and if u read the biography on the front of the book u will find out that she had two mental breakdowns each one after GWTW book came out and the movie. They turn Scralett into a soft weakling who gives up and Mammy into a cold bloodid killer.

There's a lot of material there with all of the slaves of Tara, and the basics we were given about several of them (Mammy, Pork, Prissy, etc) in Gone With The Wind.Unfortunately, this book doesn't measure up to these characters or to the story telling ability of Margaret Mitchell.While Ms. Mitchell was a little too into the \\"Magnolia Blossoms and happy darkies\\" school of writing (Her portrayal of the KKK as folk heroes was weird even by 1930's standards) you have to admire her ability to tell an interesting story with finely developed characters. Alice Randall is not similarly blessed. Like the odious \\"Scarlett\\" of a few years back, this story just doesn't compare.Maybe someday someone will be able to tell other side of the the fantasy of Gone With The Wind - the misery of the people that provided for the spoiled O'Hara girls. It's a story that deserves to be told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan-fiction?","review":"Most of what I think about this book has been said, and said well. The writing is mediocre at best, and it's NOT a parody.It strikes me as a sorry attempt at fan-fiction, and Cindy/Cinnamon/Cynara makes for a fine example of a 'Mary Sue'.Had the author intended to write the story from the view of the slaves at Tara, well, there were plenty of established characters to pick from. Why not write the story from Mammy's view, for example? Now that might have been interesting to read.

The idea was unique but the result was boring. Cynara was a poor imitation of Scarlett when she could have been so much more. Instead of focusing on her life she mostly talked about the white characters who for obivious reasons could not be named. Her affair with \\"R\\" was pointless and dull. I never really learned anything about Cynara and frankly after 50 or so pages I did care if I did or didn't. Overall the only thing that Ms. Randall did do was reaffirm my adamiration for the real classic.

But it was so poorly written and boring that it took me several days to finish it. And I made myself finish it, because I was hoping that it might get better, or have a good ending, or...something! The day after I finally made it through, I read a 700 page novel in two days, but TWDG kept making me nod off.

There's no harm in waiting a bit; and while you wait, you can read better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This was an unbearable book to read because it was so bad and very difficult to follow. The story doesn't flow the way it should, there's no character development, and there are too many references to Gone With the Wind.If you want to read a book that gives a portrayal of slave life, read Roots. That was a great book and, along with Gone With the Wind, a true literary classic.And as a side note for history...the KKK in the late 1800's was very different from the KKK as we recognize it to be today. And if you've read Gone With the Wind, you'll see that slaves are not portrayed as dumb. On the contrary, most are portrayed as intelligent and kind people who know how to receive their desired action from the plantation owners.The Wind Done Gone is a sham - it doesn't do anything in terms of portraying slave life on Tara, it doesn't make us sympathetic towards the slaves, and it certainly isn't worth the time and money spent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubish","review":"This book is garbage. I debated over rather or not I should even devote any more time to it by writing a review. But let this warn you: if you are thinking of buying this book, DON'T.

Not to mention the fact that this is one of the most blatantly racist books....I shiver to think about what would have happened had this piece of junk been written by a white person instead of a black one. There would have cries of racism, the book would have been banned, and the NAACP would have had a field day making themselves the victims. The whole idea makes me sick.

It's time we saw enslaved people as complex human beings.I read the whole novel in one sitting.There is a sense of humor in this novel and it does make a laughing stock of Mitchell's characters, but it is thankfully not a minstrel show, which is what many of the current reviewers seem to think it should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets hope the wind don't come back.","review":"Anyone who is a fan of GWTW will NOT enjoy this PARODY.

Morgan recorded for Kapp, Colpix, ABC, Epic and RCA Victor stepping into standards, pop and country with the ease not always attributed to most popular singers. With this collection, we get a brief but sweet look into her 1950s Kapp Records sides. Her international appeal is on display with songs in French, Italian and Spanish. It is indeed a pleasant introduction to the Morgan style, but not at all encompassing - covering only up to 1959. Morgan's voice enters the digital era with striking brilliance. Definitely suited for a romantic dinner at home or an afternoon of leisure.

Not a day goes by that something doesn't remind me of some lyric in one of her songs. I don't think she died in 1974 ... I really don't think she died ... A pure, sweet voice ... and a lovely, gracious, beautiful woman. Someone tell me she didn't die."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice collection","review":"Jane Morgan had only one really important hit on the charts, \\"Fascination.\\" This song, of course, heads the list of those on this CD. The CD also has a couple of other songs which made minor splashes on the charts, none in the top 10, and a lot of other well-known (if not in her version) songs culled from albums she made for Kapp Records (a minor label on which she and Roger Williams were the only two stars) in the late 1950s. The best song on the CD, of course, is her great recording of \\"Fascination.\\" But she does good versions of a number of others; the second best song on the CD, I think, is her version of \\"Love Is a Simple Thing\\" (best known by Robert Clary in the original cast of \\"New Faces of 1952\\").The only track on this CD that I really think is below par is her recording of \\"Baubles, Bangles, and Beads,\\" which ought to be done at a faster tempo than the way she does it. It isn't really BAD, but I much prefer other versions of the song.Still, I like the CD quite a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"the streets with hills!","review":"I 've been waiting for season 5 to be released many years.

His original research that uncovered \\"the seven powers\\" of the world's greatest salespeople, which are really \\"best-of-breed practices,\\" is right on the money. This might be the first sales book you could actually hand to your buyer and say \\"Here's how I'd like to proceed with you,\\" because of the integrity and trust woven into the Power Selling approach. I literally read the entire book cover-to-cover in one sitting, and as of this writing I'm reading it a second time. And Ludwig's on-line assessment tool is a great addition to the book.

While its great to possess a product that has compelling differentiation, George elucidates the factors that really cement the sale between salesperson and customer.While all of the Rs are key, I particularly found benefit in the Reputation, Relationship and Research chapters. These are heavily involved with consulting for and truly caring for, your customers. These I have used in my success in selling and now are further defined and elaborated by George Ludwig.

The book was so poorly written. The author randomly switches point of view, (The story is told mostly in third person and occasionally in first.) and the sentences are so disjointed, incomplete and fragmented that as a former English teacher I would have given the writer an F in grammer, and I couldn't get beyond the writing style. Did this book have an editor? Stringing a lovely bunch of adjectives together may establish atmosphere, but it does nothing to advance the story or entice the reader to keep turning the pages.

However, as an instrument, it is just not acceptable. It sounds fair but the notes are off. I tried several times and it could not produce a correct scale. So no matter how nice it looks and how cheap it is, it has failed its primary function to play music. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"There are few makers of bagpipes and practice chanters compared to most other wind instruments. As a result, everything bought for piping seems a bit more expensive than it would otherwise be e.g. the price of quality practice chanters. First of all, a beginner doesn't need a wooden chanter. They aren't played in a performance setting and are only used for fingering practice. Whether or not any wood practice chanter sounds better than a plastic version is irrelevant until the piper playing it knows how to care for it to stop it splitting. This is especially important when the practice chanter top is also made of wood. Naturally, this cheap piece of crap does have a wooden top. In short, spend the extra money on a quality polypenco (delrin) practice chanter and get started on the right foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off going to a professional","review":"The chanter was not tuned properly, and required at least a better quality reed and substantial tampering.

It really is beautiful with the nice looking wood and metal scroll-work. However, real practice chanters are usually made of plastic (looks very similar to a clarinet). After I got through a few lessons, I found it very hard to get my fingers on the correct holes because I couldn't really feel them since the wood is so smooth. My teacher suggested a plastic one by Gibson- it was so much easier to play because of the slightly bigger holes and the fact that the holes are slightly recessed. I highly recommend finding a bagpipe teacher FIRST and having the teacher make a recommendation for a practice chanter. The good quality ones are still under $100 and definitely worth the investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a quality practice chaanter","review":"If you want to learn to play the pipes you need to buy a quality practice chanter from a reputable manufacturer. You also need too find a competent instructor. Do yourself a favor and check out any local pipe bands, especially those who are members of competitive associations such. Many such bands offer free instruction. Some instruction is also available over the internet via Skype. Otherwise, check with one of the many online piping specialty shops about a quality practice chanter, books, and videos. Local music shops may offer to help by ordering instruments, but are in reality clueless (ask if they play and for how long). Don't doom yourself from the beginning with cheap junk and poor or no instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't mess with the classics","review":"This CD is very disappointing.

Perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the Seinfeld show?You may notice that in his speel about the Chinese he lets the word \\"shovel\\" out too soon (when talking about the Chinese's perseverance with chopsticks), and thus spoils the joke a little bit.

It addresses the grim reality of rampant kidnapping in the 1930s, and while the young couple, held hostage, are not kidnap-for-ransom victims, they are at the mercy of a quartet of hoodlums ranging from the somewhat comic to the sociopathic. Bruce Cabot is in peak form as the sadistic Patch, while Cesar Romero gives a likeable performance as the dandified gang leader.

Being as it is the only book about Elliott out there, us fans should be a bit more greatful."},{"rating":"1","title":"big waste of time","review":"Nugent's book is an insult to the genre of rock biography. Had he read books like Alice Echols's riveting Scars of Sweet Paradise: The Life and Times of Janis Joplin, for example, he might have realized it's necessary to do significant research to really capture the essence of a person.

I eagerly await a real biography on Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Nothing","review":"Brian Hayes (the reviewer below) got it right: this was a rush job done to cash in. Nugent writes like a tenth grader. His analyses of the music are obvious, he often misquotes lyrics, and he adds a great deal of unnecessary context that distracts from the main story (nugent often goes off on what could eventually be worthwhile tangents, but then leaves it up to the reader to make whatever conclusion he's trying to get at (at several points it seems like he adds details about the state of \\"indie\\" music just so he can mention his other favorite artists.)) Hayes has got it right: if you wanna know who Elliott Smith was (what he meant, what he means) turn to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elliott Deserves Far Better","review":"Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing is a sadly hollow, scattered read. Benjamin Nugent loads this biography with countless, rambling, incoherent anecdotes from Elliott's acquaintances. The best bits come from a frequently quoted Los Angeles Times interview with Elliott's final girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba, and Elliott's last interview with Under the Radar magazine. The other highlight comes from Nugent's interviews with David McConnell who recorded a good deal of Elliott's final material at McConnell's Malibu home studio, Satellite Park, the studio after which From a Basement on the Hill is named. For a far more inspired read of Elliott's life, check out the December 2004 Spin magazine feature article by Liam Gowing or the ten-page biography by S. R.

That being said, I don't really have to review this.This person had no affiliation whatsoever with Elliott Smith and never even attended a show of his. Basically, this is long, unplanned drivel that is so textbook and basic (albeit poorly written and uncreative) that you'd be better off at Allmusic.com reading about Elliott's accomplishments, albums, and life.Right after his death, I saw this book in hardcover and knew it instantly to be a cheap ploy.

High five you jackass."},{"rating":"1","title":"any idiot with a pen could have done better","review":"It's sad that Elliott's first biography had to be written by someone without any talent. It was like reading a thirteen year old's homework. Sad, pathetic, inexcusable. It did his life no justice what so ever.

I still enjoy the book because I do learn things from it and I do realize what Nugent tries to say in some parts (which is why I talked about hidden meanings), but that is what a good writer is supposed to do; they're supposed to show their reader exactly what they are trying to say, not hint to it. I still respect what Nugent tried to do, and I'm sure I'll read the book again, but it is poorly written. In my last review I gave him 5 stars because I was mainly reviewing him; I liked the effort he went through to complete the book. But I was only reviewing the person and not the actual book!

It is impossible to follow, poorly written and just a plain bore. To write a biography about someone, you should at the VERY LEAST gain access to those who knew him best or know him well yourself. The only thing the book contains is scraps of information, obtained by some of Smith's most obscure and random acquaintances.

It will be up for resale on eBay, very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly Titled and Uninspired","review":"As an enormous fan of Smith's, I was thrilled to see this biography released. I think many of us were, after the loss of such a prolific artist, searching for some solace in the intimate details of his life. This book however, leaves you cold. It's more of a clinical documentation of Smith's work than an exploration of his life and mind. It gives neither comfort nor enlightenment, and is therefore worthless.Sadly."},{"rating":"1","title":"such good writers!","review":"I can honestly say that the writing (the reviews) I regularly read on amazon.com are better than the writing within this \\"biography\\". It really is a disgusting book. The most valuable thing about the book was that I found out about some songs I'd previously not heard, and was able to look out for them (and find them later on basementdemos). His speculation about lyrical content (not to mention on what Elliot was thinking) is often ridiculous. And one truly gets the feeling that this man has absolutely no insight into the character or life of Elliot Smith (so he makes it up). I really could go on and on in this vein. I'm glad Elliot's friend and family refused to be interviewed: this man is NOT Elliot Smith's biographer. I give it one star because after reading it, I do know more about Smith, not much though."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"As a big Elliott Smith fan, I figured this would be a great read to gain some insight on someone whose music I love so dearly. Unfortunately, this book is a disappointment. Admittedly, I only got through two chapters - that's how bad this is. The writing is boring (and bordering on elementary) and the attempts to find parallels between his life and his music fall short. I probably would've read more, but another friend of mine who finished the book told me not to bother, as the rest is also awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing style lacking, gives little insight to Elliott himself","review":"Facts. That's about all you'll get from this book--it was very impersonal, and didn't really give any insight into who Elliott was at all. I was expecting interviews from friends and family, something that would give me a deeper glimpse into this enigma of a man. Not really what I got from this book sadly. There's another book out about him, mostly filled with pictures, that has stories from his friends scattered about it. That's a little better, I guess. Still wasn't quite what I was looking for though. If something could be written with a mixture between the two, I'd be the first to snag it off the bookshelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winner Takes All ( Winner Got Taken)","review":"This movie was a B-Rated movie to me. Many of the actors and actresses were no name and their speaking was not realistic. Especially Frank. His acting was just amatuer and really bad. Silas wasn't too bad but needed work. The pyrotechnics were bad also especially from their guns. The soundtrack was fantastic though. The movie could have been a major player if the acting was better. The storyline was a little unusual to follow if you didn't see it from the beginning. For future guidelines, they should follow the regular trend and keep to actors and actresses that can speak their lines with a bit more realism to it instead of sounding like they are reading from a book and trying to make it look real like a bad video scene from the Jerry Springer Show."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE VIEW","review":"HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THIS MOVIE IN MY HOMETOWN.

Sadly, this and a prior solo release suffered from a lack of promotion. A shame because both show a talent far beyond the soft coos of her back up singer days as a Supreme. \\"One Night With You\\" and \\"I am Changing\\" demonstrate a powerhouse voice that rivals not Diana Ross but Whitney Houston.A rockin' version of the Supremes classic \\" You Keep Me Hangin On\\" just blows away the original.Currently Ms. Wilson is reputed to be finshing a new CD, here's to hoping it garners the attention she is well overdue."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS is why Mary was the sexy one!!!!!","review":"It is such a shame that this album is out-of-print. The songs are great, and Mary's voice is in pristine shape here. I think you'll really like the tracks \\"Walk The Line,\\" \\"One Night With You,\\" and \\"You Keep Me Hanging On.\\" Just as a heads up though, for all those expecting her Motorcity recording of \\"Ooh Child,\\" this is not the same version; this version's instrumental is similar, though somewhat less than the Motorcity recording. Other than that, this CD is wonderful. The photos are beautiful, the sound is great, ... what else can I say. This is a really good time just waiting to happen for all of those potential buyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A commercial voice does not make you a better singer","review":"I purchased the cd years ago when it was first released. It is a wonderful collection with two songs that were recommended by Billboard magazine as potential hits. (\\"Walk The Line\\", and \\"One Night With You.\\") Sadly the record company did not have the proper financing to promote this cd well.Mary has a great sultry, smokey, voice that is well equipped for most material especially ballads. In reference to the prior review, a more \\"commercial\\" voice does not make a singer more talented than another.

It wasn't in Harry's blood, as evidenced by numerous sideman who flatly stated at one time or another that he was the best musician they ever met, period. These recordings, originally done as Sheffield Lab Direct-to-Disc recordings (there were three, all of them absolutely superlative) show the band, as constituted in the mid-70's, blowing classic James charts, and some refreshing and unexpected current tunes (make no mistake, James had a superb ear for good music). The unexpected bonus here is just how darn good this particular edition of the James band sounds, and just how breathtaking these direct-to-disc recordings were at the time. What is really impressive is the dynamic range and sonic quality of Harry's horn throughout. With a quality sound system, he's unbelievable.

It sounds like a very old monophonic, recording, (it appears to be recorded around 1957 according to the linear notes) quite a lot a echo at times, sort of like when they used to try to make stereo recordings out of mono. There are much better sounding recordings from this era --how I wish they would re-release \\"Pete Fountain Day\\" from the the same year on the Coral label (I believe). Now THAT had great music and fidelity! From the audio samples available on this site, the $6 \\"Pete's Beat\\" sounds MUCH better both musically and aurally. When I buy a Pete Fountain album, I want to hear him at his best. On this album he sounds basically just like a sideman.

The only reason he was relevant before is because he got shot 9 times and live to tell about. He is a hype man that starts trouble and is chaotic and feeds off of negativity.

There were certain sections of the Goblin album that left me guessing where exactly in the movie some of these songs were. But this CD with each track, took me exactly to where the songs were originally placed.Anyone who may be reading this, is probably very familiar with movie, so a review of the songs would be futile.

This is not a unified history of the war: each chapter is a separate subject and based on columns he wrote for the Honolulu Advertiser.The chapters were very uneven -- some focused on a battle, others focused on concepts (like kamikazes). Over half of the book covered events in 1945, when the war was essentially won by 1945. Hagen's writing style was not very interesting, and there were more than a couple readily-spotted factual errors (which made me doubt other facts).

Most dates given are incorrect for one thing. Bessie Smith, for another, is only represented on one track which features neither Louis Armstrong nor King Oliver (so much for the misleading sub-title on the front cover). Worst of all, many tracks here have been transfered at SLOW SPEEDS from whatever sources were used, resulting in longer track times and, more importantly, LOWER PITCHES than the originals. After all of this then, you'd think that they could give you a full CD's worth of material. Sorry - this thing clocks in at a measly 33:11.

Plus, from what I've read so far, the healthy and evolving type 4 seems to closely fit my own path.What interested me in the enneagram in the first was its historical connection with Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and the Neo-Platonists.

My son sleeps so much better swaddled, however he started wiggling out of even our large Aden & Anais muslin swaddle blankets. I was so hopeful that I would be able to snug it enough to keeps his arms in. No such luck! I honestly think it is a combination of our wiggly, strong baby and the fabric being just stretchy enough. For the most part, it works out because his arms are still down when he falls asleep. 5-6 hours later though, at least one arm is out and he's awake!

To my surprise, this swaddle worked really well and he was unable to get out. It kept him warm during the winter season and I do not have to worry about him catching a cold from kicking the blankets away.

I'm not sure that this is a huge problem for me, though, because she's going to have to be weaned from it soon anyway. Also, I'm pretty sure that the reason she gets her hand out is she's trying to self-soothe by sucking on it!

Maybe the songs can grow on me if i hear someone playing them and people enjoying, but until then I suggest that you buy some other great compilation like one from the East 2 West - series on turkish based Doublemoon Records run by modern sufi-musician Mercan Dede.Bar de Lune has released wonderful albums from Christophe Goze and Radar, and I have a feeling Fragile State and Al-Pha-X albums could be good stuff also (haven't heard them yet). But this compilation has none of them on it, but a long list of projects previously unknown to me. And none of them sticks in my head...You might also want to try Arabian Travels compilations on ever-great Six Degrees Records and their new artist release called Niyaz, combining persian music with cutting-edge electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-flying!","review":"This is a warts-and-all autobiography, which is almost a contradiction in terms but Gary manages to pull it off anyways. The book chronicles the highs and lows of the life of Gary Anthony James Webb, aka Gary Numan, and sets the record straight on a lot of misconceptions about the man, from his career as a musician to his high-flying antics as one of Britains top display pilots. A must-read for serious fans, it's also an entertaining read for more casual fans and even folks who don't know who the heck Gary Numan is. If you've ever wondered what life in a fishbowl is like for a celebrity, look no further than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong colors","review":"The fabric quality was what I expected, since I've ordered a tapestry from amazon before. Unfortunately, the colors are not what was represented in the picture. The pic appears to show a more turquoise tone, with a lot of contrast between the colors.

I really love the tree image, and am disappointed that the overall product is just not what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sturdy Product","review":"I love Rubbermaid products because of their durability, and this one is no exception. We just recently bought our first house and I needed a new mailbox. I got this mounting bracket along with the largest Rubbermaid mailbox I could find. Some drunk idiot hit the mailbox on 4th of July weekend and ripped the mailbox right off the post and this mounting bracket. The mailbox didn't make it but the bracket held up perfectly. I got another Rubbermaid mailbox a week later and it still holds it perfectly in place just as id did before the car hit it. I'm very impressed with how it held up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy!

Most of us who lived through the sixties will want to add this to their collection. Sure Burdon's voice is deeper and the sound is different. But it is still is a keeper for your Animal collection.

There is no indication on the package that this is Burton with a tribute band. I compared it with the same songs from The Best of Eric Burton and The Animals-Don't Bring Me Down, Help Me Girl, See See Rider, San Francisco Nights, Monterey and there is no energy in the backup vocals. The band sounds bored. Burton sounds like himself on a few songs and like the background vocals are draining him on others. The organ is missing or weak in some songs. When Eric joined the band in the 60's they changed their name to The Animals and you can understand why when you hear the originals. I will be very suspicious of Fuel 2000 recordings in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Sad Stuff","review":"this album is total garbage . I thought I was getting the real deal .

But, somehow it's like passing a train wreck and not being able to look away. It's so bad I have to listen. The lyrics make me cringe. Whoever wrote this song apparently had never heard of \\"poetic meter\\". Can someone explain to me why Eric Burdon whispers \\"In the beginning.......\\" at the start of the song? It makes no sense. The instruments sound like some non-musicians came into the studio and began playing with them. I'm a fan of Eric Burdon (and The Animals) but this song should never have been written or recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many things are not right about this recording","review":"1.

It's too bad that this tired re-hash is being pawned off as their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Best","review":"After following Eric's career for years, and trying to find every variation of the House of the Rising Sun there, i can find, this becomes a nice add on to my collection. It cleans up some of my mon recordings quite nicely, and is enough of a variation of the old tunes, to make it worthwhile additon to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This CD contains 16 re-recordings of Eric Burdon's greatest songs. Sadly, the arrangement is quite weak, and the songs are from an album released earlier called \\"The Animals' Greatest Hits\\" or something like that. That CD is a bootleg released by Disky, and Eric doesn't receive any royalties from it.But still - Eric sings quite all right, so if the info above doesn't scare you off, perhaps you should give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the Best (rerecorded)","review":"No doubt the material is his absolutely best, but not the original arrangement which is a BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look good- don't grip","review":"I can't even grip chicken secure enough to turn over.

It also works well when transferring food from the pan to a dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made, Buy Something Different","review":"First of all the handle is made of a soft nylon that will easily break down over time. However I don't think they will get that chance. The rivet started rusting WITHIN ONE WEEK, having been used once in that time frame. Now, a couple of months and half-dozen uses later the rust is very noticeable and cannot be easily removed with a Brillo pad.

I really enjoyed the exciting music used to underscore the dogfight scene. Why isn't it on the soundtrack? And how about the end title sequence? This greatly sums up all of the films key music.

The characters are finely developed and the relationships that develop between them as their lives converge are deep and believable. The overall tone of the movie is gentle and profound. The Peter Dinklage character is wry and smart and handsome. Patricia Clarkson is heartrending as a bereaved mother, and the Bobby Cannavale character who has reluctantly taken over his father's hot dog truck is awesome as he cluelessly and doggedly harasses the other characters into friendship and out of their shells. The character Cleo (played by Raven Goodwin)is a scene-stealer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Unique Movie, Not your average Hollywood films","review":"For people who are not used to this sort of indies, it might feel slow. But once you are drawn into the surreal world of \\"The Station Agent\\", you will find yourself not wanting the movie to end. Three main characters encounter and form sort of \\"family\\" in every-town in middle of NJ. Each character is portraited vividly and unique yet real. Not much to the plot, but you will find pure joy watching characters learn to \\"bond\\" with each other.I want Hollywood to make more movies like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"run away as fast as you can","review":"This movie must be a chick flick.

Well, I could really relate to the upbeat Cuban guy from Manhattan stuck in the sticks with two people who want to be hermits (a midget with a train obsession, and a woman depressed at the loss of her son). I just wish I had as much energy as he does. I would have dumped papa¡s snack truck and been on the next train back to the city. The acting and directing are excellent. Amazing character studies, incredible depth, realism. There are even some funny moments. It¡s a great movie, but the subject matter makes it pretty tedious to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"People Liked This Movie?","review":"I actually sat through the entire movie waiting for something to happen - it didn't. This is one of those movies that the artsy fartsy set really like, maybe because there is a vertically-challenged gentleman in it. Who knows. For those of you who like movies with real plots and things like that, look elsewhere. This is one of those movies that feels like it was done by your brother in some film school project and really isn't much of a movie. I love trains, so at least there were trains, but other than that, I can't get my two hours back from sitting through this."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Jersey Quirky...","review":"Why is it that directors who set movies in the Garden State almost always depict it as a parallel universe? (OK, don't answer.) Still, boring is boring, even if it's quirky-boring. In The Station Agent, an urban dwarf with an attitude moves to East Bumblepuck, New Jersey and finds that there are worse things than being short. In the process of self-discovery, he meets a variety of quirky characters, including the world's dumbest mobile food cart owner, who has set up his hot-dog stand on a rural road with LITERALLY ZERO TRAFFIC; a pregnant teen-age librarian with a heart of gold and a Neanderthal boyfriend; and a very annoying sixth-grader. Lesson from the movie: Don't get really really drunk and then walk on a train track by yourself late at night. Like the movie itself, it's NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a great movie","review":"The set-up is wonderful; initial interactions among the main characters are well done; but the last third of this underdeveloped movie is a waste of time. It's great that people are making off-beat movies like this one; but it doesn't follow that every off-beat movie is great. And this one isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real winner","review":"Station Agent is about a solitary man, who overcomes it to make friends. It sounds mundane, but is actually an excellent movie. All the character are interesting and compliment each other. The acting is A+. Even though the story sounds boring, the film goes by really fast. An enjoyable movie that'll put a smile on your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific sleeper.","review":"OK, here's the deal: if the name Patricia Clarkson appears anywhere in the cridits, then it is a must see film. Check out her work in \\"High Art,\\" \\"Far from Heaven\\" and \\"Pieces of April,\\" and you'll understand. \\"The Station Agent\\" is a wonderful, life affirming film about \\"real\\" people. Alright, I'm a sucker for \\"little\\" films like \\"Smoke Signals,\\" \\"Mississippi Masala,\\" \\"Ghost World,\\" \\"Local Hero,\\" \\"Il Postino,\\" and 2003 saw \\"Lost in Translation\\" and \\"American Splendor\\" triumph with audiences and critics - I was in Heaven. Tom McCarthy wrote and directed. Peter Dinklage gives a remarkable performance - certainly one of the five best of the year. Bobby Cannavale makes you want to kill his character only just when you're about to tie him to the tracks you discover that he's grown on you. What are ya gonna do with this guy?

It's a small, cinematic miracle. The writing is perfect, the performances of the three leads both heartbreaking and fall-down funny. It haunts you. I know these people. I am these people.Writer/director Tom McCarthy does a rare thing in modern film-making. He respects both his audience and his characters enough not to tell the whole story. When Olivia asks Fin not to stare, when Joe says grace in the most reverently irreverant way, when Fin demands that the crowd \\"take a look!\\"; there are rivers of backstory to all these characters. And we know what they are without being told. This film has the sometimes awkward intimacy of a play. I've never seen anything remotely like it.I hear Dinklage is playing the lead in Richard III. Wish I could see it. When he's in anything else I'll be first in line for a ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film to see at least once !","review":"Personally, I will watch it at least once a year.If subtle, character study films are your cup of tea, then I would highly suggest this very moving film. I have always been a fan of great, outstanding performances, and Peter Dinkage as 'Fin' in the lead role is simply amazing. Not once is his character being exploited or exaggerated, rather, this film tells his story in an honest and heartfelt manner and he truly gives a remarkable performance....hitting a direct bullseye. The setting of this film is also unique, and will leave an impression in the viewer's mind forever.The rest of the cast are good, sometimes very good, and provide very sturdy support, but this is a film to see due to Dinkage in an impressive role, and the actual story it tells.This is one of those gentle and quiet films that have more of an impact than 3 action movies combined.See it soon !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, offbeat, well done","review":"This is not an action movie. It is about how 3 people have their lives changed by meeting each other. It was a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lovely film","review":"What a lovely film this is! It is truly a breath of fresh air. I am as big a fan of the big blockbuster movies as most people, but this film is for the quiet moments. Beautiful photography, understated dialogue, and an intense focus on facial expressions make this film a very intimate experience. Friends oftentimes happen unexpectedly and come in all shapes and sizes. Friendship is all about tolerance, acceptance, and the joy of laughing together. That is the beauty of this film - the surprising joy of unexpected friendship. I am in still in awe two days after seeing it for the first time. A film rarely does this to me, so it has to be good!!!!In an age when most films have budgets the size of the national deficit (almost), it is nice to see a low-key film that is so powerful! This is one film that no one should ever regret viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this good. I recommend it to anyone who is tired of waiting for something worthwhile to come to the theater. A big budget doesn't necessarily mean a good movie.

There are no easy answers and we are all glad for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Dinklage Rocks!","review":"Quiet, character driven flick.

You would think that the episode would ease up when the story focuses away from these silly debates that are so obviously RELIGION vs. SCIENCE (ones that only seem to interest Orson Scott Card anyhow) but then it dovetails into an idiotic plot that ensures that Fletcher will be around to whisper and act all self-righteous in future episodes, it becomes practically unforgivable.The only thing good I can say about this episode is that I didn't see it the first time around so I couldn't lose all faith in this show from the outset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Bibliography","review":"Although the title and the first few chapters took me in, I found that the search advice in this book was very limited.

Upon further investigation, I discovered that the only thing truly 'Christian' about the book is in its title. The book denies the true divinity of Jesus Christ and the person of the Holy Spirit. It denies the existence of evil, Satan, the necessity of the atonement of Christ and various other fundamental doctrines of Christianity.

The success of Xena Warrior Princess not only comes from the talented people who were in front and behind the camera, but also to Joseph LoDuca whose music was as important to the show as anything else. And now that the show ended it's run, what a better way to relive one of the most original programs to come to TV in a while, than to play this, and the other CD's in the Xena Warrior Princess collection.In closing I would like to say that I believe that composers who work in film like Joseph LoDuca, Trevor Rabin, and John Williams, just to name a few, are really the Beethoven's of modern times.Gary Brown Houston, TX."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rhythm of Xena!","review":"An awesome soundtrack, really captures the feel of the 2nd season of the show!

The music allows you to see the episodes as you listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Headphones - While they last!","review":"I bought these headphones as a replacement to the standard Apple i-pod headphones. Pros: These headphones do a great job of isolating noise and provide a decent amount of clear sound. They are relatively comfortable if worn for two hours or less. Cons: I used these while working out, and the long cord became an extreme annoyance after a while. Also, the buds tend to slip out if they're not perfectly inserted in your ear. I tried the different sized earbuds, but in the end none fit perfectly. After long distance runs, all sizes eventually ended up falling out at some point during the run. The biggest frustration was that after about 3.5 months of owning the headphones, the left earphone ceased to function. This was truly annoying since it was just past the warranty period. I ended up having to purchase new headphones of a different brand and felt like I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony earphones","review":"The Sony earphones are the best I have ever owned. I love the break away cord, as well as the three different size ear covers. They are very comfortable and often forget I even have them in my ears when away from my desk. The price is great. I now own two pairs and couldn't imagine owning any other type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound quality; Wires dissolve after extensive use","review":"Best sound quality I've come across. The design does a really good job at keeping outside noise out which makes for great sound quality. However the wires essentially \\"dissolve\\" after extensive use. Sweat and body oils breakdown and softens the outer rubber coating which eventually wears away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome headphones!","review":"This is a great pair of headphones! I am a real stickler when it comes to sound, and I hate those weak bass tinny sounding headphones. If you are on a budget, I have nothing but great things to say about these guys. They seal out a lot of the sound, even though they are not noise canceling! Also, the bass is quite deep. I would say they are not good for running because they tend to fall out while I am running, but that just may be the shape of my ear, but for normal listening, and even movie, hi-fi listening, they are great! Get them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't need really expensive ones, these are fine.","review":"I labored over everyone's comments before I bought these for my Ipod. The headphones that came with it fell out of my ears on a regular basis and the foam covering was gone after one or two uses and they also hurt. I bought these to use my Ipod while lifting weights and riding my bike. I know people say it's not safe to use while riding, but I do so at very low level so I can still hear traffic! If you want to tune out any outside noise they are good for that as well. I use the smallest ear bud option and they are comfortable, don't fall out, and sound great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert John","review":"Great sounding earphones!! awesome bass reponse. Only complaint I have is the cord length. Without the supplied extension cord length is to short for for mp3 player to be worn on a belt clip.Plug in the extension and guess what ?? You have about 2 feet of extra cord to contend with and the plugs add extra weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"new cord, same sound","review":"I owned a set of first gen sony earbuds and they were fantastic. They used little power, sounded great (perfect for electronica) and lasted many years. They were stolen so I had to get something new. The EX71s are a good replacement. The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of five is that the cord is either too short or too long (with or without the extension attached). I use an arm-band style mp3 player and it works well with the short cord but I'd rather wear my music on my belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCKING! Do not buy these earbuds.","review":"I bought a pair of Sony MDR-EX71SL/WK Fontopia Headphones last November to use with my iPod mini and they were a big improvement over the standard iPod earbuds. They block outside sound a lot better and provide decent sound quality, especially for the price.However, I cannot recommend these because I have experienced the same problem as some other raters, that these earbuds are literally shocking. The earbuds come with a 1-meter extension cord. I noticed that when I used the extension cord, when the metal end of the extension cord brushed against my arm, I got a shock. I had to cover the exposed metal with a piece of tape to stop this. Then I started getting shocks in each ear from the earbuds, at random intervals. This is unacceptable. I will be complaining to Sony, although I do not know if they will do anything about this.Don't buy these. I'm sure there are other earbuds of similar quality and price where you don't risk getting shocked every time you use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with Sony MDR-EX71SL Headphones","review":"I was pleased with the price, happy with the time of delivery, and so far have had no issues with the quality of these headphones. The sound quality is good on airplanes, when working out, and they do not fall out of my ears nor do they cause any discomfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in 6 Months","review":"These were the first replacements I bought for the I-Pod earbuds. I liked the sound when there was a tight fit to my ears, but this was hard to achieve. When working out, they kept popping out of my ears. If the fit wasn't perfect and the I-pod EQ not set right, the highs were harsh and tinny.The short cord was wonderful for workouts wearing an armband; no 3 feet of cord to figure out what to do with. However, after about 5 months one of the earbuds fell out of the piece that holds it--it required electrical tape to put it back together. Then about a month later, one of the channels died completely. They went in the trash this morning. Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You could do worse","review":"I've been a Sony user for years, so after reading the reviews, I decided to give these a shot too. Compared to the ibuds that came with my Nano, these are a HUGE step up. Good base response and decent treble. I agree with other reviewers who have concerns with the quality of the wire leading to the buds. It's pretty flimsy and I can see it giving me some trouble in the future. I jog regularly and only occasionally does one fall out. I haven't quite gotten used to the cord having to go around the back of my neck, but I'm sure I will in time.I don't claim to be an expert in headphone sound or quality, but for the time being I am enjoying these headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound for little cost","review":"Excellent sound with great base as long as you have the right size earbud covers. This is my second pair of headphones having lost the covers for the first pair and realising it was almost as cheap to buy a completely new set of phones as buying some third party covers. I wish they would make fatter stronger cables particularly as I wear them snowboarding which means they get pulled around a lot and can tear easily. But a great set of headphones for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The overpriced earphones of the year","review":"For the money you are much better going with another set. The problem with these headphones is they don't stay in your ear. There is a branch at the top of the headphone where the left unit and the right unit split from the main cord that goes to you're mp3 player. This separation at the top means that the slightest pull on the actual cord will pop your headphone out in one ear constantly. I have to pull the cord over my ear then put it in to keep them in. And if you are working out with these headphones, try another set. The in ear design works perfectly unless you are sweating, then they fall right out. In conclusion, they are a terrible purchase, and the sound quality is equal to much simpler less expensive headphones not carrying the \\"sony\\" name."},{"rating":"1","title":"The idea was nice...","review":"I ordered these headphones because the ones that came with my mp3 player are a little too big for my ears, and tend to pop out. I liked the idea of a \\"small\\" sized ear plug. When I got these, I tried them out immediately & was NOT impressed. I must have exceptionally small ears, because even the small sized plug didn't fit quite right. And once I got them settled, the sound quality (something that I didn't think would be that noticeable) was crap compared to the buds that came with my player. Very disappointing... returned them the same day I got them."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoyingly difficult","review":"What braniac came up with this idea for earbuds..don't they ever let consumers try them out before dumping an idea on us? Firstly, I think the earphones that cames with my ipod were far superior and they didnt frightingly-muffle all outside noise like these do. It's great if you're on a plane or in bed, but terrible to be outside with, especially on a bicycle.As for the short left cord and longer right side, all that does it make the weight uneven so that they slide out of the left ear too easily. But the worst part is that you have to jam them deep into the ear in order to get reasonable bass response. After an hour the ears get fairly sore.Just an all-around poor product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate Them!","review":"The sound is not loud compared to other headphones. So you have to turn the volume way up to hear all the small details. Second, the cord is way too long, once you get it caught on something and the left earbud pops out it feels like your whole ear is going with it. After getting caught on a million door handles I threw a fit and ripped the cord to pieces. Now im looking for a new set of headphones that wont drive me insane!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to sender","review":"I haven't even plugged these in and am already annoyed. The cord is designed more to show off the SONY logo instead of comfort or what you're use to with any other set. I am not going to sacrifice comfort just so I can act as their billboard. Instead of meeting in the middle, both L & R wires come together on one side, so you have this stupid metal clip/logo hanging right next to your face, hitting you as you move around. I tried them on and was instantly annoyed. Who the hell designed these stupid things? Keep looking, these suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because They Work!!","review":"I think these earphones are excellent simply because they work! If you happened to have lost or broken the set that came with your portable player then the Sony's will suffice.But if you really wanna hear the very best digital reproduction that ANY player can provide then I suggest you spend the price for the MDR-Ex71sl's as TAX for a REAL set such as the Etymotic ER4p's or better yet...the Westone UM2's. Comparing Sony to these are like listening to the master recordings of HELEN KELLER! Need I say more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sony Headphones","review":"Hi,I actually bought two of these headphones. I had my first pair and one of the ears died, I thought it was a defect went to the store and they happily exchanged it with me.Now, I have the nice shiny white ones. I'm a college student and we have to WALK everywhere we go. These headphones wires get destroyed fairly fast. It's from the oils of your skin.

Make sure your player has lots of volume for these buds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound great, but not durable","review":"When I first purchased these, I thought the cable felt strange. The coating was very soft and flexible. I love the behind the head design, and the sound is outstanding for an ear bud. By far the best I've owned. Unfortunately, after only 2 months the cable has nicks and has actually torn in 2 places! Luckily the wire underneath is fine. I had to put black tape on my white headphone cord, which doesn't necessarily bother me, except for the fact that the cable is now tearing at the edge of my tape. I am by no means hard on headphones, so this is really surprising. I have seen these in black also, so hopefully they use a more traditional cable coating because I would not recommend the white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulation wears off!","review":"Other reviewers have noted this as well, and they're right! The plastic insulation around the headphone wires will break down over time into a sticky mess. You're left with bare wire. Sure, the headphones sound good, but the faulty insulation makes these headphones not worth the money.PLUS, when you call SONY and complain, they only offer you the option of replacing the headphones (for a charge of $30) or having them \\"repaired\\" for $60."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound::::Bad Quality Construction","review":"I've had these headphones for several months and after a month or two I noticed I would get a small shock in my left ear every once and awhile. It turns out it was b/c the wire covering was deterriorating and leaving the wire exposed. Although this model is nice and light, I think the wire protection was sacraficed because the cord that covers the wire quickly wears away.Instead of getting these I would recommend getting the very comparable \\"Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones.\\" I got that model and they are pretty much the same thing, with the same great sound quality, still light (good to workout with), blocks out outside noise, works wonderfully with my ipod, also comes in a few colors, and the cord doesn't errode away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound -- poor durability","review":"We've had these headphones for 8 months now, and they've had lots of use. They do sound great. Truly great for their size and price. BUT we have also had the insulation turn into a sticky mess leaving bare wires exposed. Absolutely not recommended for this reason. You expect more than a few months wear our of a product like this.I've read that the white ones are more prone to do this than black, so if matching your ipod isn't an issue, black may be the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I don't find these headphones comfortable in the least, and they don't create a proper seal for sound isolation.

Another misfire from $ony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound","review":"I should have believed the previous reviews - the sound stinks - very tinny - no bass. Sony should be embarassed to put thier name on it - I'll think again before buying Sony. Also the cord is oddly assymetric and does not hang right. Terrible product - what were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Money","review":"I'm completely regret buying these headphones and not listening to the advice of the other reviews who warned against them. I dont know how anyone could give these things more than one star. The cord is shaped wierd with the length of the cord going to one ear a lot longer than the cord going to other. The cord is also way way too short, luckly it comes with an extension cord which is about 5 feet long. So if you i want to strap my ipod to my neck or my ankle i'm all set, otherwise I have to deal with 3 feet of extra cord in my pocket. Also when i go to the gym the buds keep falling out of my ear when i run, basically i cant use these headphones at the gym.Well, atleast when cord starts to deteriate in a few months (see other reviews) I'll know not to buy another pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony SUCKS!!!","review":"SONY SUCKS!!! Dont buy sony products. Their customer service is the worst. These headphones have the weakest wires connecting them.

He didn't like the fact that the wire length was not adjustable. The wires \\"hugged\\" around your neck instead of hanging low.

So needless to say he never used them because of this \\"feature.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I purchased these in Jan and loved them. They sounded good and were very comfortable. However, the right earpiece quit working 2 days ago. I take very good care of my stuff and these were not abused in any way. Best Buy would not take them back (> 30 days). So, I had to call Sony and they will exchange them if they determine it was product failure. BUT, they will exchange them for a refurbished pair. So, I paid $50 for a pair of earbuds that were good for < 90 days. Not a good deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want something reliable get something else","review":"I bought this set of headphone about 8 months ago, the comfort is excellent, they adjust very well to your ears and I love that they cancel out almost all noise.

Sorry but for 50$ I can expect a little more durability or not?Daniel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I like this product. I basically needed headphones with a deep bass and I finally found them. I was tired of using the huge headsets just for the bass.I knew companies like shure provided such headphones but they were way too expensive.The only cons I can tell you of would be the cord length (I am sure you have read that in other reviews by now).People told me that these headphones have a short life too but I frankly don't see that happening. I have owned these for 3 months now and no signs of disintegration.GREAT PRODUCT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headphones.","review":"Good sound, light and comfortable. It was a perfect complement to my iPod shuffle. I got it because I run a lot and with an armband the shorter wire length without the extension cord is the perfect length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below expectations","review":"Not impressed. I purchased these as an alternative to the ear buds that come with the Shuffle. I won't be using them. The bass response is poor giving them a tinny quality.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably Aggravating","review":"After using these for 2 weeks, I've decided to get Apple's in-ear headphones instead. It's not that these don't sound good--that's what prevented me from giving them the lowest rating. But their design...are you kidding me? Read Ian Kessler's review for a detailed explanation. In short, the cord length is beyond inconvenient and the \\"closed type\\" design will make you curse in front of strangers. I thought I could get used to these headphones, but after angrily throwing them on ground several times at the gym, I've given up hope. Good-bye, $35. You will be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good stuff but it broke","review":"The sound quality is noticeably better than any lower cost earbud style headphones.

I bought these things yesterday, and when I plug them into the extension cord, the left ear stops making noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff for good price","review":"I've been using these headphones for 2 months now, and I can honestly say there are the best ear-plug phones I have ever had. Good noise canceling and sound, sits firmly in ears. The only minus I personally found is length of cable. Without cable extension I am unable to plug headphones to my IPAQ and attach it to my waist - it's to short. With extension cable is too long etc. Anyway I recommend these headphones - you will not find better stuff in this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for.","review":"I have been looking for decent headphones for a while now.

These are the perfect length. Plus amazing sound and noise reduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice headphones at a unique pricepoint","review":"These headphones are perfect for what I use them for: catching some tunes on my Zen Micro between classes. They block out more external noise than standard earbuds, but not enough to cause you to be unaware of your surroundings. The cord length is frustrating sometimes, but if I put my Zen Micro in a chest pocket, I don't need to use the extension cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 of these have failed on me","review":"These were the first type of earbuds that I use with my iPod.

Well all in all these ear plugs do not stay plugged into the ears. I tried pushing these into the ear canal so they would remain plugged but as soon as I talk or chew on gum they come right off. Maybe my ear canals are small or just that the design is terrible of this plug. If the earbuds were thick they would remain in well and snug. Hey I have no problem with the old school earphones with sponge covers on them, yea I'm talking about the ones that fit within the ear. Also, I used the headphone with ipod and the sound is sharp. I had to set the equaliser to \\"Lower Treble\\" so that my ears would not start to ring. Hey there are better headphones out there, this one, well the design is bad and so is the sound quality. Hope this helps you amazoners. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price! Excellent for travel...","review":"I bought this and other sony headphones (noice cancelling).

I've had mine less than four months and the rubber coatinng is ripping in several places. And if you got the white ones which I did to match my ipod, it easily gets dirty. For the price I paid, I really expected to have this pair of earphones for a long time. I mean everything else is great, the feel and comfort of the earpiece as well as the sound... but the damn rubber coating. I don't exactly put it through any tough environments, I put it in my messenger bag pocket and take it out... thats it. I have a different pair for workouts so it's not like I'm doing any thing that leads to the sheathing from ripping so easily. I use it at work, in a cubicle. So I don't recommend this brand. Unless you treat it like you would a baby, then it will eventually wear out and start to rip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but I hate the cord","review":"These little earbud headphones have very good sound, but I HATE the cord...so much that I bought a cheaper pair of no-name headphones that I use instead.The cord is asymmetrical (imagine a wishbone where one wing is twice the length of the other) and way too short overall.

It is just 4 inches too short without the extension. The extension is 3 feet long. They say the extension is adjustable, which means wrapping 2'8\\" of cord around a little plastic thing. When I walk, it bangs against my hip, which sounds like a thump in the headphones. Otherwise the sound is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but don't like the behind-the-neck cord","review":"Sounds fine. Priced a bit high in my opinion. I don't like Sony's behind-the-neck cord, but that's just my personal preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extension cord is not working","review":"Just like a previous reviewer, I had the same problem. The extension cord does not work. It probably does not make proper contact with the jack coming from the headphones and, as a result, only the left headphone works. I was stupid enough to ask for a replacement which just arrived today and guess what - it has the same problem. Thank you very much, I'll ask for a refund this time and look for other headphones with a resonable cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"These earphones sounded great. However, they were one of the worst pairs of earphones that I've ever owned. For starters, the cord is incredibly poorly designed, with one ear cord significantly longer than the other. The cord also was made cheaply and tangled easily. The rubber on the earphones created a snug, secure fit at first, but eventually (after 2 or so weeks) became smooth and wouldn't stay secure in the ear. If you are buying earphones for the gym or working out, avoid these - due to the uneven cord lengths, the cord bounces back and forth, tugging at ear with the shorter cord, creating a loud, irritating noise (because earphone is inside your ear). In the end, one of the earphones suddenly stopped working for no particular reason. Although they were still under the 90 day warrenty, I didn't replace them because it was honestly not worth my time. Don't buy these earphones - shame on you, Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Engineered","review":"I bought these when my original iPod headphones jammed in a gym locker and broke, thinking they would be an improvement. They miss being useful in the gym in many ways. The cord is very short. In addition the cords going to each individual earphone are unequal, they are not the same length where they join together. If you're going to attach it to your mp3 that attaches to your right arm it would probably be OK. However, if you attach it anywhere else it constantly gets pulled out of your ear. Because the entire wire is very short, Sony gives you an extension cord. This jack creates more weight that tends to pull the phones out of your left ear. If you jam them deep into your ear the sound is excellent. However, the moment they move a bit out, and they will, the bass diminishes considerably. I don't recommend them. In fact I feel that I threw out my money and will try to find the original iPod phones somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"asymmetrical cord design is a fiasco","review":"These headphones sound okay, and have been durable enough for me, but the short left ear cord is ridiculous. They are fine if I am at home listening to music or my personal DVD player, but when walking (for which I purchased them) the design is terrible! The earbud is constantly pulling out of my left ear because of the ridiculously short cord. At first I thought I received a defective set, but reading other reviews I see I did not, although I consider them defective. Sony really blew this design, I don't know what psycho thought this would be a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value...","review":"I bought these as a a replacement for my iPod headphones which finally gave up on me after 2 years!I think these are great. The sound quality is better than I thought it would be. I liked the iPod headphones - I thought they sounded pretty good - these definitely sound better. They sit much deeper in your ear than other headphones but I quickly got used to them. They come with three different size plugs and the smallest was the only one that didn't hurt my ears.My only complaint is the case. It looks really cool but it is a real hassle to try and get the headphones and all of the cables neatly tucked inside. If you are using these headphones with the iPod remote then you don't stand a chance. I definitely wouldn't recommend the case for daily use, however, the ear bud protectors are much more practical and they do a great job.I have no doubt that there are better alternatives out there but these are definitely good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound, for 4 months, after which they will fall apart.","review":"I bought these through an Amazon merchant for 24.00. I am extremely pleased with the sound and the feel of these headphones. However, I can no longer recommend them, as all of the talk about the cord sleeves falling apart is exactly correct. After about 4 months, my sleeves started to sort of melt and shrivel away, leaving exposed wires on my headphones. In a vain attempt to correct this problem, I had the cords all re-heat wrapped at the local electronics store. Now, the cord is too heavy to wear when walking around and fall out every three steps taken. Darn.Although I like the sound and really like the feel of these headphones, I think that the production, not only of the length of the cord, but also the cord sleeve composition, make this headphone set a lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"I love these headphones.

I should admit the sound quality is really good. But, the product is not durable at all. The cord that goes around the neck wears out too quickly. I bought mine from amazon few months ago, and now there is almost nothing left of the protecting skin around the wires.

My pair broke within two weeks of getting them (stopped playing music in the right ear). The cord is terribly designed, either too short without the extension or too long with the extension. While the sound is good, that doesn't matter too much when they stop working. I dropped some extra money on the Etymotic Er-6i's and think that are well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I bought these headphones for my daughter and she just loves them for her ipod mini.

Much softer than the ones comes with the Ipod. Sounds quality is better and comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound Imaging","review":"I've tried many earbud type units and have found the Sony to be the best I've used. I'm a musician and I pay attention to details in recordings and have found that overall, these earbuds provide faithful reproduction.The bass is much better than the standard iPod buds but isn't boomy like the Koss Spark Plug, instead it's clearly detailed and specific. My biggest gripe with these was that I occassionally found the highs to be a bit intense but found that after using the unit for about two weeks, the drivers seemed to break in and the sound rounded out nicely.Last thing - I find them to be the most comfortable I've used. I go to sleep every night wearing them and since I sleep on my side, it's always been a challenge to find a pair that is comfortable with your ear against the pillow. These are perfect for that. And I can remove the cord extension and keep my Nano in my front pocket...the cord length is just right for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes riding in an airplane a lot more tolerable.","review":"I bought these instead of noise canceling headphone, to block out noise on frequent plane rides.

On my second pair and if they still make them in 6 months to a year I'll buy another pair. For the money, I consider them a best buy. Great sound (yes), good isolation, 3 earbud sizes for that perfect fit, reasonably priced and they look cool (white version) with my Samsung Yep. Negatives: the left earbud wire is shorter than the right; wiring could be a little more durable; storage case is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's mediocre","review":"Sounds the same as my earbuds that came with my mp3 creative player. It's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent sound - horrible cord design","review":"I was very impressed when I first plugged these in my iPod. The sound was great and they were much more comfortable than the headphones that came with the iPod. One big hitch - the cord is very thin and made of a sticky material. Within a week I had 3 places where the insulation had torn and the wires were showing. I have them now in for warranty replacement but, really in less than a month these were completely unuseable after average use (they were stored in a separate bag from other items that might have damaged them but they tore anyway). The extension is too long but I rectified this with a cord wrapper product by sumajin (found on iPod lounge). If you are looking to throw your money away this is the product for you, otherwise look for something else.PS - for those confused by the cord design, one side is longer than the other so you can drape the cord behind your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"These head phones sound great, the trebles are great, and the bass from them is unbelievable. Unfortunately these are great sounding head phones that are not worth the money. I have now had 3 sets that have all had the same issue. Either the left or the right side will lose sound. This has happened 3 times in a row, Sony warrantied the 2nd set after 2 months, and is now refusing to warranty the current set.Not worth the trouble you will have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planned Obsolescence","review":"Pretty much what the title says. These ear buds are great... for about the first 6 months. And as you wear them, you can feel the cord around your neck slowly deteriorate until finally it starts to fall apart completely and just become electrifying (yes, it literally shocked me) bare wire.i'm starting to think that Sony does this on purpose because they know people will keep on buying them for the excellent sound quality these things have. oh yeah, and the name too.the ear buds have really nice lows, good mids, and decent highs. if it weren't for ****ty construction though that pretty much render them useless after 6 months (unless you like getting electrocuted), i'd give this item a higher rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you buy black electrician's tape also!","review":"Pluses: great sound, good noise isolationMAJOR flaw: these lasted just short of the five month mark before the white cord disintegrated. The white coating over the wire starts swelling and becomes \\"gummy,\\" then cracks in the coating start showing, then, VOILA! you have bare copper wire, not the nice white coating. Believe the reviews, look at the pictures, the negative reviews are accurate. (I also regularly cleaned the coating.)I also bought a black (silver) pair, and haven't seen the same flaw, but they're several months newer. I'll report the results of that pair after I see how they shape up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Review","review":"Wow. It's amazing reading through these reviews and seeing how many people have experienced the same thing I have. I bought my first pair and really loved the sound and how it fit in my ears. It blocked out a lot of the outside noise so I didn't have to put my music on too loud. I used them to work out, walk around, listen at my desk, and sometimes fall asleep with them on. After 6 months of use the right earphone died on me. I bought another one because I liked them so much. After 5 months, I noticed that the insulation on the wire connecting the 2 earphones was cracking. It didn't take long before all the insulation came off. After being burned twice I don't think I'll get these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product Quality","review":"I like in-ear style headphones. It is the only type I use. I have purchased two of these Sony headphones and they sound pretty good. The bass is not as strong as a Koss pair I owned, but they sound good enough that I bought two pairs.HOWEVER, the problem with these headphones, as so many others noted, is that the cord covering the wires literally disintigrates after a period of time, exposing the bare wires! The cord becomes sticky and then gummy and then split and expose the wire. No more Sony's for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fab sound - lousy cord","review":"These headphones are great - great sound, rather comfortable too. The biggest problem with them is the cord. Without the extension it is to short for anything. I can't even put my ipod on my desk while wearing them, its so short. But the extension is so long! it gets tangled and is a real nusence. They should make the same headphones with a longer main cord. That would solve the problem. Other then that they're great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound -- but not for long","review":"These headphones offer great sound and isolation. Especially great is the bass quality for in-ear headphones. However, there is definitely a catch: they break VERY easily. I've gone through two pairs in about a year. Both times the left speaker stopped playing entirely, which is simply unacceptable at ANY pricepoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Warning!!","review":"Indeed the sound quality on these is excellent, but after about 3-4 months the cord develops a putty like consistency and peels away from the inner wire, leaving your headphones unusable. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The wires disintegrate!","review":"I bought the MDR-EX51LP and wrote this review - it applies to the EX71 too.----------------------------------I liked these - they fit me well and sounded good. I can even sleep with them on.Unfortuneately, the insulation on the wire disintegrated within 4 months. It starts with a crack or tear where the wire meets the plug. Soon the insulation stretches, wrinkles, and delaminates until it comes off.I thought it was a freak accident so I bought the next step up as a replacement, the MDR-EX71SL. I'm sorry to report that the same thing happened to it - only within three months. I'm trying to find the warrenty information now so I can send them back.You can't buy these ear buds - you can only rent them until they sadly disintegrate around your neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is an issue with the wires","review":"I used this for about 6months before the coating on the wires just went bad, for want of a better word. The just peeled away exposing the metal inside. the wires are much softer than the wires on the headphone of an ipod. Makes it rather comfortable to begin with but in the long term there is an issue with durability. The ear piece unit is neat fits snuggly. The box gave away too in 6 months. I dont think I will buy this again. The adaptor for extension can be used with other headphones which is a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Once, Throw Away","review":"Very disappointing. The authors fill most of the space with \\"funny\\" comments and other observations, possibly to make up for what little they wrote about the actors.

I was hoping this book would be a modern version, but it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable Roll Call of Character Actors","review":"If you want a quick reference guide for character actors, this is a great place to go. With so much emphasis on humor, I wish the authors, who operate the website Fametracker.com, had slipped in some more background details, but at least you get a picture and a few movies the actors appeared in.The forward is in the form of an interview with Stephen Tobolowsky, who played the salesman Ned Ryerson in Groundhog Day. He talks about how the he was forced by the nature of his short appearance to figure out where his character is coming from.The character actors are all of recent vintage. Fans of older movies will need to consult a different source. But those included are excellent.The actors are grouped according to the type of movie they most often appear in, such as military movies, cop shows, office settings, mob movies, and so on.A great addition to any movie reference library.

My only caveat would be that patners, housemates and friends of the reader may get annoyed with the constant cries of \\"So *that's* where I know him from!\\" or \\"Did you know?...\\" or \\"Have a look at this!\\" from enthusiastic readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feh","review":"All the attitude and nitpicking of Fametracker without the fun of the forums.

Not a bad notion, but executionally the concept is a little weak... many of the items in the photos don't ring especially true to the styles they're supposed to exemplify, and many of the tips could easily be gleaned from a (free) IKEA catalog. Sometimes I find that the pictures in a decorating book make it worth the price... not so here.

The plot of Red Nights remains interesting with some good attempts to go \\"serious\\" at times. However, these aspects collide with a relatively poor acting and the gratuity of nudity and sexuality, elements that take the movie to the exploitation B-side. Nothing wrong with that, except that the the film falls short on the exploitation realm of B-movies. Most violence you get here comes from some Gestapo guys machine gun shooting some plotting business men and the women asked to uncover them while spending some days (and nights) on a castle. You have female nudity, yet sex is far from explicit. Overall then, a mid way between A- and B-film that would not please to any of these viewers.Technically, this Exploitation Digital release comes in widescreen image format.

Thankfully the tendency to over sing songs and the heavy handed, rock orientated production that marred these previous two releases has been toned down a little - albeit not enough.Although I miss the sparkle of albums such as their 2001 'Oxygen' release, there are some reasonable songs here that are worthy of a mention. These include the title track, 'Place In The World' and ' Thy Word'.A reworking of one of their biggest hits 'Testify To Love' does seem a little pointless and hints that this talented foursome may be running out of fresh ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I was expecting","review":"This album was not much more than noise. The singing is a little too strong at times and the background sounds like rock music, which to me is not pleasing to listen to.

The woman- average looking- doesn't move a muscle beyond the top portion of her index finger. The video is aptly titled as she does NOTHING but touch her clitoris and nothing else, not even other parts of her vagina. I could definitely see how this video would be helpful for women trying to get comfortable with their sexuality/bodies. However, as a woman who already feels very comfortable in that department, I got nothing out of this, and I don't want to show it to my boyfriend b/c he won't get a good overview of how to handle other parts of the vulva as well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"For $30 per copy, you're wasting a dollar a minute plus your time for this brief and simple look of this one girl masturbating.One thing I will guarantee is that I will never ever play or use this DVD again. I am even quite embarassed to say that I purchased it. Let me stop you from buying this video before you make the worst purchasing decision of your life.There is nothing new or instructional here. You won't learn a thing from this video. All you get to do is watch her masturbate. I thought I was going to learn something new to use on my partner. But I didn't learn a thing.BE WARNED.

She should have been given more screen time, but this is an action film intended for a male audience that cares little for romance. So her appearances are always somewhat episodic and her character remains undeveloped. Sturges stages the action sequences very well, the male cast is splendid (especially Richard Johnson and Steve MacQueen), the South East Asian locations are wonderful and atmospheric. Sinatra is always interesting on screen but he does not seem to be very involved in the project. Gina does what she is asked to do, and she does it well. We warm up to her character as the film progresses. At any rate, Lollobrigida was gorgeous-looking in 1959. What a woman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good old 1940 movies","review":"I was disappointed in this movie. I've seen a lot of the older 1940's war movies and they are always intertaining with good plots. This was lacking in action and acting. It turned out to be more theatrical. Not worth seeing in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Steve McQueen Diehards...","review":"Sorry to say this as I like most movies, but the only reason to purchase this movie (wish I had read my own review before I bought it) would be to make sure you have every second of Steve McQueen's screen work. As another reviewer wrote, the romance truly messes with the plot, despite the obvious charms of the leading lady. The only two bright spots are the McQueen bits where he is his usual flip and resourceful self and the scene where Frank soaks his dirty and perhaps cruddy feet in whiskey. Battle scenes on sets, poorly developed personalities of the local hero warriors, and so many plot lines left hanging, like what happened to Gina's man Nick who states that he is not a good loser? Maybe they were planning a sequel where Nick takes Frank down? And Gina is in Intelligence? Hell Is For Heroes is SO much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man loves the DVD","review":"Hello,I have been a companion for an elderly man for almost 10 years.

He looks \\"HOT\\" in this film and is very sexy. There are several \\"steamy\\" love scenes that shocked me never having seen an R rated film with Scalia in it. Overall he does a good acting job playing a character that's rather twisted. One huge negative about this movie is the music. It's obnoxious and very dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Familiarity is this flick's only saving grace.","review":"\\"Expose\\" is undoubtedly more concerned with five minute sex and shower scenes than it is with plot. I have nothing against gratuitous nudity, but this movie's taking things a little far. Starting out as a typical B movie, its overt use of nudity as a viewer attractant begins in the opening credit sequence. It plays like a comic political thriller, desperately trying to hold onto its plot for the first half of the film. At the halfway point, it seems to almost give up, and extinguishes the nudity with a marked regression into blatantly visceral violence, characterized by guns, rape, death, and orange brain matter everywhere. Ah, the American dream reaches fruition. The only reason to watch this movie is if you happened to go to college with its star, Tracy Tutor. If that's the case, you'll enjoy her cinematic debut, which essentially is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Enjoy.

The reason I purchased it is I really needed to master Web Matrix ASAP and Mr. Sussman's book was quite helpful in accomplishing that goal. Of course, it is better to begin with Visual Studio since Web Matrix is somewhat limited resemblance of Visual Studuo but Web Matrix has something nobody could resist - it is free.Make sure you learn as profoundly as possible chapters about datagrids and reusable content; these two are absolutely irreplaceble components of practically any online database application.

Of course my dog is not dry yet but I can put my nose into her coat and smell nothing. I used the spray as soon as she was sprayed but because the bulk of the smell/oil was around her eyes I was not able to spray the area. I let the spray dry and then threw her into the shower and started to wash her. I had to wash the affected area about 4 times to get all of the smell out but it is well worth it. Warning, one 8 oz bottle will wash a Golden Retriever until all of the smell is gone, once. You might want to buy multiple or the gallon jug to make sure that you have enough incase you could not get the affected area as well as you wanted. I just bought 2 gallons since I have 2 dogs and this is the 2nd skunk encounter in 8 days, lucky me.

And they both make this movie very good,they lend an aura of credence to the undertakings. The FX are good,except for the iguanas with the rubber fins taped to their heads, I really liked the giant mushroom garden that furnishes sustenance to the troop of explorers. The sets are lavish and atomospheric and the characters are intelligent and resourceful,even Pat Boone.Even the villain is well developed, how many of todays evil-doers are motivated by academic notoriety?

It's an entertaining piece of work nonetheless, full of danger and courage, surprise and villainy, romance and loyalty, fear and wonder. Menacing dinosaurs and giant mushrooms and glowing crystals and hair-raising plunges and death-defying escapes -- this is a rousing adventure.I recall being fascinated by the special effects as a child, though now they seem fairly crude. But the plot holds one's interest, Bernard Hermann's music is beautifully dramatic, and the acting is much better than the average kid flick. James Mason makes a believable professor, and Pat Boone is surprisingly good. The climax is thrilling, if risibly improbable.

Makes me long for the production values and script writing talents of those days. No cursing, no nudity, no sex, no loud, frantically cut fight scenes. Just classy entertainment!!Regarding the dinosaurs - in the absence of budget for stop motion animation, they actually did something very clever. They came up with dinosaurs that DID run about on all fours - dimetrodons. Rigging up a few iguanas with fins was quite an elegant idea. At least they weren't dishonest - they didn't call them tyrannosaurs and brontosaurs, like the makers of \\"The Lost World\\" a year later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally we get JTTCOTE on DVD!","review":"Much better than the VHS!

The damage done to Jules Verne's work is typical of the mess that Hollywood makes. Pat Boone is a fair singer, but should never have been cast in this.

I think James Mason captured the classic idea of the British scientist, always on the quest for knowledge at whatever personal cost.I think this film, even with it's very old special effects, is better than the newest retelling of the Verne story that was made in the late 1990's starring Treat Williams.One thing that bugs me though, is where is the DVD?

It was so icy that the feline was glad for the warm company of the cows. But just as the cat was growing comfortable the barn doors flew open to admit a man, a woman, and a donkey.Before long the animals heard a baby cry, and then other visitors arrived - shepherds, camels with their masters who were dressed like kings.

His ex-wife knows best that he is emotionally fragile and is afraid to marry him again knowing that his emotional baggage will destroy this relationship again.When he takes on the role of Othello, his fame explodes. Night after night he plays a doomed lover. But his psyche starts to crack. In desparate effort to separate his love for his ex-wife for his love of Desdemona on stage, he commits murder against a young woman, played wonderfully by Shelley Winters.One has to have a love for old movies to watch this one.

Nothing in the performances apart from the special effects is earth shaking, but the screenwriter did a magnificent job in creating a film that holds the attention and engages the interest.

You want to watch, not merely listen. A \\"making-of\\" documentary would've been nice, but this is from the relatively early days of concert videos. It holds up after many viewings.

There is an underlying theme, and it feels connected by one recording session, which didn't happen with XI, but that didn't hurt it, either. Netherregions is a surprisingly different album. You'll shed a tear on the quiet beauty and melody of \\"Turn Away,\\" and tap away to the catchy hooks of \\"Rebel Base.\\" Home 13 is brilliantly arranged pop/rock with added organ, cello, and trumpet instrumentation.

It started with the CD \\"Hachi\\" where the haunting piano work came close to Lesley Barber's \\"Mansfield Park\\". Next came \\"Get Low\\" where the music became more multi facet in style & interest. At last after reading the praiseworthy reviews on \\"Washington Square\\" I had to buy it. This 3rd CD is more classical orientated with opera arias & child choir inter-seeded. Though it does have good music it lacks the charm of \\"Hachi\\" & the multi styles of \\"Get Low\\". The Classical music seems to be rather in the \\"minimalist\\" style which at times does not fit the time period of \\"Washington Square\\". The song \\"Tu Chiami Una Vita\\" almost comes close in a section to a Phillip Glass vowel \\"Einstein On The Beach\\" which is at least a 100 years off from the time period of the story.

The books used in my computer architecture class always left me with a somewhat vague feeling on how things worked, plus they only barely mentioned the software issues. Similarly, my OS class never really got into MP subjects like memory ordering and the effect of caches on the OS. But this book brought everything into focus with clear explanations and good examples.The best way to describe this book is that it's part computer architecture book and part operating systems book. The operation of the hardware is presented in good detail, without going as far as worrying about gates and transistors. The software issues are also described in detail along with various solutions and trade-offs between them.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand the operation of caches and SMP systems from both the hardware and software point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read - Loads of Info","review":"Even tech managers who are working with UNIX will like the easy to read, simple to understand insight in this book.I promise - you will learn something you did not know."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets me going in the morning!","review":"as a fan of a variety of albums off the fabric series, including doc martin, james lavelle, and slam, i instantly purchased the adam freeland disc. working a 8:30 to 5 job i need a quick pick me up in the morning to go with my caffiene and this cd does it for me. its non-stop, constant, and far from boring. though i must say i jump half way through the cd usually because the first couple of tracks kinda drag but are still good. highlights are bassbin twins and adam freelands own tracks. having bought both the tectonics and on tour cds i would say this one is the best with tectonics coming in a close second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally an Album That Does Justice to Fabric's Fabriclive Nights","review":"If you're ever in London, and want a great night out, head to Fabric.

So I was very eager to watch the mini-series. I started it up and was disappointed immediately. I let it play for about 1/2 an hour before I had to make it go away. My imagination did a much better job at depicting this story than this mess. It was so horrible I nearly cried. My view may not be a popular one, but I think for this story to translate well to the \\"big screen\\", it would need to be done by someone like Tim Burton and have wonderful character actors like Johhny Depp as the Marquis, Ewan McGregor as Richard Mayhew, Keira Knightly as Door and Vincent D'Onofrio with Eddie Izzard as Mr. Vandemar and Mr. Croup respectively. This story deserves to be shown as magically as it is depicted on paper, and this mini-series just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a miss","review":"I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan, so it pains me to say it, but this film is one of the worst I've seen in recent history. The production values are absolutely nil, the acting isn't there at all, and there's just absolutely nothing here worth watching. I turned it off before I even got to London Below; the whole thing was simply unwatchable, and even Gaiman's commentary wasn't terribly interesting. Definitely give it a miss and pick up the book instead; Gaiman definitely improved upon his story when he wrote it up as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I watched it once all the way through. The 2nd time I tried thinking \\" maybe I'm just not getting it\\", \\"it must be intentional\\", \\"It couldn't have been as bad as I recall\\" It was. I had to stop it after 15 minutes. I've seen way better BBC productions (see \\"Gormenghast\\"). Neverwhere looks like someone took their camcorder and their D+D buddies out to make a movie. You can't really blame it on the budget, there are TV shows with better cinematography than this. The opening credits were fantastic! However, Islington remains it's only redeeming value. As a Neil Gaiman fan, I wanted to cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"No matter what anyone thinks of this title, no one will say that it is anywhere near as good as the book.

I'm quite sure I could shoot somethingof better quality in my backyard with an old school Hi-8 camera. This issimply horrible, and I'm sure others would argue with me to look pastthe quality - and look at the story. I have to be at least somewhatcaptivated in order to get in to a story though, so if that sound'slike you please don't buy this.There are good miniseries' that are shot on a pretty tight budget, andare still pretty good. Check outTin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)if you're interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hear me out...","review":"I loved the novel, sure. I give the novel five stars. But this is a movie we're reviewing here. So many people say you have to \\"look past\\" the acting, direction, production values, etc. But when you do that, all you're left with is a script. A book. Read the novel. The story is, in fact, amazing with great dialogue and characters. But as a movie, the production is quite poor. As for the great soundtrack, put in Brian Eno's album \\"The Drop\\" while you read the book and you will get the same effect. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once it sucks you in...","review":"After being a huge fan of Neil Gaiman's work in comics, I bought the VHS release of Neverwhere when it first came out... and to tell you the truth I got a bit disappointed at first. The production is typical of the BBC of those times.. almost like a theater production... but on television. The sets, costumes, acting and camerawork all feel pretty cheap.. but I'm not saying that in a negative way.. it does have it's charms, but at the same time it works a bit repelling for the story and does feel really strange, especially for a Gaiman fan, because it's like seeing a Gaiman comic on-stage-on-screen.. But this is where I get to my point: it IS a Neil Gaiman script and a very good one at that. And like the best of his comics it does suck you in and is very enjoyable... even though the cheap production does make it a bit more difficult than from what you've come to expect from his comics..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Everyone","review":"At first glance, this show doesn't have a lot going for it: the music is cheesy, the acting can be questionable at times, and there are some gaps in the storyline that go beyond suspension of disbelief.And yet, it still has a certain charm to it. It's delightfully low-budget, has a few gentle plot twists that hold your attention, and characters that are odd yet relatable. In short, it's just pleasant to watch.If you're looking for high production value and award-winning performances, look elsewhere. But if you're a fan of other BBC shows like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Doctor Who then you'll feel right at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neverwhere is a great story...","review":"As a Gaiman fan I had to get this... his writing is excellent in any medium he tries.

It's rather low budget and cheesy, with FX that are poor, but not quite poor enough to have a \\"Dr Who\\" kind of campy charm. The acting is slightly sub-par at best, and the plot progression is somewhat jerky.I do think Neverwhere could be made into an excellent screen feature with the right producer and sufficient money, but this effort just didn't quite make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nevermind Neverwhere","review":"It's bad theatre on video tape.

Unfortunately it looks like it was rushed to production with the goal of making a quick buck. This production is a text book case on how to ruin a good story with cheasy effects, poor direction, and horrible acting. It is also the poster child for ruined expectations. The director, producers, and to a lesser extent writers either had a very bad day or have fallen into the commonly held misconception that scifi or fantasy fans will watch anything regardless of quality.

Also, some movies were left off this list that I couldn't understand why. Movies such as \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"Rain Man\\", \\"Touch Of Evil\\" and \\"The Lost Weekend\\". Still, there are a few movies on the list that truly deserved to be there. I'm not talking about the usual fair such as \\"The Godfather\\", \\"Casablanca\\" or \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".

I personally consider The Exorcist to be the greatest movie ever made, period. What is Forrest Gump and Fargo doing on this list? Okay, I can see Fargo, maybe, but Forrest Gump?

So often is the case of Bonoff's career whose second album is a tad bit more fatigued than her first. Fans of her songwriting certainly will have a hard time warming up to Bonoff's vocals on this album. From the visionless \\"Trouble Again\\" to the clunky \\"Never Stop Her Heart\\" this album never picks up. Not recommended to anyone but die-hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate sophomore effort","review":"Listening to this tired and listless album is unlikely to evoke restless nights. Bonoff's dragging and needless \\"When You Walk Into the Room\\" cures insomnia and the droning \\"Only a Fool\\" is six minutes of pure boredom. Linda Ronstadt injected some life into \\"Trouble Again\\" ten years later, but Bonoff seems to be merely singing in her sleep. While a gifted songwriter, Bonoff is not the best interpreter of her songs. A better bet would be Jennifer Warnes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chess games removed!","review":"If you want the chess games, don't get this edition. I just picked this up and started reading the introduction. As the introduction quickly summed up the entirety of the biography, I skipped to its end. There I was abhorred to discover that the editor had the audacity to get rid of the 60 chess games that comprised the Part II of the original edition. He mentions that all of the games can be found on the internet anyhow. I purchased this book thinking that the games would be included. Sometimes it's nice to sit with a book without the computer open and to be able to get what you want.

On the other hand, he is quickly bored with the Activity Centers, such as Whales and Dolphins, Flight, and Mars.

The storyline is just great it moves quickly and the movie is really over before you even know it. It follows the experiences of a Navy navigator pilot (played by Owen Wilson). When his plane is shot down and his pilot murdered Burnett must do everything he can to stay alive. Although there are several very corny lines by Gene Hackman the movie has generally a very good plot. If you enjoy watching Owen Wilson this is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for weak minded....","review":"If you're about as sharp as a bowling ball this movie will probably make you want to join the US armed forces. That's also exactly why this movie is so fun. It wasn't even really a 'war' movie, in a sense, but more like an MTV video that happened to have soldiers, pilots, jets, tanks, etc.The plot is not very deep, but there are some good things under the surface, such as the main character's struggle to find a path, in more ways than one, including personal.The scenery in this movie is really great, and so is the sound design. Some of the extra features include different footage with different music, so it has a slightly different feel. I think stuff like that is great.

I guess it should have been obvious from the Owen Wilson casting... this is someone thats good in comedies, not war (or action) movies. this movie i guess isn't too bad if you want a cheesy Hollywood action movie, but please do not expect anything else. this movie is unrealistic and factually retarded through and through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Videohound vs. Me","review":"Although Videohound does not rate this film very high, I gave it a much higher rating.

What can you say about Mr. Hackman that hasn't been said before? Excellent.As always. This artist is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to Watch","review":"Behind Enemy's Line is one of the greatest patriotic movies. It's about a disillusioned Navy fighter pilot who got more than he bargained for after getting shot down. Unlike many other war movies which has a lot of shooting, and not much else, this one has great character development, awesome scenes, and a hilarious stunt the aircraft crew pulled off using a football. The super-slow motion shots are simply incredible, and the pictures are rich with numerous imageries, some containing messages for the audience, others complimenting the plot. You can watch this over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popcorn Movie, and then Some","review":"This movie introduces Owen Wilson in the world of action stars. It is a different role than what he's used to, that be a comedic role in such films as \\"Shanghai Noon\\", \\"Meet the Parents\\", \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" and \\"Zoolander\\" to name a few. In the end, he makes a great transition to this genre.This is basically a war thriller that keeps it pretty simple. He's an American pilot shot down in Eastern Europe, and he's trying to survive until help can get to him. The filming adds some Matrix-esque slowed down reality filming, and there's also some playing around with the audio, similar to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" after being shell-shocked.Other than that, the film is a straight-forward, entertaining film. There is also a minor performance by Gene Hackman which is nothing special, but he adds to the whole of the movie.All in all, this is an enjoyable movie that moves quickly and is always keeping your attention with action and drama...a good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun ride that is at least worth a rental","review":"Sure Behind Enemy Lines may not have the best acting seen in a movie, and it certainly doesn't have the greatest plot in the world, but it still does deliver what it intended to, and that is a good action film that is full of non-stop action and laden with special effects.

It is supposedly presenting a true story a la' Hollywood style glorifying our pilot shot down in Bosnia.

I love Gene Hackman but he looked fake and desperate in this movie. Owen Wilson is fun but not here while he is sliding on his behind shooting at the serbian tanks and heavy machine guns with his side arm getting the best of them.

Some naval F-14s carried film-loaded cameras in pods, but most of the imagery pin-pointing mass graves came from U-2s and satellites (and good coordination with French peacekeepers on the ground).

So I tried really hard to overlook the unlikely escapes, the bad lines, the ridiculous inability of the bad guys to hit Wilson with a hurricane of bullets. In the end, though, this is just a bad movie. I think the scene that sums it up is when Wilson is running through a minefield being chased by enemy soldiers.

The sound of explosions, jet engines, and bullets flying was amazing, and the music is more than just the standard heavy metal guitar solo: it actually has good music, music that I would want to listen to more than once. However, even though this was a great movie, it is a great movie ONCE. It's just one of those movies where it's the greatest thing in the world the first time, but makes you want to projectile vomit the second. But that's just my opinion. My advice is: go out and rent it first. If you think you might like to see it again, hey, go ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind Enemy lines (BEL)","review":"If you are looking for a realistic war movie then you are in the wrong place. But if you are looking for some escapist patriotic entertaiment then Behind Enemy Lines is may be what you are looking for. What made this movie more apealing was during the time of it's release, when many Americans just needed to be away from the real world for a couple hours.The story takes place in the Balkans where a routine recon flight is taking place. The pilot and his \\"Wizzo\\" (weapons intelligents officer) decided to investigate some activity in the no fly zone. To their horror they are shot down and now the Wizzo (Owen Wilson) must track through hostile territory to reach a safe zone where he can be rescued. The film does however belittle the American Allies (the French) which may irritate non-American viewers. But the film is alot of fun to watch. Rent it, but I would not recommend purchasing it unless if you are into action films"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!

If someone has it, then you may want to borrow it for free. It wasn't worth my money. I'm just glad I didn't waste my money watching this in the theater.

A lot of people didn't, I'm sure, but as an action movie, it does very well. The flight sequence was very well done, especially when they start firing the missiles. The action throughout the whole movie was great, despite probably being unrealistic, but I don't really care about that sort of thing in most movies, because..they're movies. Watch this for the action and the pretty well-done cinematography. Not the plot or character development. There's plenty of action, shooting, and violence for action buffs out there.

There are some good action sequences in this film, like the one where he's walking through a minefield but there are other parts of the film that are so heavy-handed they make me groan.

I regret I cannot rate it lower than 1 star.I kept hoping the bad guys would kill the aviator and put me out of my misery watching this turkey. Cinematography, lighting and locations were excellent, but the plot was absurd and the script went from one bizzare farce ( like being able to hear bullets coming when you are the target ) to another ( like the bad guys killing the pilot instead of using him as a hostage ). Then there was the memorable scene where the bad guys were standing within 4 feet of the hero in a flat muddy area, but could not find him. Perhaps the worst was the hero hiding under snow / ice for 15 min and jumping out just at the right moment to off the main bad guy. Maybe our boy had a periscope - that would be no more improbable than the rest of this waste of film. Gene Hackman usually indicates a worth-the-money movie.

I would have been happier with an expensive cup of coffee.Disgust would be the description on what a horrible actress Michelle Williams was. This role was not for her. If people think it was, then she needed to practice/rehearse it better.

The three main characters (loose woman, sleazy reporter, policeman) are all worthless human beings - pure anti-heroes, that we are supposed to feel empathy for. Right? Wrong! What's more I found much of the film disorientating and confusing. I've heard the book is better (well, it can't be worse) which is why I think the movie was so confusing in parts - I mean, is the son there or not? It is a dream or are we in the woman's head? Yeah, I get the message - terrorism is nasty and it ruins lives, but terrorists are also people with thoughts and motivations.

It gives a unique and well-grounded approach to becoming a vegetarian or shaping up your diet if you're already vegetarian. It does say that eating dairy can be helpful, which there is some controversy on, but even many experts who are anti-dairy object to milk products mainly because they are packed with hormones, pasteurized, and homogenized. When dairy is pure, organic, and fresh it's a good source of nutrition when used properly and in moderation. Also, the book says you should eat dairy OR fish as a supplement to a vegan diet, which makes sense when you look at the traditional diets of native cultures around the world - I don't know of any that are purely vegan. Rudolph Ballentine seems to be a very wise author with a lot of grounded perspective on holistic nutrition."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor guide for those who cannot digest milk","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of my homeopath, who had worked under Rudolph Ballentine.

We had a good way to go holding the dog in the backpack to get home.The nylon failed right at the point where the upper and lower straps adjust. We did not use this for a long time and it was kept indoors and it was not exposed to any chemicals. It was not carrying too much weight-rated for up to 16 and at other sellers rated to 20 lbs.--our dog was 15 lbs.

If you are already seriously into Cajun music, then don't hesitate, this compilation is for you.

The rough section on the handgrip is a very nice upgrade. The S2 also seems a little less heavier than the S1.I bought the S1 here at Amazon as a gift for someone, but it was defective. Amazon promised a full refund, but after I shipped it back, they went back on their word. The partial refund I have yet to see is a rip-off. So, I bought this S2 model from a local camera store and love it, but I don't recommend buying expensive items from Amazon if you're concerned about customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay.

I took it to my daughters cheer competition and every time I turn around it said to change the batteries and then it would shut off on me. I have taken a total of 85 pictures on 4 sets of batteries. I missed so many good shots because I spent so much time changing batteries at the most inconvenient times. The manual says I should be get 130 pictures on 1 set of AA batteries.

Once I left it in the back seat and a little later made a hard stop, which sent it flying. It somehow hit a hard corner and dented the frame on the side of the lens ... still working.The lcd screen is pretty nice, love how you can extracted and twisted to fit your given situation when taking pics.I had an old canon with a longer strap ... well, I replaced the one on the S2 with it because it was longer ... just personal pref.Have fun with this toy ... just remember it will be hefty compared to pocket cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it...","review":"Read all the great reviews and wanted a mega zoom with advanced features for me and point and shoot capability for the little lady... well, the IS feature doesn't work too well, at leats on \\"auto\\" which made this camera a no go for us. Any picture my wife took on auto came out blurry (yes, even with a flash etc etc). The viewfinder and the lcd screen were both poor (hard to look through without pressing your face against the screen in the first case and way too small in the latter case). Returned it and went with the Fuji s6000 which has been great thus far. The flash on the fuji can be enabled or disabled and pops up automatically if enabled (as opposed to most of the super zooms that have to be manually raised) - again this feature was necessary for the point and shoot auto quick pics of the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto Focus Stinks!","review":"After reading the rave reviews, I was sorely disappointed when I tried out the camera and found most of the pictures were out of focus. I tried it in Auto, Portrait, and Landscape modes. I also tried to set the ISO manually to 400. Most of the pictures of my kids were blurry. I even tried one where my child was sitting down playing, I was sitting with the camera resting on my knee--still not clear. The shots were much better with a flash, but those took SEVERAL seconds to focus. When my kids were moving, it took even longer to focus.I then reread the reviews from worst to best and found others with similar experiences, even with the Canon Digital Rebel XT, which I was seriously considering. Perhaps some of us received a batch of Monday morning products, because most people seem to have excellent results.

I used it a number of years and it was indeed an excellent camera until it developed what is known as problem code E18. The problem is a break-down in the lens mechanism: In the beginning the lens will go out with difficulty and will retract with even more difficulty. Eventually the lens will not retract at all; it stays out permanently and the camera becomes unusable. The cost of repair is prohibitive and there is no assurance that the problem will not recur after the camera is repaired. Canon will not acknowledge that there is such a problem as code E18 but I went to Google and found out that, despite Canon's denials, the problem is prevalent on quite a few of their camera models and there are too many complaints on file to ignore them.For the time being it is best to refrain from buying any Canon camera until they admit that there is a problem and correct it."},{"rating":"2","title":"canon powershot S2 IS 5MP digital camara","review":"The product is good.

When using the camera it appears that the iris or shutter gets stuck closed and no image appears on the LCD screen. The first failure occurred just before the 1 year warranty period was over so was covered under the warrany, but the camera failed again recently and Canon wants $129 to repair it or $190 to upgrade to an S3. The S3 seems to suffer from the same problem, so that's not a very good option.

Let me tell you that I had to delete approximately 40% of the photos taken --- reason: blurry/out of focus. I'm experienced with point and shoot digital cameras and I thought the zoom feature would be a great plus for both events. Instead it's been nothing but pure frustation. I even had two of my colleagues who could be classified as amature professional photographers \\"play\\" with (test)the camera and I guess I should be happy that half of their pictures also came out blurry (so it's not totally \\"me\\").

However, at zoom above 9X the camera MUST be completely still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera to Own","review":"If your in the market for a digital.

What I got was a book that dragged on and on. I felt the writing was extremely choppy which was very frustrating (I tend to become a slow reader when the writing is this way... when it is well written, like I am able to fly through a book). I didn't feel the characters were that interesting or exciting... Annabelle, the main character, seemed like a nice sweet working mom, but I really couldn't feel passionate about her because the author just didn't create that for me.And then there's the ending... I really don't think it could have been any cornier... something about someone being allergic to dogs... Someone sneazing near a dog? Oh, please! No offense, but anyone who read and loved this book must never have read a well written, well thought out mystery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending failed...","review":"This could be a really great suspense novel given the topic and newsroom setting. However, like another reviewer mentioned, there were way too many characters (suspects, of course) to keep up with and almost every page is its own chapter. It feels like a lot of stopping and starting as you read, keeping transitions from being smooth. In addition, which I am starting to see a definite trend when it comes to MJC's novels, she wraps them up way too quickly. There was nothing (no hints, real clues, etc.) to lead the reader to discover the \\"bad guy\\" on his own. We found out whodunit when MJC gave us an almost laughable clue in the last few pages of the book.For the reader that prefers mystery stories with solid structure, a steady stream of real clues and a sensible, smart ending, I'd go elsewhere for fulfillment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longear Rookie","review":"My husband and I just purchased our first pair of mules.

It was written in a way that the \\"rookie\\" mule owner could relate while still teaching the veteran owner.(I bought a copy for our friends from whom we had bought the mules and they loved it.)

When Larry asked what the difference is between religion and spiritually, Deepak replied, \\"Religion is for those who are afraid of going to hell. Spiritually is for those who have already been there.\\" The power behind Deepaks work and his books has always come from his directness and his refusal to be \\"politically correct.\\" He continues that in this new book, which is not only filled with exceptionally well-written ideas about our quest to connect with the spiritual and what we call God, but also callings us to dig deeper than we are normally comfortable doing. Also, don't miss Deepak's no-holds-barred interview in Nina L.

His model for understanding spiritual evolution is very clear, and meshes well with everything I have studied and experienced and found true for myself. Me: raised in the Bible Belt, immersed the Old testament, flung to the far reaches of radical psychiatry and finding brilliance in parts of A Course in Miracles, and returning to my roots to excavate mystical Christianity from the distortions handed to me as a Baptist child. Those on the trip to freedom might want to give this volume a slow and thoughtful read; there's a lot to consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to know Depak Chopra's intentions?","review":"When I bought and started to read this book I was expecting to find out some new paths in getting closer to GOD but after I have read the first hundred pages I found out that Chopra haswritten more about India/ns and their methods of healing than about GOD.Each one of us is different and as the saying goes \\"One man's garbage is another ones treasure\\" but my one and only opinion regarding this book is :\\"This book has a lot of nothing on almost everything and hell noI couldn't waste my precious time on a book like this\\". Mind youthe Seven Spiritual Laws book was amazing just as if it was written by someone else! Hoping that mr.Chopra has made a lot of money I would like him to write books that can be read and appreciated by his readers.As I said I am just sharing my opinion so I am sorry if I amoffending someone else's views regarding this book. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mechnical method for idiots!","review":"This book presents a mechnical method for knowing GOD to the idiots.

You can even smell the odor of money from this book and his web site. Forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here. Should be titled \\"Be your own god\\"","review":"This is yet another would-be guru reinventing spirituality and presenting it as new. His arguements are verbose, yet without a foundation or logical progression. Rather, he just presents his ideas where he (we) can be our own gods. It's a vacant waste of paper and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An impersonal god who cares little about you and your life","review":"I truly cannot understand the appeal of a god that is an impersonal 'force'. For example, in relationship to 'who is god?'..........god is the infinite, unbounded, eternal intelligence that constantly projects itself as the Universe--through the creation of space, time, matter and infinite energy.Listen to that. god is simply the universe. The universe doesn't care about you. The universe is as personal as your shoes.If God exists, He is bigger than that. He is separate from the universe. He is distinct, and He is personal. If there can be any love from God, He has to have a will, emotion, and conscience.Deepak's god is too small. I might as well have a relationship with the impersonal, invisible, and ever-present force of electricity...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A priest's attempt at physics","review":"The physical laws that Chopra tries to use in explaining the meta-physical world comes to this physics major as an utter disgust! Not to mention the heavy biblical influence throughout the book, making it feels like reading the bible. This book insults the intelligence of its reader and discourages criticalness and introspection. Even Krishnamurti's abstract discussions are palatable compared to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I really wanted to like this, but I found it tedious and I am ashamed to say that I couldn't even stick with it for long enough to finish it - I got through most of it, but just couldn't endure to the end of it - I was so disappointed as I really like Chopra and wanted to like this book !"},{"rating":"2","title":"When you're ready for it","review":"It was no surprise to see the range of review ratings on this book. There are certain books one must be very careful to recommend to others, such as Ken Wilbur's A Brief History of Everything. Readers must be at a certain point in their own \\"evolution\\" before the book makes sense--\\"speaks to them\\" as another review said. How To Know God is one of those books.If you've spent time on your own spiritual evolution and can look back to a time when you believed much differently than you do today, this book may very well add clarity to your understanding of where you've been and where you're going. It did for me. I was able to \\"place\\" myself very clearly on the timeline of such evolution, so for me the book rates five stars.If your beliefs are strongly \\"religious\\" rather than spiritual; if you find it necessary to \\"defend\\" your religious position; or if you consider anything that can't be explained by science to be a hoax, this book is definitely not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"To add to the many excellent reviews of this book already listed, I would recommend the tape as well. Chopra narrates. It's great to here him tell the story. This book has so many profound statements. I found myself wanting to write them down for future reference. It is an inspriration."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most definitive book on experiencing God","review":"I have read most of Mr. Chopra's books. All have been excellent. However, he has outdone himself now. This is truly the best book I have ever read, the most inspiring and a must read for anyone on the spiritual path. It answers so many questions, and makes sense out of life. What more could one want. Mr. Chopra I suspect you are on your way to Sainthood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Path to Love","review":"I am thankful that Deepak has taken the time to share his insights with us. I feel that many of his ideas about intuition and seeking God within, are needed for our survival. More than anything, the book gives faith and hope to the reader that we can move mountains. Deepak's ideas are very useful for daily life and spirtitual development. Tonight, I had difficulty feeding my 10 month old son, only to step outside and see inspiration eight feet from my door...a robin feeding her 6 days old babies. A connection that would have gone unnoticed, prior to my experience with How To Know God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potentially Life Changing","review":"I am excited and inspired.

After reading most of the reviews here, I've decided that Fritjof Capra probably said whatever is in \\"How to Know God\\" in a much more succinct and convincing manner.Thank you to everyone who reviewed this book; for those who enjoyed it, if you are of a scientific bent you will enjoy \\"The Tao of Physics\\" as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fake!","review":"This book does not deal with the question of the Divine but with the description of several common images of God - not with God Himself. The style is confusing and confused, repeating over and over a hardly helpful classification of how God can be perceived in the human mind. No help at all to unveil all this (mis-)conceptions of God we human beings carry with us but almost reinforcing them by describing them again and again! Stones instead of bread and disgusting talkative...How is it possible that this man with such a shallow \\"teaching\\" could become the spiritual guide of so many people in the US and abroad?There are deep, clear and wonderful guides on the journey to unification with the ONE - people who do \\"know\\"!There is no \\"knowledge\\" in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopra a real incubus and charlatan.","review":"In Koontz recent book called \\"False Memory\\" the sinsister character named \\"Dr Mark Ahriman is so similer to D.

Anyone who writes a \\"How To\\" book about God must consider him/herself to have some inside track to the divine that all of us heathens have failed to notice or study-up on. Dr Chopra doesn't have any more awareness or special insight into God than the rest of us have. He simply writes and talks alot about it but at the end of the day what are we really left with but someone who's read alot of books on physics and religion and blurred them together into a big bad quantum soup of \\"my ideas are better than your ideas 'cause I read alot and you... well you people deserve to hear my viewpoint 'cause I know better\\". How can anyone write a \\"How to\\" book on God? Better study-up fellow humans and get your soul cleaned up for the big bad day at the end of the rainbow.

It espoused the point of view that enlightenment was meant only for intellectually brilliant people who could understand every word written by Dr. God. What are the ordinary folks in the world supposed to do? Are their brains wired differently? Are they meant to lead lives without being enlightened? Do they not respond well to enlightened brain farts? To pass off an incorrect commercial interpretation of the Hindu Vedas tells me that the Dr. should study his own scripture in greater detail. Hinduism does not raise only the question \\"Who is God?\\" but also the more important question \\"Who is the Knower?\\" Perhaps that will be the title of a sequel. Simple people like me who cannot digest heavy quantum soup find books like \\"Conversations with God\\" and \\"Anita's Legacy\\" more enjoyable and less condescending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Chopra Is The Greatest","review":"Kudos to [those] who have rightly hailed this latest masterpiece of Dr. Chopra's. The good Doctor has been a leader in bringing Eastern ideas on health to skeptical Western audiences.In this book, he accomplishes something vastly more ambitious. With the clarity that distinguishes all of his work, he explains how anyone may come to know the Almighty. His approach is non-denominational throughout, so that all may benefit, be he Jew, Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist.I would recommend this book for anyone with an interest in the topic. It will make a believer out of you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is shame on me","review":"I ordered this to replace my copy that was borrowed and never returned. It's my fault for not reading the fine print and noticing that the book's size was only a few inches, and abridged.The original book is one of the best I have ever read, and I'm pretty open on this subject so I read a lot...but I can't seem to find a use for this tiny little thing.If you're looking for a minature, abridged copy of the original, go for it.

I must admit I chose not to complete the reading. Usually I pass books on to others when I finish, but I felt that the act of throwing this book into the trash was more important.

If this is the case, it is quite sad, because India has some genuine spiritual giants whose sincerity could never be questioned i.e. ramakrishna, ramana maharshi etc. These individuals words have the ring of truth, and they didn't have a medical clinic on the side charging obscene amounts of money for an 'ayurvedic massage' etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try but far away from reality.","review":"Dr. Chopra tried to show the face of God but I think he tried to combine concepts of different religions and he failed.

His explanation is way beyond from the concept of many Islamic sects.

How does Chopra know it's the real God? What qualifies Chopra to present this as God and as the way to know God? In this book, Chopra basically presents an esoteric gnosticism bathed in layers of fuzzy mysticism. His God \\"is in the evil as much as in the good.\\" He also says that evil and good are swallowed up in God eventually. This means that evil and good are not absolute, are a part of each other and are part of God. This is a type of occult worldview and readers should know what they are imbibing. This is not an absolutely good or perfect God, but a sort of neutral power, the same as what we find in the occult. This book is actually how not to know God, or maybe how to know a counterfeit God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake up!","review":"Deepak Chopra has some good ideas - however, they are that - ideas. This book is a grand way for him to make more money saying the same thing he's already said in his other books. I wonder if he has studied the Bible and the life of Christ? This book fits in with all the new ageism that deceives our world. We are not GOD. We can create things, but not the heavens, nor the earth, nor the breath of life. I look forward to Deepak Chopra gaining \\"true\\" insight from God, through his holy spirit. Chopra just helps keep lost souls in bondage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Year's Gift to oneself and all....","review":"A New Year's Gift to oneself and all.......No one could have written this book except someone from within the \\"virtual domain,\\" and Dr. Chopra has most certainly given us all the opportunity to merge our religious and spiritual beliefs and questions into a single understanding of God. Years of study alone could not give such joy, such hope, and such promise at a time when so many of us are searching to \\"find\\" God. He is truly a great Master here to guide many of us through his spiritual gift of writing.Also recommended: Awakening by Ram Dass and Kryon Books and Marianne Williamson (any) \\"Return to Love.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This book is an amazing explanation of how we as human beings percieve God, and it gives brilliant insights on how to get in closer contact to the true essance of God. I was skeptical of reading this book partly due to the title. \\"How does Mr. Chopra know how to know God!\\" I thought. But I was amazed how practicle this book was. Anyone who is serious about knowing the true nature of God should get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I'm a huge fan of Jarrett's standards trio work, his classical/baroque stuff, and, less consistently, his solo improvisational concerts. The 1994 Box Set of the trio's Blue Note dates and his rendering of Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues are \\"desert island\\" discs. But I don't get it when great artists like Jarrett (and Pat Metheny, to cite another example) sometimes release this dissonant, anti-melody stuff. Is it hard to play this? Probably. I don't know since I'm not an accomplished musician. But it sure isn't very pleasant to listen to. Isn't that, at bottom, what music is supposed to be? Pleasing to listen to? It seems that the musicians themselves comprise the biggest group of people who enjoy this stuff. Maybe it is fun to play it; who knows. But I'll be selling this one used soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I too feel that this CD is not the best work that Keith has ever done with his trio.The CD sound is excellent - but the music just isn't that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning -- Dissonance Ahead","review":"Keith Jarrett's music is (usually) a gift to the world. Is there anyone else whose head and fingers seem as directly sourced to the essence of what music is and why humans like it? Two of my favorite pieces of recorded music are by Jarrett: Live at the Blue Note box set, and Shostakovich's Preludes & Fugues Op. 87 -- both simply ethereal works. But Inside Out is, well, awful. No discernable melodies. Unpleasant dissonance reigns. You know, Pat Metheny -- who I similarly think is as close to the muse as Jarrett -- does this stuff occasionally too. Maybe it's me. I'm not an accomplished musician. Accomplished musicians seems to rave about each other when they do this atonal stuff. To me, it's annoying noise. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keith Jarring","review":"It's probably the shock that comes from high expectations around Jarrett and this trio. Another reviewer, and non-musician, pointed out that musicians often find this improv fascinating. But if you're less \\"sophisticated\\" musically and a fan of Tokyo '96,Live at Blue Note, Still Live or any of Jarrett's solo work, you better find one of those music stores where you can scan the barcode and listen first."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it,","review":"If you follow Keith Jarrett, I don't really understand at how this album could be a dissapointment, or 'unexpected'. I've spent weeks straight with this album, and it's beautiful. You can hear how completely involved each player is in the direction and expression of the music, it goes where it wants to and you can hear that. It's collective freedom. I wont get started about the dejohnette intro to Inside Out, I'd pay the price of this cd just for the title track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This book is not well organized and the info is confusing...having it on a Kindle Fire probably makes it worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"Astrology for the Soul is informative and useful.

I found the information to be written in a clear concise way and very accurate. The author devotes approximately 40 pages to each north node placement, identified in each of the astrological signs. There is a lot of rich information for one to associate with, digest and act on. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ACCURATE!","review":"I found that her assessment of the signs were extremely accurate for myself and everyone I know.

This book is enlightening on many levels and gives you a unique perspective on your soul's pattern that really helps everything make sense.Best of all, you don't even need to know how to read charts to understand this book. All the North Node placements are in a table in the front of the book. And if you do read charts, you can look up the Node's house placement by house as well as by sign, for more information. This gives you an idea of the soul's direction in the chart, and which energies benefit the person on this level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful book!","review":"I have been interested in astrology all my life, and have recently begun in-depth study. As part of my journey in knowledge, I found I wanted to know a lot more about the North Node, and the message and lessons it imparts. Jan Spiller's book is giving me great guidance in this area. I highly recommend it to any astrological student, but especially anyone wanting to learn about the North Node."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to know about your Self","review":"Hello all,I found this book excellent.

When I first learned my rising and moon signs years ago from knowing my time of birth, it opened all kinds of doors. This book takes it a step further! Jan Spiller in this book answered many, many, many Q's that I had about myself including the frustrations. NOW, I understand why I've been doing some of the self defeating behavior that's been holding me back from my desires and dreams.

I discovered it by intuition and have not regeretted buying it! I feel as if a piece of heaven has fallen to earth in the form of this book, it really is such a treasure. Jan says the North node makes the rest of your natal chart come alive, and it's so true. It's like reading about yourself; so many of her little gems of insight are things I have felt before about myself but hadn't yet properly crystallised. A wonderful guide to how to get the best from yourself and your life, I am very thankful to Jan Spiller for having written this inspiring, uplifting work. I wonder how to contact her....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is incomplete. I have been an astrologer over 20-yrs.","review":"A client of mine sent me this book, and while the writing is good, the text is incomplete. For example, I have a North Node Virgo, in my 9th house, conjunct my Midheaven, so naturally I would comment. Jan does not talk about the South Node, and you can't have the North Node without it, nor does she talk about which house applies, and everyone has their nodes in a different house. Also, the \\"soul\\" according to Rex Bills rulership book is ruled by Pluto and the 8th house. Jeff Green can attest to that. Years ago, Martin Schulman wrote THE MOON'S NODES AND REINCARNATION and explained it all in a 127- page skinny book that tells it like it is. I am reading all these wonderful things about the author, but am not convinced that she truly knows what she is talking about. I've been an astrologer for over 20-yrs.

While the book goes into detail, I found most of the traits described did not fit my personality. The book while well written, did nothing for me. It did not hold my attention.

The biggest problem I had with this CD is that it cost twice as much as the other Flip Wilson CD offered by Amazon, \\"Flip Wilson: Funny and Live at the Village Gate,\\" which is an exact copy of this one. The only difference is that the two CDs have different covers. This is particulary disappointing since Amazon offers both as a package deal, suggesting that they contain different routines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for Everyone","review":"I teach a class of 5th and 6th graders. This book was brought to my attention by one of my students. I used it as a read aloud to the class. It was a great Christmas story to send them off to their winter vacation. While there were several Christian references and examples, they were not overbearing to distract from the story's use in a public school. The story was predictible, but it has several lessons including forgiveness, giving to others, kindness, etc. It makes for a good famiy/school tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Hysterical Foolishness for the Gullible","review":"These are the same arguments that have been around to demonize anything from the Wizard of Oz to Superman cartoon.

So, you have to protect them from anything with that wicked imagination in it.Given that the classical stories of Ali Baba and the Seven Thieves, Wizard of Oz, or Sinbad, or Cinderella have the exact same wonderful \\"what if\\" imaginative world of make believe principles; why not ban all children's books except those that are bible stories?

Someone who is into Animal Magick could use similar powers to talk to ANY animal, not just SNAKES! These people are usually called Animal-Whisperers!

Monaco would have been an excellent looking girl instead of (compared to some of the others) a rather plain to above average Hahn and the positively stupid vignette they shot her in.

The only complaint about this album is how short it actually is. However, this is to be expected because if all of the music in the film were used, it would simply be the same thing over and over again, and therefore, to keep the album interesting from start to finish, the producers kept it short. (just a theory)That being the case, this is an exciting, thoughtful, and quite enjoyable score to listen to. There are not a large number of themes on the album, but the thematic material that is there is top notch. The main theme, which comes out in many tracks is intoxicating to the point of wanting to listen to the soundtrack many times in a row. This combined with some well done tender moments and gripping action sequences makes this score soundtrack a lot of fun to listen to, even if you did not like the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect, but....","review":"I love this soundtrack.

The only drawback is the small sized bags, I get several packages of bags at a time. This vacuum has the ability to turn off the roller brush, which makes it easily vacuum hard surfaces without the brush spitting the dirt back out. I HIGHLY recommend this product.

Meaning there are usually about two or three really powerful songs and the rest could of been left off. This is definetly what it's like with this album, or 'singles' collection or whatever you want to call it. \\"Summer\\", \\"Ithica 27/9\\" and \\"Helicon 1\\" are all excellent tracks, and that's about it, the rest is pretty much filler. Whenever I put the CD in the player I found myself always skipping tracks to get to those three tracks mentioned. If you can justify buying this for those songs then go for it, but if you want an album that is gonna blow you away song by song, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime noise, ambient melody","review":"In my view if only one Mogwai disc graces your collection this arguably should be it. Unlike many albums that are immediately likable but fade quickly, something about Ten Rapid endures and gains strength with every listen. Maybe it's the haunting melodies that swim gracefully through crashing waves of noise, or the dynamic shadings that go from meloncholic whispers to ripping chaos and then settle again into deep blue washes of calm. This disc has managed to just beat Mogwai's Young Team to the CD player almost every time on the strength of pieces like \\"Tuner\\", where the simple chord changes deliver goosebumps, and \\"End\\", where the deeply beautiful theme of \\"Helicon 2\\" is reworked into a masterpiece of subtle profundity. Definitely a \\"must have\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of my favorite songs","review":"The whole CD is definitely nice, but I find myself skipping over 'Angles v. Aliens' 'I Am Batman' and 'Tuner' most of the time. Fine songs, but not the best. I could (and have) listen(ed) to 'Helicon 2' for hours. 'Summer' is excellent, much better than the remix on Young Team. 'Helicon 1' is very good, if a little forced, always putting me in the mind of the home of the muses. 'Ithaca' gets pretty heavy in a good way, a little different from any other Mogwai I've heard. 'A Place for Parks' is pleasant and just disoncerting enough to warrant repeat listenings. 'End' is damn cool.I wouldn't recommend this as an intro to Mogwai- Young Team or Government Commissions would be better, I think. But the Helicons, Ithaca, End, and Summer are high up on my short list of favorite songs. Anyone who likes other Mogwai would almost surely not regret having bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The young team almost get it perfect...","review":"And so here are Mogwai. A scottish band with a totally original style, no-one can decide weather they are rock or dance, but originality is not always good. These guys pull it off, and this is an album which compliments everyone's collection. In particular check out the brilliant mix of Summer... I can not decide if it is better than the original version (as seen on Young Team). In the end, if you have Young Team and like it then definately buy this. If you do not have Young Team, then buy it first.Dee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie But A Goodie","review":"I LOVED this video as a child and plan on sharing it with my children...my only complaint has nothing to do with the video.

Throw in cameo appearances by John Cusack and Brad Pitt and you've got a hilarious nostalgia trip.

It was fun and a real eye opener. You are given a word. You have a handful of cards with images on them (the same images your partner has). You select images that match what you feel the word means. For example, if the word is \\"love\\" you might pick cards depicting these things: couple, children, chocolate, etc. You put them in order of 1st choice, 2nd choice, etc.For each image you match with your partner's choices, you get points.

I always liked both versions of The Commodores, and the post-Lionel Richie years had a lot to offer, particularly in \\"Nightshift,\\" \\"United\\" and \\"Rock Solid.\\" While this is not quite as good as those releases, it still has many fine moments. The program is divided into two equal halves. The first five songs are uptempo, and included is an interesting update of \\"Brick House,\\" while the last five songs are more mellow. I like this \\"Cool Side\\" as it's referred to on the back inlay card better, and the standout track here is \\"Everything Reminds Me Of You.\\" This is out of print but still fairly easy to find online, and it's ususally affordable, so if you're a die-hard fan, collector or completist, it's worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival doesn't have to be complicated","review":"Incoming and first year law students are somewhat easy prey for most authors that discuss how to get those stellar grades and be first in line for law review. Law school doesn't have to be that complicated and as such Valoir & Mixon pare the fluff of law school excellence down to the simple things that go a long way. Most of it is pretty straight forward such as when presented with a certain rule of law, list the elements and the exceptions. Once you've mastered that, then all it takes come exam time is to apply the rule (& its exceptions) to the fact at hand. Another reviewer mentioned that it isn't rocket science. It doesn't have to be. Legal study is very logical and can be quite formulaic. Grasp that and you're already light years ahed. Valoir shows you how and then some. A breezy read as well that most law students could finish over lunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Shorts","review":"These short films are great. Another collection of shorts in comparison is \\"Boys in Love\\". However, \\"Boys' Life\\" is much better for many reasons. First, the acting is much better.

Now I'm not saying that I want to see hardcore anything, but I would like to see the two actually together without fear from the critics.

It does not break down each step. They show you each consecutive move but if you're a novice dancer it would be very difficult to pick up the dances/moves correctly.

Each routine is taught so fast it requires the viewer to stop and rewind frequently. Bottom line: if you want to learn to hip hop, find a different video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and challenging","review":"I like that this video had so much variety, like 8 different routines from different dancers were presented and that was cool.

The wish is the better of the two, but considering snake girl is plain awful that's not saying much. Some great visuals wasted here. Also the stories are too long.

Ahh, not to be. I found all of the characters lacking in development, whiny, and just not likable at all, with the exception of Charlotte. The description of the Cornish countryside wasn~t up to par with The Empty House and Coming Home, though nothing can ever compare to Coming Home. I had a hard time visualizing Phoebes house and her garden. I didn~t even get a full picture of Lily Tonkins.

Halle Berry and Bruce Willis have shamed the art of cinema. The casting is a weak spot and a real problem. The acting just plain ridiculous, the performances were tired and forced. The story is intricate and well thought out but really what is the point. So many clues are forced on you and you can't really understand how a movie with two A-list actors could be this bad. Miles the so called \\"Hero\\" so to speak is just as sleazy and deranged as the other characters.

Dirt is usually of sexual kind where the middle aged men in crisis are attracted to their male interns, or young and attractive female employees. What is unclear is the passion that reporter (Halle Berry) has for her work. When one story goes sour, she quickly picks up another one even though she has apparently quit her job as a journalist? That premise alone makes no sense. She ends up temping in the ad agency where the boss (Bruce Willis) is married to a woman who has family money that keeps him tied to her in marriage. However, his wondering eyes are on every attractive woman working in the office and when that is not enough he is online in adult chat rooms.

The plot was all over the place, confusing me at every turn. To make things worse I felt cheated by the ridiculous \\"twist\\" at the end. Viewers who invest their time and money deserve much better that this cheap and trashy finale.The only question I have is why would Berry and Willis agree to do this mess?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise","review":"I was very surprised that I really enjoyed this movie, don't ask why, I just was, anyway it was very good, definitely one for the movie volt, to be watched over and over again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and disappointing","review":"What in the world has happened to Halle Berry? Can't she act any more? Judging from this movie I'd say: No - she can't... And Bruce Willis is ... well, he's Bruce Willis. And why does she have to participate in a mediocre thriller like this one? Because it is very mediocre. The beginning is quite promising, and I was ready for a nice, clean thriller. But what followed was like a bad version of some Michael Crichton novel. Perfect Stranger lacked meaning, taste, and creativity and is just another one of those \\"movies with a twist.\\" FYI: The movie was a long advertisement with way too much product placement.Then they must have chosen the worst ending. The film is not creative, not inventive, implausible, sometimes ridiculous. No, it's not a disaster. But a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed....","review":"Not nearly the movie I thought it was going to be. It seemed to me a big foiled mess that the writer's tried to make sense of in the end but it just didn't wash. Totally unbelievable and down right messy film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what to say ;-l","review":"I have a theory that you can tell how bad a movie is going to be, based on the trailers that come before it. When I saw some bad trailers at the beginning of this dvd, I knew I was in for a bad movie and I was right. To be honest, it's hard for me to write this review because I don't get what the movie was about at all. Not only could I not follow it, I wasn't actually interested in following it even if I could. I normally love Bruce Willis and Halle Berry and when I knew that Gary Dourdan was in it too, I really wanted to watch this, but none of these actors could change the fact that this is a weak plotted movie that doesn't thrill or excite. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't bought this. I wouldn't even tell my friends to watch it on free to air tv.I'm sorry to say that I thought this movie sucks. Right from the start and even to the 'thrilling and twisting' end, I couldn't have disliked a movie more."},{"rating":"1","title":"halle,please,for the love of GOD...........","review":"GET A NEW AGENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!while her acting wasnt deplorable,the movie was a perfectly convoluted mess.so much to say about a movie with absolutely nothing to say leaves me at a loss........this is only for those who are eager to see halle regardless of the turd shes in.how long before halle,j-lo and sandra bullochs star in the same movie ?!?!?!?!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you have any idea what the words awful filmmaking mean?!","review":"Perfect Stranger is quite possibly the worst movie of 2007. It is so terrible that it makes Bratz look like an Oscar winner. One could barely classify the acting in this film as acting. Halle Berry proves once again that, outside of her Oscar performance, she is as talented as a paper towel. Bruce Willis also provides some laughable delivery of lines; mostly, he looks like he wants to rape someone or punch them in the face. What a joke. The twist ending is so unbelivably lame, too. Hell, this movie is such tripe I barely feel like devoting time to this review anymore. Just take my advice and don't bother. Although, it IS on Blu-ray and might look rather decent in 1080p. But I'm sure there are much better reference disks out there without bad hairpieces and lame acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRBILE MOVIE!! Very bad!!","review":"I have to say...this movie is the worst movie that I have seen so far this year!!!Bruce Willis was okay in it but Halle Berry was the serial killer??? Everything..EVERYTHING pointed to Bruce Willis as the murderer and then Halle's friend \\"finally\\" figures out that it was her that was killing everyone because she had buried her dad several years ago. STUPID MOVIE!!I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Bruce who?","review":"After watching the movie, you dislike every character. Really a very difficult movie to get through, even though the producers try to entice you with provocative shots of Berry and the hope of seeing Bruce Willis, whose total on-screen time amounts to a cameo.To Berry: really stupid hatTo Ribisi: great potential wasted hereTo Bruce: dissapionted you showed up in this oneTo potential audience: boring, dizzy, with a dash of anti-America messages"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK THRILLER SAVED BY A SURPRISE ENDING! 2 1/2 STARS!","review":"'Perfect Stranger' starts out promising, but quickly begins to meander and become routine. This isn't helped by the lackluster performances by Berry, Willis and Ribisi who I usually love to watch. The film has a good start and a good ending which makes it watch-able, but in the middle there is too much filler and not enough meat! I rated it 2 1/2 stars 2 for the film and another 1/2 for a good ending. Rent it.....don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How far would you go to keep this movie from being released?","review":"I was severely disappointed of this advance screening of the new Halle Berry-Bruce Willis vehicle. In trying too hard to have a twisted plot, the writers neglected to give us admirable characters. There is so much pin-pointing and flip-flopping, that Perfect Stranger becomes irrelevant as a movie. Because no one cares about the fate of any of the characters, their fate becomes inconsequential and the audience gets bored with the movie.The movie's stars try to do an admirable job of saving the script, but their efforts can go only so far. Even Giovani Ribisi, who I consider one of the unsung, but one of the most talented actors of today, can't save this movie from sinking to new lows.I would only recommend this movie to Berry's die-hard fans, and then only when it plays on demand or as a Netflix rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"After this, Halle doesn't have a prayer. And Bruce Willis had better PRAY that LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD redeems him. This movie was completely awful! Very slow, lacking in suspense, and just a huge waste of $9. I haven't been in a theater since RENT (for good reason!), and so I was surprised that the trailer for this movie intrigued me. I typically wait for the movies to come On Demand.The lead part could have been played by any typical TV movie star. I guess Halle and Bruce only gave big name recognition to the film. The movie was raunchier than it needed to be and the story just diddn't flow quite like you would want. I will give them props for the twist at the end...that was unexpected, but the movie had dragged on so long that it was hard to care by then.SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, intense movie","review":"You will love this all the way up to the end and then you will be shocked beyond belief, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Twisted Ending","review":"I knew watching a movie with two stars in the business had to be interesting from the start. The pace of the movie is fast and u have to pay attention to every detail because it all comes together in the end. Halle Berry was definiely the bad guy but she was very clever at the same time, knowing exactly what she was doing convincing everyone of her conniving plot aganist Willis except for her ex-co worker who ended up being penalized for his brillance(hint). This is a good flick & Halle Berry fans shouldn't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair beginning, but terrible ending","review":"I'll admit it, the beginning of the movie was pretty good. It kept me interested, the acting was good, and so far the script was pretty good as well.But after a while, the movie just got completely predictable and the script became horrendous. Whatever beginnings of a plot line the writers had soon diminished and the ending was completely ridiculous. The movie was not satisfying in anyway; it left me with an incomplete feeling. The only thing that was up to par, in my opinion, was the acting. The actors did a pretty great job with the not so great script they got.My advice is, save your money and buy another movie(or rent or however else you may see it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very thrilling","review":"I knew this film got bad reviews, but the trailer looked sleek and sexy and I thought: Halle Berry, Giovanni Ribisi, Bruce Willis--how bad can it be? Well, it turns out, quite bad.The main problem is that, for a thriller, this film is not very thrilling at all. You never get much sense that there's impending danger to Ro (Berry) or, for that matter, to any of the characters. And yes, the end comes as a total surprise, but that's mainly because it's so damn ridiculous and nonsensical. It's almost as if aliens had landed at the end of the movie and we saw Halle Berry being taken away in a UFO. Surprise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The surprise ending can't save a bad movie","review":"Halle Berry and Bruce Willis can't save this boring thriller in which a investigative reporter(Halle) tries to catch the supposed killer(Bruce) of her friend with the help of a computer spec(Giovanni Ribisi).I won't get into details because I don't want to spoil the pleasure for those who will see the movie.No thrill, no suspense,a weak plot, too many computer details,worth seeing only for Giovanni Ribisi(in case you're not a fan of Halle).Better to leave it a \\"Perfect Stranger\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Building Down as Opposed to Building Up.","review":"If you are like me and decide to ignore all the opinions of people like me, half way through you'll probably feel that the film was somewhat slow, but as I did you probably won't understand the bad reviews. The characters are very strong and the acting as actually quite good; the tension is rising and the threat of death is imminent. The film though goes backward from their. All the tension dissolves; the characters petter out; flash-backs change the events that have already occurred; new motives for characters undermine the momentum of the story; and the threat of danger disappears. The film ends without ever having a single validated moment of suspense. Actually builds down as opposed to building up."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too much!","review":"The movie could be called \\"PERFECT FLAWED\\". What a bad thriller this was... Another bad choice by Berry and Willis is probably smiling inside, working just for the paycheck. A really bad movie, one of the worst of the year. Maybe Berry wnats another Razzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves this DVD","review":"My son is almost 10months old and loves watching this DVD.
