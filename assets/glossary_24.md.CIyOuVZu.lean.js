This camera is amazing.At Christmas it was wonderful having the whole family together wtihout their having to travel home. The full screen view was great. My grandchildren loved sharing the opening of the presents with them.They're now in Thailand for a funeral and later a wedding. They brought their camera with them and I'll be able to see them every night. I'm really happy with the performance.

Mike is not so good (seems to be picking up feedback), so you should probably use an external.Update 9/08: This was a good deal when I bought it, but the current list price is preposterous. Some of the \\"used/new\\" ones still look pretty reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech Quickcam","review":"The cost of this web cam justifies the quality of its video image and capture. However, I would expect a little more for my money. The major problem is the lack of control over the camera's adjustments. Despite, endless tinkering with the resolution, the picture quality is extremely grainy. Also, it is impossible to find a suitable color-shade adjustment: the flesh-tones of people's face either appear bright-magenta, or a dim shade of blue. The web cam is supposed to be compatible with all notebooks, but it won't clip onto my laptop's lid. Overall, this product definitely left something more to be desired, but is a good buy for anyone looking to spend under $40."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks","review":"This webcam sucks i wish i can return it but I just don't want to spend more time and money mailing it back...I was expecting a better quality product from Amazon but it just didn't meet my wants and needs....te image freeze all the time and it is slow..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivers don't work.

The picture is horrible, I look like I'm in Paris Hilton's next night vision video (minus the sex), but worst of all is the sound quality, it makes a really annoying buzzing noise that ranges from tolerable to wanting to flush this thing down the toilet.

I use this webcam primarily for Yahoo and MSN Instant Messaging, and the image transmitted is ok. The only complaint I get from friends on the other end is that the image is a bit grainy and not bright enough. So it is best used in a well-lit room. It comes with software that allows you to adjust the image quality somewhat.Pros:Small yet effective for IM'ing, and clips on nicely on my DELL Inspiron 1505.Cons:Image quality is sub-par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks ( 961404-0403 )This product is not working good,vedio quality is not coming well,its look like balck and white vedio."},{"rating":"1","title":"worth for it's price","review":"A Good Webcam in it's price range.Good quality of picture but under low light conditions picture is not so good, but not bad.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak camera...waste of money","review":"I had hope this wouldn't be your typical plastic cam with wimpy software, botchy installation and bad quality.

But for a portable webcam, I think it will be completely satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put, SUCKS Big Time","review":"I had a cheap webcam (Veo brand) that i purchsed from Walmart. I purchased this this to replace the earlier webcam. It produces so-so quality under good lighting conditions, but under low light its just horrible, my earlier webcam did much better job than this one.

Not only do I have a mic, but a camera as well. I'd recommend buying it. BTW: I did compare this product to other sites (not sure if I can name them) but this was the best price for the very same product. Other sides had it starting at 39.99 to 49.99.

The angel virus was an innovative and fresh idea. I felt this book was more about being different; whether it be as an angel, a schizophrenic, or physically handi-capped. It's about coming to terms with what your are and moving forward. The romance near the end, said to me, when you accept yourself good things come your way.I also enjoyed the commentaries on prejudice and how a cause and political correctness can be carried to far.

Rawhide was one of the best western series for television and it sure deserved 5 stars... but not the product released by greedy Paramount. For it, only 1 star, nothing else. Two volumes for a complete season 2 at $38.99 each (official price) means $ 77.98 for a single season! This is a very high price...and ridiculous too! Paramount is not doing right with the Rawhide series. Why so much focus on Clint Eastwood for the box covers? Eric Fleming was the real star of Rawhide and he is always \\"small and in the background\\" on the boxes! I understand Clint is famous today, and Eric Fleming is almost forgotten, but he was the main character in Rawhide, and, at the time, a better actor than Eastwood. At least Paramount should give both of them equal focus. Indeed, Rawhide is a great show poorly released by Paramount!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars for Rawhide 0 Stars for Greedy Paramont","review":"I love this show and couldn't wait until it was released on DVD.

Brother! Then the author uses the book to woo women on match.com?? Is he insane?? Who would want to date him? And he even lies about this age on his singles profile.

Throughout the book, this man goes through hell, yet manages to keep his sense of humor. The writing evokes all emotions -- you will laugh, cry, feel anger and elation as you go through the writer's journey with him. As the story ends, he emerges as quite a different man than when the story began. Just when you think there are no \\"good\\" ones left, Jack proves you wrong.

I have low flow toilets, they are about 20 years old, and they make a low flow Master Plunger. I won't be trying it, as I am not impressed with the plastic and lack of seal it makes. But maybe it would work better on low flow toilets.2. Others have posted you have to slowly push the air out first, then let it fill with water, then push.

The 'hero' kept going on and on like a really boring and trite motivational speaker. The romance started to be hot but dragged so much I lost the little interest I had. The ending was totally unbelieveable with the sudden changing of the antagonist, who after less than a hour starts spouting slang and cliches and acting totally out of character.It took me several days to just finish it and I found myself checking frequently so see just how much more I had to go before I was done.I will not be buying any more of these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan","review":"I am not a romance person, so I should have known, but I figured I'd give it a try.

There is none beyond the authors being kidnapped and whisked off to fantasy lands for never ending sex. And very boring sex at that. I wouldn't label this book a romance story. It's definitely pointless porn ..... neverending pointless porn. 95% is this so called erotica that is very boring after the first page and 5% very weak effort at storyline. The heros are laughable and the heroines are stupid because they don't take themselves out of this nightmare. I'm sorry I spent my money on this book.

Beginning in the time period of Josephus and moving through the 20th century, the book's articles are crisp and well-written by a variety of authors. In addition, sidebar stories make turning each page an adventure. Numerous drawings and pictures are printed throughout, making it very layout friendly.

Excellent video to show at a party, family get together or just with friends hanging out. Every DVD of his has hilarious insights into parenting, being a teenager and male-female relations, but with not one repeat of material.

At first, they didn't think they'd enjoy it. After the first 10 mins., my kids were rolling on the floor. Even though they're not 70s kids, they found Sinbad's wild recitations and expressions hilarious. We've seen our copy over and over again -- it never gets old!! All my 15-year-old son has to do to get me to laugh is to do Sinbad's impression of the stair-master ... I won't give it away, but it gets us going every time!! His comedy is good, clean fun!! Too much violence and curse words in our kids' lives everywhere they turn. We need more Sinbad in this world!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rating is misleading.","review":"This is a great stand-up special and all, but the \\"PG-13\\" rating is misleading because there is no profanity in this video, unless of course you consider the word \\"pimp\\" to be a swear word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was not the entire version of the HBO Special.

Although the style is remarkably different, the pictures are colorful and beautiful to look at.

But the Leica c lux is almost too small! It is smaller than it looks in the pictures, about the sixe of my cell phone, but packs a punch. The shutter is slower and takes some getting used to, but it catches inages with superb clarity and is very easy to use and carry. I passed on the $70 Leica case and opted for one by SONY for $22, and I carry it on my belt like a phone. I wore it while playing golf this morning and came back with sixty images. The battery lasts a long time, maybe 4 hours, and the camera quickly darts back and forth between modes. As for whether the Panasonic is just as good, sorry. The build quality of the Leica is far above the Panasonic version, and it is a real gem to look at and handle. It has re-energized my love of photography, and I will continue to carry it at all times to capture the kinds of pictures that i used to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Carry Camera","review":"When my Canon Sureshot developed problems on a recent trip to Morocco, I purchased the Leica D-LUX 1 in the Amsterdam Airport Duty Free area. Despite the fact that the box contained four owners manuals, all in languages that weren't English, the camera was quickly familiar to me, extremely intuitive, and a fantastic thing to have stumbled upon. I purchased it for the brand name, and because I'd never seen a Leica digital camera, so I can't take credit for careful research before purchase, but boy does it take beautiful pictures. I love the wider angle lens, the crisp, rich images, the long-lasting battery, and its fantastic compactness. It easily slips in a shirt pocket if necessary, and although I used it constantly while working in rugged terrain in the Atlas Mountains ( film shoot) it functioned perfectly, and became the envy of the set as well. Let's face it, in addition to everything else, it's just downright beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite All Unfortunately","review":"The product seemed fine, but it did not actually fit my RV.

What a total disappointment when I began to watch it!It was NOT the movie I expected. Many of us do NOT know that Jackie Chan made several versions of this same movie and title. If this is the OLD first version of his movie, why is he using a recent photo?After more careful investigation it seems that I actally wanted the \\"Legend of Drunken Master\\", but the photo on the cover is of a very young Jackie Chan.

It doesn't even have Jackie in it, despite the cover pictures. It used bootleg scenes from Drunken Master, and the story ain't about Jackie. If you buy/rent this movie and expect to see Jackie Chan in it, you'll be in for a surprise. This movie is a bootleg film. It's stupid.

Great picture for its age, great movie, great commentary by Ric Meyers. However, the audio problem that everyone is running into with the Cantonese track is supposedly due to the bad audio master that the company got the material from.

The frustrating part is why poor Cat should be so loyal to his rotten sibling!The characters are delightful, the humor is lighthearted and down-to-earth, the magic is entertaining, and the story itself is the perfect fantasy: the day to day battles of an ordinary kid set in a world that is thoroughly extraordinary. We can all identify with poor Cat, and struggle with him as the more he tries to get out of hot water, the hotter it gets.Plus, you have to feel bad for a poor gingerbread man whose maker's magic was too weak to enable him to do anything more than feebly wave his arms.

And yet, from the hype one would imagine that they were unique, that Rawling had done something that hadn't been done before. My own reaction when reading the HP books was that I was immediately reminded of the Chant books, and was using those as the standard against which I judged the HP books. And in my opinion the HP books come out quite well against that standard - they're very nearly as good...So if you know anyone who has read and liked HP, and isn't familiar with CC, buy this for them..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Charming","review":"Absolutely charming and delightful. I imagine this book to be something akin to if Roald Dahl had written a Harry Potter type book for teens. The old English made me laugh. Reminiscent of James and the Giant Peach/ Willy Wonka, but having to do with witches, enchantors, all sorts of magic, spells, and of course, family. This book was full of family-fun adventure; nothing too dark or violent. Pure magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of those remarkable books that I can't put down!","review":"I'm known to read a lot, but this book is incredible!

Just read this book carefully, and you'll never put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST publication effort I've ever seen!","review":"As a collector this book was a horrible disappointment. Instead of photo-reproducing Wakefield's translation they apparently attempted to OCR the text. The text is a total mess. Besides an enormous amount of misprints there are 'weird' section headings that have little rhyme or reason. The book is near useless. You'd be much better off using the Google books website or printing it off that sight yourself. Wakefield's beautiful notes in the back are ruined and the Greek readings end up as misprinted garbled messes with English characters that in no way represent the Greek. It is beyond me as to why they would've even attempted such a piece of trash. A blind man could've typed a better job. There are warnings on the internet about this company[..] I wish I'd seen before ordering.

All I would like to know is what is the actual number of the darkness.

I am sorry to say that I had to return the first one because it was hanging up at the end, causing my small dog to trip over the leash on occasion. Now the replacement is doing the exact same thing after a little over a month, and it is too late to return it to Amazon. This has been the leash I have used for about 10 years, having owned two in that decade. So, I had two that worked GREAT for over a decade, and now I have had two over a two month period which hang up...hummmm, I wonder if Flexi is cutting back on their quality? Yes, I think they are. My dog is old and trips a lot anyway, so it really bugs me that this is causing him even more anguish. This is a medium sized leash, supposed to be good for a dog up to 44 pounds.

Why I have to go on about this toy is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"As a hard core Bee Gees fan, I would think this item was excellent anyway. I have the original release and I was very surprised to hear this re-issue. It has the original album in both mono and stereo which makes for good listening. Although a very early Bee Gees release, this sounds just as fresh today as it did back then. I really loved the 2nd disc in this item. It has some alternate mixes and some unreleased tracks. Apparently the Bee Gees did a couple of Coke commercials which are included on the 2nd disc. If you're as big a Bee Gees fan as I am, then you will want to have this reissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confident 3rd Album!","review":"After their unique introduction on \\"Bee Gees 1st\\" and a more somber 2nd album, \\"Horizontal\\", the Bee Gees are far more confident in their writing, singing and performing on this CD. Barry Gibb's guitar work is exemplary and his voice is strongest on \\"When The Swallows Fly\\" and \\"Swan Song\\", as well as Robin Gibb on \\"In The Summer Of His Years\\" and the huge hit, \\"I Started A Joke\\". Maurice experiments a great deal with his bass guitar on the bouncy \\"Kitty Can\\", the pensive \\"Down To Earth\\" and strong pulsating bass notes (and piano) on the massive hit \\"I've Gotta Get A Mesage To You\\". Lead guitarist Vince Melouney writes the only Bee Gees song never written by the brothers; \\"Such A Shame\\", an upbeat, harmonica driven rocker with his Mickey Dolenz sound-alike voice. It is the last strong group effort of an album, before the Bee Gees, temporarily went their separate mucical ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for your collection","review":"These were the songs that made me love their music !

I loved it then and my opinion hasn't changed with the CD version. Beginning with the delicate but dramatic \\"Let there be love\\", this is a remarkably diverse album, with stunning tracks throughout. \\"I Started a Joke\\" started out as merely an album cut, but was released as a single by popular demand. Of course, the huge hit \\"I've Gotta Get a message to you\\" stands out, but by no means overshadows the rest. Of their four pre-breakup LPs, \\"Idea\\" is the strongest overall. As a bonus, this contains \\"Such a Shame\\" Vince's track which was deleted from the US LP (Such a shame, indeed!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Before Disco Bee Gees","review":"I like this CD because I'm a fan of Bee Gees, and I enjoy their pre-disco stuff just as much as their popular disco era offerings. If you are only fan of their high-voice Barry Gibb disco stuff, than you might beware this album is much different. I don't like the format of the first disc where the songs are repeated in mono versions. I don't understand what's the need of this, and I usually stop the CD when it gets to repeat the songs, and then go ahead listen to the second disc. The second disc provides some songs that aren't alone different versions of songs on first disc, so it's a true bonus disc. Although some are same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music","review":"I bought this album for my mother, who is a huge Bee Gees fan, as a birthday gift. I bought it as a digital download and was very well satisfied. Not only did I not have to wait for it to ship and arrive, but I also found that the download went quite painless and the quality was excellent.

Scott is a refreshing comedian...his sketches are solid and witty, and he doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks.Pre-Chewed Appetizers, his debut cd as far as I know, shows off his wide range of vocal talents...he's wonderful with accents, characters, and impressions. There are quite a few characters (all in a restaurant setting), and each one is distinct; he doesn't let them mesh into one another as many other comedians accidentally tend to do.Not only does this cd exhibit Scott's voice talents, but his writing skills as well. Each sketch is uniquely humorous without being obvious- a lot of the jokes are indirect. One might wonder how Scott would fare writing for a comedic variety show, because he seems to have a knack for creating dynamic characters within a brief sketch while not overusing the punchline.Pre-Chewed Appetizers is an excellent debut, and I personally will be paying attention to Scott's future releases. Highly recommended for all fans of comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where On the Ad Does It Mention that these are Reprints?","review":"It's McSweeneys and to some extent it's what I would expect: a mix of very good and interesting (and occasionally not) pieces of writing.

Two very long tracks from \\"Out Here\\" have edited down to more normal playing time, which is definitely a win for both songs. Especially \\"Doggone\\", which is a one of the strongest tracks, has won a lot with the long drum solo being removed.\\"Out Here\\" is in itself a great album, even if only it in glimpses recalls the sound of the earliest albums from the group. This is not surprising as only Arthur Lee is back from the original lineup.Other tracks from the album which also stand out are \\"Willow Willow,\\" \\"Listen to My Song\\" and \\"Gather Round\\".The live numbers are solid - but it is a little annoying that there is no information about origin and line-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small oven!","review":"It's a little overkill as a toaster, unless you're making a LOT of toast, but it's a very good small oven.

About time, hay!At last, this item is sold by the host,........ Mr. \\"Amazon\\" itself........ and I have to give them a thumb up for the amazing customer service. They are just great!Over all, take my word for it, you can not go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stainless Oster 6297 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven","review":"I purchased this in Dec., 2006. I love the design of this unit, it's a nice addition to the kitchen, and for the most part I enjoy it, [but it does have a few little issues...one being, the top rack is really close to the burner so the toast will burn quickly, while other parts of the bread remains untouched.] And, the stainless steel does show marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Toaster-Oven","review":"This is NOT worth it. When you are on Bake mode, the lower burner doesn't run enough and the upper burner runs way too hot. In brief, your pizza will be golden on top and lousy crust... no jokes!! I would stay away from this one. The first one had a problem, so, Oster sent me another one. NO CHANGE It's just a bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"high price low quality","review":"I have had this less than a year. The door has fallen off three times, this last time, there is not way to get it back on. I paid a lot of money for this thinking it was good quality, wrong. Don't buy one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I was excited to get this because the picture makes it appear solid and beautiful. Admittedly, I ordered a pre-packaged item and it did disclose minor surface irregularities. However, when the package arrived, it arrived in its original box (not a shipping box) and was severely torn and mangeled and wrapped in packing tape. The item was dented and dinged in several place. Upon my first use I noticed the outer surface gets extremely hot so don't touch it! It appears to be encased in a very thin layer of cheap metal. Haven't used it since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good oven","review":"Oven performs as described. It does get hot but it's a oven! Handle gets really hot compared to Oster that I had before. One foot is uneven with the others so it \\"rocks\\" slightly, but only if you put pressure on it, not a big deal, but wish it was level."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOT TIME?","review":"Got time? Well that's what it takes to use this oven. Toast...don't plan it with your breakfast...you will wait and wait AND WAIT...English muffins...you might as well plan on serving them for the next meal. What ever happened to ease? Like on and off?...with this toaster oven to toast you turn all the dials just to toast a muffin..then you have to remember to turn the \\"toaster\\" off as you must do this manually. I am so disappointed in this toaster oven I am writing my first review of a product in my life. My advice...don't waste your money! Rating it from 1 to 10...10 being the best I would rate it a ONE and that is only because if you plug it it ..it will turn on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase!","review":"Attractive item in good condition MISSING RACK! When contacted Amazon they first told me to return the entire applicance to get a new one with a rack. Then instructed to return product, that it is not an isolated issue and they cannot replace the missing part! If you purchase this you will only have to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and flimsy","review":"This toaster oven is the result of careful engineering to make it absolutely the cheapest possible toaster oven ever built. It is ridiculously flimsy. The power cord is 24\\" (2 feet long). I measured it. Unless you are positioning the oven literally right in front of an outlet you will need an extension cord. Seriously, that is how cheap this thing is: they saved money by making the power cord too short.Also, the power cord is UNGROUNDED so the oven is actually dangerous. With no grounding it means the metal case of the oven could potentially be a shock hazard. I strongly advise against buying ungrounded appliances. If a short develops inside the unit, you could electrocute yourself by touching the outside of the oven.I am using the oven a little but in all honesty I expect to break soon it is so cheap. Oster used to make the best toaster ovens, but obviously they are in revenue collection mode now and making a quality product is the farthest thing from their mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice product","review":"Makes great toast. The crunchy kind that one can enjoy and spend a little time with. A bit small, but hey, it is more than I expected. A very handy item to have in the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a safety hazard -- explodes!!","review":"I purchased this oven and was very happy with it. But the fourth time I used it, I was in the other room and heard a loud crashing noise. When I went into the kitchen, I had foudn that the glass front had literally exploded, and there were shards of glass all over the kitchen. Thank God no one was in the kitchen at the time. The oven had only been running at 350 degrees for six minutes when the explosion happened.You apparently get what you pay for. The glass in this oven is NOT of a quality that is able to withstand the heat of a convection oven. If you do buy it and use it, be sure to STAND FAR FAR AWAY from the appliance when it's running, in case yours explodes! I'd hate to see someone get hurt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I received this toaster oven as a christmas gift. It worked fine for a few months until one day while making toast, BOOOOOM! Right before my eyes the toaster suffered a mini-explosion inside the toaster. Fortunately, it tripped the gfi (ground fault interrupter) and the flames died down enough that no one was hurt. I had black marks from the flame up the backsplash. We reset the breaker, my husband looked it over and couldn't see anything wrong, but we planned to throw this toaster in the trash and replace it with something that didn't explode. Later that week, we had company over, and while I was cooking, someone plugged in the toaster oven to heat up something small. BOOOOOOOM! This item is clearly dangerous. If several people had not been standing right there, our kitchen would have gone up in flames."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 6 months","review":"Toasts bread okay if you set the temp. numb to 400 degrees or less.

I'm still getting used to using this great little toaster oven instead of the big regular oven. Saves on electricity! Works and looks great. We liked it so much, that we got our son one for Christmas! He loves his too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but hard for everyday toasting","review":"Okay, I just bought this and will be returning it to the store. Reasons? To toast (which is what I do about 80-90% of the time) you have to turn a knob past the 20 minute mark and then turn it back to some point between fully burned and lightly warmed. In the mornings, I need a button - that's about all I can handle. Also, compared to my old, simple Black & Decker that just broke, your view of what's inside is obstructed by a curved out top and the front is 90-degrees which, interestingly enough, makes it harder to see inside. Weird that I would notice but I guess I got accustomed to what I had before. Other than that, didn't keep it enough to test out the other features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all","review":"I'm trying to replace my trusty 12+ year old DeLonghi that got broken accidently.This Oster 6297 is the THIRD attempt at replacing the DeLonghi. Even DeLonghi isn't the same anymore. They are Chinese made junk.This Oster looks great BUT....the thermostat is NOT accurate...cooking a Stouffers Lasagna for 52 min. @ 350 yields a COLD center of Lasagna.The outside of this oven is DANGEROUS hot.The \\"convection\\" is useless, it neither saves time nor cooks better, in fact it DRIES out the food.The ergonomics of putting food in and taking food out is dangerous...it's VERY hard to take out the trays with any kind of weight on them without skinning your knuckles on hot glass. Stay away from this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing product","review":"At first I thought all the negative reviews were over the top. But now having lived with this product for the past several months I had to write one of my own.Like so many other reviewers, I can confirm that:- This oven is dangerous- this oven has electrical problems- the outside of this oven gets dangerously hot- the thermostat and timer are inaccurate and have both ceased to work reliably- the only thing that really continues to work is the rack - it still holds up food from off the element.And now that the oven started to smell like burning wires and started smoking, I am finally done with it. I'm very disappointed considering what we spent on it - I expected a nicer product for this price (around $70). I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad for the price","review":"Have only used for about a month, however seems to work just fine in all operations. Probably need to fine tune my use but as I get acquaited with the Oster I am sure the quality of what I use it for will be better. Lot of frozen products do not give use for a toaster oven except when to tell you not to use one. I use it more then heating up a large oven for such items as a single biscuit, pocket snacks, broil fish and such. Handy little item. I recommend this item if looking for a toaster oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"No toast for this toaster","review":"Went through half a loaf of bread before I got a slice of toast the wasn't burned. The dial doesn't work so well for smaller increments required for toasting bread. Not very impressed with the construction methods used either, through the inside of the door I easily could see the glue that had been used to help secure the door handle. Looked a bit rough for a toaster oven of this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"door broke immediately","review":"door broke immediately and would not close with out pulling up on it and holding down the top of the hot oven. Now after less than 6 months won't shut at all. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I really wasn't happy with this item. I had to rearange my countertop because the cord was way too short.Also, in order to toast, you have to turn the dial to 20 then back to the correct toasting time. It was a pain, and not consistant.I ended up returning it because it took forever to toast bread, and it just did a flat out awful job at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't last very long......","review":"When working, this is a very good toaster & oven...

I must temper my review by saying it is my first toaster oven, but it is more than adequately functional. I have only 2 gripes, these being that the door does not seal well enough to keep heat in at the front, causing uneven cooking. My other complaint is that the analog temperature dial isn't very exact, which can hamper baking thoroughly. Other than those two problems the oven is fast and easy to use and feature rich enough to satisfy my first time user needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This item has been working great. Got it about 2 weeks ago and I've been using it to heat up all sorts of food."},{"rating":"2","title":"works ok but fragile","review":"Good for toasting or baking.It is quick and even.

I love that it comes in red, it matches my kitchen color scheme. This is a great appliance to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Hot!","review":"I'm a toaster oven fanatic. So after my last one died (different maker) I wanted something cool looking, functional, not too big, and reasonably priced...and that's exactly what I got with this red hot toaster oven by Oster. I've had it for a few months now and couldn't be more pleased. It's nice and roomy inside and cooks fast. It's great to use in the summer when you need an oven but don't want to turn on the big one that heats up the whole house. It puts a beautiful brown crust on chicken pot pies, pastries, toast (of course), and reheats food fabulously even. They also have several colors to choose from to match your décor. It is easy to use and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"I decided with the high cost of engery, and eating by myself most evenings now that it was a sin to heat a huge oven for just me. This toaster oven is fantastic. It broils, bakes, toasts and doesn't heat the kitchen up! It is easy to clean, easy to use (I even taught my grandaughter, who is 8, how to use it in about 5 minutes. Makes the best toasted cheese sandwiches in the world! Holds a whole frozen pizza, but takes up very little room on the counter. Is very light-weight so can be moved easily. The convection feature makes quick work of most meals."},{"rating":"2","title":"great but not as roomy as anticipated","review":"This toaster oven is great. Cooks well, toasts well, has automatic shut-off, etc. I guess it could toast 6 slices of very small bread, but it's certainly not as large as I anticipated when I saw that 6-slice denotation. Still, I'd buy it again because it functions well and looks great on my counter-top. We use it daily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This appliance is terrible, the rack is designed wrong so you can't get anything out once they are hot. If you flip the rack over to overcome that problem, then the door doesn't slide the rack out like it should. Its supposed to be able to cook frozen pizzas, they just droop and start buring on the edges while the center stays raw. My parents gave it to me after they tried it and decided it was too unsafe for their household (after it set some food on fire)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it, but Dangerous!!!!","review":"I am sad to say I had to return this oven. It works great, but it is extremely hot on sides and top, but even hotter on the polished metal trim around the front. If you can build a protective cabinet around it to protect from someone accidently bumping it while trying to reach for something, it would be a great oven to have. After having this oven for only one week, I had a guest injured with a severe painful burn on her forearm that will leave a permanant scar. The oven was placed on the countertop next to the range and while reaching over to turn off a burner her arm touched against the trim which was about 450 degrees; the outer metal reaches the same temp as the oven setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easily results in \\"User Error\\"","review":"It may be a great, versatile toaster oven, but for just making toast it is not easy to use. There are three dials to set. Two can remain in a particular position if all you are making is toast (but check to make sure no one else change the settings). The third is a *timer* that one must turn past a certain point and then back to the time one wants. The dial rotates 360 deg. For toast, the timer must be turned somewhere between 0 deg and 15 deg on the dial, a very small arc. The dial is small. The lettering is small. After a year we are still burning toast even though we know how to use it. It may be \\"user error\\" (we are not sure), but if an appliance after a year still frequently results in frustrating errors, then there is some problem with the design.In summary, if you primarily want a toaster oven for making toast, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oster More Than a Toaster","review":"After returning our original KitchenAid Convection Oven due to the horrible noise it made in convection mode, I must say that this Oster is not only better looking, it makes only a slight fan noise during convection mode and does not need to be unplugged every time it's not in use like the KitchenAid model. The toasting mode is accurate and the oven quickly heats and cooks anything you put in it. I would definitely purchase this again. As usual, Amazon's pricing and free shipping can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"reeked of chemicals","review":"The first time I turned the oven on, it gave off a horrible chemical smell and set off the smoke alarm.

Shocking design flaw in an otherwise good looking product."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Oven Not a Toaster","review":"Got this toaster oven in red when my little Black & Decker didn't survive a cross-country move. The only thing it did well was broil. Perfect for a couple of chops or round-eye steaks. Other than that, not worth the price. Toast is either not done or burned. Clean the outside once and color/finish goes to crap. The timer is really tricky if you set it for anything under 15 minutes. Also, the glass door is a b*t*h to clean and warped so that there is a gap on the upper right for heat to escape. If you're looking for a good TOven, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster poor quality","review":"After carefully looking at alternatives I purchased an Oster toaster oven at Target.

Accurate temperature settings. Quiet fan and efficient (quick) cooking times. Toasting requires some trial and error as some bread reacts more quickly. Also, it seems that toast is always done and oven has to be manually shut off, despite timer being properly set.Yes, exterior does get very hot but that's what ovens do without layers of insulation. (Barbecue grills for instance.) Be careful, especially if small children can access unit while in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Oven!!!!","review":"I got this Oster oven mainly because of the red color, but also because of some of the positive reviews. I have used it to make toast, waffles, frozen pizza, french fries, and I found everything cooks quickly and comes out crispy. It is big inside too, with a rounded back to fit pizzas. It is easy to clean with the pull out crumb pan underneath. I have nothing bad to say about it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good oven","review":"I purchased this for my mother. The first oven cord was hot when plugged in, the fan did not go on, and there was an electrical smell that came from it. We returned it, and the same thing happen with the second oven. Finally, we called Oster, they sent out a new oven, model 6058 and she is very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better toaster ovens out there.","review":"Pros: The oven part works great. I like the fact that it is controlled by a timer, meaning that you can set somthing to cook for 20 minutes and then it turns itself off. For cooking things, the double rack is also handy, although you only get one pan (luckily, I saved the pan from my old toaster oven).Cons: The toaster part is horrible. This thing burns my toast every time, unless I watch it carefully and take it out at precisely the right time. Part of the problem seems to be that the timer doesn't work very well in small increments, and in some cases never turns itself off. Also, the bottom rack is completely useless when toasting, so the fact that they are touting this as a 6-slice toaster oven is misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy as toast!","review":"I have absolutely no complaints about this toaster oven.

I did have to buy a regular toaster because the toaster was too slow to make toast and I did not want to constantly get burnt.Last night as I opened the toaster oven door, I saw two great flashes. After investigating the problem, I found that the back exterior of the toaster oven was so hot that it had singed the electric cord of my regular toaster. Now I have to go buy another toaster.

I unpack and prepare the toaster to be used for the first time. Here is what I find:- My first attempt to toast (with no bread inside) I see lots of smoke coming from the side of the unit. I did not see any fire and there was nothing inside unit that could have been burning so it must have been the unit itself- For the unit to toast, it takes a VERY LONG time to heat up. It seemed like 5-6 minutes per toast.- The top of the unit was very hot...but to my surprise, the front of the unit was VERY VERY hot. So hot that it would burn any child.I've had to replace several toaster ovens and this is by far the worse yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"This toaster oven should be removed from the market---and any others made the same way.

We all got it from Costco for about the same price.As an oven and toaster it works great - You do have to be a little careful about toast since its easy to burn bread if you're not careful about the settings.But the one thing I wanted to share with everyone is that they need to be EXTREMELY CAREFUL because the built in timer does not always function properly.Usually you turn the knob which is like an egg timer, when it hits zero, it is supposed to turn the oven off.Unfortunately, if you are doing a short period of time (for example, under 5 minutes), the timer is PRONE TO BECOMING STUCK BEFORE REACHING ZERO, AND THUS WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY TURN OFF THE OVEN, NOR MAKE A DING.This makes it extremely dangerous in that if you are not constantly watching your oven, you will either burn your food to a crisp, or worse, start a fire.All three ovens we have purchased exhibit this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"fire burn","review":"i had this toaster for less than a year when it caught on fire after less than one minute of being turned on. I clean out the crumb catcher religiously so there is no reason that it should have been on fire-but it was. Thank god I had a fire extinguisher on hand.

Ours broke after 8 months of use. I liked my cheaper Black & Decker toaster oven better. This one takes twice as long to warm food. It also burns easily on certain settings. Wish I never bought it.

It takes so long to toast you end up standing by it waiting and waiting and..."},{"rating":"1","title":"great until it quit working after 3 years","review":"I loved this toaster oven until it quit working 3 years after I bought it. My last toaster oven lasted 13 years, and my mom's last one lasted 15 years, so I really expected at least a decade out of this thing. It seems to be an electrical problem, because it sometimes worked and sometimes didn't for a couple months, then totally quit. The timer makes clicking sounds but it doesn't heat up and the indicator light doesn't come on. Anyway, it was a bummer. So if you want a toaster oven that will last a few years, this is a great one. If you expect your small appliances to last longer than a pet hamster, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oster 6297 6-slice Convection Toaster Oven, Stainless Steel","review":"We've really enjoyed all the features of this oven. The convection circulates the heat and cooks quickly and evenly. It makes a quick tray of cookies and toasts bread evenly just as well. The stainless steel finish matches my other appliances perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice oven","review":"I use this for mostly toasting and reheating and love it for both. The removable bread crumb tray is a great feature. I also like that the shelf can be turned over to change the height, handy when you are broiling a variety of foods. It is a handsome looking oven. My previous oven, by another company, had a white handle that discolored to a yellow from the heat. I am happy to say that this one has not had the same problem-still looks brand spanking new. There is one thing you should know-the pan that comes with it is a little cheap. I have a Pampered Chef stoneware I use, so it wasn't an issue for me, but if you don't have any toaster oven pans, do know that the pan that comes with it definitely won't last as long as the oven itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The FAT BOYS are...DISORDERLIES","review":"\\"This is the movie you're gonna laugh yourself sick over,\\" as it is stated on the back of the vinyl cover.

Squeezed in the time zone of British Pop Groups ala the Beatles, they had small chance of doing well, considering they had the same vocal harmonies that the Beatles had (although they started them earlier than the Beatles in Manchester, England). Other than that, this set contains classic, everlasting songs that continue to be covered by other artists. Nearly EVERY song has been sung by another artist and \\"To Love Somebody\\" has been covered more than 250 times, according to Rolling Stone. Not a small achievement, by any mean, by three teenagers! Hats off to the three teen brothers who took the current technology of the time and survived, despite the georgeous Beatles, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" of 1967. What a start!Footnote: 1980's Bee Gees technical engineer, Scott Glasel mentioned to me that whenever he feels a need for inspiration, he puts on Bee Gees First."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bee Gees roots in folk, rock and psychedelic","review":"Other than their harmonies, it's difficult to connect the Bee Gees \\"debut\\" with the later disco music that brought them to international stardom. But this early work (actually their 3rd LP, despite the title) features all of the melodic seeds that would sustain their career through various ups and downs.This is my favorite Bee Gess LP, and includes superb songs such as the hit singles \\"New York Mining Disaster,\\" \\"To Love Somebody\\" and \\"Holiday,\\" along with the rocking \\"In My Own Time\\" (covered brilliantly by The Three O'Clock a couple of decades later).Whether or not their sound aped the Beatles, their voices formed a distinctive blend, and the songwriting of Robin and Barry Gibb had a unique, often meloncholy, stamp upon it.

I estimate that the two-bulb combination gives off about the same amount of light as a 60 watt bulb. They have a light-blue cast to them, and they are not adequate to read by; however, they provide sufficient light for conversations at night. I'm in the process of replacing every bulb in the table lamps, closets, and over the kitchen sink lights. With every light in the house turned on, I will be drawing less than 100 watts.For additional light during the daytime, I've installed solar tubes in the hallway and bathrooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product needs better packaging","review":"This bookcase is great quality - the shelves are very strong and the unit is sturdy. It is a little flimsy on the backboard with a ton of tiny nails, but that was the \\"hardest\\" part of the assembly and unless the sun is shining on it just right, you can't tell that it was folded in three sections. The packaging, however, is a different story. The first unit I received had damage on every piece of the assembly except for one. Bush was fantastic when I called them to find out what I needed to do. They ended up replacing the entire assembly. The second unit had 2 pieces of the assembly that were damaged, albeit not as bad as the first go around. By this time, I was tired of waiting to put together my new bookcase, so I just colored in the one or two spots that were damaged with a Sharpie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice knife, but flashlight is useless, falls off","review":"I like how this knife feels in the hand, and the fact that it's very easy to snap open with either hand, left or right.However the add-on flashlight is pretty much useless. The beam is underpowered, and if you twist the head too much - it falls out of the socket, together with batteries and few other small parts... and then good luck finding them all in the dark...So I'd give 4-5 stars for the knife, and 0 for the flashlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashlight Good , Knife Bad","review":"The Flashlight is a pretty cool item. Feels substantial, and is relatively bright for how small it is.On the other hand, the knife is a complete piece of garbage. I have bought better knives at Circle K. Blade is loose and has a lot of play. I bought this to give as a gift to a friend and now I cant, I would be much too embarrassed to hand him this pile of horribleness."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it for what it is","review":"This knife isn't, as others have pointed out, for those who want the finest craftsmanship, the finest materials, or the finest quality. But understanding that those qualities cost and that this knife is not intended to function in the most demanding of circumstances, I think this is a good product, one that might be ideal for a young boy or girl first learning the proper methods for using knives.I know when I was young, my grandfather gave me two knives. The first one was when I was quite young, and it eventually broke. The second one was when I was more mature, and I have that knife till this day. I think of the knife in this review as a pretty good version of the first type of knife: one that is fairly sturdy, cuts pretty well, and will last a while before it's time to graduate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Flashlight derails otherwise cool item.","review":"This is a cool mini-pocketknife, with a stainless steel serrated blade. The locking mechanism is solid, holds the blade tight in place once out. It's good for quick cutting, like box opening or a fast cut through cord or thin wire.However, the flashlight is a dud. The light is insufficient for any real illumination purposes except for up-close lighting, perhaps lighting your car or front door keyhole. The spin-to-turn-on function is poorly set; too far abd the dial falls off.As for the whistle? Let's put it this way; I'm of a mind that anything you might potentially put against your mouth in the dark should not come attached to an object that could slice your lips off. Final verdict, too much clutter on a decent blade. You'd be better serviced by an old fashioned Swiss army knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Ideas, but poorly made","review":"I've had this about a year now, and have used it on about a half dozen jobs. While it works great on some ceramics, and is accurate, it is incredibly plasticy/flimsy and will not break porcelin and other high grade tiles. The problem is that the cutter flexes too much where it should be transferring the force to the tile. The blade is also held in by only a flanged pin, and so popped out the other night. Also, the handle no longer smoothly glides on the shafts.

The steam function does not work for clothes that are hung - it only works when the iron is flat on a surface. If left vertical, the iron would spit out water. The iron was hot enough to get wrinkles out, but as the iron dripped, cloth would bubble up, thereby sabotaging any areas that had been flattened successfully.

Look forward to seeing more by Jo Ann Beard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Inward","review":"A series of interrelated memories from a forty-something child of the '70s. Despite the book's title, Jo Ann Beard focuses more on her relationships with the women in her life (mother, sister, cousin, close friend, and, most of all, herself). The boys and men generally are in a haze of pot smoke or alcohol, and/or emotionally distant. Some of it comes across as self-absorbed and pretentious (really, a pre-birth memory?), but plenty is insightful and almost all of is interesting and well worth the reading time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT.","review":"If you graduated high school in the late 70s, early 80s and were a little on the wild side..... this book has some wonderful memories in store for you. It's when painters pants were big, long hair meant everything and riding in cars with girlfriends was so IT. JoAnn Beard tells it like it was better than any author I've read, even down to sneaking out of the house though we knew better.Put on an old Van Morrison CD, and relive some wonderful memories while reading great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beard's first","review":"Jo Ann Beard's Boys of My Youth is a wonderful journey through the author's turbulent and hilarious childhood- it slows down occasionally, but the presentation is so fresh and witty that it's easy to overlook the minor weaknesses. The true gem of the book is \\"The Fourth State of Matter\\", a New Yorker essay about the murders of her colleagues in the Iowa Department of Physics in 1991.

The story begins in Rome, Italy in 1944 and moves very quickly to his travels to America at age 10. In spite of the many hardships in his young life, he forged ahead with faith and determination to make the most of what America had to offer him.

Normally love the Fellowes products, but not this one. Hard to get the paper to begin shredding, will only handle 4 sheets at the most and then it has a tendency to jam. Removal of the waste is difficult and I will guarantee that you will leave bits of paper on floor, ok lots of paper on floor.But, it does shred very tiny. Doubt anyone could put documents back together.Going to replace it with another model, secretary can have mine.

Yesterday I went to give it a single sheet of paper and it failed catastrophically. It senses the paper,the motor runs, but the shredding mechanism does not move ... It seems a gear has stripped or broken. I could live with a failure at that age, IF there were any way to get it repaired, but there isn't !!! Fellowes considers these $200+ \\"personal shredders\\" as disposable, they do not sell spares and they do not repair them. The best you can expect is an offer to sell you a remanufactured shredder with no warranty whatsoever.I suspect that I will not buy the remanufactured model that may be offered and will buy a competitor's unit as a replacement, whose I don't know yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"High quality cobbled with a poor choose for a part","review":"The overall design of this unit is very nice and \\"heavy\\". The one real problem? There is a main plastic gear, driven by what appears to be a casy aluminum one that has a tendancy to strip out. At first I suspected that the gear was made plastic for a reason - so it would strip out in the case of an overload (it does seem to have an overload protection feature also). So, I called up Fellowes and asked for a replacement part - yea... no can do. We don't sell that part. Sad, Sad, Sad. Back into the box it went."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowes Powershred 450Cs","review":"We have used our shredder over the last few weeks and so far it has worked very well. The paper shredding is cut into very fine particles.The one thing that I think is a concern is the credit card shredding. We had some old credit cards that we shredded, but it only cuts the cards into strips and does not do the cross cut. So we would cut the strips into pieces with sissors after running them into the shreader. Not a real big deal but just not comfortable leaving credit cards in strips only.Other than that the machine itself works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The shredder failed after about a half hour of use","review":"The paper shredder's cutting cylinders stopped turning after about a total of a half hour of use; the motor continued to run. I sent it back to Amazon.The shredder's box had a mean looking bull dog, marketing I took to mean that the shredder was tough.

It is very effective for light office use. If you're constantly shredding a lot of documents over an extended period, I strongly suggest choosing the next model up from the 450CS as it tends to heat up and stops to cool off for at least 25 minutes after 15 minutes of continuous use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellows MS-450Cs","review":"I purchased this product in Dec. 2008 and it works great. When shredding it makes a very very low humming sound which is great compared to the other shredders I've had. There are only two drawbacks to this model, the credit card destruction doesn't create confetti, instead it cuts the card up as if you were using scissors and you can still see the individual's name and card number. The second drawback is the automatic shutoff sensor. Even though it's suppose to shutdown after 7 - 8 minutes, it shuts down at 5 minutes. So if you have a big pile to shred, you're going to be at the shredder for a while. But the shredder is definitely worth the inconvenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shredder, safety feature not so good","review":"I have been pleased with the performance of the shredder so far. We are able to shred about six pieces at a time and it will run for about 10 minutes before it has to cool down. I was disappointed though when I realized the auto shut off that is supposed to occur when a finger touches the area around the opening does not respond to little fingers. It appears that toddler sized fingers do not register. I am going to contact the company to find out if this is a known malfunction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shedder did not work","review":"I received the shredder very quickly but it did not work at all.

Another reviewer had the same problem: it was working fine for two years; then, one day the shredder began to make the worst sounds. Contacted customer service - they issued a claim number - had to call again - sent a reminder e-mail - still, no response. As of this writing, a one-star is the best rating for this equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for credit cards","review":"This may be a good unit for paper, but is NOT suitable for credit cards. I put one credit card into this unit and it only strip cut it (versus confetti) and my account number was still readable. This was not acceptable, so I returned the shredder. After further research, I ended up purchasing the Royal 1610X Confetti-Cut Continuous Form Shredder which pulverized my credit cards as well as paper into the same tiny unreadable confetti bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be a good shredder Fellowes Powershred MS-450Cs","review":"However, mine came DOA from Amazon's supplier.

Bought a more expensive one hoping it would work for longer than light periodic shredding. No such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confetti all over the place","review":"I had the shredder for perhaps a week, and then I had to change the bag. I used all the oil they told me to use, but somehow the works must have gotten clogged, because after that time, more confetti got onto the floor, or the outside of the machine, than into the bag.I don't use the shredder any more. It sits in my laundry room as an emergency device, in case I ever absolutely, positively have to shred something. (Too bad I don't have a fireplace: burning would be a lot easier, if you ask me.)Once bitten, twice shy: I won't buy any shredders ever again, especially not the type that make paper into confetti. Maybe if someone gave me a free, el-cheapo \\"strip\\" shredder, I'd use it. You know what? It's just as easy to tear stuff up with my hands, or use my scissors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product button does not work","review":"In the past I've owned several cheap brands of cheap cost shredder but their blade becomes dull quick . I purchased the MS450 hoping it would last a few years. We seldom use the MS450 except for tax season and do not shred more than 5 or 6 pages (regular paper) at one time. It is a seldom used paper shredder at my home.Since it has never jammed, we never had the need to press the reverse button to put it in reverse mode. During my maintenance (oiling) for the shredder, the Fellow web instruction said to push the forward button and then the reverse button . Sadly the reverse button did not work. Didn't even think of testing the Reverse button when I purchase the shredder two years ago. For a shredder costing over $200. and having it break down so quickly with seldom usage, it was not a good buy for me and I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is wrong","review":"Has now stopped shredding all together.Checking to see how much it will cost to send to Fellowes...they deserve this piece of junk. Warranty not a factor, Fellowes offers no repair service nor parts service to repair this beast.It is the worst example of functionality. Only runs the right way 5% of the time; most of the time it will only activate the switch when paper is placed in the slot...BUT not shred anything! Take the paper out and it reverses as if it had been jammed even though no paper present. Push the button to shred manually may work 1 out of 40 times...still it wants to reverse. I have cleaned the head many times (as well as possible...upside-down with picks) and lubricated it faithfully...no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHREDS ITSELF AFTER A YEAR OR SO","review":"This unit is very quiet and worked well for a year or so under light to medium duty. Then I attempted to shred three sheets of paper today and it stopped mid-stream. As I worked with it to get it restarted, it began to shed large pieces of itself (gray plastic) in the basket. Needless to say, it was toast. The cutting blades are steel, housed in plastic. Had the cutting assembly been housed in steel also, it probably would not have failed. Additionally, some types of paper caused the safety device to think someone was touching the unit and caused it to hault operation. That is a real pain to remove the partially shredded paper. I can recommend it if you want to replace it every year or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice unit. Very quiet.","review":"I have had this unit for well over 5 months, except for some paper bits not landing in the basket regardless of what I do (paper bag,etc), I like it. It would be a 5 star if it shredded (even just a crosscut)the credit cards and cd's, it just cuts them into strips. This unit is very very quiet and so far very reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shredder if Concerned About Identify Theif!!!","review":"Shredder works great! This Micro-cut shredder exceeded my expectation. Researched shredders for months, before deciding on the Fellowes Powershred MS 450Cs. Was hesitant to purchase because of cost. Well worth the cost and easy to use. If you're concerned about identity thief, this is the shredder for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly quiet, shreds into amazingly small pieces","review":"I purchased this product based on all of the positive reviews. I was not disappointed. It doesn't quite reduce documents to sawdust like a classified shredder, but this thing shreds documents into such small pieces I'm finally comfortable using it to destroy credit card statements, medical records, and other sensitive documents a lot of home shredders leave all too easily recoverable. I was a bit skeptical of all the reviews declaring how quiet this shredder runs--how can a shredder run quietly enough not to wake someone in the next room?--but it's true. This thing is amazingly quiet. Great product at a good price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality!!","review":"I did my research (off Amazon) before settling on this brand. Once I selected the Brand, then I went to Amazon for the best price!!! Years ago, I purchased a shredder from the big box store - and it was junk. Hardly worked, when it did, was sketchy at best. That one went in to the trash!! This is so easy to care for - once the bin is full, empty and oil the top. It will be some time before I fill the bin - since this is used for home office work. Highly recommend this product, it's very well made - you can tell as soon as you take it out of the box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Fellowes","review":"This shredder, the little brother of thePowershred MS-460Cs Safe Sense 10 sheet Confetti Cut Shredder, does a fine job of chopping bills, credit card offers, tax records, and junk mail into unrecognizable mincemeat. I really like the micro-shred feature, since cross-cut shredders leave pieces large enough to hold a credit-card or social-security number.It's best if you oil frequently -- 2 to 3 times per binful -- following the included instructions. Also, since junk mail often contains adhesives, plastic, or even coins, you should really go to the trouble of opening the envelope and shredding paper free of gunk and foreign objects.I bought this for my home and the 460CS for a separate professional office. They're both working like champs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for the money","review":"I owned this shredder for about two and a half years before it gave out on me. I kept it well lubricated and fed it a very weak diet of 3-5 papers at a time at most (more than this and it will take an absolute eternity to shred, moving the paper up and down very slowly as the shredder just doesn't have the power to get it done). The cut is very good, the safety features are nice, but the durability just isn't there. After discovering how much out-of-warranty service on my shredder would cost, I took it apart to see if I could fix it myself, only to discover that all of the gears and inner workings were made of plastic. The screw drive connecting the motor to the shredder blades had worn down until it had no teeth. I wouldn't buy another Fellowes without seeing inside the thing to determine its durability -- their mascot may be a bulldog, but the plastic parts inside wouldn't hold up to one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerhouse!","review":"I have had this shredder for just a few days, and I am very happy with it. Even though this unit costs $178, much more than the traditional shredders, it is well worth that expense. The shredder has four wheels, it is very quiet, the paper turns out shredded smaller than confetti, making it impossible to read. It has a safety feature that it will not work if there is something over the opening, like your hand, or a pet, or a child. I do notice that it gets hot after just a few minutes and the manual notes that it is not to be used more than 8 minutes at a time; this is a limitation, but overall, it turned out to be a great buy, and it arrived by FedEx, with no shipping charge, a savings of around $30, since this shreddeer weighs around 35 pounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellows MS-450Cs","review":"All I can say is WOW!!! Corny? Yes, but with good reason. This is my third paper shredder that I have owned and this thing is amazing. Calling this a Confetti Shredder is no exageration, if anything it's an understatement. I have not seen any other paper shredder shred paper like this one. I don't see any way someone could possibly piece your confidential papers back together after they get eaten by this beast. I saw on one review a complaint about paper dust, which this shredder does create. However the only area I noticed any signs of dust after using it was ontop of the shredder, my house didn't get covered with it. Another nice thing about this shredder is a seperate slot for CD's, Credit Card's, etc. It also comes with lubricating oil and big waste bags. It is a bit pricey but worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"My product did not work at all. I checked my power outlet and everything. I read the instructions (and I never do that). My shredder did not work OUT THE BOX. I purchased from Warehouse Deals. I'm highly disappointed. Waste of my time and money. I'm returning and expecting my refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shredder","review":"...as other have said before me, this shredder is quiet, very quiet! It also shreds paperwork into TINY pieces. Don't overfill the basket though as the small pieces make a terrible mess of things and are hard to clean up. Handles 5-6 sheets at a time easily but can handle more with each pass. I simply find the unit seems to be working to hard to handle 10pgs at a clip, especially if I expect the unit to live a very long life. I am perfectly happy with this shredder and would certainly recommend it to anyone for home and small office use which is what I use it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great shredder","review":"This shredder has been absolutely amazing. Takes the paper and really rips it into fine pieces that can't be put back together. What others have said about this leaving a fine layer of 'paper dust' is true, but it is a small tradeoff for what is essentially the best shredder you will ever own. Some pieces to get stuck in the blades, but if you turn it off and just swipe your fingers or a brush across the blades, they will come off easily. Hasn't once jammed on me yet and I have put this machine through its paces. It is meant to be a light duty shredder, however, I've put stacks of papers through it before, granted it needed to cool down when it deemed that it was overheated, but that really isn't a problem; in fact, I consider it an asset. Overall, this is a great shredder and it is one of the best purchases I have ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Random Impressions","review":"I have used my MS-Cs for 4 months with no complaints worth mentioning.

However, I was using it so much that I would lose the thread of what he was saying.) I'm reasonably well educated, read a lot and enjoy it. However, this book was not anything like what I expected.

A brief summary of the book would be:Gulliver's Travels is a book about a man named Gulliver who traveled through his world finding lands undiscovered by others. The lands that Gulliver stumbles upon consisted of people six inches high, 60 feet high, a floating land in the sky with people who thought the world would end when Gulliver came, and finally a land where horses ruled and kept a degenerate version of humans as pets. All of these visits to the different lands gave Gulliver a new outlook on his own culture by studying all of theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't make myself finish it","review":"This book has been on my Kindle for a year or so now.

I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow.

This was my second reading of the book, and I read it on my Kindle.

Yes, this saw will make 45-deg bevel cuts, but only at the end of a piece, not in the middle, and with pretty poor accuracy.

By way of disclosure, however, I generally do not care for live recordings because of the background noise and untimely applause. In terms of distracting applause, this CD is over the top--some in the audience get overly excited in the middle of some songs and start clapping. That ruins it for me. I wish I could find a studio recording of this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book...","review":"Let me say that I am a huge Bukowski fan. I absolutely adore Factotum, Women, Ham On Rye, Hollywood and Post Office. Unfortunately, this book is not of that caliber. In fact, Hot Water Music is so bad that it's hard to read. The stories aren't funny, are very repititious, and are pointless. I would say this book is about as bad as Pulp, which was horrible. Bukowski is just not a fiction writer. He's only good when he writes about his personal experiences. If you have exhausted all his novels and are looking for some decent Buk, South of No North is okay, but forgettable. Notes of a Dirty Old Man also is interesting, even worth rereading. But let this be a warning: Hot Water Music is terrible and so is Pulp, so don't buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO BUKOWSKI","review":"As an ardent fan of Bukowski and Henry Chinaski, this by far is my favorite book by Buk. If you haven't read any Bukowski but always wanted to, this is perhaps a great place to start. It's a series of short stories that give you a taste for Buk's writing. You'll either love him or hate him. There's no in between. But if you love this book, then you can look forward to many other fictional pieces by Buk that will delight you. Either that or after about three chapters you will want to go out and get drunk, or get laid! Enjoy! Buk is a God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buk at his finest","review":"Gripping stories and poems from a man forged by the tragedies of life.

I don't have a problem with live versions. In fact, in most cases, I prefer the live versions over the studio, but the live versions featured here are godawful.-The sound quality could be a lot better.Don't waste your money.

But they love these things. They have absolutely zero interest in other nylon chew toys. But these, they're addicted to. Maybe it's the nubbie things.

As a 40 year old woman I wanted to feel for the main character and feel there was some sense of morality in the story. But I was disappointed I'm afraid. In fact, I actually disliked just about every character in this book apart from Ruth.They were all so whiney, weak and hypocritical. The main character Natalie being one of the worst offenders. All in all, I just couldn't like these people.Add to that the amount of sections I found boring and tedious, that I had to skim through, and I guess I wish the book had been about 100 pages shorter. I suggest cutting down some of the length and making the main character more likeable. Then the story might just appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfying","review":"I realize this was the author's first novel and perhaps future novels will be better researched and written. I gave it two stars for the effort. I found it to be contrived and trite in much of it's phrasing and an unsatisfying ending.

Then of course you run into the ex and his girlfriend at dinner and have to leave from all the anger you're feeling. Everything is so awful, why am I reading this? Oh, that's right. I'm not.

I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited","review":"I'm surprised by all the glowing reviews of this book. I wasn't really rooting for Natalie so much as I was rooting against Kelly, Tony, and Miles. All in all, the plot was interesting and kept me reading. However, it became tedious to read through all the filler material that was irrelevant to the plot. The biggest hurdle for me was the extremely poor editing. I read this on my Kindle, so the editing may have been better in print form. However, names were spelled differently throughout the book (Maxine/Marine), and the wrong words were used throughout. The book is in definite need of a proofread. The plot is the only thing that kept me trudging through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"Seeing so many positive reviews, I was pretty disappointed by the book. Like someone else mentioned, I plodded on just to find out what happened to the antagonists, not necessarily because the main character was compelling. I can understand why a few readers were unable to get through the story though. I also skimmed toward the middle through to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot drags","review":"The book starts off okay. However, it bogs down early into the book. I felt like the writer was getting paid by the word.I read about 20% into the novel, stopped and skipped to about 95% into the novel. I didn't have a bit of a problem picking up the plot. Plus, all those things one knows will happen from the beginning of the book do happen.Any book that I can flip to the end, not be lost, and find completely predictable is not a book I can recommend.If the verbage had been reduced to novella length, it would have been much better.I also never cared about the heroine. One isn't expected to like the heroine in every book, but I'm pretty sure the reader was supposed to like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The media: worts and all","review":"I read about 1/3 of this book and couldn't care less about any of the characters.

I kept thinking, \\"okay, this has to get better\\". But no such luck. The only good thing about this book was that it was free. The story could have been good but it desperately needed an editor to cut out massive sections and correct typos. The reason it took so long to read was because I literally found myself changing the sentences in my head in order for them to flow or make sense. Simply put, it was too long and too overwritten for the type of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, easy read","review":"It's a good light read! Perfect for the beach or a long weekend.

I enjoyed this book and looked forward to finding out how everything was going to work out. As others have said, there are some grammatical errors, but the story is interesting, so the errors didn't really concern me all that much. I got this as a free download and it was definitely a nice find."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring....","review":"I got to about 20% on my Kindle and then had to quit. I'm not sure why everyone thinks it's so great because I found it boring. It feels like it is taking to long to lead up to anything and there is so much fluff that is not needed. Even Kelly, the villain, was boring. I do not recommend at all and I am VERY glad that I got it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time reading","review":"OMG - why would I care about these characters?

She is dealing with a separation from her husband, her career is going down the tubes and she is struggling to find a new one.

The plot idea is good, but I can't stand the characters. The heroine/underdog Natalie, comes off more as weary and run-down. Kelly is less of a love-to-hate but instead just immature, obnoxious and annoying. There is not a good connection/explanation of back story to Evie.

Then I bought a Kindle. And how happy am I? Very.The writer isn't skittish when showing stress bringing out hidden personality traits and muddled thinking in both the heroine and her nemisis. Fully expecting a quick downfall and a quicker return, I was pleasantly surprised when the author fleshed out the characters as they struggled.

It features vivid characters, a couple of which you will love to hate, including a truly clueless yet conniving young anchorwoman and a newsroom director who will do just about anything to get a bonus check. They were my favorite characters in this book, but there are certainly a couple of very endearing characters in the story as well.There's a little element of suspense, drama and romance running through the entire plot of this book, which makes it a very entertaining read.I did feel like this book gave me a peek into what it's really like to work in the TV industry in L.A. I really enjoyed it, and I would certainly recommend this book to other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, and a dull read","review":"Photo Projects is a disappointing book. First of all, much of the specific information about resources for publication has to do with the UK (the author is British). There are some useful general pointers at the beginning of each chapter about having projects published, portfolios, etc, but the author doesn't really address those things in the rest of the text. As a writer, this guy's a dud. Also, for my taste, the photography isn't very interesting. Bleh. This is the only photo-related book I've purchased that I've regretted.

The intro to each model year is very brief and then goes straight into VINs and paint codes. I also don't like how the options and prices are written in paragraph form instead of as a list. That makes it difficult to compare between model years.However, my biggest complaint are the book's \\"quality control\\" errors. There are a few spelling errors and there are no less than 10 pictures that are mislabled (example: a magnetic red convertible labled as an electron blue Z06). The price guide section also inexplicably contains the header: \\"The prices listed here represent a sample of British sports cars imported to North America, taken from the 2004 Old Cars Price Guide.

James and Martha Grimes. I picked this up hoping to find a new series. It reads like a Harlequin romance with a body in it. Everything aches - eyes ache, voices ache, the gaslights ache. Hardened policemen speak in voices husky with emotion. And everyone but the villain is so blindingly good hearted as to be disgusting. Throughout the story the author keeps building up to a horrible impending disaster - something so much worse and more terrifying than a cave-in. The disaster turns out, surprisingly enough, to be a cave-in. Absolutely tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, a disappointment","review":"I'm reviewing the audio version of this book.I'm sad to say, I didn't even finish listening to it, which is a bad sign in a murder mystery, when I don't even care that much who did it. The narrator was ok, but his accents were really exaggerated which I didn't enjoy. The story was a little dull and very slow moving and repetitive. Anne Perry always does a good job and creating a setting, but even this fell somehow flat. Sorry, but not a favourite of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disappointment.","review":"Ms. Perry's latest is sadly lacking in all the elements that generally make her fiction delightful. The characters are unformed, the plot is shaky at best, the background data of the making of the new sewers of London after the death of Prince Albert is so sparce that she simply repeats (entirely too often) the same bare facts that shifting earth and wandering underground waterways make all such excavations dangerous. I was profoundly disappointed at the lack of care that went into this novel since the series itself has been so satisfying up to this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading.","review":"Anne Perry has this time period down pat.

Every owner should have to read this before getting a puppy. Too many people think of puppies as cute little furballs but give little attention to their training. Even these adorable little dogs need strict training and discipline so they can rise to their best behavioral level. You'll learn all the things you SHOULD do to train your dog and many that you shouldn't like rubbing its nose in feces (who ever thought of that!). Obviously, some dog owners must be a bit daft. Do yourself a favor and read this book before committing to raising a puppy. No one should get a puppy unless they are prepared to work at being a good trainer. Even this forgiving and friendly breed needs structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my pup!","review":"After having to say good-bye to my 10-year old Golden on Mother's Day, we decided to make Father's Day a happier occasion with our new little Golden, \\"Lucy.\\" I made so many mistakes in the puppy stage with our beloved Chloe and house training took a VERY long time. Lots of damage, messes, etc. This book is extremely helpful in giving simple, understandable instructions on the do's and don'ts of puppyhood. We have had Lucy only 9 days and already she is \\"getting it\\" which is so amazing to me! The book is written in a humorous vein and the important points are highlighted so even the biggest idiot can comprehend the mindset necessary for training this gorgeous little new best friend.

Howard McGhee, Phineas Newborn, Ray Brown all interact, in jazz it doesnt get much better than this. Good Gravy, Inimitable and Horn To Horn are the other three that i'm compelled to revisit regularly. Thanks Teddy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOGETHER AGAIN, thank God!","review":"This CD, although recorded almost 50 years ago is so lush and energized. Teddy Edwards is a gem and takes his music to new highs while Howard McGhee's horn transports the listener to new highs of excitment and his reputation for a lush sound is in every note. These two men, who have rocked together on many dates leave us, once again, blessed to have their music live on for future generations to know and remember. This is one for any serious collector to have and be able to play over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Freud and this book inspired me to read his other works","review":"I purchased this book as an introduction for myself to Freud's philosophies and I was very glad that I made the purchase. This book is very easy to read (I am sure that Freud did that on purpose) and inspired me to read other Frued books. I wasn't particularily thrilled about the forward in this edition, but I guess it was decent enough. Still gave 5 stars because I think that Freud (in particular this work) is an amazing read. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Civilization and Its Discontents","review":"I am officially in love with Freud. He doesn't write from a philosopher's point of view, so his work doesn't have the dry, didatic tone to it. Freud is direct and concise, his vocabulary is relatable; and he even has some comic undertones. Once you get into this piece, you'll finish in no time, no doubt with a new appreciation for Doc Sigmund : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"I read this book at age 18 after getting interested in psychiatry by an author named Karl Menninger. Freud's essay, Civilization and Its Discontents, has had the greatest impact on my life out of any book or experience. Within this short book he had taken my whole view of the world, turned it upside-down, and added an exclamation point. To understand this book doesn't require great intellectual power but rather mental capacity i.e, a capacity to receive a massive dose of pessimism! I would add almost as a warning that Freud's implied philosophy is almost conducive to depression in a maladjusted mind! If you want hope or faith, this is not for you. Regardless, everybody should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"thx","review":"i got this book 2nd i ordered 3 at the same time. i was so happy to get it. the book arrived promptly and in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Civilized Discourse Leaves Discontented Reader","review":"There isn't much I can add to previous reviews of Civilziation and Its Discontents. My own reaction (after 2 cracks at it, one in college, and one post-) is one of bafflement and boredom. With academic, convoluted language, Freud discusses the role of the individual with his neuroses and his conflicts with socialization and civilization. Many of his jumbled sociological observations are better recorded by previous thinkers--Rousseau, for example. His psychological conclusions have more or less been explored at length in his previous works. Therefore, the redeeming value is found, perhaps, in Freud's closing passages, eery portends of Europe's ugly years."},{"rating":"1","title":"am i crazy? or dumb?","review":"I am reading this book for a THIRD time. It's a required book for an introductory composition class I'm taking. The fact that my teacher asks his students to read this book AT LEAST three times should have been a clear warning sign. It is the most round-about, long-winded and dense book or writing I have ever come across. I'm shocked that it's such a popular book, a landmark they say. Although Freud does have many interesting ideas, they could be stated MUCH more simply. What a HEADACHE!Nevertheless, those who enjoy convoluted, intricate and time-intensive reading are likely to seriously appreciate this book. HOWEVER, for those who prefer simple sentences and straightforward writing, like myself, this is NOT the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Famous but short book by the father of id.","review":"Freud's point of view on humanity and its inhumanity is summed up in this dissertation.

According to CCR history, John Fogerty allowed the other band members,including his brother, to have more control over direction, song selection, and production on this release. The result was fatal. But, I would replace the cd if necessary because of the input by Fogerty. It's still decent music."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't replace John Lennon from The Beatles with Larry the Cable Guy!","review":"UGH!!! To say that this album stinks would be an insult to bad smells everywhere! This album proves once and for all that John Fogerty was the REAL talent behind the band!

Sadly, this, their last album, is a two-star release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitively worse and the final Creedence album!","review":"I'd thought this cd was any good but i was wrong it's not. I think that CCR should be a shamed of their record company industry for putting them in charge of lots a hard work like Stu Cook, bassist and drummer Doug Clifford don't even sound great except John Fogerty performing only four song tracks are OK included which are \\"Lookin' For A Reason\\", \\"Sweet Hitch-Hiker\\", \\"Hello Mary Lou\\" and \\"Someday Never Comes\\" are classics here. But those were the days when guitarist Tom Fogerty left and the pressure, tension & strain got to them alreadyit was time for Creedence Clearwater Revival to break-up. And also going into a different direction for three memebers from the band years together. So anyway in my opinion TWO THUMBS WAY DOWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry...","review":"...this album just blows. Not enough John, too much of Doug & Stu. Neither one of them can sing.

Well, as a quartet CCR never made a bad 33 1/3, but as a trio they stunk. The trios live album \\"Live In Europe\\" was a fake (read my review) and their one studio work was a bad joke. I bet Tom Fogerty was laughing at this release. By 1972, Creedence was officially pronounced dead!01. Lookin' for a Reason - 4/1002. Take It Like a Friend - 1/1003. Need Someone to Hold - 3/1004.

While Hello Mary Lou and Lookin' For A Reason are unexplainably on Volume two."},{"rating":"2","title":"BADLY UNDERATTED","review":"Critics and close minded people lambast this album. However, the material is really pretty good. It just has a Country twang to it. On this disc, John Fogerty shared the singing and song-writing responsibilites with his band mates. Whereas John was the major talent in the band, the other band members made some nice contributions. Stuart Cook's singing leaves alot to be desired but Doug's happy go lucky sounding voice is very pleasant. Whereas John Fogerty went on to record some fine solo albums, he seems to be harboring too much of a grudge against his former band mates. This grudge is what kept the band from staying together longer. John may be a very talented man, but he should learn to let bygones be bygones. Anyway, like all other Creedence Albums, this is worthwhile for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"ccr goes out with a whimper","review":"they don't call this album \\"fogertys' revenge\\" for nothing.

The Haiti stories are unrelentingly depressing, while the New York stories are uplifting. Danticat's inspiration seems to come from family stories about Haiti and perhaps her family's experience as immigrants to the US. However, I recognized one dream sequence involving a character's father in a helicopter over a cliff as being lifted entirely from the movie \\"Paperhouse\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Touching stories that paint a vivid picture.

I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to be embraced by culture and to brave the sorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!","review":"This is the kind of book that is too short and is too hard to find---its precious. The writing combines real-life experience with folklore and spiritual beliefs in a way that is breathtaking and fully believeable.I read the first book--Breath, Eyes, Memory and was a bit disappointed after it got rave reviews that it wasn't more like this. This book is brilliant and it deserves comparison with Jean Rhys, Toni Morrison, Jamaica Kincaid, Alice Walker and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Probably one of the best books by an American writer in the last 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Successful on two levels","review":"The stories in this collection succeed on two levels.First, they transport you to a place you haven't been, the horror and terror of poverty-stricken Haiti.Second, there is an arc to the collection as a whole. The stories taken together aren't as grim or horrifying as each one by itself. Together they tell of strength and perseverance in the face of difficulties and long odds.Some of the stories are a little ragged, but the book in total is a riveting read.Bill Chance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Krik? Krak!","review":"This collection of nine short stories was somewhat depressing to read. The stories of, for the most part, poverty stricken Haitian people were very intense and hard to believe. These stories show the amazing will power of these people despite the harsh oppression facing them. Danticat is a wonderful writer especially since she started at such a young age. Her different writing styles and technique make the reading very interesting and unique. She also uses a form of poetry that is very well done. I read a brief Haitian history after reading the book and this proved to be extremely helpful in a better understanding. Overall The writing was wonderful, but the stories a little intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antonio Sanchez Ms Jones 6th Period","review":"This book was really interesting, and what made it so interesting was the way every single passage was made with lively characteristics. Every single thing in the story was put with so much characteristics, that i thought i was really there living the same tragedy. What i also liked was the way the many different perspectives were made to make ONE SINGLE CONNECTION. Everybody lived that same life and everybody gave their effort to make a different living out of what they had already experienced. The only thing that disapointed me was the constant usage of wings and blood, which made me think that they were symbolically placed there, but it just made me more confused about what i was reading. I dont want to comment a lot about the book because then i will throw off that main idea, but this is a nice book if you are trying to experience the reality of what is still going on to this day on Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Atmospheres, Vivid Storytelling, Deep Emotions","review":"Krik? Krak! forces the reader into a world in which many people suffer, men are forced upon women, and mothers lament over their dead children. Krik? Krak! is an extremely deep novel that creates a deep sympathetic feel in the reader, even if he/she was ignorant to any of the events in Haiti. If ever you thought that the world was perfect, then this book brings you outside of that box, for Edwidge Danticat acts as the voice for all those silenced Haitians and tells a tale that may have been left untold for so long. This book is far from your average historic novel, it goes so deep into the emotion, into the thoughts, into the physical feel of the characters, that even you cannot help but admire the context of the book.This book proved to me that the world really isn't perfect, and I doubt it will ever be. It caught me slightly off guard at times, but Edwidge's writing style captivates you and forces you into the book once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krik?Krak!","review":"This book is composed of short stories presented to us almost in the fashion of a poem. It tells of Hatian people,women in particular, who show outstanding resiliency to spirit bounding rulers and soilders. Women who continued to love after heart-break and kept the memory of one another alive through story-telling and imagination.Each story is a piece of anothers life, put together to combine a life-story that will last for many years to come. The result is a collection that saddens,angers, and enlightens the reader with its poetic beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kric Krac","review":"I am in High school and recntly read Kric Krac for Englich.

THis is an amazing book!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped, overpraised and overtly sentimental","review":"I first heard about the book when it was nominated for the National Book Award. I expected a short-listed book to be of a high standard at the very least but this book was a total disappointment. The writing is plain, dull and the 'poetry' that many reviewers talk of is lacking. Whilst the subject matter is painful, you feel as if the writing is too contrived and its primary purpose is to aim a few darts at the heart. This kind of sentimental and melodramatic writing is hardly the material of great or good literature. It reads like the 'tragic' tales section of certain tabloids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic","review":"To be honest I got about 20 pages into this book before I decided I wouldn't finish it. I passed it off to my cousin, since he is the one who told me I HAD to read this book. Although I was not born in Haiti, both of my parents were and thus my entire life has been enwtined in both American and Haitian culture. I am also recieving my graduate degree in writing. Therefore as both a Haitian, and a writer I cannot give this book good reviws. She can write...fine. But what about the substance? What about the THING that makes me want to keep reading? I was particulary annoyed that she didn't stay true to our culture. There were moments when I wanted to scream at her,\\" You know we don't do that!\\". I haven't given up on her and plan to read more of her work, but she better wow me the next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising Cultural Portrayal","review":"Great portrayal of the cultural identity of Haiti.

I was not anxious to read it however; after reading it I began to feel connected with the author. Even though none of these storeis are true to life, the ideas that they are based on are amazing. How anyone could survive under the circumstances is incredible. When people think of Haiti most of them would say that there were colorful costumes and all the inhabitants are delightful. Krik Krak depicts Haiti as a dark militarized place in which the unspeakable happens. This book had changed my life. Now I know what I have based on what others are lacking and it showed me so much of what I take for granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"mrs. jones 6th period","review":"Krik!Krak? was a very interesting book. This book gave me a lot of insight on the Haitian culture. Although the book was written in the form of several short stories, they all intertwined with each other in one aspect or another. The book focused a lot on the women of Haiti and the various struggles they faced living in the 20th century. Krik!Krak? is a very good book to read it you want to find out about Haiti during a time when it was very rough to live there, while finding out how various women faced their problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stirring the Heart with a Breeze","review":"Reading Danticat's splendid collection of stories gives you access to a world of people and places that you will grow to love.

This book brings to reality the story of the history of the haitian women. The government of Haiti was corrupt and extremely poor. The novel tells a tale of the strife and hate that the Haitian women were subjected to. Women in the story were thought to be wrong for trying to survive and live throughout the times of chaos in Haiti. this book also tells of the story of Haitians in America, it describes how they try to recover their history and hold on to their past.

Predicably, it's the same program (actually with a few minutes extra), with the high-quality picture and sound of a DVD.I was a bit disappointed, however, that the entire first episode was dubbed in English, with no optional audio channel with the original dialogue. On TV the two German narcotics cops spoke German with English subtitles. It was more real, and that was the version I was accustomed to. The latter episodes on the DVD were OK (They spoke German with subtitles)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Poor Quality as Before","review":"This review is only on the 20th Anniversary Edition. Traffik remains a 5-star drama in my mind, one of the best miniseries ever produced. But the 20th Anniversary Edition is the same (poor) video quality as the 2001. I don't know what they \\"remastered\\" for it looks exactly the same as the one I bought in 2001. Subtitles are still hard-coded and spotty. They do not appear for conversations that are peripheral to the main dialog. The original version at least had these dubbed. It was not my preferance, but it was better than no translation at all.If you already have the 2001 version, don't bother with the \\"new\\" one. It's just an attempt to sell the same old video."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is unwatchable","review":"I'm strongly in the minority here, and I desperately wanted to share in the celebration of this series, but, as one or two other reviewers have noted here, the horrendous quality of the transfer and the almost comically bad dubbing stopped me from getting through the first hour.The opening sequences in Germany had me checking to see if I had the right DVD in the player. I felt like I was watching a C-grade German action flick from the '70s (if there ever was such thing!). Follow that up with Pakistani farmers speaking in borderline Apu Nahasapemapetalan (the Kwikee Mart owner from The Simpsons) -esque accents and I just couldn't take it.I'm holding out hope that one day they issue a DVD of the \\"original\\" version that another reviewer mentioned, where the dialogue is subtitled as it should be.As I said, most people won't care a lick about this kind of thing, but if dubbing and poor print quality bug you, stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational and motivation tool","review":"I was amazed by how quickly a student took to spelling and word recognition with this aid.

That there is the visual reference (in the color coded tiles, organization of the tiles themselves, associated illustrations, even the bumps on the back of the tile pieces), is great!! I wish there were additional word templates available to purchase for when a student had finished all the included templates. The templates themselves are a little flimsy, but they are supported by the plastic box in which they rest. This is one of the best aids I have found for students with mild autism.

The headband is made of plastic, so it's really not all that surprising they broke. Although, the packaging says they were made in Taiwan. I'm accustomed to high manufacturing standards for things from Taiwan, but it goes to show you, cheap goods can be made anywhere.

You have to remove the ear cushion to get to the battery. Because of the tight fit, you have to push against the electronics to get enough purchase to pop them off.

The sound amplification is not nearly as good as the old pair, nor is the sound attenuation. Now the right muff has developed static.

I called Peltor they said that I should just buy another pair.Not likely I have a pair of MSA Sordin Supreme basic that work great.

With my Howard Leights I could hear quite clearly the animals, insects, and our foot steps as we walked. STRIKE TWO. Lastly, the knobs came off several times just handling the things.

But then we learn that he does tons of charity fundraisers and secretly organizes parties for nerds, who need a little help with their social lives. He even helps talk a guy out of killing himself. Unfortunately, all of that is lost in really bad humor. In particular, the Bulldog pastry-eating scene. Then there's the tired, overdone jokes: the sex-starved old-woman, the sex-starved foreign exchange student, the sex-starved high-IQ nerds. Tara Reid's character is devoid of personality, and her boyfriend, naturally, is completely unlikable. Reynolds is funny, but he could do so much better with a better movie. As best it's disappointing, at worst it's disqusting. Rent it when you have a freebie coupon."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disgusting, terrible movie","review":"Wow. I saw this movie (most of it) two days ago. Several scenes in this movie are so disgusting I almost {got sick}, and I've watched people doing nasty things on {other shows} without flinching.

Van Wilder's the man in college we all dreamed of being. He's a modern day college version of Ferris Bueller.The movie lives up to the National Lampoon standard. It has all the laughs and witty lines you would normally come to expect from a National Lampoon series flick. The predictability isn't as horrid as many of the modern day teen comedy films (Tomcats, American Pie, etc) and isn't quite as low brow as the Scary Movie series.Definately not a movie to watch with your teens or kids, though.Overall a funny movie and worth watching. Not to mention worth having for the DVD Collection..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy ... is this Bad!","review":"Having read reviews ranging from very positive to very negative, I decided to find out for myself. All I can say is \\"Stay Away!\\"Tara Reid seemed like a walking corpse through this flick, and the characters were weak, the jokes not funny, and the story non-existant. A poor excuse of an American Pie rip-off.The only bright spot in the film is Ryan Renolds as Van, but even he got tired quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal House -- NOT","review":"This film provides a hackneyed plot that I presume is supposed to be a vehicle for some really gnarly gross-out humour (of the Something About Mary variety). While I smiled a bit at a couple of the gags, mostly the movie was really slow and lame. For instance a key scene involves Van Wilder trying to talk a guy out of suicide while not wearing any pants. I mean that's not a joke, it's just stupid. It might be funny if you are drunk enough, but this is about 20 steps below American Pie (think American Pie II) and is not worth the price of a rental, much less purchasing.Comparing this to the original Animal House is like comparing Mozart to Britney Spears. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"Ryan Reynolds is the Chevy Chase of his era&that can be good or bad depending on where you stand.

But beyond a few arguments, there is nothing here to make someone feel like the story should have ever been told, if there were a story at all.Conflict sure.Climax... sorta....Resolution... not really.Just, a few bickers, a flighty affair, and then, nothing.Nothing is changed, solved or resolved.Again, actors are great, the story is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and moving story of a very modern family","review":"This is one of those modern, unconventional California families: two lesbian moms who have given birth to a son and daughter by way of a sperm donor, whom the kids choose to meet when they get old enough to do so. Conflicts ensue as the couple's problems surface with a vengeance, one partner has a fling with the donor daddy, and the kids are caught up in the turmoil.The actors turn in very strong performances here, and the script and direction are good as well.

No scene is wasted. The controlling spouse is played masterfully by Annette Bening who may have done the best performance of all.It's amazing watching the characters' unconscious motives unfold, especially the father played by Mark Ruffalo, who, unbeknownst to himself, wants to take over the family for himself, that is to say, take one of the mothers and adopt the children. In other words, he wants an instant family without doing any of the work.

However,throwing in the biological father would have been enough on its own, the affair, another obstacle, but the twist felt forced and upset the balance of the film, which then took focus off of the \\"kids being alright\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"In turns funny, sad, tense, poignant, and comforting","review":"Astonishingly realistic portrayals of people who experience drama without histrionics - like actual mature people do. The story is in turn funny, sad, tense, poignant, and comforting. It's great to see a movie where the characters aren't caricatures and to see them embodied by such skillful and committed actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite poor viewing experience a Good Film","review":"Have yet to see a better American movie this year. Mia Wasikowska somehow held her own against a strong performance by Bening. Wasikowska may have been the best actor in the film. Moore overacted in a few scenes but her character seemed to be written that way. The story didn't seem contrived or overly precious at all. Just a good story well told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting for Bening","review":"No one can fault the acting in this film. I generally like Annette Bening in her roles until this one. She is mentally, emotionally and physically repulsive. Her character is so vile as to cause actual nausea. The children are spoiled brats, and the spouse (moore) is spineless. This is just a lame story about a weak minded individual. So terrified she is of losing anyone due to her lack of substance, she is a tyranical hun. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overrated","review":"So a movie is good if the male character is treated like garbage, I suppose... this review contains spoilers. At the end, Mark Ruffalo's character is referred to as an interloper by Annette Bening's character. He was not the one who interfered with anyone else's life, though. They interfered with his life by seeking him out and getting in touch with him. The message also seems to be that heterosexual sex is evil (because it involves a male) and lesbian sex is the purest, most saintly sex possible. Would the people who like this movie be happy if all the men in the world just killed themselves right now? Would that satisfy them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it.","review":"I hated this movie, but not because of the subject matter, rather I hated the acting by the Hollywood superstars (so predictable, not genuine or believable at all) and I really hated the disrespectful way the topic of same sex marriage/relationships was handled. It was so cliche' and felt very disrespectful. The material was there, but the director and the actors flubbed it. My favorite part of this movie was the development of the relationship between father and daughter. That felt real and authentic and likely, although I find it hard to believe that a guy who was so seemingly immature could be such a successful entrepreneur in today's volatile consumer market. I was also not thrilled with all the gratuitous sex that seemed to be thrown in just to hold our attention when the acting couldn't. Such a disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hopeful, but disappointed","review":"I was hopeful, yet disappointed in the plot line and complete dismissal of Mark Ruffalo's character in the end. Film had strong character development, a great cast, and was well acted~ the kids were very strong(*****). Hope to see them in future films."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of 2010's Best Films","review":"A bittersweet comedy-drama with fine performances and perceptive direction by Lisa Cholodenko (who collaborated with Stuart Blumberg on the screenplay). Despite a few predictable story turns, \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" looks at the family unit in a refreshingly offbeat manner. The film slowly gets under your skin thanks in part to the effortless chemistry between Annette Bening and Julianne Moore - complemented by Mark Ruffalo's best portrayal in years. Expect a few Oscar nominations for this unconventional gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ending!","review":"Mark Ruffalo played a great character in this movie, and I was disappointed that he was blamed for everything and chased away at the end of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting!","review":"The 2 female leads are so entertaining.

Life is very messy. The gay moms is totally all right with me. We are a product of our heritage and environment. This said, I felt horrible for the kids dad who was invited into their lives. I felt no sympathy for the moms. Kids are kids and all they knew was a life with the moms. No, the kids are not all right, ultimately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not alright","review":"The idea of even introducing into this movie a scummy creep that demands his \\"friend\\" hold down an innocent stray dog so he can pee on the dogs head is so perverted and deplorable. You have lesbians raising a family & then meeting the sperm doner. That is the theme of the movie. A family. What in the name of God does such animal cruelty have to do with the script? They didn't need to include that scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: UNFUNNY, TOO-'CLEVER', HEART-RENDING","review":"One-star due to false labeling this film \\"funny/smart/heart-warming\\" when it is truly \\"unfunny/too-'clever'/heart-rending\\" True, the acting is superb and the writing feels spot-on at many points. But the plot is soooooooo contrived and the characters are so distorted so as to overshadow the acting and writing. From my perspective, one can view this film as 'funny' and 'heart-warming' only in a sick/bad/shallow way. Because the truth of the film is otherwise to experience this film as gross/inauthentic/mean-spirited. Earns one-star because zero is not an option and because Bening and Moore soldier through with great performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I did not care for the movie. I don't like sex scenes. I think they are unnecessary to tell the story. I like Julianne Moore. There are lesbian scenes in case someone is squeamish.

It then broke across the bridge of the nose. I knew nothing of any warranty, so, she has just lived with it. I am very disappointed. I DO NOT recommend this product. No warranty, no sale.

Huge improvement over the paper-type masks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few months of use","review":"Product worked well for me for awhile. I actually really liked using it.After a few months of general usage, the mask piece itself broke on me. One of the plastic clips which attached the straps to the mask snapped became unusable. I might have received a defective item, based on the other reviews for this product. But overall I am very dissatisfied with the quality of this piece of safety equipment.

I would only recommend it to kill time, if you have lots of it, as you will be spending 15 minutes trying to remove the DVD and then almost 2 hours watching this mediocre movie. So, to open the DVD I had to destroy the entire packaging down to removal of the cover.

I found this movie, and previewed it, wondering if my college prep class would get anything out of it, but they were fascinated! Salaam Bombay is a VERY different type of filmmaking from what they usually see, and they noticed the long, lingering shots; the muted color palate; and the untutored acting of the cast. I would have loved to have had more information for them about Indian culture, so I could have answered some of their more difficult questions, but I found what I could on the web."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salaam Bombay!","review":"Having seen most of director, Mira Nair's other films, I felt I was long overdue for this one, and I WAS! I find it hard to believe that she was only 30 years old when she directed this very powerful film. Of course, location was important in its impact on the viewer, but it took me several days for the visual force of this film to leave my mind. Actually, I watched it again, a week later, and found it all the more touching and overwhelming in how it depicts an amazing culture and the more amazing street children of Bombay. Nair brings a huge sensitivity and compassion to her subject matter, and while I wish I had seen it sooner, I am grateful that I have at least seen it now, and will again, many times in the future. The message is clear: we are all one people, one heart, one blood, and we must all take care of one another, AND this planet, or we will ALL perish.

It baffled me that this man would go through so much just to survive. He had no one else to live for but himself.

Although written decades ago, and so much history has gone by since, it is still a vivid portrayal of one man's desperate travels to freedom. Imagine lying helplessly in a snowbank for weeks, totally relying on the kindness of strangers for survival.A true story, carefully compiled by the people Jan met along his incredible journey, it would be considered unrealistic, and impossible if written as fiction. It is really difficult to consider the circumstances where one would carefully amputate his own toes, with a few drops of brandy as an aesthetic.Impossible to put down, it races through a journey few can imagine. A must for everyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs to be made into a movie","review":"Definitely worth reading. It's a fascinating story. The back cover blurb and Stephen Ambrose's foreward both compare it to Slavomir Rawicz's \\"The Long Walk\\", but it's actually better than Rawicz's tale, mostly because it's so well-documented. David Howarth takes great care in synchronizing the various accounts and piecing together the story; the included photos of the locations and people mentioned in the narrative also helped to cement its believability. I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in WWII history or adventure stories in general.

The last half of the book I took in one sitting. We hardly care about the protagonist, Jan Baalsrud, as a personality. He has remarkable courage and incredible physical stamina but little spiritual depth. In the hands of a lesser writer, his story could easily have degenerated into a limp survival yarn of the sort regularly published in Reader's Digest. But Howarth gives meaning to the story both through his fine description of the harsh natural world and by his sympathetic treatment of the dozens of volunteers who came to Baalsrud's rescue. Their attempt to rescue one soldier at the risk of their lives became a political as well as a humanitarian cause, virtually the only blow these Norwegians could strike against German invaders in the wastelands of northern Scandinavia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The will to live.","review":"An incredible story of survival that is well told.

And it seems that the British find a certain sense of humor in learning about the crazy (Colonists) Americans. Some ten years ago the author found a series of strange Americans and did a book and TV series about them.In this book he comes back to America to visit the people he had written about earlier. And boy did he find some strange ones. There's the UFO crowd, the porn movie makers, hookers at a brothel (a legal brothel in Nevada), militants in Idaho.Maybe it's because I've seen this sort of thing on the news too many times, but I found the people he visited to be rather sad. To go be weird at spring break is one thing. To still be doing the same things ten years later is not showing much growth in maturity. It's fascinating to read about them, and at the same time be glad that I missed at least a few of these phases in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call of the Weird","review":"This book is little more than a rehash of a film produced by the author some 10 years earlier, as a BBC documentary. The people revisited by the author are more sad than weird, and it became apparent that the author has been unable to move beyond what he views as his \\"great\\" triumph. The only thing weird that called to me, was the Bush Bashing that he manages to work into every storyline in an odd and forced fashion. My advice is to wait for this book at your nearest garage sale for 50 cents..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Companion to Louis Theroux's Documentaries","review":"If you have enjoyed any of Louis Theroux's \\"Weird Weekends\\" or other documentaries, this book will bring you back to the world of the unique and, well, weird, people he has visited in his shows. Theroux revisits nazis, gangster rappers, legal prostitutes, UFOlogists, and other fringe groups in the same humanizing but honest way he did on television. Somehow he has the ability to interview people whose core beliefs he disagrees with by stating his own point of view without offending them (usually) and delving into the person behind the beliefs.If you're unfamiliar with Theroux's film work, I'd recommend checking it out before reading this book. I'm sure the book can still be enjoyed without the background context, but it will be better understood if you have already met the subjects and, most importantly, Theroux."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Interesting","review":"While the book is worthwhile to read on its own, I'd strongly recommend that people people view the televised initial encounters with these people before reading it. Many of them can be found on Youtube. Actually seeing \\"Korton\\" talk....you have to see it...hilarious. It really adds a lot to this addendum of what has happened to them. I've been a fan of his documentaries for a while, they are both humorous and interesting. He's a witty character whose interest in \\"different\\" subjects is something I find fascinating to see. It was an interesting change up to delve into his world of weirdness in a written format, and I hope there is more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut Type Craziness - Enjoy!!!","review":"Vonnegut type craziness plus television's version of reality gives this book a chance to define what is really weird from UFO cults to gurus to drug-crazed musicians"},{"rating":"1","title":"Urgh!!","review":"Another useless webpage design crap.

Loosely organized by chapter into various topics, it touches upon such subjects as what makes a \\"true\\" Roman (it's more than just living there), the impossibly temperamental system of government, the vagaries of historically categorizing Roman places, people, and events, and the joys of wandering Trastevere, one of the oldest and most representative of Rome's many neighborhoods. Romangnoli probably never intended this collection to be either guidebook or memoir, simply the setting down on paper of his thoughts and impressions of a place he knows well and loves dearly. Reading these essays brings back memories of visits to the Eternal City and evokes a bit of its essence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant, but doesn't reach any great heights.","review":"It seems that anyone who has lived abroad, (especially if the abode was in Tuscany or the South of France), feels compelled to write about it. This book makes for a pleasant read, but is somewhat predictable in its adherence to that genre of travel/living abroad school of writing. I found the book had some useful and amusing facts, but a lot of the in-depth encounters with other Romans added nothing to my interest in that city.

It presents information on a number of topics usually not covered by other authors, like the order of the various preparations and rituals, the different lineages of stupa proportions and translations of a number of sutras and Tibetan texts on the contents of stupas and on stupa proportions. So as a reference book it's indispensable, despite the fact that it's literary style lacks fluency. As always with [semi-] scientific writings on anything Tibetan, the text is interspersed with Tibetan and Sanskrit phonetics which tend to become tiresome after a while. However, what matters is the presented information, which I find very useful. If you're just looking to deepen your understanding of the symbolism of stupas, or to learn about practices related to stupas, there are a number of better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first by this author.","review":"I'm not sure exacty what the author was trying to portray in this book. I didn't pick up on any particular train of thought where the protagonist, Carol Wilcox, was concerned.

As with most releases, the vast bulk bores away with monotonous instrumentation masquerading as minimalism, except this time we witness her interpretations of certain cover songs. When she holds back enough out of respect it often works best, but her choices are bland- Sea of Love almost works before it becomes tediously repetitious like most of 'em.

From these songs, you can tell that this woman has identified and captured the heart of the songs, the little nuggets of truth nestled within layers of confusion, and it is beautiful. The album is trying to be transparent where everyone else is trying to hide the musical ball. If you have ever listened to songs looking for these nuggets, for the real purpose and source of a song, you will hold this album deep in your heart and can ease the loneliness of feeling like you are the only one who can see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice as gorgeous as she is.","review":"Covers records can be such a tricky thing. There are inherent dangers for an artist trying to pull one off. Do you do it exactly like the original? No one wants to hear that. Do you place the song in a new genre? Ugh, Madonna's \\"American Pie\\" has shown the world the errors of THAT. I mean, just think of that awful Duran Duran cover record (Simon LeBon singing Public Enemy's \\"911 is a Joke\\"?) or Guns N Roses \\"Spaghetti Incident.\\" Ew.Chan Marshall, however, manages to do it right on this album. Just listen to what she does on the opening track, with the Rolling Stones' \\"Satisfaction.\\" Just as you get over the confusion of the song sounding completely different, Chan's voice kicks in and says, \\"for the next half hour, these songs are mine.\\"And once you hear her beautiful version of \\"Sea of Love\\", all harp and creaky voice, you should agree. It's a perfect late night, sitting around smoking cigarettes kind of album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chan Performs Well in Concert","review":"It's generally known that Chan Marshall (aka Cat Power) gives bad show because she gets insecure and freaked out and tends to get upset when she makes mistakes. She's also just kind of weird. So it was against my better judgement when I attended her recent show at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, after have attended two shows in NYC over the last few years.Hair covering her face like a Ramone, she interupted nearly every song, but every song was as gorgeous as it is on The Covers Record. The raw beauty of her voice is amazing, accompanying herself with such spare intstrumentation. Weaving one song into another, she stopped only to switch from electric guitar to piano (as on the album). You'll need to listen to the album many times before you can truly appreciate its loveliness. Then see her live. Forgive her insecurity and hesitations, even cheer her on. But she will move you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated Folksy Boho Ballads, Dig It!!","review":"If you like John Cale, Mazzy Star, Nico, Cowboy Junkies, Sara MacLachlan or Nina Simone, this is something you need to hear. With a lyrical voice like an Appalachian angel, and lilting accompaniment on piano, guitar and harpsichord, Cat Power manages to sound sparse and rich simultaneously. Soft but strong, it's ideal music for sipping cocktails and just chillin' with friends. This is a real find, one of those CDs your guests will ask about when you play it. It's pointless to compare her versions of these covers to the originals. Her renditions stand alone. Unlike so MANY other derivative artists you've heard lauded as the next great thing, Cat Power's sound is truly unique and extremely listenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MELLOW","review":"Chan Marshall has a great voice.

Try another Cat Power CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didnt meet my expectations","review":"I had heard so many good things about Cat Power that I have to say I was a bit disappointed in this CD. It is really good, dont get me wrong. I just felt that the couragious interpretations of some of these songs would have benefited from different treatments. Cat Power seems to have one sonic mood -- and it's down. This works on some of the tracks (Sea of Love, Satisfaction), but some of the others left me kind of cold. I think the sad covers of already sad songs (Red Apples, Troubled Waters)may have been a bit redundant. Good, but kind of heavy handed.

Monk's songs are mostly played for laffs, at the level of Rick Dee's \\"Disco Duck\\" (if you like that sort of thing).To be fair (and hence the second star) this release makes no pretense of being anything other than what it is, a retro cheesy novelty Moog record.

No big deal i thought and the clock worked very well...Until this morning when it would refuse to display the time, sound the alarm or even play the radio. All of this after only owning it for 2 weeks.

That's right, this clock is actually LESS useful, and MORE problematic than another clock without the \\"smartset\\" feature.I wouldn't have a problem with this if I had bought the product before congress changed daylight savings time, but they thought it was enough to include a note rather than actually FIX THEIR PRODUCT!I intend to return this thing tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"great promise, terrible delivery","review":"I too liked the automatic clock setting feature.

The monolithic subterranean cityscape that serves as a backdrop for the story inspires a pervading sense of oppressive grandeur and silent malignancy. Likewise, the bizarrely jabbering and deformed monstosities that haunt the depths of its concrete labyrinths are truly the stuff of nightmares. The sheer scale of the city dwarfs the few humans to no more than crumbs or specks.Nihei's rough and expressionistic style bleeds raw emotion onto the page with savage scratchings and spatterings of ink, bringing to mind Piranesi and the etchings of Rembrandt. The storytelling is exceptional - novel camera angles heighten the drama and quick, sharp action sequences punctuate extended intervals of isolation. All in all Blame is a thoroughly entertaining and horrific read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Tokyopop Localization","review":"The text font was unbecomingly juvenile and was too reminiscent of American comic books.

Unfortunately the artwork doesn't transcend into the characters and action sequences. The action is sloppy and scattered, the panel transition is disjointed and difficult to follow.There's virtually no dialogue in this volume at all, so add that to the confusion and you've got a fairly weak title.There are some interesting ideas in this series though, a world consisting of thousands of levels of metal corridors and chasms being the coolest of which.Worth a look, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH I LOVE TINY TOON ADVENTURES","review":"I LOVE THE TINY TOON ADVENTURES: HOW I SPENT MY VACATION THANKS WARNER BROTHERS AKA WB.

At the time, the concept of a direct-to-video animated feature was so strange to consumers that some mistakenly thought How I Spent My Vacation was a collection of Tiny Toon Adventures episodes.The film later aired on Fox Kids on September 5, 1993, as four Tiny Toon Adventures episodes, episodes 97 through 100.

This is pretty much standard lounge music, the type Billy Joel played before he got big, the same kind David Lanz played before he started adding his own compositions into his sets. Osborne's fills are showy, and he spends a lot of time playing things up a few octaves. If you like music you are likely to hear on the easy listening stations and department stores and expensive lounges, then this disc is for you.

In the front it shows the tenses and how, when, and why to use them. (It's the same as 501 Spanish Verbs.) What's even better is in the back it has an alphabetical listing in English of all the verbs in the book. If you need to know a verb, you can certainly find it in your pocket dictionary, but seeing it conjugated is extremely helpful whether you're a beginner or someone in an intermediate or advanced level. Most verb conjugations are easy to remember, but if you forget, you can look in this book which is so light and compact, it's incredibly easy to carry.

In the middle, the 300 verbs are spelled out and how to conjugate them in all 14 tenses. The book is printed in 2 colors for easy reference.

In Love Poems: Feelings and Fantasies, Richard W. Carlson, Jr. has captured the true essence of what it takes to fall in love. His remarkable approach along with beautiful illustrated graphics allowed me to actually \\"see\\" the different feelings that are shared whenever two people open up their hearts and allow love to enter.What I found so unique about his poetry was his ability to allow me to learn how a child, teenager, and adult all go about different ways to find love. Love is a necessity in everyone's life. Without it, a person's life is never complete. From experience I can tell you finding true and lasting love is not easy. A person will find they will have to kiss many frogs in order to find that one true prince.

Please -- do not be swayed by the two reviewers that gave Kid Rodelo a 5-star rating. Do yourself a favor and avoid reading this book at all costs. I'm now going to take my copy and put it in the section of my house where I put books of this poor quality -- i.e., the trash.If you are in the mood for a good old-fashioned western, I'd recommend that you try Appaloosa and Gunman's Rhapsody by Robert B.

According to the liner notes this music was entirely written by Ellington as a present for the Queen of England. It is a music that shines for its sheer beauty. Perhaps it is less swinging than some other jazz pieces, but it is so enchanting that anyone with ears will be thrilled by it. Don't hesitate to buy this CD since it is a remastered version of a previous release.

At the moment it is a tie between \\"Lolita Lempika\\" & Philosophy's \\"Falling in Love . But now, after purchasing Nanette Lepore it has beaten them both. I'm even purchasing the body lotion/cream.

Vinge is one of those \\"B+\\" writers, not quite the top. The PEACE WAR was a great book and introduced the concept of \\"Bobbles\\", the huge bubbles into which one could safely escape to the future undeterred by weather, weapons or even time. With everyone bobbling the very idea of time itself was called into question.The characters are not your run of the mill novel players. We have, of course, the bobblers, then there are the high-techs (humans with extraordinary tech ability from right before the time of the Great Extinction when humanity vanished. Then there is the detective, the best around since he's the only one around. He searches for a murderer amid the attempts by the high-techs to gather humans from the bobble and recreate a new human civilization.

I have long been a fan of New Orleans R&B; so was very aware of just who Cosimo is. This is an essential box set for anyone into great music. This stuff is timeless. Even for someone like me, who had a lot of this material already, it is so filled with hard to find songs that even if you had 3/4 of this stuff, you'd still want it. And these songs are great to hear anytime.Fans of the recent Alison Krauss/Robert Plant will want to hear the original version of Rich Woman (by Li'l Millett & His Creoles - love that name), but really, there's not a bad track in this set.********** TEN STARS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Ever?","review":"This is probably their best ever album of original material, and it marked the beginning of their incredible mid-70s output of hit after hit.

Why buy the rights to the title just to be bad stewards?I have records remastered off of old 78 rpm cylinders that sound cleaner and more resonant than this much younger recording. You would have thought that with seventeen years to improve on the sonics of the original cd release, Rhino could have, should have gotten around to it.Regrettably, it's buyer beware for a personal favorite that deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serve It Up!","review":"This is a great album for the BG's. Wonderful R&B songs, tender ballads and even a song about making love (growl.)What I like most about it, and all pre-machine produced music, is the drums. Not flashy or overpowering, but right on. Clean & precise which is something that was tragicly lost when the world of pop went to the electric percussion that dominated the 80's, and, that which has seemed to have returned, on the charts, lately.Big hits: \\"Jive Talkin'\\", \\"Night On Broadway\\", \\"Fanny (Be Tender With My Love\\".) Also here the country-ish \\"Come On Over\\"(a later hit for Olivia Newton-John) is nice, as is the closer \\"Baby As You Turn Away.\\"A wonderful album of great, mid-70's produced, real songs.

Main Course has many good songs-\\"Nights On Broadway\\",\\"Jive Talkin'\\",\\"Winds Of Change\\",\\"Fanny\\",\\"Edge Of The Universe\\",\\"Baby as You Turn Away\\" and one or two more gems. The style of the album: smooth white soul and plastic funk( NOT DISCO!) is the perfect Bee Gees style. \\"Jive Talkin'\\" is an extremely funky song whose groove is iresisible. Tracks like \\"Fanny\\" are lovely r&b songs. The album was a big hit in 1975 and it set the stage for the Bee Gees most artistic and commercially sucessful period although the other 2 studio albums( Children of The World and Spirits Having Flown) from this period don't have as many good tracks as Main Course does."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album was not \\" Jive Talkin' \\"","review":"Even thought I was borned at the laterest 80s, I was so lucky that I had a chance to listen those energetic songs.

I've ordered them from England and just about every where else I could find them. Luckily I am now able to get these through Amazon. Saving a lot on phone bills.Bottom line.... these ARE the best.

The film is long and tedious with only occasional cheap special effects. Gough, a mad surgeon at a \\"rest\\" home, is restricted to a wheel chair and the action does not mainly revolve around him, but, rather, around some young people trying to escape his clutches.

The tale deals with a professor who offers his soul to Lucifer in exchange for fame, wealth, and knowledge. He enjoys the benefits of making the deal, but all the while wonders whether his soul can be saved. Some try to convince him that it can be saved, but he fails to act, and in the end, his soul is taken by Lucifer.

So get it, but be forewarned that somethings may be hard to get through at spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice adaptation...","review":"This seems to be a good point to enter the Faust myth for those interested.

The REA study guide was the only preparation I used and studied for about 8 hours over 5 days. I did pass, but I was not supremely impressed with the study guide. There were many demographic questions on the actual CLEP that were never covered in REA's study guide. Examples would include male vs. female increase of population (over 85 years of age) and exact percentage of upper middle class citizens in the US. These are very technical questions that you can't always reason out. I had passed all three REA practice tests with scores over 70 so I was suprised when taking the test at the amount of questions I was not confident in.That being said, I did pass with a B so the book did accomplish it's task.

The good news is that I passed, but the bad news was that this book did not prep me well. About 25% or more of the questions weren't covered in this book. Because of this I was anxious, nervous and skeptical that I would even pass. I would suggest purchasing a sociology textbook to get further explanations that this book didn't provide. Some of the questions on the test asked about specific situations and details that a texbook would have. This prep book is a general synopsis of theories and the basics, definitely not enough to pass the test with complete confidence.

His style skips right along as he explains what the women did, how he got involved as their Scottish Advocate and what the international law has to say about this constant danger to humanity from nuclear weapons.

This book is full of misguided information about herbs, candles, crystals, and so much more that you will be utterly confused if you ever pick up another book on Wicca. This title is even fictional. There is no such thing, to my knowledge, that is called 'the Wiccanning' and it is certainly not a commonly used term in the pagan community. Honestly, I just can't even explain how many errors there really are on every single page.It's so infuriating for someone who's been practicing for a quite a while.

No true Wiccan believe this. Her story of the origin of the goddess and god is almost the same as the Christian belief of its origin of there God in the bible. I suggest people who get this book to over see what she try's to teach you about her beliefs and own views of Wicca.

Huh? Someone must've eaten too much of the brown licorice at Woodstock.To all Wiccan authors, PLEASE research your religion before you write a book about it.

Well I might as well talk about the songs. Every song on this CD is good and the only thing I don't like about this CD is that I never want to stop listening to it. My favorites on the CD are #5, #7, #2(of course), #3, #18, #10, and #12. Oh yeah and #6. Well this is a really good CD and anyone who gave it 1 star doesn't know good music when they hear it (scan down the page a little further and you'll know who I'm referring to). I would give this CD an A+NOTE FROM AUTHOR- I wrote this review about a year ago and I apoligize for the little kidness of it. To put in frankly, this Cd rocks and even though I have not been fortunate to see him live I am sure he is even better. (I did see Matchbox 20 a few months ago and they were awesome!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Debut CD...from a promising artist.","review":"First I would like to say Angie Aparo is talented, has a wonderful voice, and possibilities....Aparo who also does back up vocals on matchbox twentys \\"Mad Season\\" has only one shining song on this CD, and that is the first single \\"Spaceship\\". The rest of the CD does not even fit the mood of that song.When I first heard \\"Spaceship\\", I thought it was orignal, new, and refreshing. So I went out and bought the album, and the rest of the songs sounded anywhere from bland to oaky country....It is obvious that his label was making him do a variety to play safe, however the safe falls into sounding anywhere from Joan Baez to James Taylor to Dwight Yoakam.What a disappointment, I played this CD a few times, tried to like it, but the only playable song was the single \\"Spaceship\\".Trust me on this. GRADE: F"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all...","review":"I don't typically get excited by \\"new\\" artists anymore, too many people make an appearance only to change their music entirely. Not true with Angie - love the album, heres to hoping he's a singer-songwriter that will stay in the industry and not conform to what the radio is looking for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is abolutely awesome","review":"I heard the song \\"Spaceship\\" on the radio here in Louisville, so I downloaded the MP3, listened to it about 100 times, then decided to go out and buy the album... Best purchase I've ever made. Aparo's lyrics are so deep and mystifying they will have you crawling back for more. If you like good music, buy this CD now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love it!","review":"Every since my purchase of The American, I have not been able to stop listening to it. Every song is excellent! I just love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed!","review":"I bought this CD because I love the song \\"Spaceship\\" and it's alternative rock style. I listened to the rest of the album and thought that it couldn't be the same guy! All of the rest of the songs on the album sound like they were recorded by a 'boy-band'. I will listen to \\"spaceship\\" over and over...it's only too bad I couldn't return the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angie Aparo is awesome!!","review":"I first saw Angie Aparo, when he opened for Marchbox 20 at Avalon in Boston May 2000. Angie Aparo I believe is better in person and is a great performer that embraces the audience and gets them pumped. His music, is mellow and robust, that's perfect from a relaxing sunday afternoon, to club dancing on a high paced Friday night. 5 stars and two thumbs up to one of the up and comings in the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for puzzle lovers","review":"This puzzle is wonderful. Everybody thinks that it is an easy puzzle with 9-pieces but when they see the puzzle, everything is change. It is easy to play but it is difficult to solve. My whole family loves this puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing and overwrought","review":"I bought this as a freebie, hoping to discover an author that I would like, and was gravely disappointed. There is such a thing as erudition getting in the way of the story, and while I have no problem with a whodunit, this book is just ridiculous. Not to mention, depressing - the entire second half of the book is about death: personal, global, universal. The denoument makes no sense, either, because it simply prolongs the ultimate fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time you will want back","review":"The concept of the book had great promise; I am always facinated by books involving the manipulation of time. I liked the scientific aspects and some of the characters, but the book simply does not live up to the promise. I am sure that the author expected some oohs and aahs at the scope of this book, but I ended up simply feeling indifferent. If you buy this book you will likely want your money back. If you read it you will want the time back, but time is more easily manipulated in fiction, so don't waste your time in the first place. I would actually rate it zero stars, if that were allowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"This is a short review, so bear with me. This book is VERY boring. I read some of it a year ago, so I have forgotten about it, but what I remember is that it was boring beyond imagining! I had to FORCE myself to read it, because I had paid for the stupid thing out of my own pocket, and it really was horrible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible.","review":"There are so many really good science fiction books out there. Read them. This is one of the worst books, SF or otherwise, I've ever read. The characters are not believable and don't act like real people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Time","review":"Perhaps the worst written science fiction novel I have ever read. The characters were lifeless and not at all engaging. You simply didn't care what they were going to do next. The plot was a paper thin, meandering mess. Despite the fact that I really enjoy novels about twisting time, I just can't find a redeeming feature in this novel. This was the first book I read by Baxter. It will certainly be my last. Don't waste your valuable time on this dreck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure \\"Science\\" Fiction","review":"True lovers of \\"pure\\" science fiction will love this book. When I first started to read the book and its reference to communicating with the future, I thought it might have borrowed its subject matter from Benford's award winning \\"Timescape\\" novel. Boy was I wrong. Though the premise was somewhat the same, Baxter took time travel to a whole new level. This book not only made you think, but was able to convey theoretical physics in such a way that it didn't detract from the story. Some authors like Kim Stanley Robinson seemed determined to impress you with their scientific knowledge at the expense of the story (readability). I enjoyed the twists and turns of this novel and will begin reading the second book in the series immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad rehash of his earlier novels","review":"Up front, let me confess I am a complete and utter fan of Sephen Baxter and his brilliant manipulation of the constants in our Universe. But. This would have to be THE most disappointing book I have ever read by Stephen Baxter (and I thought Titan was pretty bad with no loveable characters and a gruesome plot...). In Time, Baxter starts off Ok - bit of a mixture of Voyage and some of Xeelee stuff and then suddenly, half way through the book - BAM! Total Deja Vu as it degenerates into a basic rehash of some of his previous books from the Xeelee series (although he does take into account advances in our knowledge of the universe).If you are a first time reader of Stephen Baxter, read some of his earlier stuff like Moonseed, Flux, Ring, Raft, Voyage etc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Physics Fairy Tale - Undisciplined Writing - Cheesy","review":"The characters were weak, but so was the story line. Too many times I had to suspend my understanding of physics to let the author plod to the next impossible description. For example, the author seems to think that reflected light travels at infinite velocity (or very much faster than c) whereas the light coming directly at you from the event is traveling at c. (Characters are watching an expanding sphere of light from an explosion, waiting for it to hit them.) The book has many such flaws. And the characters are equally flawed and thinly portrayed. I can't recommend this book to anyone expecting hard SF, unless you want to groan a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginally entertaining","review":"In Manifold Time, Baxter explores some great ideas that get lost in weak storytelling. I found it difficult to stomach the arrogant characters with pompous-sounding names. It's obvious that Baxter is a better scientist than a writer, although I have to admit that there are some parts of the book that manage to convey a sense of wonder that is the key to any successful sci-fi book.On a personal level, I found Baxter's world view disturbing. He seems to believe that galactic conquest is the rightful destiny of man. He portrays the lead character, Malenfant, as a savior who pioneers this new \\"Manifest Destiny\\". I was annoyed at how Baxter took it for granted that galactic conquest was something beneficial, without delving into any of the moral dilemmas.Perhaps that is the problem with this book--plenty of science but no humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am a huge sci fi fan and an even bigger \\"time travel\\" fan. This book starts out boring and goes straight down from there. I needn't rehash the other one star reviews. He should have written a book on his theories of space, time, and the human condition. The characters are wooden, the plot - doesn't really exist, and a short story extolling his theories would have sufficed. Any thought I had of getting the other Manifold books is out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Trilogy Opener from Author of Moonseed","review":"Stephen Baxter is an award-winning author who obviously takes great care in writing his carefully researched science-fiction novels. Manifold Time is book one in a trilogy about what happens to the world when people discover that the end is in sight. It's not your standard doomsday story, however, for a number of reasons, foremost among them being the painstaking care with which Baxter presents his central thesis: that the earth is doomed not because of an iminent threat such as a comet or global nuclear war but simply because of probability.The book starts out confusing, levels out into understandable and exciting, builds to suspenseful, and then makes a disappointing decline into a long section of bewildering fluxation before finally going out with a fizzle. Hopefully books two and three in the trilogy will pick up a bit; I felt let down by the end of Manifold Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very painful read","review":"I love books of all types (especially SciFi) but this book was very painful to read and after halfway through the book I finally had to put the book down. Perhaps I just didn't get it, but even after getting through half the book I still \\"didn't get it\\" and wasn't sure what the story was supposed to be about.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book was terrible. The characters were lousy and I didn't care about any of them. The story was slow and boring. And the science was just too much. I know, it's supposed to be \\"hard\\" science fiction, but if you like it that hard, I'm sure that there are some science textbooks out there that would have a better story and much better science."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better","review":"I was really distracted by the constant use of techno-babble throughout the book. Reading Hawking is easier than reading this book.I forced myself to finish the book because I hate to give up, but I'm really glad it was free because this isn't an author I'll try again.I really didn't care about the characters in the book and it was depressing. I love sci-fi and I love time travel even with paradoxes, but this was just techno-babble that makes no sense and doesn't connect me with the characters.And the fact that the author sites scientific journals at the end as facts...just because someone publishes something in a journal doesn't make it true. It's a theory that one researcher may have that will either be confirmed or disputed by their peers.I don't want to know about one journal article, I want to know what the scientific community thinks...especially if the whole book is based on techno babble with no character substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggle To Finish","review":"Since I paid my hard earned money for this book, I was determined to finish it. (Otherwise, I would have put it down.) The science was o.k. however, the story was very weak and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man is the center of all things - not!","review":"This is an amazingly depressing novel which denies the existence of God and finds Christians to blame for virtually every bad thing that happens.There is a disturbing assumption through out this novel that we know exactly how everything works in the physical universe and that man is the most important thing to come along in this happenstance we call life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a storyteller","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I couldn't even force myself to finish it. Mr. Baxter does a poor job of juggling multiple viewpoints, and as another reviewer described, the characters are \\"paper thin\\" - I didn't care about any of them. He rushes through everything except the science. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good squid!","review":"I liked the squid. She was the best character in the book. The rest of it was more or less ok - definitely not something I would keep. Check it out of the library and save yourself the money. A good airplane book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't get there for me ...","review":"After reading the excellent Moonseed the first sci-fi book to get my attention for a long time - I was really looking forward to this book. But my hopes were dashed I'm afraid. This book is manifestly dull and depressing from the get-go.The overall story - the need to discover the true nature of humanities future in order to avoid the \\"Carter Catastrophe\\" - a self-fulfilling portent of doom - results in a book that at once expands into the broadest of scales (the future of the Universe) while getting stuck in the merest details of the characters involved.Baxter proved that he can write page-turning midnight-oil-burning sci-fi with Moonseed which combined science, science-fiction and Tom Clancy. It's a pity that this performance wasn't reproduced in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"confuses scale with depth","review":"much less than compelling characters. the truths described in the book make little sense and have other easier explanations. in short. big ideas but trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyhow, An OK read - Anyhow","review":"If you like the word 'anyhow', then this is the book for you. Ignoring the conclusions drawn from the scantest of evidence, the repeated misuse of 'anyhow' will drive any 'anyhow' word lover wild, anyhow.Anyhow, I did manage to struggle through to the end which, for me, indicates a reasonable read. Unfortunately all the 'anyhows' lost this book a couple of rating stars, anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted potential","review":"The beginning of the book was quite engrossing, but the plot kept wandering all over the place. When the story suddenly, and unexpectedly, started talking about some super-intelligent squid, I quit.

It seems like had been used. Sure enough, it did not work. I usually have a good experience with Amazon but not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of essays. Outdated and mostly useless","review":"Got this book for a research paper. Only half the book is actual information about the prison system. The other half is information about specific prisons. That 50% that is relevant is a collection of essays on each aspect of the federal prison system. Woefully outdated and scant in its description. Information on the Washington-view of prison bureaucracies is in there, but you can forget finding the inside view of the prison system itself. There's very little about what an inmate does on a day to day basis, how they interact with prison staff, and the rules and regulations they must abide by. All in all a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priced Right for the '70's Obsessives'...","review":"I like this CD because I get a very good classic soul mix, and I get to save a few dollars from not having to purchase a box set or anthology mix for the tunes I want to hear. For example, this is one of the few CDs that has that Jerry Butler/Brenda Lee cut \\"Ain't Understanding Mellow?\\" (a 'blue lights in the basement' track around here) that ain't in some [price] greatest hits compilation. I get The Commodores \\"Sweet Love\\" and Luther Ingram's classic \\"(If Loving You is Wrong) I don't Want to Be Right\\" on one CD. And I get the Ahhh-hah! without chasing down the right time they play certain of these jams on the classic R and Bee radio station here. Like, they seldom play that nice \\"Misty Blue\\" by Dorothy Moore. Well, I don't have to wait till the station decides to play it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Miles","review":"This gets my vote as Miles' worst pre-electric recording date. It's one of the most desultory jazz recording sessions ever made. All the tunes are done slowly to highlight Miles' lyricism, but everything is so draggy that he just sounds bored. Elvin Jones, a great modern drummer, is totally handcuffed. Also, the CD is a major ripoff (even as it was on LP): we get only 27 minutes of music (which, come to think of it, might be a blessing in disguise: the less of this music the better). For die-hard Miles fans only (and then to only hear him at his worst)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER BUY DIGITAL JAZZ!! = GARBAGE!!","review":"Jazz will never sound as it should when mastered on a digital format. Analog vinyl LP's or magnetic tape (as a distant second) is the best way to go. You will NEVER know what you are missing out on without a decent turntable and tube amplifier. Try listening to Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\" or Kenny Drew's \\"Undercurrent\\" mp3 album and then find someone who owns it on vinyl and listen... you will never buy another cd or mp3 again and you may want a refund for all those mp3's you bought. Digital jazz is garbage and should only be used while jogging or when not really paying attention to the music (i.e. mowing your lawn)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended long play club versions my foot--or 12\\"...","review":"rebound NEVER comes through completely with their promise. there is barely a 12\\" version on this volume, as with most, and a number of 12\\" edits.

That said, \\"The Bodyguard\\" script does have something to say: For me, it's about that very human experience of being in a work situation, a role, a situation, and having to deal with those impulses and emotions that sometimes conflict with our ability to be successful, or ethical, or even, honest with ourselves. Kevin Costner was perfect for this production and carried it off, as one of his better performances. Of course, reality would not be so dramatic, but by the time the climax occurs, we are rooting for the good guy, and can't really turn back. You might say, \\"The Bodyguard\\" story is really a Western in urban clothing. Anyway, Whitney is well cast, and does a good job to remain natural and not attempt to overact. The soundtrack has lots to like and Mick Jackson's direction was excellent; he also did \\"L.A.

The story often careers along on a soap opera, t.v movie type level, with no real chemistry between the two leading stars. To its credit though the soundtrack is magnificent with Houston singing such great tracks as, I HAVE NOTHING and I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU with all her heart and soul. The main trouble is that its plot is somewhat predictable, giving very little in the way of suspense but in all fairness there are a few surprising twists to the story but overall the film is at best, enjoyably about average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This movie is full-screen format w/ a bad transfer","review":"Most of the DVD review Web sites blasted this release for the lousy quality of the transfer. Somewhat odd for Warners to give it so little attention when you consider what a hit it was. But I guess they are doing the usual \\"double-dipping\\" of releasing a lousy version first and then making fans purchase a new edition that is cleaned up down the road. Most strange of all is that it's a full-screen cropped pan and scan transfer. I guess there are some people who will consider buying full-screen movies with part of the image chopped off (not to mention what they'll be stuck with when HD wide-screens come into wide use by 2006.

And here's the thing about Kevin Costner--he plays his characters so naturally that you don't realize he's really a brilliant actor. He just seems like a normal guy on screen. Here, you just believe he is that troubled bodyguard. I loved this film. I saw it plenty at the theatre in 1992 and I've played it plenty on both VHS and DVD over the years. It's just a great chick flick--so many great scenes even in addition to the many vocal performances by Whitney. If you like a who-done-it film, amazing music, watching Kevin Costner, as well as just the right mix of romance and damsel in distress, you've got to get The Bodyguard (and get the sound track while you're at it).The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BODYGUARD (SPECIAL EDITION)","review":"You will love Kevin Costner's best movie. He plays Frank, who bodyguards Rachel (played by Whitney Houston), who is threatened by some pyshco. This movie will lift you in high spirits the sme Whitney Houston's first 4 albums did!

Although I wish there was a little more romance and a little less thrilling.. Whitney Houston is charming and captivating and Kevin is- well heck! He doesn't need to be anything other than Kevin ;0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The movie itself was great but very very poor DVD quality, sound was barely there and the picture very dark.

I kind of always wanted to see it but have always passed it by (for nearly 10 years!). I must say that Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston both did fairly decent jobs acting; I do believe that they have both improved their abilitys greatly since this movie debut.

(I think that Betty Ford's strawberry mousse is where good strawberries go when they die.) My daughter and I used this book to create a buffet lunch for our local military recruiters for Presidents' Day. The recruiters said it was awesome to eat like presidents, and they raved about everything. Some of them took leftovers home so they could have the same thing for dinner, and that was after having seconds at lunchtime!

I thought I was getting a good deal by ordering the tablet version, having bought the softgel version previously. But the nutrition label of the tablet bottle, even though yielding the same 2mg Astaxanthin as the softgel bottle, shows a very different amount of the raw materials ( Haematococcus pluvialis algae extract ) used to make the 2mg Astanxanthin, than the softgel bottle label. I asked Source Naturals about this big difference via email but they never replied. In addition, the softgel version indicates \\"AstaREAL\\" but the tablet version does not. So one has to be careful to examine the differences between a softgel and tablet version of the same supplement supplied by the same supplier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just A Beautiful Album","review":"MAR AZUL by CESARIA EVORA is just a beautiful cd that I havent stopped listening to since I bought it a few weeks ago.

When I hear her voice and the music, I few that I am being trasported to a different land far from where I presently am. I have to say, it is her voice that truly stands out on her albums. Some have compared her toBillie Holiday, and I think that might be a fair comparison. I can't think of any weak spots on this album, each songs is just so great.

Any 4th grade student knows Nitrogen exists as a liquid only under high pressure, and is not going to sit around in a glass vial.In addition, the grammar and spelling is atrocious!

A great glimpse at the New York fashion world for real. Truly a Chick Flick and for enlightened others as well. Not unexpected, but very entertaining. Watch it, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tedious Morality Play","review":"This is a movie billed as a comedy, though it is rarely entertaining, much less funny. Streep is a brilliant performer, and Tucci makes a stereotype (one of many in the film) tolerable. It is hard to determine if this is intended as a straightforward comedy with some sort of message, or a message story with some hint of comedy. Either way, it comes across as a ham-handed story sodden with every kind of platitude imaginable about salt of the earth virtue despoiled by the pernicious effects of vanity and power. Perhaps if the whole thing had been done as a cartoon it would not be so grating. By the end of the movie my head was pounding and I wanted all of these cardboard cutout characters with their paint by number lines to just go away. This may be an interesting film to those who enjoy fantasizing about the world of high fashion, but if that doesn't strike you as interesting, I would not recommend investing time or money in seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC","review":"This movie is terrific. Again as for Meryl Streep who is about 60 playing a mother of 2 young girls just didn't fit. Perhaps their grandmother would have been more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a total bomb, but not great either","review":"Meryl Streep looks like she's have a great time getting to act so vicious, and somehow she manages to make her character believable throughout. I figure Anne did the movie for the free high-fashion clothing. I was highly disappointed in Anne's main character. They try to show her character has spunk and drive and faithfulness, but she just took the abuse too long for my liking, and her one-night stand was too easily passed over. Not a total bomb of a movie, but not all that great either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Amazon","review":"I was a good quality video, instantaneous, and the customer service was helpful.

I can't imagine any other actress for this role! Also nice to see actress Anne Hathaway mature as an actress and move beyond \\"The Princess Diaries\\".This movie is fast paced, humorous, and a total chick flick at heart. I loved every second of this movie.... Sure its no Oscar Nominee, its not meant to be anything other than just pure entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I first saw this DVD under duress: A friend insisted we watch it. I had preconceived notions: Meryl Streep will overplay her character. Anne Hathaway will be too cute. I'll be bored, bored, bored. WRONG!!!Meryl Streep is totally hilarious as the over-the-top boss from hell, Miranda Priestly. Anne Hathaway IS cute, but in a well-acted, believable way that makes you want to hug her. It was a pleasure to see Stanley Tucci chew up the scenery, and the fashions, to me, make the movie.So now I'm ordering this DVD, thrilled to have it. It's the type of movie you can watch with your girlfriends (and the occasional \\"sure-of-his-masculinity male\\") while it snows outside and you eat all the popcorn and ice cream you promised not to touch.Great casting, great editing, terrific shots of New York, Paris, runways and the lot. A winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice chick flick","review":"Yes, it's a chick flick, but a good one. Merryl Streep does a very good job in her role as the aforementioned 'devil', while Anne Hathaway plays the new assistant/intern who has to deal with the devil, who is a very strict, demanding, and at times, outright hostile/mean woman.

Tucci gives flesh to what could have been a\\"Will & Grace\\" character, thanks Stanley. There are bosses out there in the corporate world that appear to be just insane but know what it takes to stay at the top. All this is handled well with the movie however the personal lives of the young assistant and here boyfriend are just not interesting and rely on obvious plot devices to get them from point A to point B."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Thankfully, I rented this movie as opposed to seeing it in the theater. I hated it. The plot was stupid. I thought that maybe the film was going to be about how a girl who thinks fashion is stupid finds that it isn't just full of anorexic, stuck-up snobs who only care about what they look like. I was incorrect. This movie serves only to reinforce negative stereotypes of the industry. They make a big scene of making the lead character \\"pretty and fashionable\\" but in the end she is the same person she was to start except now she has a job recommendation that almost says \\"work for a bitch and let them treat you like crap and it might work out in the end\\" to the viewer. Not to mention that she cheats on her boyfriend pretty much and suffers no consequences for it. Waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"I was so excited to see this movie and it was a complete disappointment. It depicted the disgusting-ness of the fashion world and Anne Hathaway's character's change from a grounded, intelligent, beautiful girl into a fashion obsessed, shallow, ugly, pathetic caricature (much like those girls we see in the tabloid magazines). Meryl Streep had a great performance (she allegedly played Anna Wintour to a tee)- its just too hard to find fault with one of the finest American actresses. However, despite her performance, the movie was just too predictable, empty and disappointingly cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak fashion show with touches of almost-humor","review":"The reason I purchased this movie was because Meryl Streep is in it. I assumed that she would add enough to the movie to make it worth watching. However, her part is seriously underwritten. Mostly, she strikes poses in a flat characterization of the bitch-boss. The majority of screen time is focused on the heroine, played by Anne Hathaway, who has not a comedic bone in her body. The supporting characters are no better, in that the talented ones are underwritten and the rest are just plain dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Promise, Under Deliver","review":"Much praise was given to this less then interesting film. A two hour waste of time unless you are looking for something that won't require the use of any brain cells while viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, enjoyable movie","review":"I have not read the book, but I really liked the movie. It seemed fresh and different. Meryl Streep alone is worth watching, she is so amazing. Yes there are some very unrealistic parts in this (like the Harry Potter scene), but I didnt feel dissuaded from watching it and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary chick flick","review":"I'm surprised this got such good ratings here. The story line is thin. A young girl comes to Manhattan and gets a job as an assistant to a bitchy magazine mogul. Nothing much happens, it's like a one-joke comedy, wears thin with the similar scenes becoming redundant. Meryl Streep does her best to save it but it's just not a good story and nothing much happens. Add a star if you like chick flicks or love Streep in any role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless Movie. Not even worth renting!","review":"This is a dull movie about that young chick being the slave, gopher, I mean Admin. Assistant to the lady played by Streep. The chick runs all around town getting Starbucks (yuck), fetching the dryclean, and has all sorts of mishaps in between, and in the end, gets yelled at for not doing things right. Then she cries and acts like its the end of the world when she should have quit the first day. I'd give it zero stars if I could. SO many other GREAT movies out there, check out Little Miss Sunshine, for example for some good laughs and heart-warming message."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ugly Betty\\" does it better","review":"I had very low expectations when I rented this and the outcome was this was worse than expected. Not funny one little bit, horrible to annoying acting ALL around, though Meryl was functional as the mean lady cartoon character. What pizazz Meryl did manage to convey only made the other little ingenues seem all the more like high school drama class rejects. There was nothing interesting in this bland, predictable, uninvolving story.I kept comparing this to the TV show Ugly Betty, which does the sensitive outsider theme so much more creatively ( And with the talented, sparkling actress America Ferrera in the Anne Hathaway role).Regarding the love interest played by that cute actor Adrian ...(last name???) all I kept thinking is \\"Vinnie ya need to be back with your Entourage on HBO\\".One of the, no, it IS the most overrated movie of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not the Movie, It's Unbox - Take 2","review":"This was the first movie that I attempted to download using Unbox.

If I had seen the various parts, i would have known what this movie is about, and will not watch it, knowing that it is the same old same old. Well, the marketing is smart to just show 2 minutes of an interesting part of the movie. In a way, they are pretending to be something that they are not. Just like what the story is about: pretending to be somebody who they are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad","review":"I presume the book was better. Here we toss some stereotyped characters into an \\"oooh, bad office\\" situation and let them do...nothing. Meryl Streep brought her character to life, as always, and delivered a remarkable quantity of dialogue, but so what? The movie goes nowhere. Bumpkin, bad boss, fashion models... Like those models, it never gets past the surface, and it's a boring surface at that.

But the demands of the job and the morally compromising situations she finds herself in put a major strain on her relationships with her boyfriend and her long time friends.As her life begins to head in the wrong direction, her friends try to save their down to earth friend from being carried away by the demands of her pressing new life.The movie is well done, a fine adaptation of the best selling novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meryl Streep does it again","review":"Meryl proves once again she can do any kind of role well. Anne Hathaway is also a very talented actress. A very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Review","review":"This movie had to be one of Streep's best! To see her in this Diva role and then, go back to some of her previous roles in other movies, I have the rare opportunity to see a crafty artist at her best! One cannot argue that she has talent and probably one of Hollywood's best in the 21st Century. Great purchase @ a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great performance by Meryl Streep","review":"Meryl Streep is perhaps one of the greatest actresses of recent note. She is capable of carrying a movie and clearly outshines her cast in this movie. The movie is in a way predictable, but you find yourself liking and sympathizing with \\"the Devil\\" due to the immense talent Ms. Streep employs to bring the character to life on the screen. Also notable is the performance rendered by Stanley Tucci as Nigel (vs his villainous role in Terminal) - a good solid portrayal of a loyal second that never questions, never complains in a way that humanizes the woman who employs him. Nigel is convincing in his understanding of the woman most others hate. On a broader level, this movie highlights and pokes fun at a world most of us will never see (and fortunately so). Well worth viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Cast in an Outstanding Movie","review":"One of the top five movies of the year in my book and I loved every minute of it. I would have nominated Stanley Tucci for Best Supporting Actor but the whole cast is impeccable. Meryl Streep never ceases to amaze me with her ability to become the character she portrays--She is without a doubt the greatest actress of our time. For me, the director, the producers, the screenwriters and each and every one of the actors made all the right choices. I could watch it again and again.Know what? I probably will."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not the Movie -- It's the UnBox","review":"This is the first movie I downloaded via the new UnBox service.I really wanted to like this movie. But I'm hard of hearing, and the UnBox service did not provide closed-captioning. Meryl Streep talks so softly throughout the movie that I could not understand 90% of what she said. So a movie that probably ought to get 3-4 stars gets only 2.It's not the movie. It's the UnBox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong acting and a great story,mostly","review":"Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt nearly steal the show from the two leads. Great set and costume design, plus powerful performances. I just wouldn't put myself in the position of being treated like dirt by a fashion designer just to get ahead in my career. But that's just me. You can't help but root for Anne Hathaway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A++++++++++ and 5 stars!!!","review":"This is one of Meryl Streeps best performances, and she has had many.

The movie was not laugh out loud humor, but a clever and witty humor. Nothing that was gut busting laughter. I viewed it for a second time when I bought it and I love it! Now I know its true form of humor. Meryl Streep plays an excellent role (as always!)as Miranda Priestley and Anne Hathaway also shines in her role as Miranda's new assistant trying to get used to her new physically demanding job.

If it weren't for the incredible cast \\"below\\" her this would have been a total disaster. The real \\"star\\" is Anne Hathaway. She is mesmerizing as the assistant to Miranda (Streep) who steals every scene she's in. And that's saying something becasue she's in every scene. I can't help but wonder what a Glenn Close or Catherine Zeta-Jones might have done with this role. As it stands her understated (way, way, way understated) performance is hollow and shrill. She mumbles throughout the entire film as if she were a female Marlon Brando. Her soft (almost inaudible) volume never fluctuates. Her face seems to be painted on as if she were wearing a mask. It's all very annoying. Too bad.....this could have been a keeper. Instead it now seems destined for the $5.00 bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring boring boring-devil wears prada","review":"this movie is awful!

With humor as broad as the size 14 it mocks, The Devil Wears Prada manages to be even more self-absorbed than its purported target for mockery, the fashion industry press. Even some swell New York shots can't save this utterly predictable paint-by-numbers movie from being a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"From the widespread raves, you'd think this fairly thin coming of age tale was Shakespeare. It's not. It's an adaptation of a book I never read, but the title was slapped onto the movie to help sell it without any true reference to it in the film. Meryl Streep is the one to watch here. Her performance is outstanding. But the rest is rather cliched slapstick. I expected something more sophisticated.

Since I've always thought the \\"buzz\\" about Meryl Streep was mostly too much overhype, I didn't expect a lot - even though the reviews were good. I will admit though, the Streep did play this character just right. We get to see her \\"human\\" side even though she remainds somewhat cold and alufe throughout the picture, and the film offers an interesting glimpse into the big business world of fashion. The DVD also features lots of deleted scenes and several good doumentaties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go by the previews! -this is dissappointing.","review":"This movie was just... -missing something. I kept thinking that all of the drama was leading somewhere, but, really, it missed the climax. I thought that the Miranda Priestly character (played by Meryl Streep)was WAY too soft spoken. -We kept turning up the volume on our tv because most of the time it seemed she was MUMBLING her lines! It was irritating. In my opinion, the story had potential, but what it turned out to be was -just weak. -And predictable.If it hadn't been for the clever name of the movie and the fact that Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway were the main characters, I can't see how it would have ever made it to the theaters. -Overdone advertising, and someone who has friends in high places is most likely the reason. The 'trailers' for this movie pumped it up to be something it just isn't.Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil sold out","review":"This movie has great acting and a bad script.

It wasn't funny, and the plot was way too predictable. I knew at the beginning that the very moral Andrea would be tempted to betray her friends for power and privilege, but in the end she would realize the error of her ways. Streep's character was too unbelievably \\"evil\\". With many comedies you are convinced to suspend your sense of the ridiculous if the movie is done well enough. This never happened for me in this movie. Perhaps some of my disdain has to do with the fact that I have no interest in, or tolerance for the high fashion industry. I'd rather be frying trout on a campfire by a beautiful river."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly universal...","review":"I was was drug off to this film when it was in theaters because my girlfriend wanted to see it, and by the end of the film, I was glad I went. While from the outside it appears to have 'chick-flick' written all over it, there is a little bit of everything for everybody in it.

How stupid could she get?What a waste of her time and mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil IS Prada","review":"Meaningless tripe about the fashion world. Oh sure, our young heroine decides in the end that the high pressure life of top flight fashion power mongering she's tried to get involved in isn't for her, but nowhere is there any indictment of that \\"world\\" itself, and for sure the crossroads of celebrities and fashion design needs to be taken down a few rungs (more now than ever). Besides the paltry lesson of staying true to yourself and the friends you had before climbing the ladder to success, about th only major point hit home by the filmmakers is that those glossy fashion mags give hope to those sad boys who'd rather be sewing than palling around with the other fellows who like sports.

I can't say I really liked either. The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\" taught me about \\"roman a clefs\\", of which \\"Devil\\" is one. Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that \\"Devil\\" provides. Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough. Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) \\"made over princess\\" role. The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as \\"best friend\\" Lily, are mostly wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone (including me)","review":"My wife insisted on renting this movie, despite my opposition. Was my oppositon to it justified in the end? I believe so. This got two stars instead of one because the acting was actually pretty good, but this movie, as many reviewers have already classified it, is a chick flick and only served to personify the stereotypical superficiality that seems to be idolized by so many in our society. Granted, the main character 'learns her lesson' in the end (big surprise!), about half way through the movie I couldn't standy any of the characters any more. (slight spoiler to the handful who didn't guess the plot before seeing it) The movie follows a young girls descent from a kind, caring college grad looking for a job to a materialistic, backstabbing, stuck up [..], and back again. If you're a fan of Sex and the City, you will most likely enjoy this movie, but, considering I despise that show as well, this movie was definitely not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a Keeper","review":"Ms. Streep is in fine form as the main character of this film.

If it's an accurate portrayal, it's an interesting look inside the fashion industry, the fashion moguls who drive it, and the people whose lives depend on it. The entire cast turn in very strong performances; Stanley Tucci was my favorite as Streep's artistic director, Anne Hathaway is a talented newcomer, and of course Streep practically steals the show as the boss from hell who everyone fears but loves to hate. If you're into high fashion, just watching the never-ending procession of designer clothes might be worth it by itself. The personal drama and plot revolve around a bright, young college grad who, by some strange turn of events, finds herself in apparently the most sought after and probably top entry level job in the industry as Streep's assistant, a job she really isn't suited for. Overall, it's a fine movie that provides an interesting look at what for me was a little known industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guy who liked this movie","review":"I'm a guy, but I actually enjoyed this movie.

The only question I have is the one I posed in my title: \\"Why would Meryl Streep be in this movie\\" and, further, in this BAD a movie?I only wonder why I've never published a book, then had a movie made. Because this book was so lame, and the movie, so much lamer, that I know I've missed a great secret that's lying out there.Meryl Streep is the ONLY reason to watch this movie.

For example, instead of trying to teach you the whole cyrillic alphabet at one gulp, it spreads the unfamiliar squiggles over 4 lessons all the while moving you directly into the heart of Russian language and culture with each lesson. The exercises are imaginative and very useful; using lots of actual realia (train tickets, shop signs, play bills, menus, etc) that are fascinating on their own. You're even doing Russian Crossword puzzles by lesson 5!! The structure allows you to continually reuse the things you've learned in the previous lessons and concentrates on practical language necessities and situations while you're in Russia.

And there are characters brought back from previous books. Along the way, because of Charlotte's unusual social circumstances and Thomas's profession, we learn some fascinating insights into the class system of that time and place.The author is consistent in her ability to create a sense of place and character.

Prior to reading this book, I did not know about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Effect (FAS/FAE). Mr. Dorris gives a good overview of this tragic condition and his references throughout this book certainly augment the points he makes. I like the lyrical tone Abel's (called \\"Adam\\" in the book) story takes when the author includes references to nature and natural phenomena. This book is also culturally enriching by providing glimpses of Native American traditions, e.g. Adam's naming ceremony and the gatherings the Dorris family takes later in the book.Two things saddened me deeply about this book in addition to Adam's congenital condition. The author was involved in a very unfortunate controversy and committed suicide a few years ago. Adam was run over by a car and killed.

His presence and God-given message was as powerful then - and I believe in much the same way this book is now.He guides the reader through his impressionable years and talks of how he was impacted. He unapologetically explains that his twin brother was not affected in the same way by the same experiences. This was not explored further in the book, but it points out a great psychological truth -- we all develop diferently based on our individual interpretations of the same experiences.Use this book to re-examine your early life and decisions!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing roots reggae album from one of the best","review":"I absolutely love this album...some of the tracks are so righteous, accompanied with some soothing dub beats..check out 'Inequity Worker' or 'Blood a Run,' after hearing these tracks, you'll realize buying the album is a must. This album has some great love songs too, like 'Pretty Looks.'I give it a 4/5, because I find that Bolo doesn't have much range (versus someone like Sizzla), but if you like Bolo's other stuff, this is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Everyone","review":"The best thing that can be said about these sandals is their price. Add in the shipping costs, however, which more than double the price, and it is no longer such a bargain. The sandals were shipped from Canada in an envelope and arrived with the uppers somewhat squished and misshapen. Sturdy bottoms, with massage nubs are adequate, but can be uncomfortable or off-putting against the soles of the foot for some. The main complaint is with the uppers, or the strip the goes over the foot. The inner portion that touches the foot is somewhat abrasive, especially at the point where it joins with bottom part. Sensitive or wide feet need to be cautious as this sandal rubs against the instep and side of foot. I have found similar - and more comfortable- sandals at local major retailers for the same or less money - with no shipping charges and an assured fit before purchase. These sandals are not the worst out there, neither are they the best, but the price is right (sans shipping)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly would have been an improvement...","review":"I had such hopes for this game. Since it was for a baby shower, I thought I should buy two so we could have a competition. Tried out one of the catapults to determine how we could make a game out of these and quickly became discouraged. The \\"babies\\" to be catapulted were too small and flew too quickly, therefore they disappeared when shot. The back side of the package is decorated to be used as a target board, but it's way too small and after opening the package, a bit useless. Besides, how will one know where it landed after the \\"baby\\" bounces off the cardboard? Granted, I probably could have used something sticky on the cardboard to make the babies stick, if so, but it truly was too small. Silly would have been an improvement for this game. And the price, way too much for so little. Will I put this one in the garage sale pile?

While griddle is hot hit it with some water and scrape off food into drip trough in front. I usually put some wet paper towel in trough as well to help absorb grease.

We too discovered the heat is concentrated in the center of our portable stove matching the burner shape. If using on a camp stove, be sure to get a heat diffuser (plate with small holes) to diffuse the heat more evenly under the griddle.Make sure when cleaning that you DON'T EVER use a steel wool (brillo style) pad on stainless steel. It leaves little pieces of regular carbon steel behind that will penetrate small surface crevices and rust. Scotchbrite pads work well on cleaning.

All 5 of these musicians performed on many of those \\"west coast\\" recordings although Harold Land eventually became a fixture on all the early recordings of the Clifford Brown/Max Roach Quintet based, of course, in New York.Over the years my vinyl recording of this outstanding offering became worn & scratched no matter how well I took care of it and I finally stopped playing it.

Which is a huge pity because \\"One Big Day\\" was probably the band's strongest work.There is a strong country influence throughout these catchy pop tunes. This was a pretty significant departure from their previous recordings, which were more conventional 80s rock with a strong dance beat. \\"One Big Day\\" broke that mold and is much more like some of the performers of the 90's, like Amanda Marshall or the Bottle Rockets.The opening tune, \\"Forever As You,\\" is one of my favorite songs. \\"I Believe In You\\" is probably the best song on the album.Laurie Sargent still occasionally performs in the Boston area and I try to catch her appearances whenever I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it was mislabeled.","review":"I put this salve on my tattoo and it burned so badly I broke into tears.

It seems oddly appropriate that this was their last album; in some places you can practically hear the wheels falling off. I guess that sort of adds to the charm, though. The lack of musical chops is more than made up by an overabundance of attitude, and the covers blend with the original songs so well it's hard to tell which is which.

Other flattering reviews here mention comparisons with the Stones and Arrowsmith, along with Guns 'N Roses and Chuck Berry; add generous dollops of camp and parody and you start to get the trashy picture. On this album one can already see David Johanson trying on various annoying personas which will culminate in Buster Poindexter. The only redeming factor in this band is Johnny Thunders, and only then when the band is playing his infrequent songs.If you you like punk--more the British and L.A. type than the Ramones and Stooges (both superior to the Dolls) type--I recommend you avoid The NY Dolls. The other reviews on this album and their debut, however, are probably fair given other types of taste.

If you were to change some of the details--hairstyles, labels, even the television programs--you could transplant these characters into the present without compromising the characters or their experiences.I reread it and found myself laughing and cringing.

Recently felt sentimental and so ordered it on Amazon (the spiral edition with Tom Cervanak's good-bad illustrations) and now remember what I don't miss!

If you read the instructions carefully it tells you to slowly inflate the toy as your baby grows. Our daughter was at least 9- 10 months before we inflated the ring all the way.

It didn't hurt her because obviously this is made of very lightweight material but it has become a maddening experience for both my husband and I.

Even though the critics at the time damned it with faint praise as a minor Rollins effort, I beg to differ. There are masterful takes on funk and rock-type riffs. There is a wonderful spontaneous, high-spirited feel to a lot of the soloing, with an almost throw-away feel, yet after repeated listenings, everything seems well-formed and thought-out. This album has held up wonderfully over the decades, and never fails to give me pleasure. Thank you, Mr.Rollins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - A Must have","review":"8th street music did a great job on packaging and getting this out to me right away *all the way across the USA* in a few days!

They filmed in Germany, Russia, India and Italy. I enjoy all the camera work just blows you away at what people can do with the right motivation and skills. This sequal lives up to the first movie, tops it with the car chase scene. The plotline about the same but I enjoy most is that bourne makes the right choice and fixes the past mistake.

The problem is with the directing and editing.They hardly held the camera still at all, so we both got nearly sick from all the constant motion. We felt as if we had just come off one of those rides at the fair that are designed to make you sick. Even had to close my eyes and/or look away many times. Was very disorienting to watch.As far as other reviews which say the handheld camera was bad during the action scenes, I say it was bad during the whole movie. Hardly ever was a still camera used. Between action scenes when you want to relax and regroup you couldn't because the handheld camera was still being used.I didn't time it, but I bet a still camera couldn't have been used more than 5-10 minutes in the whole movie.Can you imagine being on a tilt-a-whirl for an hour and a half?"},{"rating":"1","title":"hated the camera","review":"I hated this movie, loved the 1st but hated this one, why? you may ask, here's why: the camera. the camera jumped & jiggled so much during the fights you couldn't tell what was going on, & it's an action movie which you watch for the fighting, right? well if you aren't able to see what happened it's basically just an action movie without action. plus the final fight was a car chase, how stupid is that?

Almost all of them were good, and the Bourne Supremacy is a fine example of a good, worthwhile sequel.The only thing that was kind of annoying was the shaky camera. It has the tendency to make you feel faintly ill. Besides that, the plot was a lot better, and the acting was brilliant. I thought that this was a good movie, and the car chase at the end...Totally awesome, and way better than Bullitt. (No offense to anyone here).

I predict this because here we see little tidbits of info--revelation of Jason Bourne's real name, Jason's apology to the Russian gal for offing her parents, his relying on the by the book female honcho played by Joan Allen--that there may be a movie franchise in the making. This film is one you've gotta keep your eyes open for or you'll miss something...you can't doze for a second, because you'll miss him getting to, say, Berlin, por exemple (whaaat? how'd he get there?), to say nothing of the real-time car chases.

Matt Damon is not a flashy, invincible action hero, and he puts a human face on a character who has such extraordinary abilities. There are a few moments when the believability is stretched a bit, but not nearly as far as in a James Bond movie.

The plot was exactly what you would expect out of a sequel, and would merit a rental of the film at best. However this mediocrity was not enough for the filmmakers, they had to go further into their contempt for avid movie fans by using cameras that were only place on active volcanoes. Never in my life have I seen such camera movement that actually made me physically angry. The action sequences and car chase scene were great, I think. Actually, I have no idea since all you can see is blurred car seat, flashes of light, and Damon's face. I'm actually offended that pompous ***holes think they can validate making a film with this kind of camera work. It made the Blair witch project look like steady cam.

In this case there isn't a similarity. It's almost sad. There is nothing in the movie that resembles the book - it's totally different. So much so that the Ludlum estate should demand that Damon's picture be taken off of the present release of the book, and maybe even demand that the name of the movie be changed. To say that this is the story written so masterfully by Robert Ludlum is a gross misrepresentation...

I especially liked the fight scenes and general flow.I'm not sure if this is the same crew or not on 'Supremacy' but it's mediocre to poor quality this time around. Lots of jerky and unclear camera action.The ostensibly 'main' fight scene with another Treadstone agent was poorly-lit, camera-jumpy, too close, and sloppy looking. A total joke compared with the coolness of the 'pen vs knife' fight in 'Identity' - which was well lit, both actors clearly visible, and with sharp believable and engaging choreography.Also, the protracted car chase in the latter part of the film almost put me to sleep.However, Jar Jar wasn't in it so maybe worth a matinee if you don't have grass growing to watch at home.

The performances are average at best, the story is predictable and routine (the framing someon for a murder as been done, to death), there is humor, drama, suspense, nothing. 1 out of a 10 for the improved car chase, but it still isnt even remotly comparible to the one in Matrix Reloaded (the best car chase ever), no visual effects isnt really something to be proud of, dont make a third there cant possibly be a market left for this, but i guess since they are still making damn chucky movies, anything is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The camera work was terrible!","review":"The movie could have been great - but the director killed it by filming it like a motion sickness ride that shakes the camera during every action sequence.

If you liked the first BOURNE movie, you will like this one. HOWEVER, the director shouldbe fired and told to return his paycheck for what his did in post-production. It's like the director said to the camera man, \\"OK, the fight is starting so START SHAKING THE CAMERA!!!\\" \\"OK, the chase is starting so START SHAKING THE CAMERA!!\\" What should have been thrilling chases and fights were so jiggly and out of focus that I almost got seasick, seriously! I think a wonderful movie with wonderful acting got the short end of the stick with this director.

All of the action was very real with the director giving you almost a first person view of it. The camera did get a little shaky at times but that was mostly due to the kinetic nature of the film and the director trying to give it almost a documentary look.I hated the Bourne Identity, but this was just a huge breath of fresh air. I was also relieved to hear that the same director is supposed to return for the Bourne Ultimatum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supreme Disappointment","review":"The much-discussed \\"style\\" of this production is indeed its downfall. Although the original was an engrossing thriller, this is like a theme park thrill ride version of it, with the faces & scenery painted on the walls. What's the point of having a great new rig for filming car chases when the final result is shaken & edited into a blur? A totally forgettable sequence.The story & acting were passable, but the direction & filming technique made it almost unwatchable. 'Shaky-Cam' is a stylistic trend that needs to end ASAP. About 40% of the film is so badly shaking it almost made us nauseous.Perhaps watching on a small TV in daylight would help.... Naah, just skip it. Way too short, also. No resemblance to the quality of The Bourne Identity at all. The whole result seems like an attempt to quickly git'r'done & go count the money. Thumbs WAY down.

It didnt at all. It was a decent movie i must say, but cutting out the entire book, except the two or three things that they didnt cut out but manages to screw up anyways. The only reason this is getting any stars is because the movie was action packed. Action packed doesnt mean a lot tho, because when you are trying to watch a good chase scene, and every two seconds you jump from one camera view to the other, it just doesnt fit together.

Matt Damon reprises his role as the ex-hitman with amnesia, this time framed for a CIA mission that goes wrong.The rest of the cast are good with the always reliable Brian Cox putting in another top class performance. Unlike say the Transporter movies there is an edge of realism that puts this movie in a different league from most Hollywood action films. That said most of us have no idea what is going on in the world of the CIA/MI6 etc, so whether this bares any relation to reality is I suppose irrelevent. However last year somebody was poisoned with a radioactive isotope in a London Hotel, so nothing seems that far fetched these days!This is a fast-paced and gripping film that will keep you well entertained for all of its 108mins."},{"rating":"2","title":"'the moment you entered her life she was dead'","review":"Certainly different from its predecessor, Supremacy puts its emphasis on political intrigue and espionage rather than personal matters... most of the time. The agency here is not entirely bad anymore.Treadstone is dismantled but its shadows still hanging heavily.This installment is not as even as the first one. There are a couple of really emotional scenes, showing loss, anger, and redemption and they rival anything from the first movie. Then there are suspiciously long stretches devoid of emotion. The action too gets a tad lower mark. The beginnings of mad cameraman are already evident, fast cuts, crazy angles, dark and noisy action... the style, which was further \`perfected' in the third film.JB has no clear-cut friends here, acting alone, and more methodically than ever. The tale here is a bit grimmer, too.The score now has a central theme. Firstly introduced in Goa scenes, its slower version comes back from time to time.

Of course, this might have been worse if I saw it at a theater, but I didn't.I thought the plot was almost as good as the prequel's plot, but not quite. The plot was very in-depth and very thought out, but there was just something missing. Over the months I've thought about the missing part and basically I thought this movie was a bit too much of a sequel to it's last one. Many people might agree with this but I really did think it was a bit too much sequel-ish.This movie was definately a pretty good movie, and a great one to watch with multiple people, but not enough to give it the all out five star rating.-Colton"},{"rating":"1","title":"videotography is terrible.

The camera shakes all over the place. What is with some directors. I can hold my Sony camcorder a lot more steady. Ug! is the next sequeal as poorly filmed? I am hesitant to try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt IS Bourne again!","review":"This film is really action packed as Jason again tries to find his identity.The subconscious skill level with which he protects himself and outsmarts those they created him is fascinating and portrays what a human can do with proper training. While I could personally do without the level of violence used in the film it certainly is nowhere near the amount or gratuitous violence one would experience with a Quentin Tarantino film. I would recommend this film if you liked the first one... great sequel!Peter Anderson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another sequel better than the original!","review":"The stakes are higher this time--the protagionist's memories are coming back thru several shocking events--a new antagonist along with some old ones are now hunting him and you can expect some very surprising plot twists--you will also see some fresh new action set pieces including a car chase action scene that would bring tears of joy and jealosy to William Friedkin's eyes--also there is more consideration of ethics that there would be in a usual spy/action movie--I believe Ludlum would have been proud! I surprised myself and enjoyed this more than Spidey 2 and my friend who attended thought so too, surprising himself as well! Our only complaint was the camera filming during the action scenes used that shaky-cam/TV cop show/POV filming method, which I despise, but that quibble aside, I will be looking forward to Bourne 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, great picture","review":"Its rare that a sequel equals or surpasses the original, but I think this movie does it. And that's quite an accomplishment given the quality of Bourne Identity. This movie is fast paced, has a great plot and acting, and the action never lets up. The fight scene with the other Treadstone agent is one of the best ever. The HD DVD is beautiful and the sound is great. I can't wait for the third installment in this great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a good story, if you could see it.","review":"I think most of the other reviewers already mentioned this, but movie was pretty much impossible to watch because of the camera work. I saw this in a theatre and actually had to close my eyes for about 10 minutes because I was getting nauseous. I loved the first movie and had high hopes for the sequel. From what I could tell, it was probably a pretty good movie. Too bad the director ruined it with ridiculously bad cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"???","review":"After reading several others reviews it is painfully obvious that nobody read the books. The Ludlum books are fantastic. Bourne Identity while having many inconsitencies with the book was still somewhat close. Supremacy jumps onto another track altogether and is a completely different story than Ludlums Supremacy, I dread the release of Ultimatum as there is no possible way for this series to get back on track. Do yourself a favor and jump to the books section of Amazon and pick up all three and read them instead of allowing Hollywood to destroy literature. The books are so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wasn't impressed.","review":"There are better movies out there. This follows the standard Hollywood formula. Predictable the entire way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving media campaign...","review":"It's incredible how sometimes a movie sometimes has the \\"blessing\\" of all the media... IT seems all of the critics are getting bribbed....It's absurd. They hailed this movie as a \\"smart action flick\\", \\"one that has brains\\", \\"better than the original\\". Don't believe all these lies. Whatever merits this movie may have, they are ruined by one single fact: THE EDITING OF THIS MOVIE SUC..S!! It's the worst I've seen in a long time. It's video clip / MTV edition all the way, you can not follow the car chase or the fights. It's annoying, really annoying. The camera don't star \\"firm\\" in position for more than one half of a secondThe lack of quality of the story is another point. It's much less, I mean MUCH LESS, suspenseful than the first one. Youc an see miles away waht happened.I don't recommend this movie wven for rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense in Spades","review":"If it's action and suspense that you want, you'll get both in spades, with a \\"knock your socks off\\" cast and script. The car chase near the end of the movie, while gripping and exciting to watch, defies plausibility but doesn't detract from the suspense or the quality of the movie. Well worth watching for action aficionados and those who enjoy thrillers. Overall, 4+ stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waitng for an Ultimatum","review":"For those who dont know The Bourne Ultimatum is the third in the series of Bourne Movies. The Bourne Supremacy was a very good movie and I can not wait until the third comes out. Matt Damon does a wonderful job of playing Jason again. He is a very underated actor in my opinion, but with this performance he should get his due.Jason and his girlfriend are away from everything when soemone tries to frame him for a murder and crime and this brings him back into the game. He is still suffering from amnesia so he has to piece together clues in solving why he was framed.Spy movies alway captivate me because it is hard to think that these things really happend. the twists in the movie are great as well as the supporing acting. The best line in the movie is by Julia Stiles. They are trying to figure out who Bourne is working with, she is asked \\"who is controlling him.\\" She says \\"do you want the scary version? himself!\\" This is a very good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely disappointing...","review":"I loved the first Bourne movie and couldn't wait to see this one. Although the story was ok the cinematography was horrible. The highly excessive camera shake and extremely fast scene changes absolutely ruined the film in my opinion. I mean c'mon, there are some scenes where everything on the screen is motionless, except the camera. All that camera shake did not add any sort of realism, it just made it very difficult to watch the movie and sucked the fun right out of it. And regarding the quick scene changes, I imagine there are a select few humans who may actually be able to focus on the screen in the few nano-seconds allowed but I'm not one of them. I feel like I missed 1/2 the film because my eyes didn't get a chance to focus. And trust me, my eyes were fixed on the screen in a sincere attempt. Bottom line - if I could do it over again I would not see this movie in the theatre, not even if it was free."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want 1/2 my money back, I could only see 1/2 the movie!!","review":"The action was good, the car chase in the end was great, the story was good. . .I think. Half the movie you couldn't make out because the camera was shaking so bad! I almost got sick in the theater and I'm nowhere near a person who gets motion sickness. I can understand what the director was going for. He wanted to make you feel like you were right along side Jason Bourne, but he used it way too much! Literally, about half the movie is a blur. In the end, the first one was a lot better. Some of the action scenes were good and there is a little bit of a twist in the end. Honestly, I would save your money and wait for rental. Atleast then, you can have a trash can nearby incase you feel like you are going to vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Liman and what happened to following the book?","review":"This movie dissapointed me alot. First off, who is Paul Greengrass? I mean, if Liman would have directed this film it would have been a way better flick. Second, if anyone has read the book, you would have realized how awesome the plot was and how this would have been a blockbuster if it would have followed it. In the book, Bourne's own government kidnapps his wife and Bourne must kill an assasin in search of his wife. This is all set in the Far East. Now that is a good plot. Instead, Bourne's wife is killed within ten minutes of the movie and it just falls apart after that. Ludlum would be rolling in his grave if he found out. I really think this would have been a decent film if it was set in China or Hong Kong and it followed the book more. Anyways whoever directs the Bourne Ultimatum should follow the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"at least on my widescreen the attempt to create action by constantly flashing various scenes was annoying as to make the movie unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"This is a really good movie and one of my favorates. I picked it up on HD after owning it on SD DVD well the picture quality is not that much of an improvemnet over the original. Worth it if you do not own it but as a second dip I would not rec."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER CRAPPY SEQUEL!","review":"The Bourne Identity was a really good movie! If you can'tmake a good sequel, why bother? This movie held my interestfor about 20 minutes, then put me to sleep. Absolutely nocomparison to the first! UNRECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie every time","review":"Great movie every time I watch it. It was easy to download and watch on my Roku box. No problems with the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel still good","review":"The second Bourne entry was still good as we see many of the first movies threads evolve and wrap up. The third film loses its momentum and turns into a string of actions sequences"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Purchase","review":"I was sent the wrong movie. I was suppose to get the Bourne Ultimatum. Not worth sending back as it only cost a $1.99. Would have cost me more to send back than to give it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLU-RAY MOST HAVE","review":"BOURNE SUPREMACY IN BLU-RAY IS A MOST HAVE. IF YOU HAVE WATCHED IN ON DVD YOU WILL NOT NOW HOW GOOD IT IS TILL YOU SEE IT ON BLU-RAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne Supremacy","review":"I bought the entire Bourne series for my dad, and own the series myself. With each subsequent movie in the series, the action gets more intense, and Matt Damon becomes my hero over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The car chase scene was the only part I liked","review":"The feeling in this movie is nowhere near the same feeling in the first one. I felt a solid relationship between Matt Damons character & Franka Potente so that helped me enjoy the movie-it felt like they were real people not just characters in a movie. However, in this movie I felt no connection with any character and it just felt like the first except no leading female. How many times are people going to try to kill Jason Bourne? The camara work was too much for this movie, too. At times I felt nautious and I wanted to close my eyes. But the car chase toward the end was wonderful. He just wanted to end the chase and chase brought into a tunnel was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is it?","review":"Although I really do love the Bourne movies and I purchased this where is it? How do I view it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"James Bond on Speed","review":"Skip this one, unless your attention span is less than 10 seconds, which is about the longest cut in the film. It really is like watching two hours of the shower scene in the original Psycho movie. I feel sorry for the cast which do a really good job, but their talents are cut short by the directors' apparent lack of confidence in their abilities as demonstrated by his over dependence on the edior who cut and pastes the film together out of short three to five second long takes. It took me a long time to get interested in the film after its weak opening scenes only to lose that interest again mid way through because of the relentless kaleidoscopic effect of the editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for","review":"After seeing the first movie wich I think was one of the best actions flics in a long time I was waiting to see what the did to top it in the sequel.Bid disapointment. The camerawork and constant cuts even make a nice place like Goa India not look nice. It much darker. At one point Jason Bourne walks down a stair to a subway. I could not even see him in this shot for 2 seconds. Like your father in law is following you with his handycam to the basement of you house an there is not enough light.I think the movie takes a tip down the hill right at the beginning when Jasons girlfriend gets killed. She was a big contribution in the first movie and taken that away there is less left.I could tell my wife what the sorry was and who would kill who just befor almost any scene.So This movie is by for not as good as the first one and not worth buying.Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not hold up under repeated viewings","review":"I felt the advertisements for this movie were very misleading. It showed the character Marie in the trailers, but she was only in the movie for a few minutes. There was no charming conversation or chemistry like in the first movie. Pretty much a solo mission. So I subtract one star for that. Also, I felt the story was week. Although there was plenty of action, it could not compensate for the lame story. The ending seemed depressing and out of character. So I subtract another star for that. Then I also agree with the other reviews that complained about the camera shaking. Once in a while is OK, but not through the majority of the movie. I subtract a 3rd star for that. It was definitely a one time watch and would not hold up under repeated viewings. I don't think we should blame Matt Damon though, I'm sure he thought it would be a good movie and as an actor, he was at the mercy of the director and the editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST action movie this year!!!","review":"I absolutely LOVED this movie. It is the best action movie I've seen this year. It is so much more realistic than any bond or XXX movie out there. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie - there was never a dull moment - very exciting. As to the comments about the shaky camera work - well it works VERY WELL - it is NOT cheap and you don't even notice it (not unless you're a nit pick - sorry, I had to put my two cents in). Anyways, it was the best nine dollars I've spent on a movie this year - well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"borne supremacy","review":"i enjoyed this book very much,the plot moves fast, kept you in suspense,. I would highly reccomend this book for everyone ."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"This was a terrible copy of a copy with the scenes incredibly dark with futuristic green flesh tones.Do not buy thisIMO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked the style and great storyline","review":"This movie has a captivating style and a great, consistent and sometimes even witty storyline. I didn't feel annoyed by the shaking screen during the car chase as opposed to what many reviewers did here. It made me feel I was there, and it felt very real. In the car chase scene you could feel the mass of each car in a way computer generated images can never make you feel. Very entertaining and thrilling and definitely one of the best movie I encountered in a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the first","review":"Matt Damon pretty much carries this sequal where his charecter comes closer to restoring his memory of who he realy is. Julia Styles also shines in her role as someone who is still uncertain if she is a friend or for of Jason Bourne. This is a very complex an intiguing film. I do believe this movie could stand on it's own with a flashback from the first film. If you have not seen the first it is highly recommended you see it before seeing the Bourne Supremecy. I'm hoping that they make a third in the series. Excellent film making. Per another review I also purchase The Bourne Supremacy. I buy on average a dvd a week and [...] appears to have the best prices when shipping costs are factored in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drammamine required","review":"I do not understand Paul Greengrass's choice of camera action. It is highly erratic. A dose of Dramamine is recommended before watching this movie. Perhaps it is a lack of the ability to actually plan a scene? Why plan when we can disguise the lack of scene planning with erratic camera movement????? It is hard to enjoy this movie, take in the scenes when the camera movement makes you sea sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the sequel \\"Identity\\" deserves","review":"This film depended much more on action and special effects than its predecessor, which used Damon's and Potente's chemistry and acting abilities. I think Potente was a powerful, under appreciated element in \\"Identity\\" but in the sequel she was immediately killed off, leaving Jason to scowl, frown, track, and kill. I wonder how few words he actually said in this movie after Marie was killed. Now Brian Cox's character is dead which I think will hurt future sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than your average action flick","review":"I enjoyed this movie even though I am not a huge fan of straight up action movies. The camera work takes some getting used to. After the first 10 minutes I thought I might get sick, but I got used to it. This movie has a transitional feel to it- think Back to the Future 2 and the second Lord of the Rings movie etc. There is an even better chase sequence in this film than in the first Bourne movie. Matt Damon is good, Joan Allen is excellent as usual, and Julia Stiles has a very small part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shake, shake, shake...shake your camera!","review":"Loved Bourne Identity. Sorry, but found this film a pain to sit through. I call it the wandering camera technique -- why some directors insist on using it I will never know. But the constant shaking of the camera I find irritating to the point I get physically nauseous. So very many people with whom I have chatted have expressed a similar irritation at this camera technique. Get the camera back on its sticks (tripod), please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the real Bourne Supremacy?","review":"My favorite author is Robert Ludlum, and I especially loved his Jason Bourne books. I was looking forward to this movie, but after seeing it, I wondered why didn't they stick to the story line? The books are great. The movie was a disappointment because it had nothing to do with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne Sequel Not Supreme","review":"After Bourne Identity which was terrific. I expected even better sequel. Sad to say. Not even so. First of all, Marie was killed after being shot accidentally while the intended victim was Bourne. Which quite frankly I didn't understand since. In the Bourne novels she is very much alive. But the sequel failed to explain how Bourne came to be. The plot in the movie had so many unexplained answers to questions that need answering. That it was more actionfest than movie. Keep Bourne Identity in your library not Supremacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first film! WOW!!!","review":"Another Great Bourne movie! This movie takes place 2 years later as Jason Bourne played by Matt Damon (an ex-secret opertive) has hidden himself from the world with his girlfriend. This serenity doesn't last long as he is found and narowly escapes death again. You basically follow Bourne as he trys to this time get back at the secret service. This is an awesome story followed up with subperb acting. I would STRONGLY recommend these movies to anyone as they are my definately one of my favorite series of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this trilogy, and am happy to have it in blu","review":"i highly recommend this disc for lovers of the bourne trilogy...not only is the picture stunning (of course), but also the sound is amazing, as when the assassin chases julia stiles in casablancaacquire it, enjoy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but not as good as Original","review":"The Bourne Supremacy is definately the darker of the two Jason Bourne filmss. It begins with an assassination attempt on Bourne's life, the death of Marie, and the framing of Bourne for the murder of two agents.This movie makes you see Jason in a new light. He is now a little more angry, and a little more guilty. This film unfolds yet another chapter in the journey of Jason Bourne."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice prequel to Jane Eyre","review":"Many reviewers here did not like this, but I found it quite interesting. You get the young Rochester, and this time around his pre-crazy wife is shown completely sympathetically, like a victim of his insensitivity rather than the curse hidden away (that he had to bear due to fate alone). In my opinion, this adds depth to the characters. It is easy, of course, to interpret her insanity as inevitable, but I saw it as a role that was created for her in the marriage, and it didn't need to be that way - Rochester allowed it to happen, even participated in it, and so bears some responsibility; he then abandons her once a better life-style opportunity arises. Also, the film stands very well on its own; it was only after I saw it that I realized it was the characters from Bronte. The acting is very good, particularly Lombard.Warmly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful look at clash of cultures","review":"This movie captures the eye throughout with beautiful scenery, colors and people. Though generally described as a sexy romance, the movie really looks at the clash of staid British culture (and imperialism) with the more emotional and erotic African/Creole peoples in the Caribbean. Not a perfect film, but filled with passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gonna Make You Sweat","review":"Few films get as steamy as this one and still manage to convey any kind of story; kudos to Nathaniel Parker and Karina Lombard, who flawlessly pull off a difficult period piece.What makes this film work is the progression of events; madness as depicted by tangleweed, temperature, voodoo/black magic, lust, etc. makes for a tantalizing feature, but none of it would work if the acting wasn't up to par.Having read \\"Jane Eyre\\" a long time ago, I always thought it would be a great idea to create a story based on Rochester's psychotic wife, and how she got that way.Steamy, superb drama for those of you who like a little subversion in your lives..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the money","review":"I had a hard time figuring out what the movie was about. I'm a Nathanial Parker fan which was the reason for purchasing the movie. I thought the movie was very disjointed. Mr. Rochester (Parker) marries a woman with severe mental problems stemming from her childhood and voodoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but soft porn","review":"The novel of Wide Sargasso Sea was decent book. A re-writing of Jane Eyre's Bertha. But the film is really hard to tolerate. It starts out ok. Although it seems to start deviating from the book early on. Past the point where Antoinette marries Rochester the film turns in to nothing but soft porn and the acting gets worse too."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the book!","review":"once again, a classic novel made into a terrible film. nothing good about this one i'm sorry to say (even end of the affair was better, but then again, that was a better book), on top of everything acting is almost to the point of caricature. and not erotic in the least, not even the saving grace of some decent sex scenes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"about the movie wide sargasso sea......","review":"What I can basically say is that the actress when young saw her house was burned down by the nigerians and her mother(if I am not wrong) turns mad. I am not going to elaborate the story(no longer interesting) furthur for customer to find out for themselves. There are three erotic scene inside which I can say is normal as there is no so called explict sexual scenes inside. The NC-17 is more or less for show. One scene is the toucbing of ass scene between the actor and actress, the other is just only the facial expression of the actress during the first scene and the last, of course, is the sex scene which some called it as explicit to get the NC-17 rating. The story of this DVD is good and the scenes are very normal like a bright blue sky. ***A recommended purchase for those interested in this genre of movie on DVD***"},{"rating":"1","title":"To buy or not to buy","review":"I was dispointed from seying this movie. After seing Wild Orchid movies, 9 182 weeks movies and two moon junction movies i was expecting Wide Sargo Sea to be a great movie after seing the editorial about it. The course of the movie was really good but near the end when she looses everything was tragic to mee. I did not get the point of this movie. it's worth renting. But I certainly would not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The frustrating story","review":"While there was some classy nudity and sexual content in the story which made the movie tolerable, the story line itself was frustrating and depressing.

For such a short book it encompasses so much history, taking you literally from W. C. Handy to 2003. Lisle knows what she's talking about and her tour of her home town is inspiring and full of interesting arcana about the mystique of the River City's constantly changing and important contributions to the art of music.

Full of brief interview tidbits with musical luminaries, many of whom live in relative obscurity in the area.The book has a few minor errors I noticed, including labeling part of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, OH incorrectly as the Pyramid Arena in downtown Memphis in the photo section. Other than very minor annoyances like that, I highly recommend this book to any fans of rock, r & b, blues or roots music in general. An engaging read about the music and performers and the city that literally changed the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"all in all, very much worth reading","review":"I reviewed this book earlier and jumped on the authors and/or editors for a pretty significant photo error...... trying to pass off a photo of the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, OH, as The Pyramid, in Memphis..... pretty lame, I still say. But, having read the entire book, and having lived in Memphis all of my 45 years, I would like to say that, the above-mentioned goof notwithstanding, I really enjoyed the book, found it to be pretty accurate, and learned some things I didn't know.

Tim once had an amazing sound and an incredible range. Now he sounds as though he's at death's door. I've seen him a few times live in the last few years and have noticed this steady decline. Tune-wise there are a couple of good melodies, but nothing to compare with the beautiful \\"Persuasion\\" from his previous solo album or anything from the Enz days. The production values are awful- this sounds like a demo."},{"rating":"1","title":"The voice is gone","review":"I've been a fan of Tim finn from the Split Enz days, and it really amazes me to read the positive reviews of this album! The songs are ok for the most part, but something really bad has happened to Tim's voice. It sounds like he has had some serious problem with his vocal cords. Some of the songs are sung totally out of tune, and if you listen closely, you can hear him struggle to stay on tune in most of the songs. Try a listen to \\"Need to be right\\" and see if I'm not right. He used to have one of the most stunning voices in Rock, so this is really a shock. For fans only, and be prepared for a shock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea gone horribly wrong...","review":"This disc is a mess. There is no focus, no apparent direction. Gone are the catchy hooks & melody that we know and love from Tim Finn. You can see where Tim wanted this to go: something more layered and dense than found on previous releases. While Neil managed that with total brilliance on his 'Try Whistling This' CD, Tim just manages to scratch the surface. Everything just sounds muddy and malformed. It breaks my heart to say it, but this CD is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"As a fan of Crowded House, Neil Finn, and Tim Finn, I bought this album with high expectations. But after one listen, I came to the conclusion that this CD will probably rank as one of the worst of the year. A real mess.Finn tries for a harder rock sound and in doing so sacrifices all of the tunefulness of his previous releases.This, in itself, would be OK, but the product is just a disaster. It sounds like something that was banged out in one afternoon.Perhaps Finn should bring back producers like Mitchell Froom or Tchade Blake if this is what he sounds like without their help."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it lots","review":"Tim Finn has proven to be one of the most talented performers of the 70's, 80's, 90's and now the 21st century.He still continues to challenge his listeners and fans by writing new material and giving each album a new sound. Never content to rest on one style or sound he calls us onward and by doing so - keeps himself and ourselves relevant and in the present.I love the fact that I can listen to Tim and still be thought of as progressive in my tastes. Each album of his has represented major stages of my life and I am excited by the release of this one.Having seen him live, perform from it, I know I was in the presence of a master. His current offering is a ongoing realisation of a lifelong talent.There are so many good songs on this album!

If you don't have the individual albums this introductory set could be for you. 'Land' is a little heavy on the 2002 side and not-so-much with the classic 1975 side of her career.

This is a really good collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patti Smiths' \\"Land\\"","review":"Excellent collection from this exciting singer/writer. Only one serious letdown: Where is the song Land itself, aka Horses?

If you are a long term fan buy this, switch the lights off, open a good bottle (or else) and then let go... expect waves of emotions and memories to hit you. What it's strange is that if, like me, you have the whole opus, the sequence of the song doesn't follow 20 years or so of track listening .Your memory is just not prepared for it. Dear patti, thank for this. The disc case is great, all black and white and smart. One CD pale is grey - the fans' choice, all the old \\"easy\\" numbers, but When Dove's Cry reduced me into tears. The other CD, the black one, patti's choice, starting with ... factory -shame Good's Speed is not there - is Patti's and has poems and is just as good and even better. If you love patti don't miss this collection, even if you have the whole discography. The only disappointment is patti's farewell picture and words in the booklet. That can't be true. Ehi patti, don't even think about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"both sides now","review":"The P. Smith fan can look at disc one and make his or her own decision about the pitfalls of a 'best of'. It's a good selection, though (as everyone will say) not the one I would make...the second disc however is a different kettle of fishes. From the FINALLY available track 'Piss factory' - all of Patti in 1974 embryo through very high quality and passionate live recordings, very strong unreleased tracks, and even a torch song finale, this is the concert we all missed. Though the notes make the collection sound like a farewell, the contents of the second disc alone justify the 4 stars. The fifth would have been for the inclusion of 'Break It Up' and/or a live track with Tom verlaine on guitar (or is he lurking there on disc two?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Album review","review":"Aside from the occasional song on the radio this was my first real exposure to Patti Smith and I have been impressed.

It doesn't feature the hit single version of the \\"Batman Theme\\" by Neal Hefti. The version here is by Nelson Riddle. All the music here, other than the \\"Batman Theme\\", is credited to Nelson Riddle. But in fact, \\"Batusi A-Go! Go!\\" and \\"To the Batmobile\\" are rewrites of the \\"Batman Theme\\". Plus, \\"Two Perfectly Ordinary People\\" is a ripoff of \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\", and \\"Batman Thaws Mr. Freeze\\" is based on a classical melody that I can't remember the title of. The music here isn't all that great, although I must admit that \\"Holy Flypaper\\" is a pretty good sax and guitar instrumental. The CD also features a lot of the campy dialogue from the show.

Krumme wrote about how to cope with a very ill child, how to treat his or her siblings, how to enjoy life in spite of everything awful that was happening, and how to let the child enjoy it.

Many of the family's experiences are no longer common or allowed by responsible pediatric oncologists. For this reason, the book may be misleading and inaccurate to some families.

The book mentions some conferences, equations, and says hundreds or thousands of papers were published. This was about 4 pages. I was hoping more for the story and highlights here. It is one of the four fundamental forces. It does have an interesting history from the study of radioactivity, its role in fusion, the discovery of Z particles, etc.Then, neither as a plus or minus, simply a comment: The book can be highly technical. In general, I wouldn't describe it at all as a book for the general public.For a more general survey and reader, you might look at Emilio Segre or Frank Close's books.

The family covers up a rough past and uses Nell's apparent possession as a way to escape their troubles. The father hopes that her exorcism will solve their problems.The start and middle are great, filled with creepy atmosphere and the witchery and entrenched superstitions of the South, but at the end it unravels, giving the audience too much to believe in too short a time.

It is a first person, \\"documentary\\" style movie that likes to lead you to believe it is real.I think I would have liked this movie had it been directed differently, so my review is based soley on the directing style. The movie's story and settings were a good idea and could have made a decent \\"normal\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a jip!","review":"Horrible! Even for a low-budget horror flick, this movie leaves you hanging. Wait for it to come out on TV. No shocking moments and the lead character is completely unbelievable...AND A HORRIBLE ENDING! Leave it on the shelf...DONT BUY THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CREATIVELY BANKRUPT","review":"This movie was such a let down. There was no creepiness at all.The scariest stuff in the movie was alot of neck bending and moaning.This could have been a decent movie with it's faux doucumentary style.An almost unnerving lack of scares and tension permeates the movie, with the uninspired script being suitably complemented by the insipid, leaden direction. The decision to cobble together \`homages' to certain masterpieces serves to highlight how creatively bankrupt this project is. In particular, the representation of the possessed girl - complete with white frilly nightie, greasy hair, pivoting head and demonic voices spouting obscenities - is simply pathetic. It's a minor miracle that those Tubular Bells never start their distinctive chiming, although that was presumably down to clearance issues. To make matters worse, the climactic sequence in the woods is astoundingly similar to the ambiguous denouement of Blair Witch - including a near identical last shot. What a waste..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not my style","review":"I would not recommend this show to anyone; too much gore. They say I need nine more words so hopefully this fulfilled that requirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Exorcism","review":"I thought that this movie was pretty good and thrilling up until the end. The end pretty much closes out the movie with the viewer asking questions. There were also a few parts in the movie that I had to rewind just to understand. Overall, I'd say I definitely would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what movie did everyone else see?","review":"I rented this because I usually like this genre of movie, and I read a bunch of reviews that really raved about the creativity and good acting. I did not have extremely high expectations, but even so, I was disappointed. The first 20 minutes or so seemed ridiculous to me, like a really bad parody of an \\"exorcist\\" movie. Within the first few minutes of the film, I had already predicted the \\"surprise\\" ending. Disappointing, and I can't believe they have come out with a second \\"last exorcism\\" movie. What, is the next one called \\"The NEXT Last Exorcism\\"? Or maybe the first should have been called \\"The Penultimate Exorcism\\" or \\"The Next-To-Last Exorcism\\" instead?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Take on Exorcism Genre","review":"First, let me say that I am not a fan of mockumentaries. The Devil Inside was pretty lame and I thought this one was going to be another exorcism movie set as a documentary. So I was pretty skeptical about this one and almost turned it off after the first 5-10 minutes of it. But the more I watched, the more of it started to come together and it actually turned out to be a really cool movie. The idea was original and thought it was well written. A lot of people complained about the ending, but I thought it was pretty damn cool, far fetched, maybe a little, but i thought it was pretty cool. I would recommend checking it out to any horror fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually, Not Too Bad","review":"I rented this when it first came out and recently watched it again for free on Amazon Prime.As long as you don't expect too much, it actually a pretty solid horror movie.Good characters, entertaining storyline, plenty of conflict and tension.If you're looking for a solid horror flick and can't find anything...give this a try.Just don't expect it to be a 'sequel' of or similar to the original.It's just kind of it's own, well made but somewhat low budget movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie","review":"It was a little irritating in the beginning ( I admit I did do some skipping over it all), but the story finally started taking shape. I can't say that I liked the portrayal and think the title is a little misleading, but that's only my opinion. The ending just didn't work for me. It was a surprise to be sure, and I won't give it away, but just not something I would watch again. I'm a huge horror movie fan, so I'm a little biased in rating these types of films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giving it a 5 despite the ending","review":"Low budget - but comes off that it was not---and every one in this movie acted their devilish little hearts out -- and all nailed their characters, spot on --- I bought it and have never regretted it and just well, well done film from locations to acting to direction and editing --- ending was just unusual and threw it a bit, but just a \\"heck\\" of a fun movie to watch and has years or \\"re-play\\" value for your money -- it is it's own story and not another Exorcist wanna-be ---- but like all stuff life, diff' folks got diff' strokes ---- my wife hated it, I bloody loved it. (but then- she hates anything that I call Mocumentary). I read here that they might do a number 2 -- If so, I will for sure check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"I was indeed pleasantly surprised how much I liked this movie. I've seen in 3 times mostly because I enjoyed the mockumentary style of the film, the acting especially from Matthew McConaughey look alike Patrick Fabian, and the story line/plot which had a nice \\"twist\\" at the conclusion of the film. Sorry to those who didn't appreciate or expected a more solid ending but films are supposed to leave room for our imaginations to fill in with whatever conclusion we the audience choose to fill it with. Anyway, this viewer enjoyed the simplicity of the film and hope you give it a chance as well.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"The story was half-assed and it wasn't even quite scary or suspenseful. The only scenes that were slightly frightening were all in the end just like all those paranormal activity movies. I was disappointed.

I will watch The Last Exorcism II."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Exoricism","review":"I actually liked this movie. It had a well thought out plot & the effects were quite believable.

I am Treasurer for our church. We previously were using Membership Plus 6.0 and we upgraded. After almost five months of trying to use it, I have reverted to the version 6.0 until I find a totally new product. That's right - even after investing the money in this product, we are abandoning any further efforts to use it. There are many features that just do not work - there are frequent error messages (including during backup), and the company only offers free support for 30 days. My opinion though is that this software is so buggy that the data is unreliable. I would have rated it with 0 stars if that had been an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should never have been released","review":"Allow me to add my disappointment to the other reviewers.

Instead, I found a melodramatic and very ridiculous plot and some awful writing. The characters were one-dimensional, the villians were pure evil - I expected them to be tying a damsel onto railroad tracks at any second. I am mystified by all the good editorials this book has received.Basically, I was disappointed by this book.

The basics for bumps, blisters, and cuts are included. Not much in the way of larger dressings, but let's face it- How many times do you need a trauma pad while on a weekend jaunt?

While you won't find any of these songs in the top 40, they will stick with you and perhaps it's because it was well recorded. At the used price, you will have one heck of a bargain. Get it now, because other cd's have long since disappeared from the market place and are as scarce as hens teeth. Don't say I haven't warned ya, in a few short years you'll be paying plenty for this recordingThe opening salvo of \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\\" gets you going just like the Beatles version. \\"Twenty Flight Rock\\" is a joy to hear and \\"Cycle Song\\", if for nothing else, is funny. For under 10 bucks, you will be playing this cd over again, bringing you back to the early days of the Beatles before they were the Beatles.

My child did not like it at all either - uncomfortable in the crotch area and my childs legs got banged up on the pieces of metal on the base of the carrier. Funny that nothing I read mentioned that there were strips of metal on the bottom, which I guess are supposed to make if more sturdy and sit on the ground easier. Who knows.

There is nothing terribly offensive about this movie, but it is so terrible that I could not possible give it more than one star.The movie's soundtrack is comparable to a 70's porn flick, the action was boring, the script was obvious, and the plot was at times completely obvious and at other times completely inscrutable.Avoid this movie.

Most other accounts if they even mention the Eastern Front focus only on the Battle of Tannenburg which took place very early on in East Prussia.Place names in Russia familier from Napoleonic or WWII battles appear in this account.

If your curious .. go ahead and give it a watch ... but it's really and truly not worth it.I gave it a one star because I couldn't deduct stars ... like say a minus 5 star rating would have been generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watched half of it","review":"O.K., I went over to my brother's for 'man-cave nite' and picked this DVD up from the TV cabinet. \\"What's this?\\" I asked.\\"Oh, my neighbor loaned it to me.\\" (See, nobody will admit to ownership of this thing.)So I sat down, lit a cigar, and started watching while he made dinner. I got about halfway through before I had to turn it off. It disturbed my sleeping and waking hours for days. Not because it was so gory and gross, but because it says something about humans that we can come up with something so demented.I hear the producer decided to make a sequel. I'll pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie from a human idiot!","review":"Love low-budget horror films, and I enjoyed horror porn films like Bad Biology. But The Human Centipede is a waste! The movie was slow moving, the actors do not know how to act, and this moving was not gross at all. Don't know what's the big deal about this movie when we don't see anything graphic in the film. Three people connected to one another releasing waste, so what! Like I said love hardcore horror films that push the limits, this movie did not. Tom Six get over yourself you're not that hardcore. The Human Centipede will not gross you out, but it'll bore you to death!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick Sick Sick","review":"The only good thing I can say about this movie, and it isn't much, is .......... well there isn't anything good about this movie.

Stranded girls decide its a good idea to let the guy they ask for help know that nobody knows where they are and BAM!, next thing you know its off to surgery. An ending that leaves you hanging, nothing redeeming, but then again, what would you expect from \\"Human Centipede\\". South Park's \\"Human Cent-I-Pad\\" was funnier, but this was up there. Not something I'd watch alone because if someone saw you they'd probably question your moral character LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and pointless.","review":"Wow. Wow.

It sounded different, unique, sick and twisted; definitely my kind of film. Well, let me tell you, after seeing the film, I was beyond disappointed. There is absolutely nothing sick and twisted about this film, nor was there anything disturbing or scary about it, at least in my opinion.The acting is terrible and the girls and so annoying. The Japanese guy tries his best and does slightly better. The German doctor is pretty strange and creepy, which is why you can't understand why or how the rest of the movie happens.Definitely a lame film; total snooze fest. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a Hostel-like movie, very wrong","review":"Dont watch this movie, if you're looking for a scary movie to watch, just get REC or REC 2.

Instantly i realized that the episode was made based on this movie and believe it few mins into this movie you realize what a sick and gross movie it is.I wish Amazon or other video streaming websites could ban this one. Dint feel this gross ever before, few scenes from the movie kept haunting for atleast couple of hours.Wish Amazon allowed us to give half star or less"},{"rating":"2","title":"A horror original","review":"Most horror films are so cliche-ridden that the only suspense is wondering what the final body count will be, or just much blood will be spilled. But just when you think that this genre has been worn out, someone does something that goes well beyond what you've seen before.Tom Six accomplished that with the Human Centipede. This is a uniquely nasty piece of work, which will make your worst nightmare seem like a day at the spa. It takes a very twisted mind to come up with anything like this. \\"Sick\\" doesn't begin to describe what the brilliant but demented surgeon does to his victims. The one who dies early in the movie is the lucky one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and pointless","review":"I just don't get how anyone could see value in a movie like this.

This movie wasn't thought provoking or interesting (like I'd hoped.) And finally, this horror movie wasn't even the least bit humorous (like I would have settled for.) It's amazing how much hype has been made over this movie, and in addition, how many sales this movie has made. Don't waste your money. This movie is a waste of money, even to rent. Seems like it may have potential in the first few minutes, but the rest of the time you're sitting there bored out of your mind, waiting and hoping for something to happen, and fighting off the urges to simply fall asleep. Probably the worst movie since \\"13 Going on 30.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Amateur...","review":"The only \\"good\\" thing about this movie is the idea...that's it.I went into this movie expecting great things(wow you have to check this one out!),...the first few minutes of the movie (really?? acting?? script????) (and then the rest of the movie) laid that idea to rest. What I got was a SyFy Channel sub par horror movie (the ones where you shake your head and laugh all the way through the movie thinking how awful it is and why am I watching it).Writing/script...amateurishActing...cheezy/amateurishDirecting...horribleWith some talent, the idea of \\"The Human Centipede\\" could of been a great movie, but alas, the movie is amateurish at best.

Wait, no, I don't. I don't know. I'm so confused. Low budget, bad acting... But I have to give it 5 stars for unexpected shock value.

Terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing is an understatement!","review":"I got tricked into watching this movie by my boyfriend. I am furious with him, and he is not allowed to pick movies anymore.About halfway through I had enough, but got badgered into watching the whole thing. The problem with this movie is not that its gory or frightening like typical horror movies are. The problem is with the suffering. This movie is filmed in a way that forces you to experience the suffering with the victims, showing each and every day of it. From start to finish, you see the pain and panic of the victims. Its just too much for me.I not only had a dream about is the night I saw it, but woke up and got ill because of it. I agree with the previous reviewer, if you are at all sensitive to watching the suffering of others, you will not be the same person after seeing this movie.I give the movie 5 stars because its moving in a way I've never experienced before, which I suspect was the director's goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than what you think!","review":"Do not be scared away by all the 1-star reviews.

It wasn't. I didn't give it two stars because I think it's bad - it just didn't entertain me. It wasn't really bad or good, it just was. The quality was great and the acting was top notch. The story was odd, but not really...considering that it was about a lunatic. It was slow and somewhat boring. In my opinion, the movie was tame enough that it could have been an episode of House or CSI. Sybil, Misery, I Spit on Your Grave, Saw (pick one), The Girl Next Door = these are a few movies are a little disturbing and hard to watch at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gore Mania","review":"Its the best movie ive seen in a long while, You must own it!

I love watching \\"B\\" horror movies but this one left me feeling sick to my stomach. I honestly think that if there was a way I could forget this movie by throwing away my tv that I would.

I give it an F for filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The Horror Connoisseur","review":"This movie was definitely made for a very small segment.

Hence I read reviews and watched the trailer. Do not waste your time--people shouldn't get money for making a film like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Horror, just Torture","review":"This is not a horror movie. It is a movie about human torture. Plain and simple.The hype about this movie is the confusion that this is art, or even falls within the realm of the horror (or psychological drama) genre. It doesn't. At first I thought this was going to be a very dark-humor \\"it's so bad, it's good\\" type movie. No.It's not scary, it's not humorous, it's not entertaining, and it is very poorly made on a number of levels.It's not the gross-out factor that bothers me so much. It's that the movie is really about nothing other than a close-up look of human torture with no point or meaning. Mean-spirited is an understatement. Seriously.If you like horror movies, skip this.If you like watching people suffer, being mutilated, and being tortured, then you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curiosity satisfied","review":"All the hype had piqued my curiosity about The Human Centipede and the way audiences were so divided over it. I suspected I would fall into the negative camp so was glad to see it among the free offerings for Amazon Prime members.In short -- this is fetish porn masquerading as a horror movie. If torture, coprophagy and Nazi imagery are your thing, look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Human Centipede Review","review":"There's really nothing else to the \\"3 people sewed together to make a centipede\\" Story. The cast is unlikeable and dumb at best. It's not subtle at all. The villian is 1D and phoned in a mile away. Infact,The villian's plan is stupid and he has nothing good to gain from this. All the movie does is waste time by having pointless filler moments. Overall:like Hostle,a bad movie that has no real horror and relies on the hype of it's gore which is overblown. I give this film -0 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"poo","review":"unrealistic and amateur... the motivation was never explained... why the dogs? why the random killing of the truck driver?

DO NOT... insult it by watching this tripe. I've seen some bad films in my time but this has got to be the worst of the bunch. There is nothing redeeming in this film.

To write anymore would involve me having to remember it... would rather not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"It is very disturbing that someone would make a movie like this and somehow got the money to make it. But what I find more disturbing is that people would willingly pay money to see such a film, buy the DVD or rent it. And some of this people give this film a good rating. There is something seriously wrong with the human race. If you willingly watched this film or just want to, then I don't want to know you. As for the guy who made this movie and the sequel (!) I hope karma catches up with him quickly. Sick beyond belief. There is no justification for a movie like this. No wonder so many horrible things go on in this world. Any decent human being would be repulsed by this and never even watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":";0/","review":"This is no blood or gore horror movie but it's sick in so many ways. It's call human centipede need I say more, the concept and seeing it it grosses out your mind to the 10th level, and the doctor look soooooooooooooo creepy like really creepy the way he look talk act. The acting was ok but the concept was crazy. When I'm watching i keep thinking what if one of them poop,pee or try to get up and run, it made my skin crawl.PS: I wouldn't recommend watching this move and eating at least if you are stop eating towards the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"Seriously sick movie.

At times. Does it gross one out? I suppose. Is there a real satisfying twist, and or resolution? Sorry, for me, no. Certainly if you're looking for a bit of 'torture porn' or out and out weirdness, this flick may deliver for you, but if real scares and spine chilling fright are your goals - look somewhere else.Lead actors are good - most notably the sick doctor and the Japanese \\"centipede\\" head - but the material is so straight forward, to the point of predictability, that I found myself wishing for the end credits merely to alleviate my boredom.I've heard a sequel is in the works. The Human Millipede perhaps? Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews having higher than a 1 star rating - get the drift.","review":"BAD, REALLY BAD.

I hate the movie so bad that I actually view it on Netflix a couple months back.

Evil characters should have well written motivations; the doctor in this film does not. He tortures his victims for no good reason what-so-ever. This film is just gross with no compelling story elements in it at all. The plot is boring and predictable. In the end there is nothing entertaining about this film, it is pure shock value, nothing else. There is no meaning or message to carry away from the torture depicted here.P.S. What's worse, the creator of the film admits he only created this film to get audiences used to his gross ideas so he could make another film that is even worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"a shocking movie from start to finish.","review":"when swatching human centipedce i found myself saying i casnt believe someone actually came up with this.a movie that will stand the test of time for shock value alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF","review":"This has to be the most messed up movie I have ever heard about let alone seen.

My teen watched it with me and was totally freaked! Never, ever, let anyone you know watch this revolting excuse for a movie. In fact, I think every copy of it should be destroyed along with the original. It's no wonder our society is falling apart with this loathsome excuse for entertainment. Utterly senseless and revolting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont watch this heaping pile of dung!","review":"My husband and I were very excited to see this movie, until we watched it that is.The movie is well filmed and the premise of the movie is, well... interesting to say the least.We're fans of the movie Meet the Feebles Variety Hour, so we love \\"bad taste\\" movies but this one definitely takes the cake. What ruined it for us was the complete lack of sense all of the characters have. There was not one good decision or even a realistic one made by any of the characters throughout the entire movie!!! All the decisions made seem to have been put there by the director to allow the worst possible outcome to happen. It was infuriating to watch stupid decision followed by an exceptionally more stupid decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Doctor, but that's it","review":"Aside from a very effective creepy Doctor this film has nothing aside from a stunning location.The horror isn't horrific, the torture isn't gruesome, the story is not well developed medically or anatomically.Heck, they're not even naked enough to suit the folks that would have enjoyed that aspect of it.Honestly I was more concerned with the blood stains fouling that lovely house than I was about anything that went on otherwise.Ok, so yes- the house was lovely, coldly austere in a spectacularly creepy fashion and foreboding to whatever dust mote might dare to attempt a cameo appearance.For me watching the Doctor move around and live in that home without even introducing the centipede concept or the first line of dialogue would have been far more nightmare inducing that what they chose to put on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"This movie wasn't scary. Just another addition to the Torture Porn fad that I thought had passed.The story is typical and it's really paint by numbers. Girls have a flat tire and come to a crazy person's house.What is so unattractive about this movie is what he does to these people. The guy sews to Woman and a Man together so one person's mouth is attached to the other person's butt hole. When one person eats it goes through all of them. Can you imagine the actors having to pretend like you are attached to someone else's butt whole for the entire shoot.Of course the people captured never have a chance. The killer has the upper hand throughout.Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"human centipede","review":"easily the crappiest movie i have ever seen. the acting is terrible.

It's not really scary, actually most of the audience laughed at a number of scenes...BUT it is a truly sick, mean-spirited film that left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). That being said, it is like a grisly car wreck; you cannot look away once it begins. The sequel is in the works, and although my mind rails against the idea, I will probably end up seeing that too. Bought this as a Christmas present for a friend of mine as a joke, so I can't comment on the extra features. I don't know if she's watched it yet.

How perverse is the plot; then how perverse it the director for taking on the story line to convert it into a movie. Not meant for human consumption.

Unfortunately, I chose this piece of crap. It's not horrifying, frightening, gory or even thought provoking. It's just a sad attempt at being offensive.

It ended up being laughable (not humorous) and pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Watch This Movie-- It's Bad for Your Mind!","review":"I repeat: Do Not Watch This Movie-- It's Bad for Your Mind!It looks like a stupid mad scientist/slasher film-- until the premise is revealed in the first 20 minutes.I am no prude, and no stranger to the bizarre, or a good horror movie.This film is an outright abomination, and I turned it off right after the premise was revealed. I wasn't willing to pollute my mind with this twisted trash and I hope you won't, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely unique...","review":"... at least for an actual horror movie. I think a lot of 10-year-olds come up with stuff like this when they're bored in math class, but for some reason it never gets to the level of film. But I think that's one of the things I like about this movie. It's the kind of dark thing that most adults won't admit they once did, or still do, think about.It's not the best-produced movie. I mean they skimp on a lot of the effects, and the two main girls.. well, the movie gets better once they lose the ability to speak. But the story explores the horror and realism of the situation (a doctor with a twisted idealistic aesthetic, what it would be like to be sewn to two other people..) rather than just forcing a lot of gratuitous sex and gore, and the doctor is creepy as hell.Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a fun, but f'd up ride","review":"Listen to the concept or watch the trailer of Human Centipede and you will immediately know if this movie is for you or not.

I could not believe the idea and was so intrigued (and a bit disgusted, but in a good way) that I was enthrawed throughout the entire movie.Is it a perfect movie? Not at all. There are a few storyline flaws and holes, but the whole point of this movie it what it says it's about. What's the funniest part is comments people make about the goriness of the movie. It actually is fairly tame compared to Hostel, Hills Have Eyes, The Collector, and other gore-porn type movies.

Truthfully it was even scary or disturbing at all. I've seen scarier and grosser horror films than this...the actor who played the doctor was really good, creepy and the centipede actors were really into it, but seriously it was more laughable than anything...no spoilers or give away from me....but in the end, the movie was disappointing as I watched the trailer and the internet hype this movie has received was extraordinary...see for yourself.

It isn't really a horror flick that I thought, but more of a suspense movie. It's about a crazy doctor and 3 people being connected together. They are connected by their front of the heads to the back of their anuses to one another. The movie shows how he will operate on them.

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original) was a classic that was gruesome, but it provided serious tension and fear. That adrenaline fight or flight response that draws us to horror films. This movie is nothing of the sort, and anyone who attempts to justify this trash by saying that it was humorous is by definition as sick and deprived person themselves. There was nothing funny about this film like the goofy humor in Piranha 3D or some of the smart humor in Scream.This movie is foul.

If this film was satirical, I would give it more credence.I can relate to people getting wasted, and while they are imbibing, somebody saying \\"wouldn't it be funny to sew asses to mouthes\\". However, that is not what this movie is. It's not Frankenhooker, Eraserhead, ZOmbie strippers, Killer Klowns, etc. It takes itself seriously. That is it's downfall. The premise must be metaphorical for some oddball anger issues atht the creator must have.Anyway, there is no suspense or scares in this silly movie.It is soooooooooooo stupid that I am embarassed that I am familiar with it.

This is a good start, and the following track Feel What You Know is good soulful house. Track 3 is another solid selection, with guitar weaving throughout the beat. Track 4 veers off course with a grating male voice wailing, and Track 5 So Far Away, while initally pleasant veers off into high-pitch wonker teritory. The next few tracks feature not really \\"deep\\" house with latin percussion or harmonica jamming, before dropping to the generic diva-whaling Music is My Life.

Also some symbols are not accurately drawn either. Additionally, I don't understand how one can offer definitions in English but not provide information on the original Akan/Twi words/definitions (but I think that has to do with the fact that some symbols are clearly made up).

I needed smaller stamps for my audience to use during a hands-on activity following my presentation on the symbols. I wanted them to emulate the process for stamping fabric, including creating a grid and filling it in with symbols in a repetitive manner. Larger, more authentic stamps would not have allowed this, given the size of the fabric swatches being used and the budget for the program. I found the booklet useful, but I had done a great deal of research on the symbols, and had sufficient information to counter any shortcomings.

I am big into making my own flavors, and making healthier than store bought versions. This machine is great for that! It isn't loud at all, definately a big upgrade from the salt and ice mixer I used to have that could wake up the dead. The fact that you just pop your ingredients in the canister and stick it in is amazing, no messy clean up whatsoever, or need for trips to the store for ice/salt. The only slight disadvantage is that if you want to add toppings that spread throughout, you need to add it after its almost at icecream consistency and for that you have to pop off the top (theres no slide window to add through while its mixing). But even doing that extra step is simple after 30 min's of churning.

It is very fast though, under 30 minutes you'll have your icecream, but if you just mix your fruit with frozen milk or cream and have a very good blender, you'll get very similar results...I would not have bought it if I had tried it first. Maybe the blade is too slow, or it freezes too fast, whatever it is, is not great texture icecream, that's for sure. Not gelato, that's is for sure!!!After a few more weeks of use, we have tried some good recepies and you get somewhat better results, so I guess the recepie has a lot to do with it, but do not expect that you blend milk, sugar, fruit and put it in this thing and presto...if you want good icecream you'll have to cook it right before you put it on...maybe it was just my ignorance on how icecream is made..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Amazon Guys!","review":"WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?I spent about $155 with you Amazon Guys and ANOTHER $90 for duties, customs and re-sipping to my place in Mexico.

They said send the broken part to them (which I did, at a cost of $15.00) and they would ship another one right out. Three weeks passed ... another round of calls to Lello (most of which go through to an answering machine). They said that they were out of stock and would send me another part when they arrived from Italy in a month. Eight weeks later, no part, no answer from Lello. I wouldn't ever buy one of their products again. This one is going back to Amazon. It might be great if it works, but who can tell if it's broken upon arrival and you can't get it fixed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As easy as 1-2-3.","review":"This is the greatest machine since the discovery of ice cream. At first I was skeptical when I read that it only made a pint, but depending on the recipe, the Gelatto is so rich that a pint is more than enough, and if you want more it only takes a few minutes to whip up a second batch...you can also order an extra container for the machine , so that you can make double the amount of you selection. It is very easy to follow the recipies in the booklet that was supplied with the gelatto machine, and the taste is outstanding, and beats anything that you can buy in the stores regardless of which brand is your favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a machine that will last","review":"This was a great product for the 4 months in which I was able to use it. You mix up your ice cream, pour it in, and hit 2 buttons. One for the machine, and one for the mixer. A dream come true.However, after 4 months of use mine has stopped working. It simply does not cool anymore. Do not let this happen to you!If you value a machine that will last, then this is not the machine for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"no 3 times, 2 failures is enough","review":"I bought this for a friend as a gift.

It simply stopped freezing the gelato. So I tried to locate the parent organization, Lello Appliance, and zipped them an email at LelloAppliances@aol.com as a live person does not answer their phone. They responded the next day advising me to call Electra Craft Inc, a service center, at 201-439-1700. When I called Electra, they informed me that the repair would most likely run around $100 plus shipping both ways. Well, I'd wind up paying close to the cost of the entire machine at that rate. Bummer. So I've sent another email to Lello seeing if they can help in some way. If not, I'm definitely going to be changing brands. Big, big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used it 15 times and stopped working","review":"When I first got this machine it worked very nicely, you get very creamy ice cream in about 20-25 minutes. Just after the 1 year warranty expired the machine stopped freezing, meaning that the motor is working but the mixture is not getting cold, so something with the cooling system went bad. If you get this machine I will recommend you to use it as much as possible during the first year so if it breaks you are still cover for the warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE LELLO GLATO MACHINE","review":"When it's working it's fine, but it rarely is working.I have owned this machine for approx. two years.

The ease of use and speed that high quality frozen treats can be made right on our counter top really makes this a great value. The machine has held up with fairly heavy usage for almost three years.Since I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in the past year, we have been using it even more frequently to make me sugar free treats usingSPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Granular, 9.7-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 2)or Erythritol Powder by NOW Foods - (1 lbs. Powder) to sweeten the ice cream.We also use it to make reduced calorie snacks for our kids and they enjoy making their own creations (Coffee Almond Ice Cream seems to be their current favorite).Usage and clean up are fairly easy as well, making this a great kitchen addition the whole family can enjoy!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Out-of-Box Experience.....","review":"I've decided to give this machine one more chance. The Lello Service Dept is sending me out a replacement Churn Motor for the paddle. If it still doesn't work, then it's going back to Amazon for a refund, and then I'm going to get the Musso 4080 Lussino Icecream maker, which is ALL stainless steel, including the paddle. I'll let you know how it goes. My hopes are still high, and I haven't given-up hope yet. I want very much to believe that the Lello is a HIGH-QUALITY machine. Just two more days until my replacement part arrives. I have to admit though, it's just a little disheartening when your hopes are so high, and then to be let down like this, with Amazon sending me a defective machine. But, we'll see. I have a feeling this replacement part will do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of problems","review":"Unfortunately, I regret my purchase. There are smaller products on the market that are just as good and MUCH less expensive. When it was still working, it constantly beeped and was very annoying. Then the motor stopped working.

The machine worked fine the first time I used it although it took an hour for the ice cream to get to a firmer consistency. The next night when I wanted to use my gelato maker again---it didn't work.

First, the control panel became disconnected from the top of the machine. Shortly afterward, the mechanism (black rubber knob) that provides power to the churn mechanism fell down into the casing. Since I am overseas and it is very expensive to ship this heavy machine for repairs, I decided to see if I could repair it myself. After wrestling with non-standard screws that hold the case in place, I discovered that both the control panel and the black rubber knob were held in place by very flimsy plastic brackets and metal screws. These brackets had broken apart in several places, leaving the machine unusable. Buyer beware - as usual, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This machine is a piece of junk","review":"Right at the first batch, after turning the machine on, I got the error of \\"stuck rotor\\". I had to reset the unit every five minutes so the rotor could blend the ice cream base. It took about 2 hours to notice a slightly frozen cream. Each and every component of this Lello machine is cheap and most likely this is the worst product I ever purchased (till today). If you are serious about getting an ice cream machine, stay away from Lello. I'm convinced that even for Chinese products stadard, this is is a total failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"This machine does as it promised; produces great gelato in little time. Wish I had bought the larger version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I just purchased this item and am very happy with it so far. I've only made 2 batches of ice cream so far, the Strawberry ice cream recipe was wonderful! I'm impressed so far and my wife was amazed (she thought we would have to put it in the freezer before eating).The two things to note (as said with other reviews), it's not small, not huge, but with it's own refrigeration system, it makes sense. The 2nd thing is the instruction booklet isn't the best, cleaning, maintaining and using is all in small type on one page and doesn't really stand out...No real complaints, looking forward to much more ice cream and gelato!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"I never thought making ice cream could be so easy, creative, delicious, quick, and mess-free. Not one penny of regret here! We look forward to every new batch. The excitement of creating and joy of eating is only surpassed with the incredible ease of use and simplicity of operation. I highly recommend to anyone to try this over another brand where it is necessary to freeze the canister first. Home-made ice cream has always been delicious, and now it is easy too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass On This Piece of Junk","review":"I read all of the reviews good and bad and on balance thought this thing was worth a try. When it arrived, it was clear that it was a reconditioned unit, something several people had observed also happened to them. It even had gelato mix on the cord! Nonetheless, I needed it for a traditional Thanksgiving ice and decided to try it anyway. What a complete piece of crap.This thing bears no relationship to a gelato machine. It's really just like a salt freezer with an electric compressor.. The motor is a joke. In order to make it run at all, I literally had to prop up the cover of the machine with quarters. It's pathetically weak and operates like a battery powered children's toy.In this case, you get what you pay for. Don't waste your time with this trasher. Buy a real one or pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic ice cream maker","review":"I bought this for my husband's 30th birthday gift. We love it. He uses it at least once a week to make ices, ice cream, gelatto, and everything in between. It freezes fast and without any large crystals; the results are always smooth and delicious. My biggest complaint has to be the top; if you're not SUPER careful, your mix can get up into the underside of the lid. We've had to unscrew a few parts to clean it, which is doable, but a pain. Otherwise, a great, great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Cream Ice Cream we all scream for ice cream!!!","review":"But to no avail!!! I got this maker for Christmas.

And I thought I had done enough research and read enough reviews... ah well, it's off to Mio Gelato we go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"We bought this, and it came broken...we called and another one was rushed out to us. Very impressive customer service from Amazon. We have had this product for 7 years and haven't had a problem since. We make ice cream throughout the summer. We find we eat less when we eat REAL ice cream...it's so much yummier. We've tried all kinds of delicious variations.Making sorbet is easy peasy!

If my second attempt will be unseccessfull, I'll be looking for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing results","review":"This unit worked well on the first batch, but would never freeze ice cream thereafter. A support person cautioned against using more than a pint of liquid; otherwise, he said, the unit wouldn't work as advertised. He suggested the pint of liquid would double in volume during freezing, thus honoring the manufacturer's pledge that the machine produces a quart of finished ice cream In my opinion, the Lello 4070 Gelato Junior belongs in the \\"buyer beware\\" category."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked for a year.......but then","review":"I have used my gelato machine two or three times a week for a year and loved it. Even though it didn't come near the freezing time....it is more like 50+ minutes. I liked it because I could make ice cream that had very little fat content or sugar-free.One week after the limited warranty time (if I had purchased it) the machine started knocking. I have only let the machine run until it stops 1 time. Was that one time too many?I am a faithful purchaser of Amazon products. I have looked high and low for a place to get some attention on this.This could be a great product. I would be interested to know how many of the machines are still running after one year.

Gradually the freezing times got longer until it took over an hour to freeze. Now it barely gets cold and won't freeze at all.I contacted Lello service and found that the problem is most likely a refrigerant leak and that repairs would cost at least $75 (not including shipping).I'm now in the market for another ice cream machine.

But, the first one that I ordered arrived broken (wouldn't get cold at all. Amazon promptly sent another. It ran for a week and then died. It was nice while it lasted, but not worth reordering!

HOWEVER, when I contacted AMAZON.COM, they were a help and told me how to return the item and use the return lable to avoid shipping costs. The NEXT DAY I went to the UPS store to sent the package back; to my surprise, when I returned home, Amazon.com had OVERNIGHTED the replacement without even recieving the return yet.

Doesn't make much product, but perfect for one or two people. You don't want to put too much product in because as it freezes the product creeps up on the blade hitting the cover. A little noisy as it churns away, but not excessively loud. The removable container makes cleanup really easy. I've made ice creams, sorbets and slushies with this machine.

So I didn't expect much from his performance. To my surprise it however works : Keanu Reeves is believable, for once. I won't spend too much words on Pacino, as he is the best actor alive on this planet. The problem I feel with this movie is the title, because it immediately gives the plot away.

I couldn't watch another second of it and turned it off with roughly 5 minutes to go, Pacino's last scene where he tells Keaunu the truth would have to be one of the worst written scenes I've ever seen. I found the first hour extremely boring, then it started to get a little bit interesting and then in the last half an hour it lost me again.

Keanu Reeves is totally unbelivable as a superduper hot-shot lawyer - he is so bad that it is simply embarassing and almost painful to watch him; he is best suited to comic book roles, like that in Matrix, and this film required someone better to make it come alive.

If you're just a complete moron and love movies that anybody with any intelligence would find trite, you're in luck. This is easily one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen. And the acting is truly a masterpiece. Keanu Reeves. . .I didn't think that it was possible to top Speed. And, boy, has Al Pacino hit upon hard luck. What happened to the great actor we knew and loved in the Godfather and Dog Day Afternoon? Who else have we got? Well, we've got the guy who played the principal in Ferris Bueller as the Devil's right-hand man. And we've got the girl from Mighty Joe Young as Keanu's wife. Just an all-star cast.

Speed was fun. But here, he looks like he's acting. Keanu is stiff and unnatural, and never becomes the role he plays. For the entire movie, I am never able to suspend disbelief and be absorbed in the story when Keanu is onscreen, he is that distracting. And what about that phoney accent? See this movie for Al Pacino and a few special effects - when it comes on television, as it does often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"Had to watch this for a legal ethis course.

The concept is great and is one of those that'll leave you thinking long after the movie is over. The only downside is that Reeves reinforces the belief that he is not a good actor.

All in all, an enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated.","review":"Great movie. Terrific acting by the entire cast, Keanu included. His best acting ever. And genuine acting too! Al Pacino is awesome. Understated at the beginning, but out in force at the end, once his identity is no longer a mystery.

The movie keeps you absorbed by it continuous twists and questions ( like \\"The Game\\"). It portrays all the tricks of deception the mind uses to keep us entangled in this world. Of course the movie wouldn't have been the same without Al Pacino which personally blew me away...the power of the speeches and comments he gave during the all movie wear just phenomenal. The more you watch this movie, the more you start to understand how our powerful mind (i.e. devil) works. It's definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story and acting, but very blasphemous","review":"This is a great movie with great acting. It is impossible for Pacino to act bad. The reason I took 3 stars off is because there is a scene for approx. 10 minutes in which Al yells and states things that are very blasphemous towards Jesus Christ, it is 5 times as bad as the Exorcist (as far as blasphamy). I would not reccomend this for anyone very religious."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie ever","review":"I keep watching them so much that I have to keep buying new ones. Love this movie.

Seems perfect on paper, but Devils Advocate suffers from so many problems that it sinks under its own weight. Pacino, normally a great actor, chews up the scenery like a T. Rex. Keanu Reeves as a southern lawyer? Give me a break! He gives the weakest performance of a already spotty career, and gives us, perhaps, the worst southern accent ever commited to film. A convoluted plot that makes little sense only adds to the viewers misery. Want to watch a good movie about Satan?

Al Pacino putting his pointy tongue along his veneers is so gross and makes me throw up a bit every time it happens in the film, which is like every five minutes. The irrational leap they ask us to make in thinking any one of the beautiful extras would think he is sexy, even if he had supernatural powers, is an insult to intelligence. You gotta love the devil's daughter's botched boob job in the end when she says \\"look at me\\" as though she were gorgeous and she is as skinny as a concentration camp victim.

Reeves stars as an aspiring lawyer from Florida that has suddenly caught the attention of a big New York firm lead by the devil himself (Pacino) and eventually becomes a servant of the dark prince (hence advocate). Eventually noticing that something is seriously wrong at the firm he works at, Reeves slowly witness his wife become enslaved and eventually destroyed by the power of the devil. Asked to finally join sides with evil, Reeves is put in an amazing choice of his life. An excellent film with a highly beleivable Reeves portrayel as a brutal attorney. Pacino also does well in his role as Satan. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Twist to a Brilliant Story","review":"Brilliant movie; Brilliant Cast; Brilliant script;A movie to own and watch a few good times with people who havent seen it; wait for the twist and see the look on their faces..Should be in your collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"One bad actor spoils the whole bunch . . .","review":"This movie really had the potential to be great had it been cast with someone other than Keanu Reeves. Reeves is such a bad actor that I was embarrassed for him and then in myself for watching. I don't know who the genius was that cast Reeves but I'm assuming it was because Glen Campbell wasn't available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking film!","review":"I was just browsing through TV channels one evening and came across this film as it was just beginning. Since it starred Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino (two very good and entertaining actors in my view), I decided to watch it. The storyline really held my interest and I have to say that I was completely surprised with the ending -- I never saw it coming! The last 20 minutes of this film had me totally captivated!! I thought it was an excellent film and have recommended it to others who have enjoyed it as well. It's the kind of film that has you thinking about the message (if you choose to believe there's a message, which I did) long after you've seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ONE of A Kind Film with a Perfect Cast.","review":"A Great, spine chilling movie that is sure to provoke your thoughts on the power's and reality of Satan. If not, at least the Morality of each and every choice we make and how it effects us and others and the motivation behind each choice we make. Sure makes you want to be as Humble as possible for you never know the forces behind your decisions and the profound impact they can have. I tell you after watching this movie, sure made me want to examine any choice I had made to feed my own ego regardless of the consequences it may have down the road. A great movie and an ALL STAR Cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie has grip!","review":"The movie takes a strong grip on the viewer although at times offensive in terms of its language towards GOD. The overall theme is however thought provoking as it reflects how the devil makes you lose when you think you are in the fast track and winning !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacino gives a stunning performance with silver screen taste","review":"The constant battle of good over evil continues in this thriller. Pacino all but steals the show. The special effects and gruesome creatures are catchy to the eye but Pacino's power and elegant evil steals what's left. His depiction of Satan or the Anti-Christ or \\"whatever\\" people like to call him( according to him) isn't short of extrodinary. He gives the old silver screen appeal. With his mesmerizing speeches he reaches out and says, \\"I don't need special effects, just put the camera in front of me and sit back and enjoy.\\" A true masterpiece, right out of the Brando-book. \\"Ahh, vanity, my boy. It's my favorite sin.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Invigorating!","review":"I am applying to law school. If you look at law school blogs by applicants, current students, and graduates, you will find that elite law firms in places like New York are often villified as hypercompetitive and elitist (i.e. top 10 law schools like Harvard or Columbia look down on tier 2 schools). Greed for money and excessive hours of work are common complaints about \\"BIG LAW\\" in blogs. This movie brings all those complaints to life with an outrageous plot. Al Pacino is the head of an international New York firm that is BIG, and he's the devil! The acting by Pacino is great. As a current Florida resident, I can tell you that Reeves does not sound like a real southerner from the SEC region. (Although his mother does). I know that Reeves is actually half Hawaiian in real life, so that is an unrealistic expectation for him to fake a southern accent. But Reeves' acting hits the right tone at the end in his final confrontation with Milton, or the devil."},{"rating":"2","title":"The talented actor of our time.","review":"Al Pacino is one of the most talented actor of our time. He is very Mephistophelean and charismatic. This movie was made to re-emphisize his excellence. It is humorously metaphrical. Don't expect something deep and philosophical. This is only a Hollywood movie. Surely fun to watch. By the way, Al Pacino's Russian was pretty good and understandable but his Korean was almost impossible to understand. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurtis Blow is back with a vengeance!","review":"One of the rarest Kurtis Blow CD's out there!TRACK LISTING:1.

It is a wonderful concept, but is very difficult for small kids to put together so an adult or older child needs to help. Even so, it is difficult to build something stable. If there was a way to make the base more stable it would be a better toy. It often fell apart quite easily no matter how we constructed it, and this led to a lot of frustration. Also, the design of many of the pieces does not make sense in terms of the marbles flowing through the channels. There are a lot of marble products on the market, and it would be worthwhile researching to see if there is a more stable set before purchasing this one. I bought this on sight without doing so, but wish I had now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised by other reviews...","review":"I am surprised by the other reviews. My son received this as a Christmas present when he was 2. We knew we would have to build it for him at first, which at 2 you don't expect them to play on their own much anyway. He and his cousin loved putting marbles in it. As he got older, he loved to build his own. At first, I'd help to make sure they flowed properly, but even if they didn't, he had fun. He was building on his own by 3. He is almost 4 now and still loves this toy. I admit that when built too tall it is not as stable, but my nephew has another system that is horrible to put together. This one can easily be rebuilt. Do understand that most complex toys require a lot of parent help at first... that is how the child learns to do it on their own (this has been true with legos and puzzles for us)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Therepy","review":"I chose this toy for our grand children first of all. I set it up with ease following simple direction enclosed. It took me very little time to complete the set and I finally was able to play with it... myself. Well I am a poor grandpa because I was so enthralled with the action that I left it set up in my den and bought another for the grand kids to take home. It is very durable, should be set on a sturdy surface, no carpet. The simple snap together sections worked well. The only drawback is the \\"not so perfect fit we of the straight pieces to the curved but that is of little consequence when we all enjoy the hours of wonderful fun together as a family.

My husband even says that the type is a bit larger which he likes but it does make the bible thicker.

Letting scripture interpet scripture is the best study method and the Thompson method is great for following scriptural ideas throughout the Bible. There are also ample other study aids and resources but the indexing system is the crown jewel. If I were stranded on a desert island and could only have one Bible this is the one I would want, without a doubt. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there wasn't a calfskin NASB or ESV version, especially in the handy size. I love limp calfskin covers, just the way they feel in my hand when I read them. Maybe the Thompson people will read this (hint, hint) and start publishing one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent study bible","review":"I love the content of this Bible. I had one before that fell apart though. I loved the Bible so much that I took a chance on buying a new one. It seems to be made better and somehow it is a little thinner.

This is an unfortunate use and loss of a good platform and important topic! The arrogance of \\"the Anglican Church, and maybe the Roman Catholic church, is the REAL church to \\"only polytheists and pantheists\\" have healthy spirituality is a demonstration of \\"same song, different verse.\\" The \\"narcisistic/addictive\\" component remains the same.

It was worth the wait, though. Since the release of Glass Cockpit the band has achieved a stunning maturity that is apparent all over Idiots Out Wandering Around...not only that, but this record features their best drummer yet (and there's been a handful) in Brent Hanson.I've been following this band so long that I can't even compare their sound to another band (they sound just like HOLS, though). If I had to take a stab, I'd say it's a lot of Minutemen with a little AC/DC and a little Cheap Trick...it's punk rock with the Midwest smile.

If you're unfamiliar with the songs, you won't even realize that they bulleted through three songs and they're on their way to the fourth song in the medley. It all comes off flawlessly. Any fan of music should be immediately impressed. Anyone who currently plays in a band will want to work harder to attain a level like this. The studio albums are great but the revved up versions included here are outstanding!

The author's narrative is in the first person and he takes us with him as he journeys through India seeking the answer to the meaning of life. In the end, he seems to have found what he was searching for.The book \\"My Father's Guru\\", by J. M.

I found it engrossing, fascinating, and uplifting.I have changed my opinion after reading \\"My Father's Guru\\", by Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson (also featured on Amazon). Masson grew up in a family which adopted Brunton as its guru, and in his book recounts many of his own and his family's experiences with Brunton, telling a very personal story which ends in disillusionment and some bitterness.After reading Masson's book it became clear (at least to me) that Brunton fabricates much, including his own Phd. status. I now suspect that much of what Brunton wrote in \\"Search in Secret India\\" was also fabricated. Hence, as a work of fiction masquerading as a documentary I do not rate it very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"My experience with Paul Brunton (A Search in Secret India)","review":"This was my first exposure to the writing of Paul Brunton.

Barnum of the exotic travelogue.He WAS able to write bestselling books about mysterious locales, but they were full of obvious inaccuracies and flat-out fiction. He wrote whatever he felt would sound dramatic and self-aggrandizing. In this book he relates a meeting with Meher Baba that has little to do with the actual interaction between the two. Although Brunton went on to be one of Meher Baba's most famous critics, in person he represented himself as a devout follower.I'm glad to see that his Ph.D. status is no longer attached to his name... he apparently made it up to lend more credibility to his writings.Check out Jeffrey Masson's 'My Father's Guru: A Journey through Spirituality and Disillusion' for more on Brunton's nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Study Resource","review":"This book is the perfect companion for one's studies of the Book of Daniel in Scripture.

Mind's Eye, to me, is a superior offering, but Time Odyssey is a close second. there is just something about Mind's Eye that i can't explain. it's so awesome, that it makes anything Vinnie puts forth, have to live up to. unfortunately, many artists suffer this affliction. they spoil us with a release, and make all their later releases pale in comparison. however, this cd is very good as well. \\"while my guitar gently weeps\\" is so masterfully done, that it gives me chills when i listen to it. if you are a guitarist, then you will appreciate Moore's rendition of this Beatles' classic. it is nicely engineered, and the performances are on point. if it weren't for Mind's Eye, i would be proclaiming it's place at the top of VM's releases. however, it is a victim of having to live up to a masterpiece, which it does a very good job of. peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compositions + Great Skill = Great CD!","review":"I had this on cassette tape way back when, and then replaced it with a CD... recently burned the CD to my mp3 player... it has been a constant for well over 10 years now. Meanwhile I've nearly forgotten that Malmsteen exists. The reason for this is that the songs here are so well constructed - the chording behind the main guitar line is what really takes you from your living room into the odyssey Vinnie Moore invites you on... (if you'll pardon the cheesy comment).Then, on top of a basic chord structure that takes you somewhere interesting, add nearly the best neo-classical themes and some of the most brilliantly executed \\"shredding\\" you'll ever hear... and you just can't beat it. (Note, I won't say the \\"BEST\\"... there are guys out there more innovative or faster).... but adding all things together, this is timeless music. Vinnie Moore got it \\"just right\\" on this one: the best of his ample output in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not in style, but still amazing...","review":"I can't even recall how many copies of this album (tape,cd...)I've gone through. At the height of senseless shred era guitar heroes, this guy actually played a lot of stuff that made musical sense. Even though I really don't play music like this anymore, I still put this cd on whenever I don't feel motivated to practice. And lemme tell ya, it'll motivate you. As far as being an \\"Yngwie clone\\" (it's hard to believe arguments like this are still going on), well, at least Vinnie had the sense not to get some shmuck to sing juvenile lyrics and awkward attempts at melodies over his neo-classical/fusion stylings. This is a fun record to listen to, and I think some younger players would dig hearing stuff like this.

The songs could still have saved it - especially with Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin collaborating - but they were tuneless and unmemorable - except for \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\" - but Gene Kelley's voice ruined it for me. Rita Hayworth was filmed unflatteringly -- and there went my last hope for enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, doesn't work for me...","review":"I know I'll take all kinds of flak for saying so, but this is a dismally scripted, poorly choreographed Technicolor musical featuring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth, both at their most lackluster. Phil Silvers is also in here -- also to no great effect. In fact, Eve Arden seems to be the only actor who even seems to be trying on this one. The costumes are grotesque, the sets are minimal and even the score - a collaboration between Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin -- is a dud. Why the movie guides like this one is a mystery to me. Only one good scene, when Kelly dances alongside his spectral reflection, other than that, you're really better off searching out stronger performances in \\"American In Paris\\" and other classics. This flick is strictly dullsville."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Classy, Brilliant","review":"My wife wanted this movie, and I was surprised to find it on DVD. Was I glad! If you've forgotten about how good movie musicals can be, give this one a try. With Rita Hayworth, Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers at the top of their form and with words and music by the Gershwins, this is about as good as it gets. Of the great female dancers in movie musicals, there is Rita Hayworth, Cyd Charisse, Leslie Caron and a few others. Trained as a dancer since childhood, Hayworth always was right up at the top of the list. This movie shows why. And of course, she's drop-dead gorgeous and a darn good comic actor. Gene Kelly's dance with his alter-ego in this movie may not be as famous as his Singin' in the Rain number, but it should be! Try it. You'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Cover Girl\\" covers it all!","review":"This is my favorite movie of all time. That might not mean much since you don't know me, but believe me I have seen a LOT of movies and NOT ONE compares to this one. As musicals go, it is the best - the dance numbers are inventive, complicated, and extremely entertaining; the songs are all catchy and lyrically brilliant(\\"Tomorrow,\\" \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" \\"Long Shot,\\" \\"Put Me to the Test,\\" and, of course, \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\"); the plot is fast-paced and believable; and even though Rita Hayworth is not my favorite, she absolutely dazzles in this movie.

Usually I end up being disappointed by the quality of dress shoes--even pricier brands--because they end up being all flash and no comfort. These Unlisted Seam Roller Oxfords, however, are a different story. Sure, they look great, but as an Amazon shopper you knew that already. They also feel great. The footbed is very comfortable, the sole is intelligently shaped, and the upper has enough lacing to tighten if necessary.The only downside to these shoes is the durability of the sole. The soles appear to be some type of soft rubber, which isn't a big deal unless you walk everywhere, like me. Also, because of the ridged design of the sole, I wasn't able to attach 'wear protectors/heel taps' to these shoes.The bottom line: this is a great shoe for the money, and it's a great fit for all but the most strenuous walkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"husband likes these","review":"I bought these for my husband who is on his feet all day at work.

Nick gets close to Jo Ann attempting to know more about Mac's drug dealing plans and his connections with the Mexican dealer Carlos, who the police believe is coming to town to meet with him. Nick also falls for Jo Ann's charms and his friendship with Mac is in danger. This movie is all about what was great about the 80's. \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" has a complex plot, one where the motives of all the characters are suspect and where nobody knows whom they can trust. Interesting plot setup and although dated, very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"well made and stylish . . .","review":"But for me at least, I found it rather hard to root for Mel Gibson's character, given the fact that he was a major, major drug dealer. When the movie ended with him more or less riding off into the sunset with Michelle Pfeiffer and all the loot, I didn't find myself feeling exactly uplifted by it. Given the fact that the movie bent over backwards to depict Gibson as a loving father, a phenomenally successful businessman, and a super-stud, one might fairly say that this movie glamorizes drug-dealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of talent, time, and money","review":"I had the unfortunate experience of spending money at Blockbuster and renting this dud. With such big name stars, I expected at least a mildly entertaining movie. What I got was one hour of lifeless, drab, big-budget flick. I couldn't bear to watch another minute, thus \\"Tequila Sunrise\\" became the first rental I stopped watching since that fateful day I rented \\"Last Action Hero\\". The actors seem to be stumbling through their scenes, lending not one iota of believability to their characters. I'm sure Michelle Pfeiffer, Mel Gibson, and Kurt Russell all look at this horrendous piece of garbage as the down point of their careers. I hope the actors had fun making this production; I sure as heck didn't have any fun watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack Master - Mr. Dave Gruisin","review":"Forget about the great movie for now and let's give credit to the great soundtrack that gives the movie its stylish southern California flair. I'm not referring to the rock and pop tracks but to the background music and the Dave Gruisin song on the soundtrack called \\"Jo Ann's Song\\". This was the track played during the steamy hot tub scene and added to the overall sensuality of the movie. Great sax riffs by David Sanborn! That song remains number one on my list of seduction tunes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cast Makes for a Great Movie","review":"Tequila Sunrise is one of the few action movies that you can watch until the end without ever getting tired of the fast-paced plot involving crime, drugs, money, etc. The dialouge is intense, the actors are great, and the plot doesn't drag on. Michelle Pfieffer and Mel Gibson show great chemistry, and also Raul Julia has a minor role that really showed his talent. This movie is a real fun one to watch. I'd reccomend it to any fan of action, or lover of great scripts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie from the 80's","review":"Mac McKussic (Mel Gibson) is an ex drug-dealer wants to go straight. Maguire (JT. Walsh) is an agent determined to put Mac in jail.

Nick Frescia (Kurt Russell) in the other hand, is the police who is responsible for the case. He is reluctant to pursue Mac since he is Mac's best friend. He believed in Mac but if Mac screw up he might have to put him in jail. Mac is attracted to Jo Ann (Michelle Pfeiffer) an owner of a restaurant and their relationship becomes a little complicated when Nick also trying to get close to Jo Ann.I guess this is one of the best 80's movie I've seen.

The chemistry amongst the three main characters is great, the story and settings are compelling, and for the ladies in the audience, Mel & Kurt are looking their best! The only fault I can find with this movie, which I only noticed because I've seen it so many times, is when Michele Pfeiffer's character claims not to know Mel Gibson's character's first name ... by the time this scene comes around she's heard it many times.

That is why this book would be helpful to little children it tries to help them to realize that they should be thankful everyday for what they have and not be competitive about things that in the long run won't matter anyway.It tells kids that they have a lot to be thankful for and that they should remember those things everyday.I would recommend it to any child who needs to learn the value of day to day life and how to respect and love everything about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"injustice","review":"After hearing the samples, albeit mono, low sample rate versions of stereo mixes, I found them sonically inferior. The ambient sound lacked charm. I wonder if the band new they were being recorded. In each case, I heard intonation rubs and or klinkers by one or more players, particularly the trumpets. If they accepted those performances, they are either naive or the recording budget prohibited retakes. And, I'm sure if the singer had her way, she would never have allowed the vocal version on the realaudio sample to be scrutinized by a large audience. II know she could have done better. It's probably acceptable live, but for a cd version, it's beneath the integrity of the band members themselves. A band like this should be recorded with the quality that will best represent the phenomenon that they create. I don't think it happened here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"The group Ordained Praise is absolutly amazing and completely blessed by God.

Not good. Four months after installation I was getting sound crackling and drop-offs. Then it mysteriously stopped emitting any sound at all. I sent it in to Sony and they claimed the unit had \\"water damage.\\" Another mystery...no water had every touched this unit, no spills, nothing. Sony wouldn't replace the unit as \\"water damage\\" isn't covered on their warranty.When the unit worked, it did work fine.

The mirrors have too much distortion, because they are plastic, and are too thin (vertical dimension) to be useful for seeing much of anything behind. The correct angle for viewing is nearly impossible to set while riding. For bar-end-grips-while-cruising, the aluminum frames (black part) seem as sturdy as any bar-end grips I have seen, but are cold and unpadded. They are functional grips, that is, right up until I hook a branch or a telephone grounding wire or something!!BUT, they are an elegant idea that I'm sure will evolve into something that works. My suggestion is wider (the short dimension) mirrors, made out of glass, and padded black frames--somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dull recitation","review":"This unstructured novel filled with graphic violence and sex, for all its salacious material, does little to either titillate or instruct the reader with any moral or aesthetic lesson. Quite the opposite, Steps is wholly amoral. This would be fine, if the writing had some scintillating quality; if the characters were richly drawn; if the flow of the narrative was swift, effective, tense. But this novel has none of these things. It seems difficult to believe, based on Steps, the Kosinski was once the flavor of the month, and a National Book Award winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I had to give up in the end. If the overall vignette concept is attractive enough, the execution of detail isn't -- Kosinski can't write. He tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important, whereas the reader is always expected to discover \\"depth\\" in simplicity. Nothing to be recommended for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americans...","review":"This may be a little deviant for you. Perhaps the new Ann Coulter book would be a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Sex, Bestiality, Sado-masochism, Revenge","review":"These are a few of the themes in \\"Steps\\". This book is not a novel, but is a series of dark vignettes which concern themselves with the degradation of men, women, children and animals. Sex is used as a dark means to control and kill the spirit of all including those who would read this crap. Remember the admonishment, \\"You are what you eat?\\" It could also be said that we are what we read. One certainly doesn't need to wallow in the mud and eat trash to gain an understanding of pigs, and one certainly doesn't need to read a book like this to realize that evil exists in the world. Do yourself a favor: stay away from this book and find something else to read. Your mind will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steps to disappointment","review":"A very adolescent work. Definitely not worth reading, despite the fact that Kosinsky had won an award for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, awful conversion in ebook","review":"The book is good, full of twisted scenes and strange dialogues.What is terrible is the quality of the ebook conversion, probably made with OCR.A lot of missing full stops, wrong words (i.e. \\"real\\" becomes \\"red\\"), and even asterisks when there shouldn't be.You better buy the paperback version..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"This is a kind of love it or hate it type book, type of prose that some just can't get into.

There are plenty of books that further damage our reputation with the stereotypes of our people. It is refreshing to read a very realistic account. People, like the reviewer above, need to realize that the stereotypes have caused extreme discrimination, all in the name of romanticized entertainment. If it doesn't hurt them, they don't care. As long as they have a good read, however fictional it is.If you are seeking the truth about the Roma, then this book will be a good addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the cost!","review":"I was very disappointed in this product!!

Many, many people have emailed me, requesting more information about what other explanations there could be, because their children are not shy due to their environment of happy loving families. So this is an update to my original review.The book does not mention any treatable organic causes for apparent shyness in children, including but not limited to anxiety disorder, social phobia, and Asperger's Syndrome. None of these issues are discussed at all. This is a serious and inexcusable omission. All of them are treatable and controllable by medication and therapy. It seriously angers me that this book does nothing to address these concerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lost Gem","review":"Almost everyone I know who still has the vinyl version of this claims to be just about to wear through it, and for good reason.This is THE seminal live alt country/bluegrass/country rock album. Usually the allmusic.com website gives very good record reviews, but on this one their 2 stars is completely unwarranted and the comments are vacuous.Just listen to the music. Watch your toes. If they aren't tapping by the second band on the album, either your leg or your brain has gone to sleep.This is my very top pick on the \\"Why isn't this available now on CD?\\" list.I agree with the other reviewers on not worrying about whether Gram Parsons is on this album. If you need a GP fix, then go listen to Grievous Angel, a wonderful album. But don't let it stop you from listening to this gem.BTW, there is a very nice family tree of all the incarnations through 1972 that TFBB went through, giving plenty of credit to Gram. However, the group did just fine without him as this outstanding release shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAST OF GREAT BURRITO MUSIC","review":"One of FBB's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM.

Chris Hillman and Michael Clarke are here, along with replacements Al Perkins (who plays steel guitar admirably) and guitarist/vocalist Rick Roberts, as well as a few other players who really shouldn't be here. It seems that Hillman wanted to turn the Burritos into a quasi-bluegrass band (which would never have happened under Gram Parsons). The first three cuts are excellent, but things go downhill quite rapidly from there. The annoying Byron Berline and a couple of his bluegrass pals horn in with a series of fairly well-played but dreadfully out-of-place bluegrass tunes, while the remainder of the album is devoted to lackluster rock. If you want to hear bluegrass, listen to Bill Monroe, who does it better than Berline and his hacks; if you want to hear the Burritos at their best, this is not the album for you. Two stars for the first three cuts, and none for the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but very wide","review":"These looked like cute shoes in the picture, but when they arrived, they were too wide, even wider than a regular medium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!!","review":"I think it's a pretty good CD!I do reccommend you listen to the samples first.The songs I reccommend are:Freeze Frame,I Want Everything,Stuck,That's What Girls Do and Remember.The others are worth listening to as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"*BEST CD EVER*","review":"this is w/ out a doubt the best soundtrack ever. it is... amazing. the movie is great too. it has songs that everyone can enjoy. i like remember... it's a really good song. and all the other songs are good too... they put you in a good mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very odd","review":"This is pretty odd to me...

It might be due to the fact it was first designed to be a backpack but refitted as a side bag, would have been nice to have both options. Good for storage of big electronic items, but not for using for everyday living because it lacks any small compartments.

And I'm not blaming them...It's a 35 minute documentary recorded at 6 hr. speed with no hi-fi and looks as if it has been put through a lo-fi inducement device. The material appears to be taken from an NBC special on Kaufman from a few years ago, slightly rearranged and combined with some hideous and inaccurate narration. Also we get to see more Howdy Doody footage that is probably in the public domain, then we do of Kaufman footage. This tape even lifts promo material from the forthcoming Jim Carrey biopic. By all means avoid this tape and stick with something legitimate. I hope the people who made this thing get sued by the copyright holders (NBC, ABC, etc.) so at least I have a collectors item when this thing gets forced off the market.

There is a good bit of Andy performing, but 90% of it is overdubbed with a horrible narration, so all you get is the visual. The whole thing looks and sounds like it was put together in somebody's basement using equipment bought from a local camera store. Obviously a quickie project to make a buck off the interest generated by the upcoming \\"Man On The Moon\\" film. Not worth the money I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Bob Zmuda book!","review":"This video was obviously made after reading Revealed by Bob Zmuda as it appears to nearly quote the book verbatim.

This holder will work with 8 Ga wire and smaller as it has spaceing adaptors inside where you clamp down the set screw. Remember to order a fuse as well. The mounting base is small so you will have to slightly angle in your mounting screws. The shaft of your drill bit extenstion and body of the fuse holder will not allow you to come in at a 90 degree angle.

Monkey movies are getting to be few and far between, with the bad ones overtaking the good. (Did anyone see Ed with Matt LeBlanc, yeah, i didn't think so) All those that feel that the genre of monkey movies is almost dead should see the brilliant Dunston Checks In. This film has it all: a monkey that wreaks havoc in a swanky hotel, and Jason Alexander really overacting. Jason, lighten up bud! you are in a monkey movie! The real pleasure comes in knowing that this film was an attempt to breath life into the monkey movie genre, a field that has been over looked by the Oscars for numerous years. The only problem with this film is that it is far too short. When will filmakers realize that monkey films should be epics, not 90 minute comedies.

Great movie with only one gripe: standard format. I mean, c'mon, they haven't even sold standard format tv's in almost a decade now. The formatting is tolerable but unnecessary in this day and age.

Keith Reid's lyrics are introspective, questioning the human existence and the consequences of life's journeys, usually in negative and dark tones. The music is sometimes fuzzy, mixing the blues edge of Robin Trower's guitar with the older style Hammond organ that pervaded rock in the late 1960s.

Trower's guitar playing is so original. Gary Brooker's voice so laid back and Fisher's B-3 weave as many pictures today as they did listening to this LP 40 years ago. That's right, 40 years!In Held 'Twas in I still reigns as the top piece on this supremely re-mastered recording. It's interesting to read the album notes written in 1997 for the re-release of this CD. How it was put together, and how it was the USA that put it on the map.For all Procol Harum freaks from 1968, This one you gotta have.A very well put together package.CheersBrian Greenway"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is it not available as download?","review":"there are a few great songs on itunfortunately those songs were not available as AAC on iTunes nor as mp3 on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"As previously stated by other reviewers, this title is presented at the wrong speedrendering it un-listenable and a worthless purchase.This edition sacrificed quality as a space saving measure for tofit in more bonus material.The bonus material would be welcome as a second disc and all held to the properspeed.Pick another version until this one is corrected.I wish I had listened to those other reviewers before I ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, the speed is wrong","review":"Salvo terribly messed up the speed of the first two full album releases by Procol Harum.I hope they eventually offer a recall program and get the albums corrected.In the meantime, I can't in good faith recommend the first two Salvo remasters.

I've been a huge fan ever since. The music on this album is beyond description! Pat Metheny is brilliant, a genius! Lyle Mays is excellent also. All the songs on this album are great, but the two that really stand out are \\"Are you going with me?\\" and \\"Goin' ahead/ As falls Wichita, so falls Wichita Falls\\". Weird titles, but INCREDIBLE songs! Buy this album, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a watershed moment","review":"in 1982 i had just graduated from college, landed my first job, got my first \\"permanent\\" apartment and on my older brother's insistence (thanks john) purchased this on vinyl and have loved the pat metheny group ever since. every time i listen i am taken back almost 30 years ago and my whole life and all of the unknowns were in front of me - very exciting and a perfect soundtrack to my life and how wonderful it was and still is. my personal favorite \\"goodbye\\" still makes me weep at the sheer beauty and powerful emotions it brings out. thank you to pat and everybody associated with the band in making this one of his best and sharing it with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Special CD","review":"For some reason I had never added this CD (actually these CD's) to my Pat Metheny collection. Well better later than not at all. There is some remarkable music here and this is probably my favorite overall Pat Metheny CD. I always liked the Pat/Lyle interchange which is well on display here. Even though the recordings are live they are excellent and well balanced which is not surprising as this is a ECM recording. Being live provides a very dynamic musicality to the proceedings. Every song is special in its own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"metheny group at their best","review":"this is the one.. the ultimate metheny experience. maybe the best ensemble metheny has put together. nana and danny are the ultimate together.. simply magical"},{"rating":"2","title":"sparkling, brilliant sets","review":"This recording is pure magic. It is almost painful in searching for something else like it and not finding... something that captures the spirit the same way that this album does. The sparkling chimes, the piano and organ, the drums, and of course, the guitar all seem to create these waves of lydian-blues and brazilian rhythms and every tune is perfect. This is the best CD of the ECM catalogue (though some of the Keith Jarrett concerts might be candidates for such a title). This Cd seems to mark a point where PMG really discovered their combined voice. Critics have said this isn't \\"jazz\\" etc. etc. and no, it is jazz... taken to new heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD's can't live forever","review":"Yep, my first copy of this CD that I bought in Japan over 20 years ago finally gave up the ghost.

Song. Ever.\\"My humps, my lovely lady lumps?\\" WTF BBQ, people. I haven't heard a more exploitative, filthy, and totally unredeeming song yet. And the club-ready vapid beats are catchier than hell, of course, meaning that this audio abortion will stick in your head just long enough to ensure that you're in a straitjacket by the end of the week.Man, I always knew The Black Eyed Peas were pathetic but I didn't realize their goal was to outsuck the Simpson Sisters, Hanson, N'Sync, Lil' John, Gwen Stefani and 50 Cent combined. Mission accomplished, gents. This makes me wanna die."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm going to pretend this didn't get airplay","review":"Out of all the songs on the new Black Eyed Peas album, I hated this one most. It has the worst rhythm, beat, and lyrics that I think they possibly could conjure. When I started hearing it on the radio I almost died. This is quite possibly the worst song ever created, it is sick, and does not belong on the hit station or on any station. The rest of the album is so good, so it is beyond me why they made this a hit. It is terrible in every aspect, and so is the video. IT scares me that anyone would actually like this song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical Excrement","review":"This song is base, juvenile, and completely lacking of any taste or value. To say that this is musical excrement doesn't do it justice. If there were words more vile than what our language considers \\"curse words,\\" they might do.It is utterly worthless. The music is thin and synthetic. The words evoke no emotion nor thoughts with any semblence of depth or meaning. When the lyrics rhyme (not that that is necessary) they do so in the most childish manner (the \\"bad/sad\\" variety).This is faux-ghetto material. I suspect her humps/lumps are merely her 4th illegitate child and most recent outbreak of herpes.To think that this hit #3 on the charts and has received the airplay that it has makes me realize the dire condition of our culture. The next time you hear of \\"sex slaves\\" or the sex trade in some 3rd world county, remember that America's own children have been sold as \\"pimps,\\" \\"hos,\\" and \\"porn stars\\" towards the profit of evil ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Song","review":"My Humps should have been called my dumps, this has got to be one of the worst songs I've seen, everything about it is horrible, the lyrics look like king kong, the rapping is terrible, the beats are pitiful and the cover is a mess.One of the absolute worst songs of the year, no doubt about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"ok people, from a teens point of view, this CD totally sucks. 'My humps' is such a stupid song--i mean, it's about a girl bragging about how guys love her butt and boobs. it gives a horrible image of women!! the tune is pretty catchy, but the actual song is just so laughably stupid.

At times, I'm ashamed to be a part of my generation. If this is what people think is \\"good music\\", then by the time I'm old and grey, music will have gone so far downhill that it will just be a random mix of beeping noises and drum samples, because nowadays you don't even have to try anymore to make a \\"hit\\" single."},{"rating":"1","title":"This song is genuinely awful...","review":"I loathe the song to death.

The last time I was, I heard this, and it reminded me why so much modern \\"music\\" is to be avoided by anyone over the age of 10 with a functioning brain. Vapid, annoying, idiotic crap. The music is unimaginative, the beats, as per usual for hip hop, are simplistic and uninventive, and the lyrics sound like they were written by a mentally challenged 12 year old. As the title says, crap like this makes me envy the deaf. If you were to hear this and the equally idiotic \\"Hollback Girl\\" by Gwen Stefani back to back, it would be enough to cause you to jab an icepick into your brain to make the memory go away. Utter garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"This song is so funny and IRONIC.","review":"Isn't it ironic? Don't you think?I could tell after a few listens that My Humps is supposed to be a (wink wink) kind of song. The song is exploring the negative mentality of women who subject themselves to disrespect by men for the sake of material possessions.You can tell by Fergie's voice that she is playing a role.I also notice a few other songs that sound like or have a similar set up to My Humps.

The book is a non-stop page turner, that will have the reader guessing who is telling the truth and who is not. The main character Matthew, is brillantly charming but has a hard time telling the truth to himself and others. He has a secret that only leds to more which in the end could cost him his relationship with his friends and even his brother. Matthew's trials and tribulations come to a conclusion when the people closest to him deliver their shocking secrets which asks the question, \\"Does everything happen for a reason, or are events just coincidental?\\"This book is a great summer read. First time writer Shannon Yarbrough delivers a story of intrigue that you just can not stop reading. I look forward to future books by him, which I can only guess will be as good as his debut novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"This unfortunate effort by Shannon L. Yarbrough fails to rise above adolescent obsession with sexual identity.The protagonist, Matthew, is uninteresting and unconvincing. One hopes -- and hopes again -- that this character might come alive. He does not.The book is not helped by the piling on of southern clichés. No matter how hard the author tries to evoke place with these trite references, there is no covering over the shallowness of the characters and their failure to engage the reader.(I decided to give the book a generous two stars, because I suspect that it is an early effort from this writer.

It is a necessity to any \\"rooty\\" student of philosophy.Secondly, let me acknowledge that Socrates was a seemingly unhuman grace to the acomplishments of the human race. However, as he encouraged us to face rational facts as opposed to common beliefs, you must face the reality that in fact Socrates had sex with young boys, as was the norm for that era in Greek history. There are no questions. Most of the great minds did, though I am both a devotee to their teachings and wise to the ugliness of those actions.If Aristotle killed a stranger would that make his work of lesser importance?Let me stress that dignity in experiences (your 4 years of study) should not extend to close the mind but to expand it. We are reading passionate works of a man who shaped our world.To argue irrationally on the topic of Socrates is to hit a man who disrespects Gandhi."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent anthology.","review":"This is the kind of text used in those bread & butter Western civ. or survey philosophy courses. The translation is fine, but not particularly critical, literal, interpretive, or anything you can associate with a particular goal on translating. It's just the text. Maybe we could call it \\"pragmatic.\\"The notes are very nicely done, comfortably introducing the reader to a lot of important background concerning ancient Greek philosophy and the culture(s) which spawned it. I think this is a fine book for becoming acquainted with Plato and generating interest for further study.What really to say about the content that other reviewers haven't already mentioned? The four books take us from outside the courthouse all the way through a post mortem wrap-up between the interlocutors. Justice, integrity, immortality of the soul, the afterlife... All of philosophy is just footnotes to this guy, after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Structured Products","review":"After 10 years, \\"Structured Products\\" is still one of the best transitions from building blocks to structured products. Written with a practitioner mindset, it is a useful read for junior structurers, treasury sales, risk managers, and users of structured products.

But what makes this book awesome is the fact everything is so real, to know it could happen to anyone, even you.The story is based around Janie, who grows up a harsh and rugged life around drugs, violence, and endless crimes. We she doesn't realize, however, is that she is destined for no real future at all. It tooks the whole book for her to finally realize this, and by then, it is too late to change what has already happened. But she could provide a good and content life for her daughter, Etta - the life she never had. Janie/Leshaya makes many bad choices, but eventually learns from her mistakes.I reccommed this book to anyone, though everything is very blunt, and the character basically speaks her mind.

This is more in the vein of hard rock, with heavy guitar & organ stylings. Most of it is fairly run-of-the-mill boogie rock, but the first & last tracks (of the original LP) are noteworthy. The title track. \\"Deep Water\\" ran up the Dutch charts to Number 5. The band's new lead vocalist sounds uncannily like The Hollies' early 70s replacement for Allan Clarke, Mikael Rickfors. Great track. The final cut, \\"Time to Leave\\", is a hit-that-should-have-been; a beautiful mid-tempo tune with, again, great vocals and fine instrumentation. The two bonus tracks sound like they changed personnel again, and are OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible, unwanted surprise after their promising debut","review":"The first Grapefruit album (\\"Around Grapefruit\\", also available on CD from Repetoire) was a delightful late '60s pop album, fueled by nice harmonies, catchy tunes and sympathetic instrumentation. Not really essential, per se, but surely worth having if you are a fan of pop music from pop music's golden age.This album, Grapefruit's second (and last) is, in contrast, complete junk. In place of high quality pop music, we get generic hard rock and boogie. It's really hard to believe this is even the same group. No matter how much you enjoy the first album you don't need this one. There isn't a single tune on this album that ranks with the material on the first one. Too bad.Things that make you go hmmm... aside: Before this album was recorded, John Lennon offered Grapefruit the chance to record the then-unreleased Beatles track \\"Two of Us\\". They passed.

Save you money and instead purchase one of the many other books written on this subject by architects, contractors, etc..

He was vocations director at St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts and is a well known writer, so he was an obvious choice to write the book on behalf of the order. However, there is too much factual information woodenly presented and without photographic or other illustration to be engaging. In fact I would think this would discourage vocations. Some basic early documents of the Cistercians are included but can be found elsewhere, including on line at the Scourmont Abbey web site. The volume is also considerably overpriced for the purpose. A better choice to learn a bit about Trappist life is the same author's book _The Monastic Way_ which is engagingly written and amply illustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"yankee magazine","review":"I ordered this magazine almost 5 weeks ago.

In it's own way, Daryl Hall's surprising album holds up very well to those other art-prog rock classics. One part Todd Rundgren, One part Frippertronics and one part Hall and Oates, \\"Sacred Songs\\" is the most accessable of the three, and yet adventurous for such a pop-friendly act as Hall. Included are a couple of bonus gems from Fripp's \\"Exposure\\" album in which Hall guests on vocals: the punky \\"You Burn Me Up I'm a Cigarette\\" and the Dreamy \\"North Star\\". One worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good reissue from the label","review":"Long sought after by Daryl Hall fans, this is a good album that gets better with each listen.

At that time (1980) Hall & Oates grated on my ears - yet if Fripp was involved in this Hall album I felt that I should purchase it - and I did. Upon its release I would have rated it 2 or 2+ stars. But now that it has been released on CD with the bonus tracks; YBMULAC and North Star that I would give it an extra 1/2 star. However, for those of you who have purchased the 2 CD set of Exposure with the extra bonus tracks with Hall on vocals, let me say that you may add another star to this disc because you will see Fripp's vision much better.So I now rate this CD as 4 stars because it has improved with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Coffee Maker","review":"For the money it is a good value. The only real issue I have had with it is that it si a bit messy. When the coffee is finished brewing you ave to put something down to catch the post brew dripping.

These may be things I do better with after some more practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for the price","review":"This Delonghi espresso maker is as described by other buyer reviews.

Quinns review pretty still pretty much holds true for this expresso maker. For the money, one couldn't ask for more. My personal experience with this machine has been generally positive. The attached tamper is convenient if you don't have one on hand but it will give you mixed results as seems to have been the case with Mr. Quinn. I purchased a tamper after having used the machine for a couple of weeks and have found that I can get fairly consistent very good results with both the single and double shots. My only complaint with this machine is that it continues to drip for several minutes after the brewing is done making it necessary to drain the drip pan fairly frequently when making multiple cups of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Water/Espresso comes out","review":"I followed the instructions and let the machine heat up for about 30 minutes then tried to \\"clean\\" it by running water with no grounds.

I called Delonghi, and they instructed me to send it to an appliance store in Ohio for repair. While I was happy that they agreed to cover the cost of repair, I did have to pay the shipping fee to send the machine to Ohio.Now, our machine has been in for repair through the whole winter, for over four months.

From the get go it has been trouble. The filter has two sizes and both are too small. I usually pull 4 shots on my old machine and get nice strong espresso, but this machine does not seem capable of pulling one strong shot, much less 4. Just putting the filter into the machine is a chore. Had to use incredible force to get the filter into place in the machine! Ridiculous. The steamer spits out a ton of water further weakening the coffee. It is terrible. I do not recommend this. Had a Dilongi in the past and it was terrible too! Should have known better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect manual pump machine!","review":"I recently purchased the Bar32 through Amazon to replace a worn out machine.

That is for about four months. After the winter, we stored it away, when we took it out again and plugged it in, water was leaking out EVERY surface on the machine. I immediately contacted DeLonghi and they informed me that it had been just over a year since I had purchased the machine and there was nothing they could do. They recommended I take it to a DeLonghi service center and I explained that their website says there are none in my entire state. They sent back an email basically telling me tough cookies. So, here I am with an expensive espresso maker that was used less than 20 times and it doesn't work. Save your money, people! Find a brand that really stands behind their equipment. I wish people would write these reviews then update them a year or so later. I think that would affect the overall rating this machine received!"},{"rating":"2","title":"coffee not strong enough","review":"We like the way it works. It's convenient and efficient.

No issues at all. Water cup could be a little bigger somehow, but I guess I might drink too many espressos... Nothing to complain: for the price, it's a great bargain.

Friends came home and nothing but compliments to my coffee now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Espresso machine","review":"After a few practice runs, I was making great lattes and Cappuccinos in no time. Make sure you let the machine pre heat fully before making the first espresso. The milk foamer works great. The downside is you can only fit smaller sized coffee cups in there. Also, you need an additional metal container and thermometer for steaming the milk. I bought a set on clearance from Starbucks for $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Crema","review":"I bought this for the discounted price of $93 (down from $210). For this price, I thought I would try it because I had never had a pump driven espresso machine before. My Krups just wasn't making good espresso. I had suffered through bitter lifeless espresso for 4 years and it was time to go. This DeLonghi has really surprised me. It helps you make better espresso because the filters are small, and if you use espresso cups you can't go wrong as you have to stop extracting as the cup fills. Over-extraction is one of the main causes of bitter espresso. This one makes great crema from the first drop to the last drop. I'm very pleased with this new discovery. Finally real espresso in the morning. I guess the pump mechanism really does make a difference from the steam operated ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"How difficult must it be?","review":"I purchased the Delinghi after reading all of the great reviews, plus it had a $20 mail-in rebate offer. What a deal. I was so excited to enjoy my first cup of home-made espresso. I have had a Krups steam driven machine for about 3 years now but I knew the real deal was the pressure driven machines. I read the directions thoroughly and prepped the machine. The green light turned on and I switched the knob to express the coffee.... and nothing happened. It makes a whole lotta noise and the machine is hot, but absolutely no espresso comes out. I read the part about flushing the parts before using so I removed the coffee from the holder and tried again. Still nothing. The water is not coming out! If anyone has suggestions please let me know, but honestly this is ridiculous. I am seriously considering returning it.

I have had electric espresso machines for years so it was exciting to find a reasonably priced pump machine and it made great cappuccinos. Sadly, within 9 months I found it was heating a little less, then gradually the gasket started giving out and it would leak water. At a year and a half the heating element failed. Replacement would cost more than the purchase price. After this experience I certainly wouldn't buy another so I am going back to a Krups 4-cup electric espresso maker. Over the years I have had 4 of them and each one was good for 4-5 years dependable service at half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother, It'll be a drip-coffeemaker in 6 months","review":"I should have believed the negative reviews - talk about irrational, wishful-thinking decision-making! In less than 5 months, the pump is a total fail. Yes, I took it apart and cleaned every part with vinegar and water, in-between descaling. Coffee is wasted, electricity wasted, waiting for some pump action. I bought it barely used, it worked beautifully for a few months, though it never had enough pressure to leave a solid coffee-clump in the basket - it was always soupy, instead. If you want to create more plastic landfill every 4-6 months, go ahead, waste your money and taint your karma. Otherwise, save up, buy an espresso machine made in Italy, where they're built to last and to make true, rich espresso. Only Saeco and Hamilton Beach make espresso machines in the USA, and both brands have terrible reviews. This one is from China, a sheer plastic horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a month and a half","review":"I got this Espresso maker because I wanted a pressure pump based espresso machine.

So I ignored the bad reviews thinking that those reviewers just got unlucky and got a bad machine, thinking to myself 'surly it won't happen to me'. Sure enough it happened to me also.

I've put the filled water tank in and out several times, thinking maybe that was the problem, but it makes no difference. Plus, the steamer part is working, which means water is being received from the tank. Still, the coffee part does not get any water even after several minutes. I have put the handle in all positions, turning it as far to the right as possible, both with and without coffee in it and with and without the filter in it.

The rubber grommet that holds the screen snugly within the filter head has completely fallen apart rendering the EC140B unuseable for want of this little piece of rubber.I've visited deLonghi's website, but it's incomplete (doesn't appear to have been updated since it went online in March 2004) and the Customer Service phone number in the documentation that came with the machine is \\"No longer in service.\\" I'm willing to accept a percentage of product failure, but deLonghi can't or won't stand behind their product quality.

Last week the machine stopped taking water from the tank altogether. De'Longhi does not have a service center in my area so I have to ship, at my own cost, the machine to New York. Ridiculous.

I just can't do it with this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"not good foam-yet","review":"I hate to be the party popper here. This machine is good for starters only. I have spent a great amount of time trying to create good milk foam and it's just not possible. Tried using different types of milk, initial temperature, pitchers, angles, etc..

I will keep practicing anyways, maybe one day I will make good foam!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good looking machine, but just haven't had excellent espresso out of it yet","review":"I purchased this machine based on user reviews, both at Amazon and elsewhere. Overall, I'm pleased with the operation of the machine, ease of use, quality, etc. The only thing is that I still haven't been able to make a really good espresso or latte with it. I'm experimenting with grinds, beans, and amount of pressure on the grounds before brewing, and I hope that I do get there, but so far, it has been mediocre.Also, I have been unable to find the 'pods' at major grocery stores or at Super Target, which was disappointing. I thought those might take a factor out of my control and it might make a better cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another DOA","review":"This showed a lot of promise--seems well designed and solidly constructed. I can see it being very useful in the absence of one limitation: the unit I received did not make espresso. The pump simply refused to work. The milk steamer part was fine. I looked at some other 1-star reviews after this experience and found several similar reports--including some where the replacement unit was also DOA. To avoid such an event, I simply bought the equivalent Mr Coffee model at a local store. It's not as sleek, but it works--great espresso and foam the very first time. A side note: Amazon has put distribution of a similar DeLonghi machine on hold because of reported quality problems. Wonder if that's related?"},{"rating":"1","title":"replacement doesn't work either!","review":"It arrived very fast, looked great, BUT JUST DIDN'T WORK! The steamer was operational, but no water would come out of the machine to produce coffee. I followed all the instructions, waited for at least 10 min, while it made all the noises and vibrations pretending to work, except no water would come out. I did make sure the water was getting into the machine (saw bubbles of air coming out when placing water tank). Read all the reviews online. Consulted my friend who has the same espresso machine for a year now and it works well. But he also confirmed I was doing everything right and the machine still did not work.So considering all the good reviews I ordered a replacement. And guess what?.. IT DOESN'T WORK EITHER!

It is easy to use even for a novice like me. I was looking for an uncomplicated, inexpensive machine that would be easy to clean and make a cappuccino like we got hooked on in Italy. The De'Longhi Bar32 is it! It is about the size of a coffeemaker, attractive enough to sit on the counter, and can make 4 cups of cappuccino or espresso as quickly as a pot of coffee. My one complaint, if you can call it a complaint, is that my coffee mugs were too tall and I had to buy some really cute cappuccino and espresso cups to fit the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"De'Longhi never sent the advertised mail in rebate, and the machine broke after 1 year of use.

The only issue we have had is since it's pump driven, there is a slight wait time for everything to heat up, takes about 2-3 minutes for my morning latte, but that's still quicker then waiting in the line at Starbucks.Ok, it's been a couple years and this machine finally died. We used it every day about once or twice a day for two years till the steamer died on us.

I will look elsewhere for a better machine and service."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This product has fallen very far short of my least expectations. The rubber grommets that keep this in place are not securely attached and constantly fall off. There is catch basin between the water container and the pump, which is theoretically a great idea in case you overfill it. However, in the case of this poorly-made product, every time you fill up the water container, most of the water leaks out into the catch basin and out all over your counter. The motor is exceptionally loud. I would not recommend this product even to my worst enemy.

Maybe it is possible, as some of the reviewers say, but at this point, it is far more trouble than I am willing to put in (I already put in more trouble that I wanted to).

This disc smokes. Sonny and Max Roach trade hot licks like a couple of dudes snarfing down buffalo wings at the local Hoot-ers.

The book isn't great because it is far from an atlas. It is more like a lab manual, explaining a little about the different lab tests. It basically has only one picture(in color)for different examples of each bacterium. Seeing as how it's an atlas, I assumed it to have lots of different pictures of each bacterium. Furthermore, it occupies alot of space with useless low yield info such as chemical structures. If you're buying this book for pictures of bacterium and virus, don't, because you can find comparable pictures on the internet. Also, not sure about this, but it doesn't seem that the authors are PhD's or MD's. They don't list a designation after their name, which may not matter to you, but I've found that most of the useful books are written by PhD's/MD's.

However, when I was trying to figure out colonial morphology, only about half the terms that we were supposed to know were covered in the book. Not so helpful.

I purchased extra music sheets to add to what it came with and, even at 5 years old, she has really gotten the hang of making pretty music with it. It is one of the few toys she doesn't forget about- it is out on a regular basis and is simple enough for her to use.

It's complex, dark, and intelligent. Cathy and Heathcliff are not textbook lovers. In fact, they are not lovers at all. Mostly, they're just mad people, who have a very deep connection.This film, is a love story. The writers have taken the characters and plot, raped, pillaged, violated and completely mutated them, leaving only their names intact. Cathy is turned from a volatile, spoilt maniac, into a flailing heroine. Heathcliff is turned from a ferocious, abusive animal, into a romantic heroIt's an alright film, if you want a love story.

For one thing, the protagonist (Heathcliff) is portrayed as a person that one should have pity for. In the novel, Heathcliff is supposed to incite a negative and bitter reaction from the reader. He is supposed to be one of the more evil characters in the novel, and we're supposed to hate him from the beginning. Another bad point is that the movie only shows 1/2 of the plot of the book, when really, the second half is much more important and crucial.Admittedly, the movie is good in itself (which earned it that one star), but it's atrocious to see what is done to Bront and her hard work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!","review":"This was a very horrible film. The plot was chopped up and scattered, the characters were not allowed to have any depth, and the claim that the film spans the entire book is only true in that it has basic plot points, but leaves almost everything of substance out in between. I was not even a huge fan of the novel, but after this film, I would gladly go back and suffer through Bronte's writing than watch this monstrosity. I am always amazed at how certain directors and screenwriters can get a hold of such wonderful actors (in this case, Finnes and Binoche) and turn them into nothing more than talking manaquins with no personality or depth. The entire time I was hoping that the two of them would just die already so the film would be over.

Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche are very good actors and they were very young when they made this - but they are both not very good. They are \\"trying too hard\\", I think.

I assume that those who find it problematic haven't taken a look at what is happening in the world lately. The affects that evironment and lack of love can have on a child can be profound. In Heathcliff we see a child, taken from the streets, given a home, but not without the taunting of an older, \\"brother\\" and the care he receives only last until his adoptive father dies. Then he is treated as the lowest of servants. Is this so unrealistic that we cannot see \\"Heathcliffs\\" amoung us today!What we see is a man, full of hate and anger, but DESPERATELY clinging to the one person that gave him happeness, even after her death.

Ralf Fiennes is the perfect Heathcliff,brooding, morose,obssesive, magnetic, jelous on an almost demented level. Juliet Binoche is Kathy flawlessly, wild and determined, together their chemistry is explosive.Jason Riddington's performance as Hareton Earnshaw is heart breaking. this alone makes the movie worth watching. My only complaint and it's a small one, is that Juliet Binoche plays both Kathy Earshaw and Katherine Linton. It's slightly disconcerting, not to say she doesn't play it well. It's just a little hard to buy. However, it doesn't really hurt the story. This is all and all a fabulous treat of a film, whether you love romance, historical, or dramatic films it's perfct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call me a cretin...","review":"...But I simply do NOT see what the 1939 Olivier version of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" has over this one. Seems to me, the sentimental, overstated style of filmmaking that was popular in the 30's is ENTIRELY innapropriate for an adaptation of Bronte's great novel. The lovers in Olivier's version speak in a manner of affected innocence which grates on the nerves, and are forever giving eachother milky-eyed stares. The dark, smouldering-beneath-the-surface passion that is communicated in the '92 version is a much better interpretation of Bronte's writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miscast","review":"This film is probably one of the few adaptations that is reasonably faithful to the text, but the casting is ridiculous so it was hard to take seriously. The actors are too old to play the parts - they are in their 40s yet they play Catherine and Heathcliff in their teens. It is silly to see the pair giggling and acting like children (because in the book they were) when they are obviously so much older! Juliette Binoche even plays young Catherine which adds to the ridiculousness of the role. I really wish the director had cast different actors. Wuthering Heights is one of those books though, where it is just so difficult to convey all the passion and grief into film.

It was not convincing - Catherine Earnshaw is a complicated profound and yet mislead person - she is here played as a smiling happy-go-lucky person, laughing incessantly, even when discussing such a serious matter as matrimony with Ellen Dean. She took it with a pinch of salt. I think Emily Bronte did not wish her to be quite so light hearted.However Ralph Fiennes plays Heathcliff beautifully - the role suited him very well, and so for Ellen Dean."},{"rating":"1","title":"wont play because its from erurope","review":"I cannot even watch the DVD because it is european and nothing mentioned it not being able to play on american dvd players.

See it only to say that you've seen it. The movie had a lot of potential, but it seems it was produced for the MTV crowd. They crammed a beautiful, sweeping novel into a 95-minute chopped-up, fast paced film. The only good thing I can say is that the scenery was stunning. The actors are beautiful, but even that lost its charm as the film progressed into a disaster. By the way, how do people who have never read the novel know if this \\"adaptation\\" is good? You don't have to read a book to enjoy a film, or to know if the film is good on its own. But you can't judge how well it's based on the original story if you've never read it.

May that day not long be delayed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Withering Heights","review":"Forget this version of Bronte's tale of obsessive love. Even the Olivier version is soft. Check out the hard to find version starring young Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff, possibly 1964 (?). The cinematography is a major player in the drama, as is the haunting soundtrack. I don't understand why the version I praise is not available, for it has truly the best of all elements and it successfully and comfortably balances the demands of the novel's complex plot and the cinematic arts at their most vivid and austere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than at local pet store","review":"I bought these for the everlasting treat toys that I bought my dogs.

They do not flatten my fine hair down, and my hair really does look thicker and shinier. Plus, both the shampoo and conditioner are so creamy and rich, you only need to use a tablespoon or so each time you apply. The shampoo lathers up immediately, with only a small amount.

The main character, a shy and naive young lady, undergoes quite a transformation not only as she takes in her new role as a wife, but also as she struggles to meet the expectations for someone in her position.

The reviewers who complain of the slow pace of the first third should understand that the groundwork must be laid for the excitement to follow. I had to force myself to slow down so as to savor Ms. Du Maurier's enchanting descriptive writing style (being a gardener helps one appreciate the descriptions) .

It is the only book that kept me so well in suspense and the ending is so well set that I can not help reading it again and again. I know there is a reason for Daphne not to reveal the narrator's name. But it really set me wonder whether Daphne had actually a name for her in mind.

The shy, timid and unamed second Mrs. DeWinter is another wonderful character, although she is overshadowed by the commanding presence of Rebecca. Another worthy character is that of Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper who seems to keep Rebecca's presence 'ever alive'.Ms. Du Maurier's prose is simple and flowing, providing a spellbinding and haunting read.A permenant book by my bedside, \\"Rebecca\\" will be read over and over again.A wonderful read for all age groups, I truly reccomend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"... Though highly readable, I find the characters to be rather flat, and the plot a tad bit too predictable. It also has a tendency to drift, which gives me the impression that Dame Du Maurier had written this without really knowing where she was heading herself. On top of that, I find this novel to be far from atmospheric or brooding. Rather, the devices employed to create an eerie atmosphere eg Danny's skull-like head etc, seem to me to be rather contrived. Maybe I'm feeling this way because I have heard too much positive feedback prior to my reading, it's easy to be disappointed when the novel falls slightly short of my expectations. But one thing for sure is that this is not the best suspense thrillers I've read. I'll stick with Victoria Holt."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eery delight!","review":"This is a timeless classic.

I will say I was suprised at how much I loved this book. I thought it would be good, but it turned out to be great. The story starts slowly, gradually building, until you just can't put it down. It is a mystery that turns itself on end. I don't want to give away the plot, but whatever twists and turns it takes, you still keep rooting for our shy little heroine.A previous reviewer commented on the abrupt ending. I thought it was perfect. Any more said would have overstated the obvious.I highly recommend reading this book. I think I will reread it.

It has its share of suspense and thrills, but nothing like I thought. This is a worthwhile read and great piece of fiction.

We never learn the name of the heroine as she marries Max, moves into the rigid but elegant life at Manderley and tangles with Mrs. Danvers, Manderley's fearsome housekeeper. What unfolds is not only a mystery but a story of obsessions and evil.

I understand that we all have different tastes in books, so if a spineless, meek, and boring main character is something you'd like then you'd love the book. I hated those qualities about her and the thing is, she never did get a backbone. The book didn't even get interesting until 3/4 in. If I didn't have to read this book, i would've given up on it.

Rebecca is about a young mistress (her name was never given) who is married to a widower name Maxim. Maxim's late wife, Rebecca, was loved and cherished by everyone~maids etc., and after her death a few things got a little cooky around the house.

Truly, every character is insufferable - Maxim is an ass who treats his (2nd) wife as if she was a small child, the 2nd wife is utterly spineless, the elderly companion at the beginning is a pretentious bore, the housekeeper is a sadistic, controlling bitch. There really just isn't anything at all to like about this book, and I'm completely at a loss to understand why on earth people seem to rate it highly.

Daphne Du maurier is unquestionably one of the best novelists of our time. the whole setting and mood of the book is over shadowed with mystery and suspence and you get the feeling that all is not what meets the eye. the story starts to build the minute Max tells the unnamed story teller how he killed rebecca and how he hated her. after that, there is no relief from the building tension as the story reaches for the climax. but just as you think relief is in sight, Du maurier surprises you again, as the real climax does not manifest until the very last line. the heavy sense of irony is apparent in the very fact that the whole novel is based on a person who has been dead for a year. rebecca is truly a marvelous literary acheivement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This book was written in 1938 so it seems very long winded for today's standards.

Dont miss it! i recommend Jane Eyre and Pride and prejudice too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"\\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again...\\"With that opening sentence, Rebecca offers an addicting and engrossing journey into the mind of our unnamed heroine, slowly tortured by her new marriage to Maxim DeWinter, a man twice her age, and haunted by his dead first wife, Rebecca--whose body was never discovered. She finds herself living in Rebecca's shadow and haunted by the mystery of the woman's death. She is and always will be the SECOND Mrs. DeWinter, something the sinister housekeeper, Ms. Danvers, will not let her forget.Rebecca is a novel of mystery and passion, a deliciously dark psychological tale with a brooding atmosphere and unbearable tension.

I warmly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I purchased this for my granddaughter's required summer reading and also read it myself.

It was full of suspence, mystery and romance! I think it was very true, the thing one person had said about Rebecca being so powerful because she had no soul. I liked the un-named mrs. de winter too. The ending seemed a little sad though, and when I had finished, I went back and read the first 2 chapters again and they seemed to make alot more sense. It was one of the best books i have ever read , don't get thrown off by the first 2 chapters though, if you work through them this book will grow on you more and more...happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Night I Dreamt of Mrs. Danvers","review":"Du Maurier's \\"Rebecca\\" is a very surprising, gothic murder-mystery and dreadful romance saga in one book. Does the novel manange to handle all of the elements successfully? Yes, with a hypnotic yet fevered pace. Though it starts off rather slow, the novel becomes like a good drug. Soon you'll crave more, and soon it will possess you. Anyone interested in horror should read this book. The vivid images have a way of creeping up to you. The only problem I had with this book was that there seemed to be a lot of unnecessary description where a few strong words could have done the trick instead of a few strong pages. Still, this is an exciting, character-filled saga of mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience..

A shy, self-conscious young girl marries a handsome and rich widower and goes to live at his mansion...great, right? Wrong. She cannot escape the shadow of her new husband's seemingly perfect deceased wife Rebecca. Everything she does seems to be wrong and not how Rebecca would have done it. The narrator overcomes her nagging insecurity to discover what really happened to Rebecca. Du Maurier creates a wonderfully suspenseful environment and uses several opportunites to shock you. This is the first novel I've read in a long time that totally shocks me with it's revalations. I say read it if you like suspense, surprises, and dramatic character shifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I read this book as a British literature project for school. I read it in two days, since it was so hard to put down! This book makes you really connect with the main character, whom the author kept nameless in a stroke of genius. I could feel the anguish and pain of the main character as she tried to fill in Rebecca's place in the manor. I could almost see parts of myself in the main character, she was so realistic. We've all had doubts that we could fill in the shoes of someone without messing it up. Plus, Rebecca was so seemingly perfect in every way. A must-read, very captivating and realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"In reading a book, I know the author left an impact if I find myself missing the characters after turning the last page. Even though we were never told her name, the narrator is a character that lies inside many woman. She is a person they fear to be, the fear of losing ones personality in loving a man. Du Maurier clearly did a beautiful job in creating this character"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor description","review":"This version of the audio-book is an abridged version of the book and this fact is not indicated in the listing.

I expected more of a mystery, more of a mind bending plot, not endless pages of nothing happening. The \\"mystery\\" did not surface until about 75 pages to the end.

I ordered another copy from Target with normal print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book-- bad ending","review":"I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed. I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very dissapointed with this book. The characters were very hard to empathise with,the story was very slow and when there was suspence, you were let down. It seemed that the author didn't even know where she wanted to take the story next, then just settled because she became bored with her own story."},{"rating":"1","title":"can you say B-O-R-I-N-G???","review":"I HAD TO READ THIS FOR MY RESEARCH PAPER AND I CAN TELL YOU IT IS NOT GOING TO BE AN A+ PAPER BECAUSE HOW IN THE WORLD CAN YOU WRITE A PAPER IF YOU DON'T GET THE BOOK.

I was pleasantly surprized to find that \\"Rebecca\\" is indeed worthy of the praise it has received over the years. I won't re-hash the plot, (naive young woman marries widower, goes to live at his creepy estate where the memory of his former wife Rebecca is everywhere). Suffice to say this novel has great suspense, a superb sense of foreboding, and enough plot twists to keep you hooked. As other reviewers have stated, it was a particularly brilliant detail to keep our heroine unnamed, it allowed the lingering memory of Rebecca to pervade this novel just as she infiltrated each of it's characters. Rebecca does not disappoint, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"A Good Read At the beginning of the book, I found it difficult and sometimes boring to read. There were many words, which I haven't known before. But the wordlist we received, was a good help. And as I'd read about twenty pages, I found the book suddenly better than before. I began to read it at home to know what would happen next in the story. And so I had to think a lot about the story, because I found it really interesting. But the end of the story isn't very good. I was surprised that it ended like that. And I was also surprised as I was told us that the second Mrs de Winter had mixed feelings for her husband, and that she was only together with him because she wanted to have a better life, more money. I did not realise that before. I don't know. Perhaps I didn't understand that part of the story. Still, I found the book good and interesting! In one word: A good novel with an end that nobody would expect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very, good book","review":"\\"Rebecca\\" is one of those rare books that really stays with you long after you have read it.When the second Mrs. de Winter (no first name is given in the book) comes to live with her new husband at his English country estate, Manderley, she finds mystery and intrigue around every corner. Mr. de Winter is still haunted by the memories of his first and beautiful wife, Rebecca. And although Rebecca is physically dead, Mrs. de Winter will find that she is still very much alive at Manderley.If you can get past the first few chapters, the story really begins to take off.

Rebecca is one of the best romantic suspence novels of our time. In Rebecca the rich hansom Maxim de Winter, seems that he can't get over the loss of his first wife, the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca. He then goes to Monte Carlo where he meets and supposedly falls in love with the narrator of the story. She then goes to his house the haunting house called Manderly.Which is run by the sinister Mrs. Danvers,who worshipped the ground Rebecca walked on. The narrator gets caught up in the life of the former mistress of Manderly Rebecca. This novel is a stunning portral of the fine writting style of Daphne du Maurier. Readers get hooked and don't want to let go until the end"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Agree","review":"This book has been around forever and is still popular. The suspense builds and the reader is drawn into the description of the characters and the elegant house. Some earlier reviewers revealed the answer to the mystery so you may only want to read the first few reviews on this page."},{"rating":"2","title":"the anti-character","review":"Rebecca de Winter is dead when this story begins, and yet is its strongest character. She haunts the second Mrs. de Winter (whose first name we never learn) even before her arrival at Manderley. Convinced that Mr. de Winter is still in love with Rebecca, she allows herself to be completely undone by the prospect of stepping into Rebecca's shoes. She is scared witless by Mrs. Danvers, the overbearing and creepy housekeeper, who remains devoted to Rebecca and determined to keep everything at Manderly just the way it was before Rebecca died.To be fair, Mr. de Winter seems to give absolutely no consideration of the fact that she might feel out of her league and doesn't seem to even notice her distress. However, even when the de Winters finally start communicating and things look like they might work out, she continues to act like a nitwit. It's very hard to sympathize which such a protagonist, but that aside, this is an excellent work of suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan Fontaine was perfect...","review":"Seen the movie many times so there weren't too many surprises except for du Maurier's writing style--very sensually detailed, full of beautiful descriptions. The story takes place in England in the 1930s and is narrated by a young nameless woman (played by Joan Fontaine in the film) who may be the most neurotic character in all of fiction. She marries well above her station and becomes the second Mrs. Maxim de Winter, the first being the mysterious Rebecca who died in a boating accident nearly a year before. \\"Rebecca\\" is a mystery, so I'll stop there, except to say that if you haven't seen the film the book will be hard to put down as you brave the suspense and clever plot turns. After I read to the end, I watched the movie again and this time the film seemed vacant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"Excellent! If you love suspense stories, you'll read this book again and again. Also, the Hitchcock movie is also very good, but veers somewhat from the book but still very good just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was glued to it....","review":"An intruiging book; we know of the second Mrs de Winter only by that name, almost as though her only identity is by being the wife of Maxim. She is endearing and silly and lovable at the same time and yet as we read how she is haunted by shadows of ghosts we are drawn to and repulsed by Manderly at the same time. And the end of the book does not come back to the beginning. As Max has said \\"Perhaps in the end Rebecca has won\\", that nothing ever ends when it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping!!!!","review":"This is a gripping novel, I could not put it down till I've finished it.

Although it is practically a classic, it is very easy to read and the 400 pages go by fast (once you're past the first 100)."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a voice!","review":"i adore this book. the young new bride and all her hesitations, which we all occasionally feel, and the jealousy that we know, that we think we know when we can never catch up with perfection, especially when that perfect is dead. each scene is beautifully constructed, even the conversations which seem dull but simmer with tension. the poor mrs dewinter, gauche, insecure, desperately in love, without the confidence to believe that her new husband loves her... dumarier managed to get everything right in a way which she does not achieve with her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The classic co-dependency novel","review":"I wanted to take the second Mrs. de Winter, give her a good shake and tell her to get a grip! It's no wonder du Maurier never gave her a name. Anyone with any gumption would have fired Mrs. Danvers after the second encounter, redecorated the west wing, given all those clothes to the local thrift shop, and had a life. Obviously well-written, classic story of suspense, etc, etc, but I had to force myself to finish this book - the heroine is so useless I had no empathy with her at all. And Maxim is another neurotic. No wonder the book is called Rebecca."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring (at least in the beginning)","review":"I found the story very slow and boring (at least at the beginning,fortunately the end is a slightly better, else it would be very boring) is , the characters sometimes seemed to do simply nothing. The actions of the people are often not or only heavily comprehensibly, for example Mrs. de Winter. Why does she stay with Maxim after she found out his dark secret? In the movie it is more understandable. But I think the movie is much better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Restored My Faith in Reading","review":"This book was great. I have read so many mediocre books lately that I was beginning to think about giving up reading and doing something else with my time. This book, however, helped me remember why I like to read.The book \\"Rebecca\\" not only has a riveting story that keeps you wondering and thinking between each reading, but it is also written perfectly, in my opinion. Daphne Du Maurier definitely knows the English language and how to put sentences and paragraphs together that flow and develop the story and characters. She seems to choose the perfect words and best writing style to build to the right atmosphere for every situation in the book. There were times when I was reading that I forgot I was reading and felt as if I was actually in the story observing what was going on.This book is going on my \\"best books I have ever read\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebecca is an unforgettable book","review":"Every so often, you run across a book that you remember for a long time. I have recently read Rebecca and can honestly say it was one of the greatest books I have ever read. Du Maurier is extremely descriptive, making you feel as if you were there at Manderley yourself. I absolutely loved every bit of this story. It added symbolism that Mrs. De Winter had no name, to add to her non existence. I saw the movie, it cannot even hold a candle to the book. Everyone, if you want an unforgettable experience, read this novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"This is the best book i have ever read, no girl should live without reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating, intricate, ironic, and ingenious","review":"\\"Last night i dreamt I went to Manderly again...\\" and so the story begins. Daphne Du Maurier has woven \\"Rebecca\\" into one of the most captivating novels I have ever read. From the moment the main character is swept off her feet by an older man, and carried off to his wealthy estate, Manderly, until the last few pages of the novel--Du Maurier keeps the reader in a trance. The characters in her novel are intricate and personable, each with his or her own secret to reveal. There is a surprise around every corner, and a new twist in the plot when you least expect it. In addition to the ingenious story, \\"Rebecca\\" has captured the most briliant and ironic ending perhaps of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"anyone who loves mystery and romance will adore this book.","review":"this book was truely of of the best i have ever read. i fell in love with it at the first page. Daphne duMaurier captures the inoccesnceof youth in Maxin's new wife, and how strong love is. she wrote a web of character that you felt you knew and you can't help but feel sorry for.

I re-read it at least twice a year and I never get bored with the story. I believe that the reason why so many people (read: women) love this book so much is they see a piece of themselves in the story. Everyone has, at some time, felt they stood in another's shadow. Everyone has, at some time, felt they were haunted by memories. Rebecca touches a universal chord in people. Masterpeice Theater (PBS) did a wonderful production of Rebecca that can be purchased. I highly recommend viewing the presentation if you can find it on sometime."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of my favorite books!!!!!","review":"The thing I love the most about \\"Rebecca\\" is the way the author tells the story. When I read it, I feel as if I'm at Manderley with the second Mrs. de Winter. Also, Daphne du Maurier never mentions the second Mrs. de Winter's name, and I think that is truly unique. This book has so many plot twists, that it makes one wonder how she got the idea for the story. This book is truly a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant, timeless novel!","review":"I had to read this book for an English class, then I had to write an 8-page paper on it. The paper was due within a week, plus I had to read all 380 pages! Well, I thought it was going to be a chore, but to my surprise, I loved it! I just couldn't put the book down. The twists and turns totally keeps the reader interested. I'm not even going to sell the book back to the bookstore--I'm going to keep it and read it all the time.

The book was full of suspense and romance. The book almost resembled a scary movie in the sense that you think you know who the killer is until the very end when you are mystified by a plot twist. I could not put this book down, maybe it was because at times I felt as though I were standing in the room watching the main character or because I was so determined to find out what happened to Rebecca. I highly recommend reading this book! You'll want to read the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"confusing at first, but ends up being great","review":"It took me two tries reading this book, but I'm glad I finally finished it. The first chapter made me fall asleep and so did the second. Don't quit though once it gets rolling it is actually a very good book. You could feel what emotions the main character was feeling and it seems like you are her. The ending is excellent. It leaves you wandering and wanting more.

This is one of my all-time favorite books, and anything else Daphne du Maurier writes is always amazing as well. This book haunted me for days the first time I read it. Yes, her characters have flaws, yes, you get frustrated with them, yes, there are cruel twists - is this not life? Rebecca is suspense at its realest and I absolutely adored it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classical novel of romantic suspense","review":"This suspenseful novel is, by a long shot, Daphne DuMaurier's most popular. The realistic character development, the complex relationships and the thickening plot makes it an enjoyable novel. As the book goes on, the reader's curiosity for this mystifying character, Rebecca, grows. However, the reader is lead in the wrong direction at first and thus is very surprised at the shocking news that is discovered. As the book draws to an end you become anxious for the main character. Sympathy is given to Mrs. De Winter and then thrilling information is revealed as all the puzzle pieces fit together. This novel is surely an incredible experience; I encourage all to read it (if you can stand your heart beating and fast paces)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Classic","review":"Rebecca, I have to admit, did not enchant me from the very first page. It took a number of chapters for the plot to kick in, but when it did, it was definitely worth the wait. What struck me most about Rebecca was its' writing. Du Maurier writes very, very well. Her writing is so descriptive and poetic, always. The story itself begins to unfold when the main protagonist is swept away from Monte Carlo, when ask by Maxim de Winter to marry him. She arrives at Manderley, finding it a mysterious place. There is a lot of mystery and suspense in this book, and a massive twist of events in the middle.I had to read Rebecca for school, and at first i didn't like it, because it was very descriptive, with an un-exciting plot, which isn't a good mix, for me. But when the plot became so suspenseful, that you had to keep reading, one finds that the writing helps to complement the scene being described.I'd recommend Rebecca to anyone ages 13 and up.Give it a try, you're guaranteed to love it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rebecca","review":"This item was listed as a hardcover book but it was actually a paperback version that had a hard cover put on it.

I read it in one day when I should have been doing other things, but I kept saying just one more chapter, until I reached the end. I recommend that other readers try (and are prepared) to read the book straight through. It's rare (for me) to find a novel that's so well written that I just cannot put it down.The plot is terrific and develops quickly (I won't give anything away), the main characters are very well drawn, and the writing style is beautiful. Given it's age, I thought it might feel dated and remote - not at all - but the reader does have to feel, at least not antagonistic, towards the life-style of the English aristocracy more than fifty years ago. I had previously read My Cousin Rachel and thought that was so good, and would be difficult to beat, but I think Rebecca wins (by a nose)!Oh, for more novels like this, perhaps Jamaica Inn will prove to be another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can get past the first 3/4 of the book you're set","review":"I had to read this book during the summer before entering high school. At first I found this book to be utterly boring, it is very long and very detailed at the beginning -- characters are very well developed -- especially the famously unnamed narrator.

I paid over $11 for this and I had purchased another to my mind (Masterpiece - The Count of Monte Cristo) and the book was wonderfully bound, uneven pages, quiet like an old book, amazing, for $7.95.

If I were to rewrite this book, I would take out a word or two a sentence to shorten the book and Miss DuMaurier could have used some more events rather than just the second Mrs. DeWinter comparing herself to Rebecca, Maxim's first wife.

Not enjoyable at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beginning","review":"I started this book and read about 10 pages. The whole time, the author was going off about the different kinds of plants which grew in this garden, and I didn't even know who the narrator was, and where the garden was.

The novel shows the problems of the main actor, Mrs de Winter, very graphic. But for me there's not enough tension. One of the reasons for the missing tension is that you don't wonder why something happens because either you know why or you don't notice that something strange is going to happen.After about three quarters of the book, the reader knows what exactly happened with Rebecca, but the book doesn't end at this place, it still goes on. That makes the end rather boring in spite of the unclear ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple glass picture","review":"This simple, 3 1/2 inch high glass sculpture is amazing.

I felt like I knew Roger Miller a little better after hearing what his peers had to say about him. Their message all seemed to say the same, i.e. \\"Roger Miller was a genius\\". I second that motion!!I would like Mr. Style to consider using his talent God gave him and write some more books that us country fans need to have written. How about Ray Price, Wynn Stewart, Tony Booth, Kitty Wells, just to name a few.

She immediately fell in love with it too. Her Auntie Zoe had a bassett hound and Hannah loved to sing the \\"Old Lonesome George\\" song to the dog. But her favorite song of all was, \\"I Wish I Had a Million Friends\\". To anyone who ever knew her, that summed up her personality -- she was so outgoing, loved meeting people and making new friends, and her world was a good place and a happy one.Hannah was killed on December 20, 2003.

In 4 nights, he was sleeping 11 hours uninterrupted and 2 naps a day for at least an hour. It's like a miracle! We're finally well rested and I have all this time to get others things done. This book and this \\"method\\" really works as long as you are consistent. The authors are very supportive of us parents which I needed, and the instructions are simple. I also appreciated learning more about sleep for babies that are my baby's age.

During the early months we we found \\"the happiest baby on the block\\" and it worked wonders for us. So we thought this would do the same. We'll it's been a month of using the tactics in this book and we are still NOT GETTING ANY SLEEP. Our child can cry for 4 hours straight like it's nothing. The ONLY reason I gave this 2 stars was because it recommended putting a few pacifiers in the crib for the baby and that has worked a bit (we use 20 and there are still times she can't find one).

I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"We have used this method since our baby was 4 mos old, it is great. It is healthy, realistic and it works. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devastating!","review":"I was so sad to watch this film and realize that it was yet another cruel 'cry it out' method. The film depicts the process of desensitizing mothers to their natural instinct to nurture their child. I wish I had read the negative reviews of the book before buying this DVD version. There are many other mothers who are unwilling to dammage their bond with their baby by leaving them to cry themselves to exhaustion under some guise of teaching them to fall asleep on their own. This quick-fix method may sell, but it isn't my idea of loving parenting. Why should we nurture our babies through the day and then isolate them at night, ignoring their real needs for closeness and nighttime nursing? The approach of Dr. Sears is so much more in keeping with my instincts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible- Utilizes the Cry it out method","review":"I did not read anything about this video before I bought it. I just purchased it out of desperation for sleep and wish I had researched it more. If you don't mind allowing your baby to cry it out, then you will like this video. However, know that while this method may work, think about what you will be teaching your child: that they cannot trust you, that sleep is a scary state to enter into. Do your research before attempting a method such as this. Look at alternatives. Read about attachment parenting and its views on cry it out methods, they make some good points. Follow your heart, if the idea of cry it out is heart wrenching, don't do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful DVD, but get the book also","review":"This DVD is great as an 'Intro to sleep training'. If your spouse is not an avid reader, this is great to have just so that they have some idea of what is going on when you try getting your baby on a sleep schedule. Then, one of you can be the expert and actually read the book. If you want to be even more knowledgeable, I would also recommend either buying or checking out \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" from your local library.One other tip: if you have an iPhone/iPad, get the app called \\"Baby Log\\". The book recommends keeping a log on the baby's sleep patterns, and this app makes everything so much easier. The app can also help you keep track of sleep, feedings, diaper changes, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of British Missional Scholarship","review":"I loved this book.

Unfortunately, there are no citations (footnotes or endnotes) to back any of these up. In other words, the reader has no way to judge the reliability of what Hoyt is saying.I know that publishers of books for popular consumption tend to dislike footnotes. However, Hoyt paints Mussolini in a better light than most other biographers or historians, and many of his conclusions are controversial. The absence of citations makes me doubt Hoyt; perhaps if he had included them, I would take some of his statements more seriously.However, if you simply want to know the undisputed facts such as when and how he took power, this book will do nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent start on Body Language","review":"I found book language is easy to understand and the images explain very well the text description.

They take a lot of time to point out that you have to look at \\"clusters\\" instead of any one signal, and then spend the rest of the book interpreting individual symbols! They also tend to present most of the gestures as \\"absolutes\\" or definite, while every other book warns you that all gestures can have multiple interpretations and you must be careful.Honestly, not a bad reference, but hardly \\"Definitive.\\" don't make it the only book you read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"The negative reviews are ones that compare this book to others or complain that it's to detailed.If a reader wants detailed and varied details.

There is little scientific information about how to communicate with body language and how to use the body language they describe. All the examples are still pictures of brittish royalty and dated celebrity shots. And while it's nice to see familiar images, not all gestures that people make have a message. Sometimes, one just needs to adjust their tie; they were just unlucky enough to have their picture taken at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Start into the vortex of the human condition","review":"This book is great, but should not be considered absolute truth, It is like a guide. There were a few things that were never even gone over, like top palm hand displays, especially with women and nails, or within a fighting/opponent context, and within certain cultures, but the more you study the more you will learn. It covers a lot and gives many references and studies one can look into more thoroughly. The only thing I personally didn't like was, the journalist writing style, it is written for the \\"average\\" New York Times best seller book reader, and binding is just as horrible. It does it's job, and you will learn to \\"read\\" those around you and hopefully use that to improve your relationships with others.

In fact, I cite this book in my dating book for men, \\"Changing Your Game\\" - if a man can learn to read women, his options increase dramatically.This book covers the gamut: the art of reading people, hand/thumb gestures, handshakes, facial expressions, arm signals, cultural differences in reading people, signs of deceit, eye signals, signs of dominance, attraction/sexual signs, and much more. It has lots of pictures, diagrams, and examples.The one negative, and it isn't really a negative, is that the authors are from the UK, so Americans won't be as familiar with some of the examples (e.g. Tony Blair, the Beckhams, etc).Good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginner book","review":"Great beginner book with a wealth of information that should be well known to some already and to some not. body language for dummies is almost the same book so dont buy both if you are going to dive farther into this field!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and well written","review":"It's a straight foward and well written book.

Joe Navarro is a confident teacher who is able to succinctly give you tools to aid you in your quest. I now feel more able to interact with other members of my species and not be overwhelmed by their seeming duplicity. Not that humans are always lying, but many of us do tend to say things that don't reflect how we truly feel and being able to tell when that is happening is very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting book","review":"Although some things seem a little far-fetched, I really enjoyed this book. My gut tells me that the authors may take a few liberties in their interpretations of studies, but I am really not sure.On a very positive note - everyday of reading it, I would learn something new and interesting. Overall, worth the time and money. I suggest you buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book is a good introduction into body language and simple to read. All the pictures included are very helpful in understanding what the authors are speaking of. Some sections of this book are just amazing. For example, the chapter on handshakes was very interesting, the authors discusses the types of handshakes and how different types of handshakes show what type of person someone is. In this book, the authors cover body language shown by the eyes, hands/thumb, legs, cultural differences in body language (which is good if you travel a lot), and much more.

I read a (quite expensive, mind you) book from the Library calledDetecting Lies and Deceit: The Psychology of Lying and the Implications for Professional Practice (Wiley Series in Psychology of Crime, Policing and Law).

This section being so inaccurate makes me question the accuracy of other sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is why there needs to be a ZERO star rating","review":"The postulations made by the authors themselves are dangerously unskilled. The book itself is highly outdated. By that I am referring to the fact that the majority of the researched used to bolster the author's opinions are studies/works published in the 50s/60s/70s (for a book written in 2004).There were double contradictions all throughout the book and there was a horrible amount of redundancy that could have been eliminated by an unbiased editor.There are better books out there. And by better I mean more accurate and more widely respected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh. There are better books out there.","review":"This book is definitely better than some of the body language books out there but it is certainly not the best. The biggest problem with the book in my opinion is that the author goes on and on and on. Most chapters could be summarized into a couple of pages and the writing style is very showy (\\"Let me tell you something most people would never dream of!...\\"). The illustrations are terrible and at times are confusing or ineffective as an examples of what to look for.Instead of this I would recommend \\"What every body is saying\\" by Joe Navarro and ex-FBI interrogator. The book unlike this one is straight to the point and has better/more information presented in a much better format.

I'm a big fan of \\"behind the scenes\\" books about films anyway, and this one was nicely packaged, with excellent photography and lovely production illustrations. Reading the script demonstrates just how well-written the film was, and how much the actors continued to bring to their roles. Best of all was the interview with Joss Whedon and the \\"mee-mos\\" he wrote to the crew, outlining his vision. The book was worth it just for those! You'll go back to this one again and again!Why only four stars? Fully 3/4 of the book is the script - not a bad thing, but I'd like to have seen a couple of longer interviews with the cast, or the other production crew, or something - in short, what's there is great, but I'd like more \\"meat.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"True Serenity","review":"This is truly a companion for teh movie.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have as much information as I'd hoped, though it is useful during gaming occasionally.It's strictly about the movie, and doesn't have the information I was looking for, about Firefly-class ships and background and such, and the costuming wasn't as in-depth either.Still, it's interesting and good to have around if you really loved the movie.

It includes the shooting script for the movie and gives a lot of historical background information on the Firefly 'verse as well as some of Joss Whedon's and the cast's musings on Firefly and the making of Serenity. A cool part of the book is the long interview with Joss, which prefaces the screening script. Joss discusses anything and everything you would want to know about the characters, about the ship, and about the 'verse. The best part about the shooting script is it includes Joss' descriptions before they came to life and deleted scenes so it's the original story Joss wanted to tell. Overall, I'd recommend this book for anybody who wants to know more about Firefly and Serenity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ni Hao! A super-shiny supplement to the film","review":"This book makes a very nice supplement to the film. It reads like a book-long interview with Joss, and includes a full shooting script, although NOT in original format, which I found disappointing - but the book as a whole overwhelms any slight disappointment I'd felt about this detail.There are really interesting pre-production memos and drawings. The book also includes Joss' explanations of the Serenity/Firefly universe, some of his angst over adapting characters and stories intended for a long run on television to a two-hour movie, and wonderful photography.

Many of the tools that she uses are NOT widely available, therefore making it difficult to even attempt to do any of the cakes.

As with all the Hall and Oates works, it is punctuated by fine vocals. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rock and Soul","review":"Although this album is not as strong as the early 80's work, it is a very soulful album. \\"I'm in Pieces\\" is a great classic soul feel; the hit \\"Everything your Heart Desires\\" is very typical Hall & Oates...their signature background vocals; \\"Missed Opportunity\\" is another fine example of their special vocal blend....no other band gets that smooth vocal blend - 80's version of Philly Soul. For people checking out Hall and Oates for the first time, I'd probably recommend their previous album, \\"Big Bam Boom\\". However, \\"Ooh Yeah\\" would be a close second or third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Side One Is Better Than Side Two","review":"Side one features Everything Your Heart Desires(3), Missed Opportunity (29) and the lesser known Downtown Life (31). Everything Your Heart Desires was the group's last top ten hits. (So Close only made it to #11 and Do It For Love reached #1 on the Adult Contemporary Charts in 2002). The other two songs on side A, \\"I'm In Pieces\\" and \\"Talking All Night\\" are also real gems. Rockability from side B is the best track of side B. What I like most about Rockability is how Daryl and John share the lead vocals which is what made \\"She's Gone\\" was such a great song. \\"Keep On Pushin' Love\\" is the only song on the album fronted by Oates alone. It closes the album. I usually skip the three songs between. As much as I enjoy the accoustic guitar effects on Rocket To God, the words and melody are bland and forgettable. Real Love and Soul Love, almost sound like the same song. That may be incidentally why they bleed into eachother."},{"rating":"2","title":"At their Peak!","review":"My personal opinion about this album is that this is one of there best pieces of work.

I have been thouroughly impressed by this album ever since I put it in my fathers 1990 CD player back in the day when they where just starting to get popular. Every song is uplifting and hip no matter what kind of mood your in or what your doing during the day.

To be honest, the rapidity of the adaptation, and its success do slightly beggar belief but this is fiction and meant to be entertainment after all!Nevertheless, this is a powerful film and, if it represents anything like the way top security prisons are run in the states, a harrowing account of the type of brutal regime designed to do anything but rehabilitate their inmates.

Add to that the fact that it's out of date, and it adds up to a definite last resort resource book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest, but it has some value","review":"Overall, I was disappointed with the content of this book. While providing useful information to the seasoned pro, I found that it glossed over too many details during the course of the tutorials (i.e., they show you a picture and just say \\"adjust yours to look like this\\" without actually telling you how they did it). This might be okay for a veteran MAX user, but for a beginner, or even intermediate user, I think they just left too much out.On the other hand, the tutorial subjects were excitingly diverse, from creating a kangaroo to creating and animating a space rover type vehicle. I just found that it didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Information","review":"This book gives a consice guide to assisted reproductive procedures with easy to read details.

Yes, it is very true, but this is really not enough to be called a MOVIE, but perhaps a skin-flick in disguise. Hewitt parades her body and performs actions that should have given this movie an \\"R\\" rating, and not PG-13. Though they may not SHOW all of the sexual acts, they are certainly not subtle, and think about it, should a 13-year-old really be watching and emulating such acts? I certainly hope not.I gave this movie 2 stars because I had a few laughs and did enjoy the ending. Oh, and yeah, I'm a male and I certainly enjoyed the Hewitt views, but if you're a sex-starved male looking for some young skin I'm sure there are other movies out there that may satisfy your cravings even more, so I add, what really was the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"hackman is funny","review":"This is a mildly funny but predictable comedy saved from total oblivion by the hilarious performance of Gene Hackman, as an elderly and ill tobacco baron and would-be dupe of two women aiming to bilk him out of his fortune. Sigourney Weaver is quite skilled in her role as a mother who has taught her daughter (Jennifer Love Hewitt) never to trust men and to use them for all they are worth. Having just pulled off a scam on Ray Liotta to get his fortune, the women set out to deceive just one last time. Although Hackman is a laugh riot in this role and Weaver is lukewarm-funny, Love Hewitt is annoying and her obvious/predictable \\"love story\\" leaves one sick to the stomach. Mindless entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I saw this movie in April of 2001 and saw the DVD in early October of 2001.

Sigourney Weaver,although a little long in the tooth to be playing a fem fatale, is competent and Hackman stole the movie with his nicotine drenched old rich guy. When these two actors were on the screen, it was watchable indeed. The big snoozer in this movie was Jennifer Love Hewitt whose only noteworthiness was big silicone implants in tight clothing.Whenever she came on the screen away from Weaver, the movie fell flat ASLEEP! She has neither the talent, charisma or looks to carry a movie by herself (so,we haven't seen much of her lately have we?)This movie is watchable IF you rent it and fastforward out the parts with Hewitt. The scams Weaver pulled were fascinating and cutting out Hewitt and concentrating on Weaver desperately looking for an old rich guy with one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel would have been a better story."},{"rating":"2","title":"jason lee is hott!","review":"for fans of jason lee this is a must see. heartbreakers is a romantic comedy that leaves you thinking about it for days afterwards. it is one of those movies that you watch and when its over your just like, hey that was a good movie. jason lee gives a great preformance. jason lee and jennifer really click. they really make the film work. plus jason lee has the whole good guy thing going and he also is kinda shirtless in some of the movie! thats a plus right there. this is a really great movie with great actors and a great story. watch it, i know you will love it! and if you don't ...well... your opinion doesn't matter anyways!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"plz read this its the truth","review":"hey,believe me ive watch all the movies that cometo the moviesheres the good things:1.they definately picked the right actors for these parts.i usually sit at a movie saying\\"it would be better if they gave his\\\\her part to...\\"but i had nothin to complain bout it2.this has a very clever backround and scene cause usually movies like this are usually bout trying to win a bet and end up fallin in love.or liking someone and then getting a makeover but this really stands out3.laughs,heartfelt moments,nervous moments this has everything"},{"rating":"1","title":"Examine that head carefully","review":"It's a rule of thumb that seldom steers you wrong: if a video cover shows the actors, who were obviously photographed at different times, crudely montaged together, the movie is going to stink. And, if that wasn't enough of a clue, carefully examine Ms. Weaver's glamorous head. Doesn't it seem just a bit too large for the sleek body it sits atop?I normally wouldn't lead off my review with such trivia but, sad to say, it's the most interesting thing about this sourball of a comedy. I suppose it's the only game in town if you want to ogle Jennifer Dugs Hewitt's cleavage so if that's your kink, godspeed.(The actresses' commentary on the DVD offers a nice illustration of their personal differences. While Ms. Weaver ponders the Gene Hackman character's resemblance to Malvolio in Shakespeare's \\"Twelfth Night\\", Ms. Hewitt rues that her butt looks so large in a certain pair of white slacks.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dsyfunctional Family Comedy","review":"I?ll admit it, I love this movie and bought the DVD. It?s like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, but this movie features a mother-daughter con artist duo.

Yes, there were parts where I laughed, but overall it was a let down. Nothing was laugh-out-loud funny either, and a lot of the points that I found funny were more so from being awkward points. The acting was pretty good but the plot line was not very amusing and did not hold my interest for very long. It is not the worst movie I've ever seen but I would not recommend it, it's really not even worth the 3 buck rental. And for a \\"light\\" romantic comedy it was a little on the long and drawn out side as well. Not exactly horrible, but not very good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"I thought with this great cast and this funny premise they could make SOMETHING out of this movie, but sadly they did not. Other than a few good one-liners (thus two stars rather than one), this movie stinks. Cliches galore, bad jokes, bad acting, and bad writing. If you want to see a good con-artist movie, get Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Steve Martin & Michael Caine. Heartbreakers is not worth 90 minutes of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"... not enjoyable","review":"Jennifer Love Hewitt better be thankful that she is attractive, because she can't act her way out of a wet paper bag.Sigourney Weaver is still beautiful at her age, but this was such a demenaing role for her, after all, she is so much better than this movie gives her credit for.Ray Liotta is ridiculous, I think he's been getting type cast a lot since Goodfellas. It's a shame, because he was really good as white bread Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field Of Dreams.Gene Hackman, the best thespian in the film, smallest part, least lines. This is just a travesty. Thought the purple shorts and green socks were hilarious. And the hacking and falling downa lot. Who knew he had it in him.Anne Bancroft: give her more screen time.The story: stupid. Very much like the review said, a female version of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with a huge sacrifice in talent... I'm glad I didn't see it in the movie theatres, because it would not have been deemed worth the price of admission. It just stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreakers - A Grand Delight","review":"This film is seriously funny! Forget the critics. This film has it all - undoubtedly the best cast line up of 2001, a great script and above all alot of heart.The film basically tells the story of two con women (Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt) who... erm... con rich men using their amazing \\"persuasion\\" techniques (the men include Gene Hackman, Ray Liotta and Jason Lee).This film was a pleasure to watch, with really funny moments (including a certain sculpture) that is not to be missed, I would highly recommend this to everyone. All the actors give an exceptional performance, especially Love Hewitt. Forget Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Love Hewitt is the real j-lo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A *very* funny movie.","review":"Okay, I admit it, Jennifer Love Hewitt's cleavage has sucked me into many a bad movie (I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, The Suburbans), but this one balanced all those out. Her performance combined with the considerable charm of Jason Lee, who plays the man she intends to con, made this movie fantastic. Sigourney Weaver made a good showing, and apparently I am the *only* person who didn't like her scene in a russian restaraunt. The high point of the movie for me was watching to see what con act got pulled next - and there were some good ones. Despite whatever you've heard from jealous women and their boyfriends, this movie was *very* funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my personal favorite comedies ever!!!!!!","review":"I love this movie the first time I watched it...In 2001, it was very original and it's very funny, because sometimes they have to do disgusting things and those things are just hilarious!!Besides, Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt are both amazing actresses, and they both made their roles very good and very convincingly...One thing we have to face: this is one of those typical \\"stupid movies\\" in which all the cast do is funny, but let's face another thing: PEOPLE LOVE THAT!!! I totally agree with the other reviewer who said that he/she almost choaked on him/herself...maybe the people who ranked this movie with 1 star haven't even watched it, but only they know.Buy it, you'll have so much fun watching it over and over again, because it's not just the jokes, it's the attitude the girsl have when they do those things."},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny, it hurts!","review":"Max Conners (Sigourney Weaver) and her daughter Page Connors (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are con-artists where Hewitt's character jeopardizes their latest scam when she falls in love with the owner of a bard that's worth at least $500,000 (played by Jason Lee). I enjoy this movie a lot, like \\"Trojan War\\" I was laughing at all the hijinks (not to mentioned smiling all the way) throughout the film (when Hewitt appears in her first scene, to the end of the movie).What can I say, I'm big fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt! I admit, however I was kind of surprised with the outfits she and Weaver wore for the film (considering I was so use to see Hewitt as the girl next door thing when she was in \\"Party Of Five\\").

Gene Hackman is hilarious and really gets into his role, and Jason Lee . . . well, I'd watch Jason Lee watch grass grow! He's always good. This is a laugh-out-loud movie that's actually got a good heart, despite all appearances to the contrary. You won't be wasting your time by watching it. Go ahead, give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I'm not usually a sucker for these types of movies. In fact, I usually despise them. But this movie is funny and romantic. I give most of the credit to the cast. Gene Hackman is solid (not quite up to his performance in \\"The Royal Tenenbaums, but he's always good). Sigourney Weaver is also terrific, as is Ray Liotta. But the two stars here are Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jason Lee. Jason is one of the funnies guys out there, but he's also been showing he can act lately (Almost Famous).

That alone tells me something about the author. And when I read it my suspicions were confirmed.

His jumps of logic are embarrassing. I'm not a scholar, but I can see the difference between a work of quality and the writings of a fanatic who desperately needs to prove his ideas despite the obvious hurdles of truth and logic. Sorry.

Switchfoot is one of the awesomest bands ever. I'm not sure if Mandy Moore did their song justice or not. It was just too different from what I was used to hearing. Anyway, if you enjoyed this CD, you should definately consider buying any of the three Switchfoot CDs. From a person who knows all of their lyrics, it is seriously a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk to Remember","review":"I chose this book because I saw the movie of it and I loved it because it was a sad and romantic story.

This story is about this girl named Jamie and how she fell in love with a guy named Landon but she has leukemia. She is not worried though because she believes thatit was the Lord's plan and that she has faith that she was meant to go like that.I liked this book because whenI read it, it told me that It does not matter what people say about you, if it is not true, then don't listen to them. Also learn how to ignore them. Jamie did that because she had faith in the Lord and that is all she cared about.My favorite part of the story was that when she did a play in her drama class.

I was trying to buy a birthday present for my little cousin, and I pick this up and was stunned. C'mon, is Cold trying to fit in with all that useless, no faced pop...? Please tell me no.

Switchfoot's songs are great, and Mandy really shows off her voice in these songs. Her and Jonathan's Foreman's voices really play off of each other well. I also enjoy Mother I Just Can't Get Enough and Dancing in the Moonlight. Mandy has an amazing voice and so do all of the other artists on this CD. I bought this CD right after I watched the movie, which was also one of my favorites. I'd recommend this to all age groups. One of my friends and I really enjoy this CD.

Mandy fans, this CD is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for Mandy Fans!","review":"I love Mandy Moore and was very excited to get this soundtrack. It was certainly worth it. Each Mandy song is gorgeous and she sounds lovely. Cry was the best song on her latest CD and probably one of the prettiest ballads I've heard. Only Hope is another romantic ballad that suits her perfectly and she sounds better that ever. Its Gonna Be Love is a mid tempo track that is sweet and catchy. The other tracks by the other artists are not as great. Fans of Mandy Moore are certainly not fans of the type of music the other songs are except for If You Believe by christian pop singer Racael Lampa. An uplifting ballad that showcases her amazing voice. The other songs by Toploader and Switchfoot are very slow, boring, and not very interesting.

Perhaps it's because many rock/alternative songs from the movie were omitted from the soundtrack. Why the Cold song was included is beyond me. I suspect that other than Mandy Moore's fantastic voice and charm, this movie hardly did justice to the book. How come we never saw anyone PRAY in this movie? Not for a miracle, not to give thanks, for the kid in the hospital?? There was alot to PRAY for, but it never happened. This movie is not a christian movie.

I have one thing to say about this cd, that if you thought the movie and book were something to remember, this cd will do you one better. You'll not only remember it, but you'll be listening to it ngiht and day, happy or sad, its the perfect cd for absolutley any time or place. Being a teen you wouldn't think a cd had so much impact on me, but my family all listen to it, I listen to it every night when I sleep, and it is definatly one of the favorite car carry alongs.

It's such a heart-warming film with a beautiful, meaningful soundtrack to accompany it. I won't explain all the tracks, but I will say you need to see the movie first to feel the music. All the songs on here are touching, sad, fun, and they will either make you cry, dance, or laugh.

The Songs that are from Switchfoot are Dare You To Move, Learning To Breathe, You and Only Hope the same song that Mandy sings. The rest of the CD has other artists that only have one song on the cd.

Seriously infectious melodies and lyrics. Elvis Costello for the new millenium. Where else do the sex pistols AND Burt Bacharach collide with such a listenable manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly his best ever","review":"\\"North and South\\" ended a lengthy recording hiatus for Rafferty. Surprsingly, given that it came 6 years after his last album, and 9 years after his last hit, the album only just missed the UK top 40.Unsurprisingly the album is filled with wall-to-wall Rafferty classics. Most of the songs clock in at over six minutes, mainly due to lengthy introductions, but the music is almost sensual, and never boring. In fact the only weak cut on the album is by far the shortest. The laid back nature of most of the tracks may mean that the music will wash over you without leaving much of an impression, so my advice is to actually take the time to LISTEN to this master at work in order to fully appreciate just how wonderful this album is. Once it hits you you will not easily forget it.This is my favourite Rafferty release bar none. If you're fond of any of his work at all you should have this album in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare gem if you can find it!","review":"Having been a Gerry Rafferty fan from hearing the \\"City To City\\" album, I was thrilled when Rafferty had released \\"North and South\\" in 1988. It was a wait worthwhile. This album captures the high energy of \\"City To City\\", but has a Celtic flavor as well. The songs \\"A Dangerous Age\\", \\"Shipyard Town\\" and the title track \\"North and South\\" are the highlights of this album. Unfortunately, back in 1988, I had the feeling this album would not be as popular as the \\"City To City\\" album, so I went out and bought the tape as well. If you're a Gerry Rafferty fan and you run across \\"North and South\\" in a resale shop, grab it while you can! This album is a rare gem if you can find it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's I own...","review":"I bought this disk in 1988 and was immediately overwhelmed by the power and feeling of most every cut. I still listen to the disc and find some of the tracks to be the most beautiful, and sad, that I have ever heard. Rafferty sings about the loss of love heart-breakingly well. There are so many good songs I could not begin to name them all. Lovely music. Lovely voice. Just wonderful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Underrated Gem","review":"This is an absolute gem of an album that went largely un-noticed on release in 1988. I won my copy (tape) on a radio call in - only thing I ever won. If it had been released a couple of years earlier (circa Dire Straits Brothers in Arms or Chris Rea - Dancing with Strangers) I can't believe that it would not have been huge. North and South is the absolute standout - I could listen to it forever absolutely sensational slow builder. Shipyard Town was the first single - nearly as catchy as Baker Street - and a similar style. Moonlight and Gold was the second single - a smoother than smooth ballad and stunner. Hearts Run Dry is a great song but was a poor choice for a single. Dangerous Age is catchy beyond belief. There is not a bad track on the whole shebang.Production is stunning. If there is ever an album screaming out for digital release (preferably on CD) this is it. It is a crime that it is not currently available."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Book, little information.","review":"Lots of words, but little useful information.

This is by far the most wasteful use of paper I have ever seen. If you think you are going to pass this exam with this book you are sadly mistakened. This book is not even close to what you need to study to pass the exam. I bought the book \\"Windows 2000 Network Infrastructure Administration by Paul Robichaux and James Chellis\\" and passed the exam. I would not recommend this book to anyone.

I spent a week reading the book, and another 3-4 days on the CD . After this time, I was well prpeared for the exam. The book is extremely well done, and accurate. The one surprise I had coming was in regards to the CD. From past Study Guide purchases I was expecting a CD that was in the fair to Ok range. This one was really, really good. It has the entire Study Guide on it, which made it easy for me to carry to work- comes with video, audio tracks for the car, practice exam, etc. I was really happy with this book- my experience with this one made me pick up the Syngress Directory Services book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No really what I expected!","review":"With all due respect to the author, this book will come handy this Christmas sitting by the fireplace.I bought this book to help me in preparing for 70-216, to get more knowledge, informations and so on; thus being confident on the exam.Instead, what I found that it has so many mistakes, so much redundancy, doesn't get straight to the point and uses to many non-sense words.

On my 1st shipment, I did not receive a video & did not receive an instructions manual. I spoke to customer service & had to return the original package & re-order another. This one came with a video & manual. I was very excited to give it a try. The \\"mega video\\" is supposed to be a compilation of several videos from beginner to advanced.When I played the video it was extremely grainy..it looked like a video that had been poorly copied multiple times. The video played the introduction but would not play the individual workouts....I was VERY disappointed. I think that I would really enjoy this rebounder if only the videos worked.

Upon arrival I realized that it is rickety and unstable feeling. I weigh 220, so that shouldnt have been a problem. I did decide to do my research and found out that the urban rebounder is among the worst rated rebounders. I lucked out and sold it within 2 weeks to a naive person like myself and got most of my investment back. I decided to go ahead and buy a $300 rebounder and its like night and day.... huge difference. I would recommend going to a sporting goods store and buying their cheapest rebounder and you would be as well off as buying the urban rebounder and save yourself the money. The DVDs were defective and skipped and one wouldnt play several of the workouts.. overall, the entire program turned out to be a cheesey cheap rip off. Save up and get a decent one that you wont get hurt on or buy the cheapest one you can find and you will have the urban rebounder for a lot less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good work out","review":"My daughter had purchased one of the rebounders and her family loves it. She recommended that I get one. I was skeptical at first so I researched \\"Trampolines\\" . It appeared that is was a good recommendation for an easy workout. I needed something that I can move around, not too heavy, relatively inexpensive. I have been using it for 2 weeks and like it a lot. I especially appreciate the CD instructions that are included.

The strength of the springs that make the trampoline fold in half caused it close with such force that it split my lip open and nearly knocked my front tooth out. After a trip to the emergency room to have 7 stitches in my lip on the outside and inside and being monitored by the dentist to make sure my tooth doesn't turn black and fall out....I highly recommend staying away from this product.

I found I didn't like a trampoline workout (got dizzy and queasy) so I gave it over to the kiddos. I had my concerns as the handle had about a foot of play in it and seemed very rickety. My son also gashed his foot on the sharp edge of the springs when he landed a bit outside of the center. Also very noisy. Then, with my 39-lb 3 yr old jumping on it one of the legs just fell off at the weld and the trampoline tipped over. It's irreparable and going into the garbage. At least my kids jumped on it almost every day for 5 months, but it surely is not a quality product as it fell apart without an adult using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T PURCHASE THIS","review":"I MADE THE MISTAKE OF ORDERING THIS ITEM, ONLY TO BE DISSAPOINTEDAND TOTALLY UPSET AT HOW THE COMPANY DECEIVES CUSTOMERS BY RATINGTHIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AS AN ITEM USED AT GYMS.

Within 15 minutes after delivery, I was literally jumping for joy! The most difficult part of the assembly, was getting the trampoline out of the box (it's very well-packaged). Some people noted a lingering odor. I have a sensitive nose and smelled nothing offensive, at all...My rebounder is black with a red band, perhaps it is an improved model. I use it with my Wii Fit program; makes running so much easier on my ankles, while giving a more vigorous workout. It is also quiet enough to hear the remote & TV.

The TAB(strip) that is attached to the mat and holds the springs, has become detached each time. I used the first rebounder for less than ONE YEAR-it pulled apart in two places. The second UR was used less than THREE WEEKS and became detached also. (My son and I both weigh under 200 lbs., so weight limit is not an issue.)I would like to offer the following SUGGESTIONS: 1. Lengthen the tabs so that they fit further into the mat./or 2. Double the tabs for better reinforcement.I truly enjoyed using the Urban Rebounder and lost weight using it. However, I will not even consider purchasing another one(nor recommend it to anyone else) until this HAZARD is corrected.

Somehow it was too hard for her, and yet when she bounced on it, her feet went almost all the way to the ground. Also, the foam it was packed with somehow bonded to the paint, and there were white blotches all over it that were not removable. I tried scrubbing them and using my fingernails, but they were permanent. After sharing our disappointment with a colleague, he said that if we were serious about buying a rebounder, to get one that, instead of springs all the way around, that could potentially hurt if you mis-stepped, to get one that had what is essentially a bungee-cord winding back and forth between the trampoline surface and the steel rim. He said these are much gentler and easier to use, but they are a lot more money, on the order of three times what this one cost. We have not yet taken that particular plunge. If this one works for you, then it's sure a lot cheaper. It didn't work for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The trampoline is very squeaky.

I wanted to return the DVD's in exchange for working ones but Amazon would not let me do this. The only way to exchange was to send back the trampoline & the DVD's.

I also ignored that springs kept coming unhooked and are damned hard to hook back. But, then the mat broke. On the first day. The mat ripped and a spring flew off, and this time no amount of grunting and groaning was going to get it stretched back into place (the section connecting the mat to the spring was torn completely free).

My 130 pound daughter used the Urban Rebounder for workouts. After our bad experiences with previous trampolines, she knew that she had to be pretty careful if we wanted this one to last. Despite this, springs from the UR began breaking within about 6 months. Eventually we had to throw it away. I can't even imagine what would have happened if a 200 pound person were to use this. I have yet to find a trampoline that holds up for any reasonable period of time. We will probably buy another UR because my daughter loves using it but I will definitely buy it from a store where I can also buy an extended warranty because I have no doubt it will need to be returned within 6-9 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy indoor exercise","review":"I have arthritis and find a simple \\"jog\\" on the urban rebounder gives me exercise without stress on my knees and also allows me to move even when the weather would discourage me.

The guy that invented this rebounder is name JB and he is awesome. There's a dvd that comes with rebounder. First timers, beginner,cardio, abs and so much more; Also one more great reason to buy the rebounder you can store it away neatly the rebounder folds so it's not in the way and for people that have a hard time to keep your balance it comes with a stablelizer bar.

I can't get my heart rate up and/or keep it up because of the pain.

I called to return the rebounder and was told that I was responsible for the return shipping fees. After spending another $28.00 to ship the rebounder back, I vowed never to purchase something so heavy from the internet without reading all the fine print. They offer warranty services, but I was not happy with the overall quality of the rebounder and did not want to keep it. It moves around on it's legs as you are jumpin and the stabilizing bar moves several inches either way which made me very nervous. I thought for the price, this was going to be a high quality item. It did not appear to be high quality to me - at least not enough to warrant the high price tag (plus the extra shipping to return it!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban rebounder","review":"The urban rebounder was recommended to me by my chiropracter.

In my opinion, it's much ado about nothing. I got tired of the irritating Beach Boy harmonies and over-production very quickly. Most of the songs are nothing special. They aren't in the same league as Traffic, Queen, Yes or Led Zeppelin. Most of the lyrics are trite and pretentious - and the singer really isn't very distinctive. The song writing is far from spectacular. I've always liked, \\"Tell Her No\\", and \\"She's Not There\\", but I heard nothing on this CD that matched the quality of those two songs. WHAT am I missing!!!!?!?! I'm convinced that the reason why this album has a cult following is because the hooks in some of the songs stay with you like ear worms and drive you crazy! I listened to it twice and will recycle it at my local used CD store."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem","review":"This essential-to-own recording captures every one of the players at the top of their form.

Each photo is a glipse into a disposible, plastic life. Does the piggy want to play or cause terror? Is the lamb timid, sad or sleepy? More interesting is the effects of mass production on expression - is that red spot on the bunny a flower or a head wound?Fun, funny and thoughtful.

NO MORE SUBTLETIES.....This is the first Pumpkins album I have heard like this......Lots of complaints about the new METALLICA as well. @@ It gives the music a midrange canned tone but ....IT'S LOUD!! BUT, CAN'T WE JUST TURN UP OUR STEREOS? This process compresses the LOWS or quiet sounds all the way up to withing 80-90% of the loud ones so any DYNAMICS that were involved in the original recording are GONE.

But I must say, that Zeitgeist is a huge disappointment for me. I agree with all the negative reviews about this album. Billy is trying too hard to prove something, and the music sounds like it.

Pure Garbage from the fathers of gay goth, emo gayrock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing album","review":"I admit it, I fell for the hype. I loved Smashing Pumpkins in the early to mid 90's but didn't really follow them after Mellon Collie. They were an essential part of my late teenage years and Siamese Dream is my favorite album of there's. So in comparison with those works, no this doesn't even come close. As has already been mentioned, the songwriting and riffs are just nothing to write home about, and the vocals are oftentimes like nails on a chalkboard. Something about the way they were mixed is just irritating, and doesn't sit well in the overall mix. Yes they have proved they can still rock, and it's still better then a lot of the garbage out today, but knowing what the Pumpkins are capable of just puts this album way behind many of their works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wall of Dreck","review":"I won't try to paint the Smashing Pumpkins new album as \\"getting back to the Pumpkins sound\\". It is what it is, a wall of noise for the sake of having noise. Not one distinct song, the entire CD blends together into a mess of guitars with some inane lyrics mixed into it.

That album and pretty much everything that Billy's released since has, for the most part, sucked, whether it be with Zwan or solo or whatever - I must say that I loved his cover version of \\"You Don't Know What It's Like\\". How can you release something as epic as Mellon Collie or as personal as Ave Adore and then expect people to buy into this inferior crap? The amps are set to 11 and you're screaming like someone dropped an anvil on your big toe but so what! None of that stuff will help carry a weak song - just ask Marilyn Manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - Corgan is washed up.","review":"A few months ago I listened to all of the previous SP albums. I was more amazed at how incredible most everything sounded. Great songs. The wheels began to come off on Machina:TMOG. With this, I wasn't expecting much. Unfortunately this is the worst \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" (it ain't real without D'Arcy + Iha) album of them all. I cannot believe how bad it is. Not one good song. If I were the label exec who received this finished product, I would have said sorry Billy, I'm not releasing it. I've already banished it from my memory (not difficult to do with this dull set), and will remember the good times by listening to Gish, or Siamese Dream. This album may have warranted a second star if Corgan had the decency to release this as a solo album or any other iteration of his choosing, but to put this out as a bona fide SP album only serves to damage the legacy of the name. Shame on Billy Corgan. This album is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR OLD SCHOOL SMASHING PUMPKIN FANS","review":"Most bands that stand the test of time have to grow or at least change, or every album would sound the same. I understand this & accept that the pumpkins of Gish thru Mellon Collie era no longer exist. I haven't liked much since that era. I just can't \\"get\\" their newer albums. Hardcore PUMPKINS fans my disagree, but this album is flat, boring, and quite simply has no punch. Classic SP almbums could hit as hard as any act in rock or slow it down, but with heavy emotion. Maybe its the fact that this album is really only 1/2 of the orig. pumpkins... either way I would discourage fans of Gish, Lull, & S. Dream from buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the bias","review":"I really wish people would (inevitably) stop comparing it to their older material.. in my opinion it was a different era of (far, far better) music, which i'm not sure the Pumpkins would fit into if they released it now. Zeitgeist is, to me, an amazing and diverse album, and while it doesn't give the same 'feel' as previous albums, if you give it a chance without throwing it off as a sub-par CD and let it grow, it will be one of your favorite albums for a while to come in a time of fairly tragic music everywhere else.People forget your bias to the 'older' Pumpkins and pick up a copy, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Smashing Pumpkins are back! Does anyone care?","review":"\\" After seven years, the acclaimed Pumpkins have returned with Zeitgeist. There are 3 versions of this CD, each one with one exclusive bonus track. It's a sham for long-time fans as well as for indie stores, because you can only get 2 of the versions at mass retailers (who are killing the music business). Ironic that a band like this, who built their career on the backs of the indies (Gish, anyone?), would lose all memory of their past. I openly encourage you not to buy this as a way of saying, \\"no thanks to your crappy marketing, you greedy bastards!\\" Thanks for listening.\\"~stinkweeds"},{"rating":"1","title":"One big pile of steaming...","review":"Crap! This album sounds as if Billy Corgan tried to put out something truly aweful (like Zwan or his solo album) just to sit back and watch the long time pumpkin fans snatch it up and talk about how great it is, or different it is. I have not heard an album this bad in a long long time, well since the Billy Corgan solo attempt maybe.If you just have to hear it, at least don't pay for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a ghost of the Pumpkins in sight","review":"This record gives new meaning to the phrases \\"Quit while you're ahead\\" and \\"In Name Only\\". If you think that Billy was putting tinfoil over his windows after his solo album sucked at the record store, then he should be well underway with bomb shelter construction now that this new \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" album is out. I don't feel compelled to write a huge review, so I'll close with this analogy: Billy Corgan is doing to the name of Smashing Pumpkins what George Bush is doing to the American flag, which is sadly summed up as an utter disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Corgan's Final Cut....","review":"This is hardly a SP record...it really an example of Billy Corgan learning marketing. His previous projects, Zwan and his solo alubm (both of which featured Jimmy Chamberlain at some point) failed commericially and alienated his fans.....this is really the equal of Pink Floyd's FINAL CUT (which really was a Waters solo venture)...it just that floyd didn't rip fans off by pushing 7 (yes seven) different \\"versions\\" of the album.Overall, BC doesn't know if he wants to be heavy, political or loving...it just doesn't mesh well as a whole. With one or two good tracks (the best is the 10 minute epic UNITED STATES which sounds very Machina-era like), this doesn't have much to offer....nostalgia is nice...but this kills the love."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad to hear some ol' skool Pumpkins","review":"Best part of this album is it is back to the old sound that put them on the map, like Gish and Siamese Dream. Mellon Collie was a great album, but my opinion is that they got a more refined, produced, and lost a little edginess. bottom line, if you like Mellon Collie and earlier, you'll love this album. if you like the stuff after Mellon Collie, may not fit you.My only downside to this is that the first half of the album is great. don't know what happened, but the second half doesn't seem as good to me. the songs are alright, but didn't catch me as much as the first half, which makes me think they just loaded up their stronger songs to the front. nothing wrong with that, but it did make me feel a little.........ho hum........towards the end, which is why i went for 4 stars.in the end, solid album, really good stuff for a long summer road trip to pump on the stereo with the windows down and the wind blowing in your face"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album/Welcome Back","review":"Anyone who gave this less than 4 stars must have had unreasonable expectations. This is a great album and a welcome return for this great band (even though there are only two original members).

I was really looking forward to it because I loved Billy and Smashing Pumpkins growing up and through college but this album never grew on me. Maybe I'm just getting old and I'm not as into something this heavy. The album was much heavier than I thought it would be.

United States has got to be the worst track I've ever heard. But a lot of great bands have had that bad album someplace. I hope the pumpkins get back into the studio to record something that rocks. This one will find some fans, and others will leave it behind as I will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm not a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan or anything but I did really like their first 4 albums. Once they did Adore that's when they turned for the worst. After the break up Zwan was pathetic and lifeless. that band was never ment to go anywhere. In 07 Billy decides to get a new Pumpkins band together with founding member Jimmy Chamberlin and two new people. The result is a sloppy, weak mess. This album only has a 2 good songs. Doomsday Clock and Bring The Light. Other then that the album is just straight up garbage. Every other song sounds flat and stale. I'm all about a band experimenting and trying new directions but this album really has no life to it. If I want to listen to the Pumpkins it's going to be 1 of the first 4 albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smashing Pumpkins Stale","review":"I have waited a long time to post this because I wanted to get over the original excitement of the Smashing Pumpkins getting back together and touring the world with their Rock n Roll anthem rock.Sadly, since summer has passed, I have not loaded this disc. It is tired and just the sight of the jewel case makes me want to listen to something else.I am not sure specifically what it is about this album that doesn't register with me, but there is no feeling that comes from it. The other albums, you could really sense something in the abrasiveness of the music and Corgan's lyrics were equally as biting, but not here. Instead what I found was another attempt at bringing back the dead, which is a mistake that too many artists make.This album isn't bad enough for me to tell them to not make another record, but it is far from impressive and to be honest, at this stage of the game, I expect a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent album. Smashing pumpkins in very fine form.

I kept listening through the album, waiting to find a great song. Tarantula is OK but it's one of the best songs on this mediocre album. All this album reveals is Billy is a narcissist, who doesn't realize he's lost his songwriting talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Crappy Comeback Album","review":"I listened to the whole album and I only remember Tarantula because its played on the radio so many times.

I was more a fan of Zwan, than earlier SP (bust still liked some older SP), I liked Corgan's solo work and I am really liking SP.I have been listening to the CD off and on for over a month now and it really has grown on me. I don't like first impressions of CDs at all. Although my first impression of this CD wasn't bad, it still took me a while to appreciate it. I love Corgan's lyrics and his more positive deep views of life. It isn't so much young angst, but a more mature view of life.

Compared to the delicious crunchy bite of the old true Pumpkins line up the new Pumpkins is like nibbling on a stale wafer. Zwan was better than this. However, if you are a fan of the new stuff by the new Pumpkins you may think this is ok. For me the good Pumpkins equals loud distorted melodic guitar & Billy pulling his lungs out and showing them to you. Thats not here. Not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"this special edition is not special at all.really dissapointed","review":"ive been expectin this special edition really more special than the standard one.but the thing is this edition sucks.i got a scrached cd after the 1st time i opened the sealed package cos the cd is put in the back slipcase and way a lot worse than it to put in a standard cd case for more protection.and the 76 pages *full*colored book is bulls***!it only got 4or5 low quality picture prints and a *lot*blank pages and transparent pages(so they call a transparent page is TWO PAGES)that is ridiculous cos all the so called book contained 4-5 pictures that maybe billy took and one billy transparent page and one jimmy page the rest are lyrics just like the standard edition.so everybody who got a brain don't buy this LTD VERSION,ITS A TOTAL WASTED OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!though the music is good.everybody should listen to the music n don't expect anything more of this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Zeitgeist is a major disappointment.

The only two original members is Billy Corgan and the (ironically enough) once-exiled drummer Jimmie Chamberlin. Completely missing is James Iha and D'Arcy. So right off the bat, this was an album that, in my mind, was behind the eight-ball to start with. You're missing half the band and the one-guy you did get to come back was someone you gave the boot to in the first place.One or two decent tracks just isn't enough to justify a glorified Billy Corgan solo album. If you need a good Pumpkins fix, go to their earlier work up to around 'Mellon Collie' ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"Want to know what the sound of a desperate mid-life crisis sounds like with guitars?

I mean, haven't we all met someone like that?Meanwhile, Madonna's new album totally, like, rocks. I mean, her biggest hits are here, and the cover of the album is nice. Im thinking if she didn't hook up with Britney Spears, she would have at least made a couple of good rock albums like this one. Who knew she had it in her?I think Madonna's dad would be proud that she finally abandoned her pathetic attempts to be a dancer and made some really sweet dance music like this one.Amazing! Isn't life crazy?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still strong.","review":"Slightly more one-dimensional than past endeavors, \\"Zeitgeist\\" still holds it's own in the pumpkins catalog. The absence of half of the original lineup no doubt contributes to the change in sound, but Billy and Jimmy channel the \\"Siamese Dream\\" sound and it works. I would have liked this album a little more if it were less political; in today's music world, politics are such a reoccurring theme that political albums are almost becoming caricatures of themselves. Anyway, I'd like to hear more of this sort of thing. So I think everyone should support this release and get us one step closer to washing away all those bad memories of emo bands that won't get off the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little known gem of a book.","review":"The book is moving, witty, involving, and wise.

It is ultimately a book with a message, about stoic courage and grace, although not everyone is ready for the wisdom here. The book's ultimate message is that we should appreciate the moment and cherish those whom we love while we can.

If you find this book useful, do not even think of trading futures, as you would be too naive to do so.This should not be even called a book, it's rather a booklet. The information presented on a level of a seventh grader. I bought this, browsed it for 30 minutes, and returned it the same day. Then (for $0.75!)

I highly recommend it for those who are serious about their tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"When I read the jacket for this book I couldn't wait to open it and read it. Unfortunately I was quickly disappointed. I doubt I'll even bother to read the inevitable third volume in the series. The first problem is that nowhere in or on the book does it mention the fact that it is the second volume in a series. I had to find that out here on amazon.com. I felt like I was playing catch-up the whole time because I didn't know the beginning of the story. I also hate the author's habit of ending chapters at the peak of a dramatic moment, only to skip over the drama and tell about it third-hand later on. I like to read the exciting parts as they are happening, not relayed in the past tense. Finally, I just found the plot rather improbable. If you want to read a good novel of aliens hunting humans, read \\"The Hunters\\" by Burt Wetanson and Thomas Hoobler. An oldie but goodie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Problem with Sequels","review":"I liked First Evidence. But if I'd wanted to read it again, I would have. Outer Perimeter was little more than a re-hash with a subplot woven in. I'm a big fan of episodic fiction - following the same characters through DIFFERENT stories - with little or no reference to previous events. However, I had the feeling throughout Outer Perimeter that I was reading the next few chapters of First Evidence. It had very little of its own plot. When I got to the end just to discover the story lines, such as they were, weren't even resolved, I just had to throw up my hands. It's my guess the next in the \\"series\\" will be another weak subplot with the bulk of the book simply re-hash of the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hundred Hungry","review":"One Hundred Hungry AntsOne hundred hungry ants marching in a row, going to a picnic-but were they too slow?

The ugly illustrations lack color, and lack soft rounded objects that are usually found in children's picture books. Also, the \\"chaos\\" pages did not effectively convey the ants realigning themselves. The story line too is awful because ants have the natural trait of traveling in single file lines -- they only do otherwise when scattered by outside forces. The worst thing about this book is that is has an unhappy ending, the hungry ants never get to eat; children expect and want a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"They use this book at my child's school to teach math concepts.","review":"This book was sent home with 100 unifex cubes to use along with the book. We used the cubes as the ants. We started off with one line of 100 cubes (as the ants). Then, in the story, they split into 2 lines of 50, so we split our cubes, too. Then, 4 lines of 25, and so on.... Excellent book to use with the cubes to demonstract how many different ways to make 100."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved the art but not the ending...","review":"I really wanted to like this book and it had me up until the last couple of pages.The art is great & I like the tempo of the story as the ants divide into shorter & shorter rows in order to make better time but the ending is a total let down!The story leaves you with the impression that math is useless and is a waste of time. The ants reap no reward for doing the smart thing and are even mad at the little ant that suggested dividing up. The ending implies that they would have made it to the picnic in time if only they hadn't wasted all that time dividing into shorter rows - ultimately not a positive math message at all.I like a good quirky kids story where thing don't end the way you might expect & not everyone is nice but this one falls short of quirky & just ends on a bad note."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Just Math!","review":"Waiting to give a presentation to my daughter's 5th grade class, I spotted ONE HUNDRED HUNGRY ANTS on display in the library and had enough time to read it and loved it!

Rather this story also has a \\"strategic business\\" spin...at least I was able to draw that interpretation. In fact, because of my mind-set, I saw this story as a great example of what can happen when leadership and strategic focus are not strong! While you may eventually get to your destination, will it be in time to reap the desired outcomes and rewards of your plan? Or will the continual process checking and redirection ultimately became a roadblock to success. The same can be true in many life and business situations.

As with most of the \`Sim' games, they have a mindless enjoyable quality about them. If you enjoy \`Sim' games then you've probably already played one or two of the games in the collection. The great things about these games are their replay-ability. You can play them again and again with each a game differing as you build your sim (city, island, tower etc). Of the collection I really didn't like Sim Copter or Streets of Sim city, which are more like vehicle simulators than building simulators. I wouldn't even bother installing them ;0( After all if your looking for a vehicle simulator you can certainly find something much better out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of Sim Games!","review":"I stumbled across this set quite by accident, and being the Sim addict I am, I just HAD to buy it! I already had half of the games, but the price was worth it just for the others. The one thing I'm not crazy about is the lack of printed manuals, but for these prices, you can't have everything. There is full documentation on the CDs themselves, so if you have a printer, it's easy enough to create your own reference manuals.

The other games didn't work on my DELL Laptop, or I couldn't get the whole point. And even Sim Safari can sometimes get too challenging, for it's so hard to eliminate locusts, fires, and drought. Even playing this game at its least challenging is quite difficult. Unlike in Zoo Tycoon, everybody wants to see buffalo, elephants, leopards, lions, and rhinos. In the scenarios, you start with too little money, so as soon as you spend over half your budget on an amphitheatre your in trouble!

Whle all of these might have been really great when they came out (although I know that even then many of them were judged overwhelmingly not to be), time and our resulting expectations, as game upgrading marches on, have ground these into the dust of gaming history. Where they might have been fun once, now they are tedious and disappointing. The exception, of course, is SimCity, which makes it through the limitations of its obviously archaic, extremely simplistic graphics with, nevertheless, still entertaining game-play.However, overall, we must accept that some things we loved in the past aren't capable of matching our current game-play expectations. These Sim classics are some of those, and are best left back there in the past to be remembered fondly... unless you just want some antiques you'll never use around to give your PC software library \\"substance\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about buying this","review":"When I saw the price for all those game I instantly bought it.

IF you've never played any other computer games and aren't expecting anything then I'm sure you'd find them all entertaining. . .maybe.But after playing Fallout, Baldurs Gate, and Diablo seeing these measly, boring games that I had just spent my money on was not a pretty sight.What I suggest to everyone is to go out and get Simcity 3000, because it's obvious that if you're checking these out you like Simulations and that one is one of the best out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half Fun, Half Boring.","review":"Half of this pack was fun (Sim City 2000, Sim Copter, and Streets of Sim City) and the other half was boring.

I have some reservations about the writing in this book however. The author constantly makes references that aren't explained, remarks on illustrations but doesn't make it clear on the photo what is being referred too, and generally talks about each subject, but doesn't necessarily always make a clear point.It's a handy book for the reference, but all that material is free online, so the price of the book weighs heavily on the balance of the material which in this reader's mind, is vague in areas that need specifics, and specific in areas that are free to the public anyway.I look forward to the second version though just the same. I feel guilty attacking the style of a clearly experienced engineer, but engineers in general know that they are a breed apart. The rest of us Laymen need more help.

Along the way you get a roller coaster ride as you discover more about the Carnies and the reason why they were passing through that way in the first place. Carnivale is a rich series set in a poignant era when hope and despair were fighting in every heart.

I have to admit that i unfortunately did not find this show until it was on DVD and cannot fogive myself for not seeking this show out while it was on HBO.

The first few episodes are excellent; however, I agree with what others said in some reviews. There are some middle episodes that draaaaaag on. Once it gets passed these episodes, things start to pick up again. I would also agree with the idea that season 1 won't leave you with many questions answered.However, if you have HBO, you can attest to how amazing Season 2 is. It seems like HBO plans to cut it after this season, so things are moving very quickly compared to season 1. My boyfriend who hated it originally, now eagerly asks me when its on next (my family has HBO On demand).I plan to buy the season 2 when it comes out, and that leaves me little choice to buy season 1 to have the whole set.So if you didn't like season 1 or are iffy, watch season 2 and when put together, the show is absolutely amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Payoff","review":"This is the best produced, acted, and written show that I have ever seen on TV. I feel embarrased to speak in such superlatives. The whole look of the the series is mesmeris1ng and feels authentic. At the end of the season, I felt frustrated with so many questions left hanging. And now the second season is being shown and does it ever deliver! And I'm beggining to see parallels between Brother Justin's manipulation of the votes of his poverty sticken followers and some things that are happening in today's political arena. And who got these actors together on the same show? Wow. My personal character favorites is the \\"cooch\\" show family, where old dad pimps his wife and daughter out on the side. Which brings me to the most outstanding and original concept of the show. Yes, there are distinctive forces of good and evil, dark and light, but there is a large ground of moral ambiguity in between that we have to navigate on our own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hbo is going to be sorry it let this masterpiece go...","review":"Without going into glorious details of how amazing this show is, let me just say I feel it is hands down the best show on television: acting, production design/art, cinematography, direction, plot development, characters, story arcs this show has it all!God forbid we had a show that was well developed and made us think but of course hbo had to go and ruin that be getting rid of Carnivale. They will be sorry though, many are upset if this is indeed the end of the show and many are actually getting rid of hbo because of it.This dvd is amazing I can't wait for the season 2 set we could only hope that hbo realizes what they have and brings this show back they at least owe it to the fans to allow it to go somewhere else then if they ar stupid to realize what they have! Carnivale was treated awful putting brand new episodes up aginst the super bowl, the oscars, the grammys etc. and little ad campaign. Shame on you hbo shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but slow","review":"Great cinematography, an interesting premise, and interesting characters that are well-cast are the strenghts of Carnivale. That said, it is simply too slow. Mysterious events happen that have seem to have no connection to the overall plot, which is itself a mystery. Character development is laborious; by the time something meaningful happens it is hard to understand the connection to the events that were spread out over the course of several episodes. No wonder HBO chose not to renew it; it was like trying to understand War and Peace reading a chapter each week, then putting the book down after 100 pages and begin reading again after several months. I wish I could give it a better review; I really liked the idea and vision. But it just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"We're Done","review":"Well, we rented 5 episodes which, in my humble opinion, is more than a fair chance but, the series never seemed to have any direction so we won't be renting any more of them.

While some people on here complain about the pacing, I was able to deal with it. I felt like the season built up to an exciting and satisfying ending.

The series reminds me of a long string along movie where you hope it gets good but doesn't and then has a big let down ending. There is some interesting sex parts and lots of twisted love triangles but that was all it had good. The entire first season was slow to get the plot going. Overall a big let down. Would not buy the season or bother to watch it or recommend it to anyone.

Specifically, this brilliant book relates the Course's thought system to that which underlies many of the Gnostic movements of the early centuries of Christendom, along with Platonism and Neo-Platonism.

He records the scene outside the train window or porthole like no one else. Close to poetic in some sections.I have read almost all of Theroux's books and when I picked up this one I was afraid it would just be excerpts from his travels and might be less than satisfying, the tales taken out of conntext. I was wrong. These stories are gems in their own right, timeless, and may inspire you to read more of his books, fiction and nonfiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Globetrotting Non-Tourist","review":"This book is a collection of episodes, usually not connected, from six previous Theroux books published in the 70's and 80's. His travels in five different continents are highlighted here with varying degrees of detail. Since his other books describe distinct journeys from beginning to end, Theroux explains in the intro here that this book is meant more as a celebration of the art of traveling itself. He also has some snide insights into the art of travel writing, especially annoying authors who give only a tourist's eye view of the destination but don't bother to say how they got there. Getting there is Theroux's passion and the fragments in this volume usually show him encountering all kinds of intriguing characters and situations around the world, all while on his way somewhere else. That includes the good, the bad, and the ugly - and describing all of these with equal insight is Theroux's greatest strength as a globetrotting non-tourist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squeezing a little more from the old stuff","review":"Paul Theroux has always been a grump but I have read, and enjoyed, most of his books.

Please save your money and buy a real juicier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numerous of design flaws.","review":"The strainer is quite difficult to clean, as pulp gets trapped when you flip it over to clean it. Trying to chase down and remove the loose pulp can be maddening. Also, like others have mentioned, the torque will spin the entire juicer around, and if you're not careful it'll wobble off the container. The press thingy tends to get stuck in the chute because it narrows towards the bottom. Leaks and doesn't handle leafy vegetables well.There are much better juicers on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Machine is Wild, if not Dangerous","review":"I have many KitchenAid Appliances from a Dishwasher to the Stand Mixer and Food Processor.

I cut two fairly large carrots in half and started to feed them into the juicer. Fairly quickly (after 1 carrot), the shredded carrots got unbalanced and the machine started to shake a little bit. I decided that this wasn't too bad and continued with the second carrot. Whaoooo horsey!! Halfway into the second carrot, this machine developed a mind of its own started to vibrate wildly and spin around the countertop spilling juice out its spout.Although this machine was well-built & cute I had to send it back. (Note: KitchenAide recommends emptying the basket if it gets out of balance. I didn't think I wanted to have to empty the basket after each and every carrot.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchenaid juicer","review":"This is a great product.

Then, when her youngest was just a few months old, she was diagnosed with inoperable breast cancer.

Joe Lynn Turner is on vocals this time around, and the music definitely has a very glammy, 80's-era Rainbow feel to it, culminating with the ultra-cheezy hit \\"Heaven Tonight\\". But there is some amazing stuff on this album once you dig into it. \\"Hold On\\" is a great piece and showcases the good that JLT can do for this incarnation of Yngwie's band. There's also good to be had with \\"Bite The Bullet/Riot In The Dungeons\\" and \\"Krakatau\\", both of which are in the vein of Yngwie's earlier compositions. But \\"Dreaming (Tell Me)\\" is the rather early climax, a dreamy, acoustic-tinged piece with an absolutely crushing solo at the end. Its probably Yngwie's finest moment on any of his albums, and the reason this is a four-star review and not 2-1/2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic","review":"This is one of the greatest guitar cds of all time. Yngwie Malmsteen teams up with Turner (former Rainbow singer) to produce a fantastic cd that will blow your brain with guitar riffs and fill you up with quality songs. Rising Force, track 1, is powerful and a perfect start to the cd with a great guitar solo. Hold On follows up, and then Heaven Tonight: both quality songs. The next song, Dreaming, didn't do much for me. Bite the Bullet is Yngwie's \\"Eruption\\" (Van Halen) and it's not bad at all. Riot in the Dungeons blows you away with it's lightnight quick riffs and long intro. Crystal Ball is my personal favorite on this cd. Turner on vocals is absolutely phenominal delivering perfect melodies and the chorus is very catchy. The last three songs are good, but nothing stands out for me. Overall this is a great cd, and one of the best guitar cds of all time.

Then, we have the \\"majestic\\" (I'm joking ) \\"HEAVEN TONIGHT\\", that should make Bon Jovi and Poison proud. Joe Lynn Turner managed to do the same thing he did while he was in RAINBOW: convince the great guitarrists that it was time to make some money and sell out.

This book has an energy about it, as obviously from the previous reviews, Stephen Arroyo has IT, he is the consummate humanistic astrologer who can give people the absolute astrological stuff that we need when we need it. Very much in the same area of astrology as Liz Green, yet in my opinion much more easily accessible, for as much as I adore Liz Greene's work, it can be quite intense and needs many readings to take in what she is saying. All of Stephen Arroyo's books are a joy to read, this one being my favourite.

The character's personalities are so detailed that I swear I could picture them standing right next to me! The third book got a little strange, but the storyline overall is very solid.

We are supposed to just accept Dr. Emoto's research that water changes shape when presented with different emotions based on one study with each emotion and no variables in the study.

I appreciate the guesture, but it was completely unncecessary.The play itself is only about 80 pages long, just 10 pages more than the Cliff Notes. So don't expect to save any time by reading Cliff Notes instead of the play.Also, the play isn't really that confusing at all. There are only a handful of characters and the dialouge is not hard to understand (though it isn't written in a modern dialect). While reading this play (I finished it in one night), I never once was confused or lost.Cliff Notes can be useful for long, boring, confusing works such as The Scarlet Letter. But something as short and simple as The Importance of Being Earnest stands fine on it's own. Skip the Cliff Notes and just read the play. It's actually pretty funny and you'll probably enjoy it.

If I set my EQ just right I can hear something that sounds good. It might just be in my imagination but I can't fault the band completely for a bad production house. But, like the title says, this CD has HORRIBLE, DEPLORABLE, TERRIBLE, SAD, MISERABLE production quality. There are some CD's you buy that sound good on only certain types of stereo equipment. This cd sounds TERRIBLE on all configurations. The only album that I can think of that has just as bad if not worse production quality is \\"St.Anger\\" by Metallica, but at least Nevermore's music is still good, so that's the upside. Please Nevermore, if you are reading any of these reviews, I'm almost positive that your songs are awesome. Please produce another CD. We won't think any less of you!!!

You can hear some of each song in every song on this album. Nevermore's last masterpiece was DEAD HEART, after that...It's not that the songs are BAD. They're just linear. On DEAD HEART, NM switched gears with each song. This was especially so on their EP IN MEMORY. Each song was a masterpiece you could hang on the wall and admire as an individual work of art.ENEMIES is a collection that you get the sense of the genius behind it only collectively. None of the songs really stand out on their own merit.But hey. Awesome band. These aren't guitar-slinging nuts, these are musicians to be reckoned with.

I think the singing sounds a little distant, but that goes with the dark and heavy sound of the CD. I am not a big fan of extremely heavy CDs, but Nevermore makes it so good. The guitarwork is excellent, with great solos and riffs. Of course, as always, Nevermore has some of the best drumming of any band out today or ever.

Nevermore really thrash it up on Enemies, and the musicianship is of course excellent.

The rolling/massaging action helps break down stiff and sore connective tissue that resulted during the healing of an old injury. In addition, proper use of the roll on the spine can help balance the autonomic nervous system by calming sympathetic nerve energy in the mid-back (thoracic spine)and stimulating parasympathetic activity in the sacral and cervical regions.

I'm sure children today will find it as entertaining as I did back then. I highly recommend Petunia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petunia","review":"The book is wonderful but the copy I received was not the original hardback with outer cover. It was, instead, a smaller child's cardboard back book which is not at all what I thought that I was purchasing. Hence, I was very much disappointed but kept it for an extra copy in our library. The advertising led me to believe that it was the original hardback . . . I am not happy about that which I feel was deceptive advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proud Petunia Pleases","review":"Petunia is a silly goose who finds a book and believes she'll be wiser if she's seen carrying it around. And the other barnyard animals actually think she *is* wiser because of it. The thing of it is, she's still just a silly goose, who gets her friends into all sorts of scrapes.\\"Petunia\\" is a pleaser but gets a little too philosophical in the last two pages. That's okay-- the first pages and clean 1950s illustrations make up for it. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Kids' Books","review":"This is a book I remembered vaguely from my own childhood and bought for my son on a whim. He loves it. In fact, he received it on Christmas day and has insisted that it be read at bedtime every night since then. Literally.So, will your child love it? Probably so. Will you? Probably so, at first. For our part, my husband and I are growing a little weary of it. But in the land of childrens books, that's probably the best you can hope for, right?The illustrations are fun and entertaining and the language is clear and fun. I'd give this as a gift again, or would certainly recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Rendition of a classic","review":"I must admit it was the illustrations that lured me into purchasing this book and am now a real fan of Ms. McClintock. Somewhat reminiscent in style of the Victorian Illustrator and cartoonist for PUNCH, Sir John Tenniel of \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" fame. Now if only this duo would do Grimm's \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" all would be right with the world! It would be so nice to see more illustrators such as Ms. McClintock give a child's imagination something from which they may take pleasure. I think we may see this illustrator follow in the path of such illustrious names as Kate Greenaway, Anne Andersen, Gennady Spirin, etc.! Bravo and many thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldilocks","review":"I read the book Goldilocks And The Three Bearsby Jim Aylesworth and illustrated by BarbaraMcClintock. This book is about a little girl named Goldilocks who snuck in the three bearshouse eating their porridge, sitting in their chairs, and sleeping in their beds. The authorwrote this story because he wanted to tell youthat don't go on peoples property withoutpermission. The conflict is person verses personbecause Goldilocks went in the three bears house without permission. I think Goldilocksis sneaky and the author made the three bearsnice and understanding. The other version ofGoldilocks And The Three Bears is the sameas this one. Kids should read this book because they will learn a lesson to respect people's property.I liked this book because I like how the author wrote the story because it wasn't too easy or too hard. I didn't like the book because I didn't like the book because I didn't like the illustrations because they looked kind of weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice laptop, but screen specs are in error","review":"For those shopping by spec, for some reason the LCD specs are messed up in many sources, including Amazon currently.

I've figured out how to manage the computer so that it doesn't overheat and die on me--basically, I cannot run anything that takes up a lot of memory. No games, multimedia programs, interactive websites...This computer get hot fast and shuts down without warning. I thought it was only my machine at first, but I've found out that the problem is common and that compaq offers a heat sink repair kit that doesn't really work either...I recommend against buying one of these machines unless you have no other alternative or you get it for less than 100 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not morbid at all!","review":"I read the back of the book and thought this would be a blow by blow account of looking after a brain damaged child. I found that the story gripped me from the very first page and kept me reading since instead it is a study of the charactsers in the family surrounding the child. The inner turmoil of the father and the unexpected unfolding of events beyond the control of the parents in the family make this a gripping read. Anne Widdecombe's writing is superb and alternates detailed dialogue and inner thoughts with succinct summaries of conversations and the aftermath of various events. The final denoument is unexpected, poignant and beautifully written. We are left hoping that the family will find happiness in the end and the father's turmoil is over.I look forward to seeing a televised version of the Clematis Tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin, weakly pigmented -- not finger paint!","review":"Finger paint is supposed to be thick and gloppy -- that's what makes it so satisfying to smoosh around on the paper. It's also supposed to be richly pigmented and glossy, thereby providing a fun visual and tactile experience. This 'finger paint' is thin -- more the consistency of poster paint, and the color is weak. As soon as my children spread the paint around on the paper the color all but disappeared. We were left with a watery mess with the barest hint of green. What a disappointment! I have written to the company and am waiting a response. Meanwhile, I've ordered a different brand of finger paint. If you want your kids to have the joy of smooshing and swirling thick, glossy, colorful paint, avoid this product.update: I wrote two emails to the Alex company, one when I wrote this review and one about 1 month ago. To date, nobody has responded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been much better.","review":"I knew that it was primarily a book of still photos. However, what I did not know was that the selection of photos would not be that good. There are much better photos out there that have been published elsewhere.

Same for Chambers and Taylor exceptional musicians, but here the star is Red even if the trio seems almost like a single instrument. I hate to be brief but here there's nothing more to say for real.

My memory of it was as one of the best SF novels that I'd ever read, but it didn't hold up that well on re-reading. There are many enormous holes in the plot, and the plot is really just a way to deliver a few \\"shockers\\" about the main character (the giant planet). Still, the writing is quite above average for hard SF, and there are a lot of original hard SF ideas in here.

Through his exploration of nationalism and catholic history he develops a cogent theory of how the christian attitudes towards Jews were formed.

I love the book because it is a preternaturally accurate and insightful portrayal of Amherst College as it existed in the mid-1950s. I know because I was a student at Amherst in the class of '57. There are many characters who are instantly identifiable as real people at Amherst, such as James Merrill and the renowned (or infamous) professor Theodore Baird [\\"Oswald McBain\\"]. I don't know how enjoyable the book will be for readers without an Amherst connection. But for me, it's wonderful, because I disliked Amherst College as much as many of the novel's major characters do, and as Alison Lurie herself obviously did when she was there, married to an English instructor. I'm happy because, when my classmates and I are gone, posterity will remember Amherst as I knew it and as Ms. Lurie has depicted it. Ah, redemption!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ups and downs of an adulterous relationship","review":"This very leisurely account of Emmy Turner's adulterous affaire in a New England university community gives plenty of space to develop credible, interesting and sometimes quirky characters, believable conversations about all sorts of things (not all of them related to the plot), fine descriptions of, especially, winter landscapes (talk about love-making in a cold climate! As often as not in a car - until it gets warm enough to do it in the open air.) Class distinctions and academic hierarchies are nicely observed. The affaire, which Emmy desperately tries to keep secret, has its ups and downs, and Alison Lurie is very good at combining sympathy for painful emotions with wit. The ending is a bit complex, but it does seem right to me.Very nicely done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader in Seattle","review":"I began reading Ms. Lurie's collection with her most recent \\"The Last Resort\\", which I enjoyed. I then decided to read preceding books like \\"The Nowhere City\\" and then \\"Love and Friendship\\". Nowhere City wasn't bad, but had pretty much the same characters and circumstances as The Last Resort but just in a different setting. As for Love and Friendship, it has taken me quite awhile to get through the book. I must say that I am happy to see Ms. Lurie grow in her writing but for goodnes sake write about something else than a professor and a wife in a marriage gone bad and extra-marrital affairs. Every book is the same. I would recommend choosing one of her books, particularly the later editions, and not read any others because they aren't any different."},{"rating":"1","title":"You cannot learn Java in that short time","review":"not upto mark as java beans java servelets and JDBC should have been included atleast at awareness level.

Many times during this book I felt longing creep quietly into the back of my mind, raising the questions that we so often evade - what is the true purpose of our life, and are these brave adventurers the people who alone have fulfilled our calling as human beings? Reading this book is a responsibility, a responsibility to listen to this voice and hear it out, a responsibility to be prepared to have our lives changed by this quiet urging we all hear, but often refuse to listen to. Do not expect to read 'The Seven Storey Mountain' and walk away the same person. You won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Book","review":"This is not just another inspirational book. It tells of a journey from early childhood through final orders at Gesthemene that includes the reader every step of the way and points the way with great practicality and simplicity. To see the opening of his world to the Creator beyond and within has made a difference in my life and my reading. His continuing story, \\"The Sign of Jonas\\", also left me with wonder at the man's love and intelligence and great faith. My little Merton library keeps growning as other gems turn up; including \\"Encountering Merton\\" by another spiritual author, Henri Nouwen. It must be said; I found \\"Seven Storey Mountain\\" to be a threshold book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep and important autobiography","review":"Thomas Merton is a profound person, and his personal story reflects his wisdom and keen sense of what is important in life. The book itself is surprisingly easy to read, though at times it seems to contain more detail than I hoped for, particularly in the latter parts of the book. As a non-Catholic, I was not reading this book for specific religious doctrine, but rather as a study of the nature of intensely devoted religious people. I got my money and time's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"See how a non-religious man became a Trappist monk","review":"This book is a modern masterpiece-- often compared to St. Augustine's Confessions. I think the comparison is valid. Merton's struggles in life can help guide us today.The book is a bit boring at times, but you should still be able to get through it without too much trouble.I highly suggest anything by Thomas Merton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merton\\"s Mountain","review":"I first read this book in high school, and it is a must for anyone interested in the Roman Catholic spiritual experience. Merton was a convert to Catholicism and later became a Trappist monk. His autobiography was published following WWII. It became a huge best seller and made him internationally famous. By contemporary standards, the book is dated in its post war innocence and preachiness, but still a fantastic read. Why does a man give up everything: sex, money, friendships, education to live as a impoverished medevil monastic. In the 1960s, Merton became a staunch anti-war activist. He died suspiciously in Asia at an international conference on meditation. Some say it was a CIA murder, others a suicide; most likely though an acciental bathtub electrocution. Read his autobiography then his other books and diaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still reading.","review":"It was on my to do list. have not really read as much as i should to give an informed review.

Merton, a trappist monk expressed the spirituality of so many people that longed for a religion that could both function within the bounds of Christianity and bring it to life. Thus it is with this poet, monk, and student of the Zen Masters the world recieved a new voice on its oldest subject. In this book, Merton's spiritual autobiography, one comes in contact with a truly beautiful human being. This book has my nomination for the great twentieth century American novel. It is a book in which every word echoes the warmth and passion of its author.Thomas, You will be sadly missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising journey of Faith","review":"I lived in Kentucky for 10 years, and I heard of Thomas Merton. I was afraid to try to read any of his works as I thought that they would be so deep I wouldn't be able to relate. Thomas Merton has shared with us his journey into Cistercian life that was easy to read, and I found myself not wanting to put it down, and when I finished I found that I wanted to hear more from him. It reminded me of the life of St. Augustine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best introduction to Merton's immense body of work.","review":"This is a warmly personal autobiography written in a relaxed style and liberally sprinkled with Merton's wry humor, directed mostly at himself. It is a superb look at one human soul's odyssey from loneliness and self-absorption to a total surrender to God. If he occasionally goes overboard with his religious musings, he can be forgiven, as the excesses of youthful idealism usually are; anyway, it's worth noting that within just a few years of this book's publication (in 1948) his intellectual and spiritual development had advanced so much that, as far as he was concerned, the Thomas Merton of \\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" was \\"dead.\\" But the Thomas Merton revealed in these pages is very much alive and the story of his life's journey is compelling and unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the most well-known book by an American monk...","review":"Even for a non-Catholic agnostic kind of person, this book was a near life-changing event. Having read Merton's work on Eastern things (Chuang-tzu, etc.) I came to this book with an open mind. What I found in reading it was a story of a child of the early nineteen forties who turned toward God. He was actually a classmate at Columbia (or a near contemporary) of Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg..... and they ended up trying to find salvation in a similar, but different manner....It's a wholly worthwhile book for anyone to read though for some I could imagine the section after his conversion (which would strike many of his readers as the most profound section of the book) could end up being a bit tiresome...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for the path","review":"I picked it up because I wanted to know about the conversion experience firsthand. On what it felt like to be called to wear the habit, more specifically. And ti was interesting on many levels, as well as informative and enlightening for my own journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, with moments of brilliance","review":"This book is supposed to be the autobiography of one of Catholicism's great open minds. But Merton's mind is largely closed. Merton bashes nearly everyone in this book, Anglicans, people without faith, protestants of all colors. He does not have a questioning spirit about his own faith, but just parrots some well worn cliches about Roman Catholicism. It seems you must come to Merton loving Merton or you will see nothing here but one man's contempt for others and himself"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long and Difficult Read","review":"It has taken me six months to get half way through this book.

I am teaching it to freshman physics majors, and even those who've had significant high school physics (includng AP) have never really seen a physics course like this, and it seems to be keeping them excited. Unlike the standard freshman college texts, which simply reiterate the high school curriculum at a slightly higher level (and makes them do blocks on planes and pulleys ad nauseum), Matter and Interaction introduces classical mechanics alongside modern, alongside relativity. I have also found it a useful jumping-off point to discuss oscillators and circuits. Though the authors will need to do a bit of fine-tuning in future editions, I highly recommend this as an excellent freshman physics curriculum."},{"rating":"1","title":"very difficult to use","review":"i used this textbook in an intro physics course...while it more or less explains basic concepts sufficiently, it is grossly lacking in terms of applying concepts to even the homework problems at the end of each chapter. while i'm not asking to have my hand held through each and every problem, i think this textbook expects students to be able to solve unreasonably difficult problems given the depth in which it covers the material, and the associated lectures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aviod This Book At All Costs","review":"This book does a horrible and insufficient job of introducing the student to physics.

The pet hair attachment was clunky to use, very difficult to move across the surface of our couches in the first place, and then it got clogged with pet hair almost immediately and stopped working (the attachment stopped spinning, vacuum still works). I went in and unclogged it once only to have it stop working again a few minutes into cleaning. I don't know what I am going to use this for now as it's not a very convenient handheld vacuum with no rechargeable battery power option so it must be plugged in, which makes it difficult to use to spot clean around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I just bought this item at Walmart. My intent was to use it for quick daily pickups in between the weekly thorough vacuuming- pulling out my big machine is a drag.I chose it because there are no air vents on the sides as some other hand vacuums which cause dipersion of debris. I have 2 cats which shed their hair on my sofa and armchair. The Retriever was promising as it sounds very powerful, but it did not collect that much hair. You had to \\"insist\\" and still it would leave hair behind. A favorite spot of my cats is on the top of the back of the sofa which is 3 inch wide, it was next to impossible to collect the mat of hair there. An annoying feature was the \\"neck\\" of the pet brush which connects to the machine. It is very flexible and if you try to apply pressure, the brush just raises and just skims the sofa lightly. Very fast, 5-10 minutes into the job, the machine starts feeling very hot. I am returning the Retriever tomorrow. It is not saving me time at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I have dog at home and purchase that product just for dogs hair. The turbo brush is just OK. It is not working great. If you push it to hard it stops. So If you need that for hard hair cleaning I would not recommended that. Good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not great","review":"The machine doesn't hold up well with usage. I've had it for a few months and now it overheats after five minutes and turns itself off- even when the canister has been cleaned out. The attachments worked great the first two months and then one by one stopped working. The vacuum power is so weak with the attachments on that I can barely feel it with my hand.Without the attachments, the vacuum is still pretty powerful, but again it overheats after five minutes. I can't even clean small surfaces without waiting for the machine to cool off and turn itself back on.My cat's hair is pretty rough and tends to get itself entwined in fabrics making it really hard to clean up. The spinning carpet attachment did a pretty decent job getting the cat hair off my couch- until it stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad suction","review":"This vacuum overheats after five minutes and turns itself off.

So happy to find this from Amazon. Works so much better than the battery vacuums. Really sucks up the dirt. Easy. Long cord makes this perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't suck","review":"It doesn't do a good job sucking up the cat litter from the carpet or the cat hair. If I'm patient with it, and keep trying, the motor gets too hot and shuts down. Very very disappointing item.It's easy to change attachments/empty the receptacle and the filter works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"Now my wife says I shoulda bought a cordless!Can't win!I thought it was a great Valentine's day present!(kidding!)ciao!Tebaldi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Corded Hand Vac","review":"This would not be the first time I bought the wrong item. But, although I wanted a cordless vac, and was hesitant to open the box, I gave it a try. All I can say is the cord is not much of a problem. This vac has more then twice the power of any cordless. And the attachments are the icing on the cake. Kind of nice to make an error in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"very powerful vac","review":"this thing as a quick touch up vac and as a pet hair remover is second to none. can't beat the power. the bristles in the turbo brush are rubber and really pulls any embedded pet fur right out with no problem. i have really long hair that wraps around the turbo brush, but i've found that if i use the vac alone or with the hose attachment first, i can then finish up with the turbo brush to leave my bathroom completely hair free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deficient","review":"This vacuum comes with no attachments except the brush for pet hair, which is useless for getting into corners and crevices, and I can't seem to find any additional attachments I can get for it. If you just want to clean up dust and pet hair in open discreet areas, it works OK, but for anything more, look elsewhere. Mine's going back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shop Around","review":"We purchased this hand-held to pick up dog fur and also to get dust off of our dogs fur. The suction is definitely not up to par. I'd compare the suction to one of those inexpensive,unknown name brand vac's you buy at K-mart or some other retailer for 19.95 or less. For a small hand held it is extremely loud and does heat up quickly. This machine is overpriced and I expected much better from Black & Decker. I would definitely shop around for a higher quality hand-held and only buy this unit if it is a last resort. It failed miserably when used to suck up dog fur from a futon mattress, a leather recliner chair. By the way, this unit absolutely will not pick up dust from a computer/keyboard, nor should it be used as such (i.e. as a data vac)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roller brush driver jammed & useless in 5 minutes","review":"I have a balinese cat that sheds 2\\"-3\\" hairs -- not huge clumps, but a uniform \\"dusting\\" everywhere.The pet hair attachment here is ALMOST a really good design -- pops open easily for regular cleaning. Unfortunately, it's driven by a fan unit (i.e. by the cleaner's suction power) which is not user-serviceable. After ten square feet of slightly-furred close-nap area rug, its axle was gunked up and it didn't spin freely.This hobbled design is simply not up to the task for which it's sold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Powerful for such a small vacuum","review":"A note of caution, when I plugged it in it ran and scared me. The switch was on out of the box?When you turn it on, it twists due to the torque of the motor. With that being said, this sucks with the power of a regular full size machine. It's easy to clean and handy to pull out for a simple cleaning instead of going to the closet to pull out the regular vacuum. We bought this to clean up our kitty litter and bird seed. The feathers were sticking to the brush we were using due to static electricity."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],C={key:0},N={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",H,[(i(!0),a(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(i(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),a("span",N,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",C,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const x=d(M,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-a4e4baa4"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/24.md","filePath":"glossary/24.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/24.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
