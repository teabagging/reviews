And she didn't even write this, her \\"Spirit Guide\\" wrote it from the Other Side. I don't know-I truely don't believe she's fraudulent. She's helped so many. But I have caught her in a lie. On January 3, 2000, she appeared on Montel and when asked about celebrity couples who would stay together, she said Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman would remain married. A year later, they divorced and Sylvia was back on Montel and said \\"I knew all along\\".And how do you justify [the money] per question just to ask her spirit guide Francine, something?

I am not even going to go into the counsel of elders comprised of only male spirits. And tough luck for you introverts, obviously you have not evolved to the level of your extroverted counterparts. While I like to read intelligently written books about dimensions other than the one we live in, I found that even for a fantasy book this was lacking imagination. Perhaps Francine would do well to stick to her parties, it seems that they very much color her worldview. This book made me feel sad, angry and gullible for buying it.

Sylvia, how much does Montel Williams pay you to do his show and why not any follow ups on the \\"Readings\\" you give people?This book should be called 'Conversations With the Other Side with the Demon World by Francine' because this is where the information is coming from.It saddens me to see people giving her such props and glory...People can be so blind and gullable....Seek the Lord He is the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This was a rather interesting book about cultural history of Russia.

Starting from the historical scope -- Peter the First time -- author completely ignores all the rich, complex and significant history of Ancient Rus, its combination of Byzantine, Mongol, and Viking influences, and because of this omission, completely misinterprets all the consequent tensions in culture and art. All the examples are from Russia trying to catch up to Europe, and failing. Not much is said about the Silver Epoch.Author's Protestanism is very evident, as is his disdain for Russia's rejection of Martin Luther.From author's viewpoint, as Russia did not participate in either Renaissance nor Reformation, it therefore cannot be considered cultured. Excuse me, but that viewpoint belongs to the last century.Two decades after the end of Cold War, one would expect a more in-depth and unbiased review."},{"rating":"2","title":"The contrasting influences that shaped Russian culture","review":"A well written account of the manifold influences on Russian culture.

Figes cetainly examines that underside of what makes a Russian different. He does it with revealing research and obvious affection and respect for those deep characteristics so unique to Russia and it's people. Certainly a scholarly work, but still entertaining, convincing, and a joy to read.

Andresen, Author of \\"Walking on Ice, An American Businessman in Russia\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"!","review":"This book is completely out of date. The problem with most books on Russian culture is their narrow-mindedness; they all follow the same old path established at the beginning of the 20th century by White Russians who escaped the revolution and created the history of Russia and Russian culture for Westerners. Such \\"histories\\" are one-sided, they see the subject from one pro-Russian prospective. Ukraine and Ukrainian culture/art do not exist in such books. But Ukrainian culture always was the avant-garde of MOST Russian cultural developments. It is time for scholars to realize it.

The drill itself is one of the best I have ever owned but the batteries are JUNK. Now this may not seem like much of a problem, but the first one is dead in 18 months of occasional use. The replacement cost is $79.95. I expect the second battery to die shortly, another $79.95. If so, that's $159.90 every 18 months for a tool that currently costs $222.00. Although I can't prove it, I suspect that Milwaukee ships batteries with the tool that don't quite measure up so they can screw us over for the replacement batteries they know we will have to buy.

Highlights include Break U Off, I love You Nancy, the silly tracks I Drop Money, MANE, and Bamboozled, and the downright funky Kenworths with Wings. I was a bit disappointed by the track with Motion Man, Serve 'Em a Sentance. I was expecting some humor and banter, given how wonderful Masters of Illusion was. But the track has a head-pounding beat and the most serious, humorless message on the album. At least they worked against my expectations. I can't wait to see what they crank-out next.

The setting (environment: dark and stormy) at the beginning was very clever to cover the true identity of Fumiko. The procedure/logic used by the cops to catch Daigo was described thoroughly.

My friend wants to borrow it to read to her 3 year old so that he can understand a bit more what his friend is going through.

I have experienced large parts of the journey Alice and her husband undertake in their quest to better understand her ancestor's experiences in creating the first telegraph line across Australia.I found the book to be very Alice Thomson-centric. She seems to glorify all aspects of her journey while continually placing Charles Todd higher and higher upon his pedestal. I was hoping she would rekindle some of my own memories of the Australia outback. However, Ms. Thomson invariably spends paragraph after paragraph describing her husband's illness or her own tiny adventures driving the Land Cruiser or walking around Coober Pedy. Her descriptions of the local towns and environs is terse, quick, and dull. I do not recommend this book to anyone except Alice Thomson and her immediate family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regrettable","review":"An interesting effort by a distant, if not vague relation to an historically insignificant figure, albeit one from whom myths form with their customary accuracy.

I was in love with this heater. It fit the requirements for safety at my workplace (only radiant heat allowed, nothing that can be seen glowing and no fan). It heated up quickly and warmed a goodly-sized area around it, as well. It was just the right size for rolling it up close to combat a sudden chill. It kept the chill from my huge office window from constantly gliding down my back. I would have given it five stars last year; however, I just now tried to use it, because my office was 61 F this morning. It came on, beeped, the display went dark, and I now have an over-sized $50 paperweight. No, it didn't trip a circuit breaker, the thing is just dead. What a disappointment.

The room temperature stayed consistent and it didn't seem to dry the air out so noticeably as some of these types of heaters tend to do. I had no issues with noise and it operated just fine out of the box. I also used it in a larger living area that measures 4X larger in square footage and it worked just fine for that space as well. I did end up saving on my electric bills as a result of space heating. Additionally, the slim profile has also made it easy to store the unit away when not in use.

It is rated at 1500watt or whatever but all it does is send the heat up to the ceiling which is of no use to me. Yes, you may say that it will eventually warm up the room but its been 6 hours and I'm still cold. I decided to put it under my desk and it is now warming me up. The size of it would probably fool you, leading you to believe it will warm anything bigger than the underside of a desk but it barely does at the highest setting. I dont' know if it is safe to place it where I have it but I figure my chair probably gets warmer than my desk will with this darned thing. I suggest you either get a spot heater (I'm buying this tomorrow-Soleus Air MS-09 Oscillating Radiant Heater) or a forced air kind of heater you can keep next to you.

Great at showing easier ways to accomplish common task. Best all around book ever on Maya with a catch. These are tips only, without detailed explanations. But that's okay, because once you can look online or in reference manuals for more details on the tools. This book is must for any Maya artist. One other negative is there is no CD. It was frustrating when you wanted to see for yourself how the steps were all put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Great screw and at an exceptional value.

I did not plug the holes, so 1\\" were the perfect length (if you are plugging, get the 3/4\\").I was using the Micro Drill Guide for this project.On the first hole, if the material was not clamped, the screw tended to jack the materials apart. A quick back out and reset of the screw always fixed the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hole in the World","review":"Eric Schimler7th grade the Walker SchoolThe book that I did for my reading journal is a Hole in the World by Sid Hite. This book is a recommended book for people of all ages. This book is about a kid, Paul Shackleford, who gets in trouble and is punished by having to work on a farm somewhere in Virginia. Paul's gets anew view of the world outside of his life in Richmond. Lots of conflicts such as the work that Paul had to do and the benefits such as meeting Rebecca and Einstein, a dog on the farm, and learning about the farms past and future. A major part in the book was when Paul and Rebecca went to Hennely Gray's cottage and read the note left by Hennely. This book teaches kids that you need to take responsibility for your actions. Read the book to find out whom Hennely Gray is, why Paul was sent to the farm, and if Paul survives his summer at the Hargrove's farm."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ENTHRALLING","review":"Ya know, this book is fascinating. Not in the usual sense. It kept me reading; I couldnt oput it down. The characters and meaning are deep. A must read for anyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hole In The World Review","review":"This was a rather short book but not very exciting. It was a long time before you actually figured out the reason for Paul being sent to the farm, which made it very hard to grab my attention and keep me interested. The book did have a good message to the story of the power of your words and integrity, however it did seem to go into some things that did not appear to deal with the story in many ways. If you read it with a group that does not think alike, it can become a controversial book with some of the topics. If you have the opportunity, chose another book to read. I only gave it a one star because you were forced to rate it, personally out of five stars I would give it a zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Performance","review":"This performance stands up to the very famous \\"Bach: Violin Concertos in A minor, E major, G minor; Double Concerto in D minor\\" by Itzhak Perlman and Daniel Barenboim with the English Chamber Orchestra.

Only problem was when I overtightened one of the 3 screws that hold it it and the head broke off leaving the threads filling the mounting hole.

His basic thesis is sound and would have been fine for a magazine article, but he goes way off the subject and rambles incessantly. His ego has reached immense proprtions; he can't stop talking about how brilliant he is and how stupid everyone else is. There are too many ad hominem attacks and irrelevant analogies that have nothing to do with the book's main subject ( I still don't understand what the Florida Marlins, Kevin Garnett, and Ivan Lendl have to do with the book's critique of the Court)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elitist and Foolish Book...","review":"The only merit of this otherwise elitist and foolish book is that one can learn how *trial* lawyers can distort issues beyond all recognition (\\"above the law\\") and how they employ such tactics as grossly inappropriate analogies (Hitler for the Suprem Court), (weak) strawman counterarguments, non sequiturs (e.g. Soldier's and Sailor's Civil Relief Act of 1940 and the President's responsibilities), and so on, and how they can represent themselves as something they are not (neutral, non-partisan). One can also see that it is possible to expand a one-paragraph argument into a book --- although this is admittedly a lousy example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly veiled partisan deceit","review":"Our country is in the current unfortunate state of social decay due to men like Vincent Bugliosi who blur and blunt the truth, then fail to see the causal behaviour creating the outcomes in this case of a man named Bill Clinton. No one, including the Supreme Court, suffers a liar well, and in this case the Supreme Court has the capability to bring to bear at least a small amount of justice by allowing the prosecution of the liar, though he is the President. Bugliosi's treatise is poorly-veiled partisan deceit. Many American people have turned their faces from the Presidency and Bill Clinton because of the previous behaviour of Mr. Clinton and his ongoing exploits in office. Clinton's actions are a dishonor and disgrace to our country and our people. He currently stands as one of the most disingenuous, female-exploiting politicians of the modern era. As a past prosecutor, how can Bugliosi remotely support the type activities in which Mr. Clinton engages? Jim Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy, Vincent, easy!!!!!","review":"Since when did prosecuting Charles Manson make Vincent Bugliosi a constitutional law expert?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I thought OUTRAGE was so good and objective, I was really looking forward to this book. But Bugliosi has no objectivity at all! For one thing, he points out the true statistic that the vast majority of journalists vote for Democrats. But then he says, \\"For some reason, even though they vote liberally, they write from a conservative-Republican viewpoint. The idea of a liberal media is a myth.\\" The idea that the media is conservative in it's view is INSANE! And so is Bugliossi...or so I thought a few times when I read his delusional free-association ranting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Calendar of Celebrations","review":"This is probably a lovely book, just beware that the title that was shipped to me was not the same as advertised on Amazon, or anywhere else that I have seen. The book that arrived was \\"All Year Round; Christian Calendar of Celebrations\\". So if, like me, you have no intentions of celebrating Christian holidays, then this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"was expecting something different","review":"I was expecting a Waldorf inspired book with information about seasonal celebrations and pagan holidays, but this book actually is only interested in obscure Christian holidays. The text in general is very evangelical in nature and assumes that its reader is fairly evangelical as well. Some of the crafts are cute but equally good craft ideas can be found in other, less Christianity focused, books. Again, I repeat, this is not really a Waldorf book. Buyer be warned. It has nothing to do with paganism or green living or non-Christianity based homeschooling or natural family living, as the tags say that it does, unless for you natural family living and evangelical Christianity are the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I Thought at First","review":"I've owned this book for about a year now and I had to change my review. At first I was going to return the book but I decided to keep it when I noticed how often I refer to it for seasonal ideas. I don't often make projects directly from the book, but I usually get some good starter ideas. If I had to choose one Waldorf-y style book, however, I would choose Earthways by Carol Petrash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello!","review":"Thank you for everything, the CD arrived without problems.

Greetings from Spain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid's book","review":"This book was a waste of time, it just talked about basic dog behavior, with simple language. No detail whatsoever on how to train or specific tricks to teach your dog. The book's title should be \\"Rottweiler Children Stories.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Faulty Premise","review":"I'm sure my point of view won't be popular in this forum but the author needs to make the point that what would be MOST beneficial to the children is to forego remarriage until all the kids are grown. Coming from a blended family myself, I must conclude that there is no valid reason to put the kids through \\"wisdom through the pain\\". I had a miserable childhood in a blended family but setting that aside, there is NOTHING Biblical about revolving spouses through the household."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retired from the Navy.","review":"Good shirt. Lettering could be bigger. It shows I'm retired from the Navy and has the CPO emplem on the front."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I only attempted to read this book because my book club picked it. I couldn't get through it! For starters I'm not a big fan of historical novels...which this is. It deals with author Henry James and his lives and loves (mostly for men) and how his books came into being. It is well-written and moves but I was completely bored. I gave up at page 100 because I realize I hated the book and didn't give a damn about the man or his works. If you love James' books you might enjoy this. If not beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Look at the Life Of Henry James.","review":"Although the book didn't go into detail in some aspects of Mr. James' life, it did shine a light to let us see what type of person the famous author was and how he used his personality to write such hit books. The fact that he takes his friends for granted, at times, until they are no longer there, made me feel a little on the edge. But his incorporating some of their characteristics into his books made me appreciate such a man. I had read Mr. James' and Mr. Moore's, \\"The Portrait Of A Lady\\", last year and feel it, along with his own life, will always be sought-after material. Interesting material that was put in an attentive form by Mr. Toibin! I am including this book, along with \\"The Portrait Of A Lady\\" in my \\"So You'd Like To ... Dip Into Some Great Books- Go Ahead And Dive!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry James imagined","review":"This book is not nearly as good as anything written by Henry James himself. It is a novel about Henry James covering this mature years in London and Rye. This NOVEL--what does the author mean!?-- main characters are based on real people and named for the people they are based on, but because it is called a novel I suppose one cannot complain if you don't like it or some portrayal of the characters.Henry James crawls achingly through the book mostly as a depressive personality. I don't believe it. Near the end there a scene where Henry's brother, William, tells him he has been in contact with their dead mother. Toibin has Henry respond, \\"...Is my mother at rest?\\" Now would you respond to your brother and refer to your mother as if your brother had not the same mother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books in many years","review":"Having read \\"The Blackwater Lightship,\\" I was particularly moved by Toibin's evolution from a very good writer to a masterful writer. His craft here is exquisite. The writing is lyrical, deeply thoughtful and deeply felt. The narration carries the reader along gently, sometimes with great sadness, though the storytelling is never sentimental. Toibin touches on homosexual themes but at the same time keeps the tension somewhat distant, as I imagine might have been correct for its time. I couldn't wait to get to this book every evening and was sorry to see it end. I've not felt this way about a novel in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Disappointing","review":"I've read all of HJ's fiction, his Notebooks, Prefaces, Letters, travel writing and a shelf of biographies and I'm finding this book lifeless and \\"studied.\\" It does not animate HJ, but makes him a waxwork--I found the (fairly) recent biography of HJ in relation to Fenimore and Minnie far livelier and better written. It's being hyped to the stars, but does not live up to the hype, and if you read the long NYTBR review carefully, the reviewer there isn't wild about it either, noting its mechanical quality and its anachronistic view of HJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I somewhat had to force myself to finish the book. In retrospective it was an interesting subject to read about Henry James' life, but I found the writing not on part and the story a bit forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do we need this book?","review":"There is little interesting in this book that I could see. I didnt finish it. It was a big tease about whether or not Henry James is going to have sex with a man. Since he didnt get an e_____n when he slept in a trundel bed naked with Oliver Wendel Holmes, he might not be gay. But he must appear gay because a society lady thinks she is doing him a favor when she assigns a toothsome gay butler to him when he spends time at her houses. Like who cares if he is gay or not? That's the main topic of the first quarter of the book. We get to meet his pathetic sister before she dies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful Master","review":"BRILLIANT. Truly brilliant. For anyone who has ever yearned to write, or for anyone who does write, or for anyone who creates art in any medium, the joy and the struggles are rendered with such acute precision--and then there is the gilded life of Henry James, the second son of one of the most illustrious families in New England, connected to everyone who was anyone, back in the days when one's birth meant everything about one's future. Colm Toibin follows Henry James's psychological state with the same intelligence and warmth that Henry James gave to his characters Isabel Archer and Lambert Strether and so many others--while enabling the reader to understand the derivation of those fictional characters and their roles in James's life. In the words of the Master himself, who wrote, \\"Summer afternoon... the two most beautiful words in the English language,\\" Toibin's loving ode to James is as beautiful as that summer afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most highly recommended","review":"I most hightly recommend this book to anyone who, like this reader, adores the work of Henry James but has found the many (often very good, even excellent) biographies of him curiously lacking in nuance. Toibin supplies this through the use of his creative imagination--we have a picture of James that finally seems really true, precisely becuase it has been re-imagined by a very sensitive and intelligent artist. Indeed, it would be hard to overstate the intelligence, as well as the artistry, of this work. Reading it only now, after actually owning it for some time, I have found it to be something of a revelation. I thank the author deeply for this magnificent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"These are the Best at Least for my Husband,he bought some 5 yrs agoand just now need to be replaced With the Same.

Colors looked more yellow than green. After using that cartridge for a while (it lasted about 1/2 as long as cannon cartridges), I replaced it with the second color cartridge.

In particular the first hand quotes from actual high school students showed him that there are a range of things that he could encounter in the next four years, and it would be perfectly normal.

The flash head itself, with the proper module works fine on my Minolta. I read the two Amazon reviews and went with J's comment that the first reviewer may have gotten a bad unit, that he had no problems, so I went ahead and ordered another one from Amazon. I've just spent an hour, reviewing manuals and camera settings and still end up with the same problem as the first one. Both Canons; Rebel EOS xt and EOS 20D are TTL functional and the product write up states that the module will work on both. I also use speedlights on both of these cameras, as well as my Nikon D3200 with no problems at all, so I know the hot shoe's and TTL's are working. I contacted the eBay seller and asked for suggestions and was told \\"don't know, I'm a Nikon man\\", end of story there. So, good luck getting it to work if you buy one, but I'm totally done with the project."},{"rating":"1","title":"QDC-CN Module is NOT eTTL-2 compatible","review":"The Quantaray QDC-CN flash module is NOT compatible with Canon eTTL-2 cameras. It appears to be nothing more than a relabeled QDA-CN module, with some of the wording replaced in the instruction sheet to indicate that it is eTTL-2 compatible. I have now tested it with the original Digital Rebel, the Rebel XT, and the S5-IS - all of which are eTTL-2 cameras. In every case, in every mode, the flash fires only at full strength, which is exactly what Canon describes will happen with incompatible (non-Canon) flashes and is exactly the behavior exhibited by the original QDA-CN module. If Quantaray did, in fact, update the module circuitry, they certainly could not have tested it. This unit is essentially useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"I ordered this unit through Amazon, but it came for an outfit called Go Camping. It was obviously a display model or a return. It was covered with dust and had several scratches. I would have returned it, but I needed a heater immediately for a project I have underway. I have also learned that the unit is available from Home Depot for $99.00. The box contains a bold print statement to call the manufacturer if there are any problems with the unit. However, the number provided takes you to a recorded message directing you to the manufacturer's website. The website is a simple half-screen of links to manuals and parts.

That was in early 1998, and I was delighted to be able to purchase the recently republished story by itself.Like all of Fritz Leiber's work the writing is supremely articulate and the story telling carefully, and craftily constructed, holding the reader from start to finish.The main character twenty-nine and party girl Greta Forzane, takes us through events sited in an R&R centre for battling time travellers who find themselves becalmed on The Big Time along with a counting down Atomic bomb. A book which will need careful reading to get the whole picture, but well worth it; and for that great Gertrude Steinism: 'you can't time travel through the time you time travel in when you time travel.'For the price I would have liked to to get a dust cover.

Perhaps the problem was my expectation.

However, in practice the book was tedious, the characters were not well developed and some of the curiosities Leiber aroused were never fully addressed.As odd as it sounds, the feeling of the book is very much like the setting in Cabaret - a group of people waiting to see how a war is going work out. Even down to the German phrases that are muttered. Was Leiber a fan of musicals?The concept probably makes this worth the read but its a hard book to get through. The 130 pages seem double their length upon reflection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sympathy for the characters","review":"Although the plot of the book drew me to it, I found myself losing interest to the point where the ending had no impact on me. If it were not so short, I would never have finished it.Instead, I was irritated throughout by the small-minded characters who seemed far more concerned with their personal situations and romantic relationships than with the fate of the universe for which they are held responsible. One wonders how they gained this responsibility since they act and speak like high schoolers.When one cannot establish sympathy for the characters, one is not emotionally invested in the plot. Thus, the twist at the end is overshadowed by the feeling of relief at the mere termination of the book. I think I may have persisted in reading it only out of disbelief at the degree to which this acclaimed author bored me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good First Impression","review":"A tad dated but it is still pretty slick.

It was every bit as entertaining and delightful as I remember his other books (mostly the Prydain Chronicles) to be. It tells the humorous tale of the town delinquent, Lukas Kasha, and how he is magically transported to the kingdom of Abadan where the people instantly hail him as king. All is not well in the kingdom; however, and the story shows how Lukas is transformed (almost against his will) into a mature and responsible man. Lloyd still spins a wonderful story, and \\"The First Two Lives of Lukas-Kasha\\" is guaranteed to entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"This book was very slow going from start to finish.

(Not very often, unfortunately, in season one.) And Tom Poston did his comedic best, as well.This set is worth owning if you're a fan of Bob Newhart, Tom Poston, or even Larry, Darryl and Darryl.

I have an angel fish and two tetras, and they love the tank. Setup is simple and there is no cleaning or extras needed. Fish food and dechloinizer is all that is needed and probably some fish.

Our results--dead fish, all 4 of them. So, if death is considered educational I guess it gets points for that.We followed the instructions that come with it, but the reality is--there is no filter, it's just a bubble wall that does not act as a filter. So, the water is not really cleaned. And, the air pump is much too strong for this very small 1 1/2 gallon aquarium, causing a huge current that forces the tiny fish to struggle against it. Despite consulting with various aquarium experts at real fish stores, and purchasing a variety of water additives that are supposed to instantly \\"age\\" water and remove ammonia, we came to the conclusion that this tank is just not functional. I'm furious that my little boy had to experience the death of his pet fish, one by one, and furious that countless other children will probably experience the same thing.

Those four little goldfish that lasted two days in this 'tank' had a potential of over fourty years. A reviewer on this product said you could fit three goldfish in here. Completely unacceptable! Three goldfish would need fifteen gallons at least! Do your self and that poor common goldfish a favour and don't buy this product.

Grimsley omits all these people from his book, they are not to be found in the index to his book.In short, Dr. Grimsley has selected the information which suits his thesis and has omitted the information which contradicts his theory.

Hopefully Ataxia will release a full length LP or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong movie on right disc","review":"I received Bob the Builder On Site, which I ordered but the movie on the disc was Thomas On Site. The pic and the description on both the case and the dvd were that of Bob. It appears that someone burned this dvd in his garage. I am very upset with this vendor and will not purchase anything else from them. The only reason I'm not returning the dvd is because fortunately my son likes Thomas and wants to keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Bob on site","review":"Not very good due to the change from english to american accent, (no offence intended to the americans) but after my sons have had bob the builder in english over a year they just dont enjoy the american version.

Personally, I find that to be a HUGE plus. Our two year old son has recently discovered Bob the Builder but both my husband and I find most of the videos absolutely painful to sit through. The stories can be dumb and the characters are, quite honestly, a bit dorky. In the On-Site videos there are just short clips of Bob with one or two of the machines and then there is a ton of good footage of trucks and \\"worker men\\" with just Bob voicing over what is happening. My son is kept interested throughout and I don't have to cringe the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the typical Bob","review":"My 3 1/2 year old likes this show, however he's a little put off by the \\"real life\\" segments that are in each episode - they don't belong on a Bob the Builder show according to him! At first he didn't want to watch those parts (which is funny because he loves real life construction DVDs we have), but now he does ask for this show and watches it. I think we'll stick with the traditional ones though for his enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"The Cosby Show is a classic Nick @ nite comedy.

The story, though--it's obvious, insipid, and *boring*. I cannot fathom why anyone would have given this five stars. The ultra violence feels like it was put in to appeal to teenage boys who want something \\"dark.\\" Batmans fall feels completely fake, so his redemption is not a thrill.This is a terrible, terrible story barely made worthwhile by good art, and then re-ruined by horrible coloring. Seriously, Frank Miller isn't *that* great, but this horrible and sloppy copy makes him look like the genius people think he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Wray Wants You To Save Your Hard Earned Money","review":"Is there any doubt that Bill Wray is the hot shot colorist for the working man? I doubt it. Not after his work on this book. See, Jim Starlin is a lousy writer, always has been, but Berni Wrightson is a really good artist. This book originally came out during the crazy Batmania of '89, and do you know what sweet old Bill Wray did? He did the ugliest coloring job in fancy comics history. Tons of ugly greens, and reds and browns and purples. He knew this book was a stinker, but he didn't want anyone to get suckered into buying it because of Wrightson's extremely alreet art, so he screwed it up the best he could. Way to take one for the team Bill Wray! You truly are an unsung hero of corporate comics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to my intelligence","review":"This video is awful. It is a shame that people out there consider anything on The Discovery Channel to be informative. The whole video is based on the premise that the general public thinks the Freemasons are a \\"secret society\\" with \\"pagan\\" and \\"satanic\\" rituals, cryptic codes, and \\"influence\\" dangerous to the establishment. I find it hard to believe that any American could be this ignorant. Worst of all, the voiceover/narrator guy speaks with a sppoky, creepy, suspenseful vibe... it's just insulting to anybody's intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my very favorite CD's","review":"The selection of tunes on this CD is great.

They are studio recordings, so you get crystal clear vocals and accompaniment (something I find frequently absent in the live recordings). Talk about nostalgia! When I played the CD, I realized I knew the words to the songs without even realizing the songs were performed by the Kingston Trio. A pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fell out of my seat!","review":"Well, this last year I decided to swallow my pride and join the Compact Disc revolution, and this is the first Compact Disc (C.D.) I purchased. I didn't know much about the band but was impressed by the \\"trio\\" part of their name-I've always been annoyed by bands where you don't know how many people are in them (see, for instance, the Beatles). I was pleasantly surprised to find this is a great C.D. They obviously put a lot of work into it-some songs even have more than one instrument is playing at a time!I was so enrapt with this C.D. that I invited my friends over to share a can of Pringles and played this C.D. while we sat around (one of my friends, David, jokingly suggested that I turn up the music so he wouldn't have to hear my voice!). Honestly, folks, the first time I popped this C.D. into my Sony C.D. Player I was so excited I fell out of my chair and landed smack dab on my cat (I make sure to lay down on the couch when I listen to it-sorry Whiskers!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Star Wars Collectible","review":"This is one of the best installments in the Star Wars 12\\" series since the 12\\" Taun Taun and Han Solo. It's large, makes an impressive display, and is always a conversation piece when company comes over.The only problem I see with this is that it's off balance, much like the Han/Taun Taun from a few years ago. When Luke is placed on the Taun Taun it will fall forward. The way I solved this with the one I have on display was simple: Drill a small hole under the base of the tail. Drop enough BBs inside until the Taun Taun no longer falls forward. This may take a while, but if you're a Star Wars freak you won't mind. Squirt silicone inside the hole until the BBs no longer rattle, then viola! Problem solved. You can now stand the Taun Taun in any position without it falling over.I highly recommend this beautiful, fun action figure set. If you're a serious Star Wars collector it won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking dead vol. 2","review":"My husband liked it. He is a fan of the show.

I picked one day shipping, paid like 12 bucks just for the shipping, and got the book two weeks later. About the book, it is great.

Don't want to skip over to volume three, but waiting for such a long time for an issue like this to be resolved is agonizing!

Like a Nebraskan. Ted Kooser puts you there. Like stepping out of the stark house in Edward Hopper's, \\"High Noon\\" with great acres waiting outside and wind whistling. Or eyeing a line of thunderstorms sweeping across fields of wheat like in John Rogers Cox's \\"Grey and Gold\\". His apt metaphors and great imagery paint clear pictures. He chooses words for his prose with poetic care. He frames these anecdotes like an artist, easily shifting from the simple to the sublime, from way back when to this morning on a walk. He focuses on the importance of small things. His stories exude a great warmth of spirit and bear repeated reading. I wish he was an uncle of mine. I'd follow his directions and visit, like a neighbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"Order for the book was fulfilled in a satisfactory timely manner. The content of the book was interesting, at times very, very touching and sometimes though not often, a bit of a stretch (fanciful). But I liked it. It is a book about the author's personal day to day observations and impressions gained from living in that particular part of Nebraska and it included occasional glimpses of his family and boyhood in Iowa. The author is someone I would like to be neighbors with----he's obviously a great guy with a warmth and sense of humor that places him well above most of the slobs who inhabit this earth (including myself). Is this review long enough? Can I stop now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding investment book!!!","review":"The Bogleheads was an outstanding book. It was a real joy to read. Too many investment books are too basic or go so into the nitty gritty that they only become a cure for insomonia. So many great topics were touched on in the Bogleheads Guide to Investing from asset allocation, costs, and taxes. So few investment books ever tough on taxes. I wish I would of had this book when I was first starting out investing back in the mid eighties. I would recommend this book along with Christine Benz's books as a must read for any investor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bogleheads' A++","review":"As a recent college graduate with little to no expenses I found myself with a small nest egg and absolutely zero direction. My money was rotting away in a lowest interest savings account.After reading many financial/investing books I feel like I have found the one that gives direction, realistic goals, and options. This book is honest and easy to understand. It teaches the power of combining indexing with compounding.I recommend this to all that are new to investing. If you are an experienced investor you might find the book is a bit basic but keep in mind how much information the writers packed into this book.Brian Campbell"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter guide for new investors, or old investors who are confused","review":"If you're trying to save for retirement, or are new to investing in general, but don't know where to start, then this is a great book. The authors aren't trying to sell any scheme or program; they're just offering a common sense approach backed up by history and math. There's really nothing in the book that can't be found on the Bogleheads website (which I also highly recommend), but I found it still a great read as a concise introduction to the world of investing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for every American to read","review":"This book is a must read for every American looking to learn how to make wise decisions with how they are handling and placing retirement and other investments.

Good for reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated book","review":"Well, it's a good book, sound advice, but it's gone. Here's why: the book has a model, it's based on the stock market performing well in the long term. Let me quote chapter 2: \\"Start early and invest regularly.\\" Sure, all the Wall Street guys would love that. Give us all your money so we can play it all like blackjack. Look at Dow Jones, 10 years ago it was 10.6k, now it's up by 22%, worse than the inflation. So: \\"Start early and invest regularly\\" does not work anymore. All the calculations in the book are done assuming 8% average growth of your investment. Wrong! Does not happen anymore, forget investing in Wall Street. Get the money and spend them with care, that's it. New rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Bogle, Investor Advocate","review":"The Bogleheads' Guide To Investing is a easy reading book on investing with no-load mutual funds. Whether saving for retirement,college or handling money in general, this book would be a good place to start learning the fundamentals on how to keep more money in your pocket and out of your advisor's or broker's. While some may need some financial help through a pro, if one has the desire to read and learn about investments and how they work, one can save themselves thousands of dollars in fees and other costs associated with investing. Learn about index funds,diversification,asset allocation and rebalancing. The authors show you how to tune out the noise of the media and stay the course!

It's all you really need to know about investing. It's basic, but you don't need to go deeper than this if you don't want to. I've always felt like I didn't know what to do when it came to investing, and never trusted 'financial advisors'. Now I can confidently do it all myself (and probably outperform those that pay an advisor a percentage to manage their money)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"This is a good book. It summarizes much information which is found elsewhere. I think of it more as a reference guide than a book to be read beginning to end.My main criticism is that it covers to much ground, and touches on subjects from investing to wills to 529 plans to insurance. As such, it lacks focus. It is almost too abmbitious in its scope. Still, if you follow the advice in the chapters on investing, you should do very well.If you are interested in investing, go straight to the source and read Jack Bogle's Little Book of Common Sense Investing. It is better written. This book could be a follow up to that book.Still, this book is worth reading and is better than 90% of investing books out there. I have given copies of the book to others and they have always responded favorably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bogleheads: A Book That Makes Sense Out of Wall Street","review":"There is nothing like a Bear Market to get you to question a lot of things about the wonderful world of investing. Having said that, this book which focuses on the ideas of John Bogle is just the ticket to set you straight on a number of critically important investment concerns. Asset allocation, the importance of having the lowest costs, how the mutual fund businss really works, it's all here and it all makes perfect sense. I wish now that I had heard more of the wisdom that this man has been passing along for so many years while inventing index funds at Vanguard Investments. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to invest with greater confidence and success for the long term. It may well change the way you think about the world of Wall Street and investing. It did for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent advice","review":"This book gives excellent advice primarily about mutual fund investing and retiring.

The writing style is dry.I think there are better books out there for investors."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book for starters","review":"I think it is a good book for starters. The authors have plenty of experiences in personal investment. It is a good book for starters.

I have Leslie Sansone's 1-mile challenge and it is really a great 1-mile workout that gets results. I was looking for diversity, but this video is not what the wrapper promises it will be.

It is not adjustable with the traditional tools available on the Kindle (eg font sizing change, orientation, line spacing, etc). Neither can you highlight or connect notes to the text.

If you are Catholic, you will find this the best book to make you feel good about \\"the Church\\". If you aren't, it basically makes you mad because it doesn't ONCE discuss in any real sense why there was a reformation in the first place. It's VERY frustrating for the protestant. The author spends pages on why the Catholics have never done wrong (? ), but seems to do a very nice job paraphrasing Luther's evil ways. If the author had stuck to the facts, that'd be fine.

Great book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, there are better books out there...","review":"This book didn't even make it in front of our daughter. The message is just so wrong, the pictures of swollen lips etc were completely unnecessary, and I presume the answers to the questions is no? There are better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming story -- Important message","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for a friend with an allergic grandchild. He told me it was a special delight to read the book together with his grandson. The story is charming, and effectively communicates an important message about acceptance and coping... in a way even a very young child can grasp.

I was unlucky enough to have this book as an undergrad a number of years ago, and along with a general dislike of it that I've always carried, I specifically remember that the exercises were impenetrable. Now that I am getting a PhD in the history of the English language, I can safely say that I am achieving this goal despite this book. It is adequate in some ways but nowhere near as good as some of the other options. The only real bonus I can see is that the price is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"I didn't like the book at all. The book did not meet my expectations of a book about etymology.

I find it hard to believe there are human beings alive that watched this show and did't have to spend an hour in the shower to remove the stink. The music sucked; the singing overwrought; It is so awful. I find myself so embarrased for the performers I want to hide in a basement for a month. It has a sick fascination and is amazing to watch, like a bad performer on American Idol. You constantly ask yourself, what were they thinking? That people could write a review praising this show makes me hate America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before it's time","review":"This was a great show, definitely before it's time. It featured gritty performances that were interlaced with fun. The show wanted the audience to not take it so seriously--it's TV, for gawd's sake!Trio showed this, but somehow managed to miss 3 episodes, which makes it difficult to tape. Hopefully, it will be released on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Feat","review":"Cop Rock charted the dramas and emotions of its characters using music and dance. Like the use of the chorus in a Greek drama, Cop Rock's format was initially off-putting; but once the strangeness wore off, the series was able to effectively juggle the nuances of being human in an inhumane world. An incredible feat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Innovative, interesting, but was it any good?","review":"I remember the show. I've had the pilot episode to Cop Rock since it first aired, and I've even watched it once or twice since then, and I don't think the show is as good as some might remember. It tried to be too many things at once, and while it was interesting to watch, it was difficult to actually LIKE, week-in and week-out. I think another reviewer said it best, it's Fame meets HillStreet Blues meets The Life - but it's not half as good as any of those. 2-stars for innovation and it's a wonder it ever got made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will giving a review of a non-existent item help it exist?","review":"I hope so!

I check back every year for it and am disappointed that it still has not been released. So much junk from television from yesteryear is available, but not this quality show? I remember that people had trouble with the concept of signing cops. It still frustrates me that they were so locked into their stereotyes that they could not recognize this as a musical where the songs carried the stories to levels that dialouge could not do. I'll always remember the drug addict signing about giving up her baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"And now for something completely different, an anti-reality show","review":"This show came out when I was married to a police officer. He bemoaned the fact that this, as well as other cop shows - were not realistic. Well, that's why they called it entertainment. I loved this show. I never liked musicals, but for some reason this show worked for me. It is easy to see how it launched one of the most successful programs on TV - Law and Order - and the spin offs. Many of the actors here in cop rock later went on to star in Law and Order. I wish they would re-air this on hub tv, Me TV or CWN - I can't wait until the DVD comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"great rack at a good price","review":"love it! it showed up quick and only took 15 minutes to install. directions are spot on. all hardware came with it. good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Music Mimics Life.","review":"In this book it shows how art mimics life. Dominic and his girlfriend Tossa are at a folk music weekend at a well-known English college devoted to music. They find themselves in the middle of a family drama, and when one of the performers goes missing, Dominic knows that he has to get his father, George Felse to help. Sure enough the missing person turns into two missing persons, and a body does turn up. The plot is woven around folk songs and music, and this is a particularly effective way to string a plot together. Although I figured out the story before I finished the book, it kept my interest. Ms. Peters' prose is as beautiful as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but not for me","review":"This is a touching book, it gives a good picture about a young woman who was a great student and a wonderful person, who falls into a dark world of drug abuse and depression. She gets AIDS and soon dies. The mother, who wrote the book tells the story in a very moving way. There were a few parts that I couldn't beleve but overall I thought it was very realistic. I didn't love the book though, Its just not the kind of book I read, I was forced to read it for a class. At frist I thought it would be terrable but soon I started feeling sarrow for the people in the story.

Unfortunately it feel short of our expectations. The cross bars where you hang the shoes were not strong enough to hold up my hiking boots and my husband sneakers. Also, the hardware used to hold the pole sections together was cheap and not able to secure the poles together. After putting it together and placing all our shoes on the rack it literally began bowing and bending along as the days passed. I will day that we did not act roughly with the shoe rack as the only time it was touched was placin shoes on and taking shoes off of the rack. All in all I would not reccomend this product at all.Note: the lack of confidence in how secure the poles were held together with the accompanying hardware was a bit disheartening as our 7 month old baby is learning how to stand and takes any opportunity to hold on to things to balance with.

It is definitely one that I will be keeping and using in my future practice and ministry. Dr. Rosenau writes this very easy to read, but yet is detailed to cover all aspects of Human Sexuality from a Christian perspective. He discusses the functionality of sex, the spirituality of sex, aging and sex, and problems with sex. Every Christian should read this to be educated about this area."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overwhelmingly positive view of Christian sexuality.","review":"This book is probably the single best evangelical marriage manual on the market, complete with explicit but tastfully done drawings and unflinching examinations of various sexual issues.

This book helped to embrace my sexuality and get rid of my baggage of Christian frigidness.But be warned: In this book you will be encouraged to touch yourself, to explore and play, and to - yes - actually *celebrate* sex without a guilty conscience. The book even includes hand-drawn pictures of various positions, which, though nothing extraordinary for sex guides in general, might almost be revolutionary for the conservative Christian.The book also helped my wife and me to openly *talk* about the details of sex, about our own sexual feelings or lack thereof, etc.For the non-religious reader, this book is possibly still too unprogressive and has too many references to an Evangelical worldview, but it's a great tool for liberating Christians from sexual legalism and undue guilt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie.","review":"My wife had to have this film as it was her favorite Peter pan film from when she was younger.

A good romp.","review":"A nice retelling of the Disney animation, this one in live action.I think I avoided it in 2003 because I was turned off my Moulon Rouge, and I thought this would be similar, but it wasn't.It seems to have some elements of the Zefrenelli (?) movie of Romeo and Juliet from the '70's, some young love, maybe more similar to Blue Lagoon in the 80's.Fun.

Also, to me, it is an adventurous film that I liked since I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A relentless assault on the attention span","review":"Peter Pan is a timeless story for children of all ages, but this movie drags out each scene beyond the limits of our ability to sit quietly without fidgeting. The (actual) children that watched it with me were filled with a sense of wonder (as in \\"I wonder when this scene is going to end\\"). The continued state of \\"peril\\" for the child actors in this story makes the whole scenario work better as a cartoon (cannonballs? sharp swords? drowning? arrows? plummeting from great heights?). It is surprising that some other reviewers think that the most dangerous thing this film will teach kids is how to \\"mouth\\" kiss. Also, the same actor plays both Capt. Hook and Wendy's father. Is there a single kids' film that doesn't feature this tired Oedipal angle?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Pan","review":"Our family rented this movie, and we loved it.

I loved this movie. It\`s the best Peter Pan movie yet (and I\`m not saying that just because I have a small crush on Jeremy Sumpter, the boy who plays Peter in the film).

So, I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, surprising.","review":"One of the better Peter Pan films, quick turn around as well. I would recommend this to anyone. Buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good !!","review":"Wow ! I was really impressed with this movie. I think the acting was fantastic. I really loved the lost boys, because they were so well played. I thought Tinkerbell was wonderful! She had great facial expressions ! Neverland was really beautiful and happy until Peter and Wendy got mad at each other. The scenes were a little awkward and it didn't make sense how 10 kids could be fighting like, 30 pirates. I mean , it just looks a little strange. I adore Wendy ! She is soooooo pretty. Peter (Jeremy Sumter) and Wendy seem to work together really well. It's nice seeing them attracted to each other so much. Over all, this movie is amazing and the sellers on Amazon have always send things to me quickly making this DVD a no-brainer to buy. I would suggest this movie. P.S. There may be one part you would want to skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremy sumpter is soooooooooooooooo Hot","review":"This is his best movie yet . someday I am going to meet him and marry him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The previews looked amazing. Jeremy Sumpter (Peter Pan) looked handsome and mischieveous, the perfect Peter. Rachel Hurd-Wood (Wendy) looked strikingly beautiful yet innocent. But that's just how it LOOKED.The movie followed the basic J.M. Barrie tale, about a boy who never grows up, flys, and lives in Neverland. Sumpter seemed good for the role, but when it came to acting...he just didn't cut it. Hurd-Wood was wonderful, charming and innocent as a girl with her first crush. But it was hard to figure out what made her so infatuated with Peter.Jason Issacs starred as both Mr. Darling, Wendy's father; and Captain Hook. He was the best thing in \\"Peter Pan.\\" As Hook, he was witty and intelligent. He was a good actor, showing different facial expressions and proving the authority of Captain Hook. But he wasn't enough to save the movie.You're better off seeing the old Disney animated classic than this. Go ahead and rent that instead of seeing this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent far from exceptional","review":"My wife was dying to see this movie so I recently purchased it for her. Unfortunetly I had to sit threw an hour and a half of boring story telling. For children, they might enjoy this movie. The littler audience 2-6 probably wouldnt enjoy this film. There wasnt enough interesting moments in the movie. Most kids would probably loose interest in the first five minutes and continue to be bored throughout the first 20 minutes. This film does have some enjoyable comedy. But for peter pan, I would much rather watch hook a couple dozen times. But if you really enjoy the peter pan story you may very well love this move as my wife did. But if you loved hook you will not enjoy this movie because it is not as funny nor as interesting. All I can reccomend is rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Still Haven't Gotten It Right","review":"I read this story as a child and saw the Disney version and unfortunately, this version was more action than the rather cerebral/Freudian book.First of all the special effects were incredibly cheesey and from ILM yet! Peter Pan moves way too fast for an entity weighing more than the bee he flies like. Didn't buy it. The trip to Neverland through outer space, didn't buy that either. Neverland was more like a place in a dream, a fourth dimention you might say.The same actor playing both Wendy's father and Captain Hook (who gets killed by Peter) and then there's nothing standing between the two. That's rather spooky and you can read into it what you want. I don't want to go there.This was better than the Spielberg disaster of 1991, but not much. Disney's cartoon version seemed to pass it on as what the author had in mind. Great music score though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What Was Expected","review":"I took my 2 and 1/2 year old son to see this and was completely disappointed. We didn't even stay to see the end because it was very BLAH! It wasn't Peter Pan as I remember it. It was the child's version of a love story. Jason Isaacs was great, but the rest of the movie was terrible. The special effects were all right, but nothing spectacular. They looked fake. I would recommend renting this. It just isn't worth the $$$ for a matinee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!!!!","review":"Gee, I cried like a baby!At age 19, it was SO good to remember old Peter Pan. I just watched it, and I remember now that as a child I used to play with my mind, imagining that Peter didn't had to leave Wendy and that they lived \\"hapilly ever after\\" like in the stories that Wendy told Peter (\\"They end all in a kiss..\\").Really, the BEST movie of Peter Pan EVER! Buy it! I'm doing it. The Fairy dance escene es absolutly marvelous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will have to read the book","review":"Not having read the book, I don't know how close to the actual story this was but I saw some scenes in here I hadn't remembered from other movies. Of course the cartoons always change the story and the musicals have to make a place for the songs to fit and have to cut something out. I enjoyed the two main characters and their interaction, and enjoyed the actor playing the father and the Captain. This could be a little intense for the young children, but the rest of the family will enjoy it. All in all, I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you missed it in the theaters...","review":"Don't miss it on DVD! This is one super movie, and can be enjoyed by the whole family. The young lead actors (Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood) were terrific, and displayed a chemistry that is unusual for such youthful actors. And Jason Issacs was both fun to watch and just intimidating enough as Hook to rise above the previous incarnations of the character. I urge all parents who were concerned with the critical reviews of the movie when it was released in theaters to give it a chance on the small screen. It is a true classic-in-waiting. So don't wait---buy it and let the little child in you have some fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for kids!","review":"I hope my grandson gets tired of this by summer!!!

Not only that but for a 12 year old girl playing Wendy (Rachel Hrud-Wood)did a great job.The best actor there was none other than Peter Pan, (Jeremy Sumpter)at age 14 he has played in 4 attractions.He has played in Frailty which recieved 4 stars,Just a Dream which recieved 3 1/2 stars,and Local Boys which recieved 4 1/2 stars. Jeremy Sumpter is a natural for the over thrilling epic adventure of Peter Pan now showing in theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever.","review":"I find it hard to believe that quite afew people gave this film less than three stars, and generally thought that the acting skills of the actor/esses were of low quality. This movie is extremely interesting, and highly imaginative. The visuals are great, the score is great, and the acting is also great. I think that Jeremy did a great job as peter, he is a great actor, better than Daniel Radcliffe, the boy who plays harry potter, who in my opinion is the worst child actor. Rachel Hurt Wood is a great Wendy, and she also is a great actor. This movie IS for families, and not for ;gothics, punks, rock people, rap people, old men, teenage males, and is generally for people who like fantasy, visually stunning movies, and for those who appreciate great movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second on the right, and straight on til' morning.","review":"The previous reviewer, \\"a sixteen year old who already feels the effects of age\\" is looking forward to Peter Pan. So is this 46 year old who has never grown up and hopes that never changes.Whatever your age, whatever your status, there is that part of you that never wants to grow up - and that is Peter Pan. Similarly, there is that part that DOES want to grow up, but still, still, doesn't want to have to obey the rules that don't belong, doesn't want to have the responsibilities, and isn't sure that the world is what it really should be - and that's Wendy. And finally, there's the part of you that wants to have no responsibilities, but all the fun, but still, if need be - to try to help - and that's Tinkerbell.Berrie put together the archetypes that are within us all.

It's my fav movie of all time, I am totally obsessed with this movie. I think my favorite thing about this movie is the romance between Peter Pan and Wendy (I wish they ended up together) and the fact that they can go to Neverland and don't want to grow up. This movie really made me not want to grow up. I'm 15, and I sooo don't want to grow up because it just gets worse (like school) from this age. Gotta watch this movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful remake of classic tale","review":"This film has amazing aesthetic quality. The screen play is somewhat different from the original novel and stage play, but includes classic lines, the same basic story, and certainly the same heartwarming theme of a boy who won't grow up and a girl who realizes she must. The young actors who play Peter and Wendy put on an impressive performance. There are long trailers in the beginning, but it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adaptation","review":"This is a beautiful live action movie of Peter Pan. I was simply thrilled and amazed as to how the story came to life. I honestly can not think of any complaints. Every one worked well with each other.The special effects are great. There isn't too much but just enough and even the back ground music is riveting. Highly recommend for a Peter Pan lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I've seen in a REALLY long time!","review":"Peter Pan is a really awesome movie! I'm right at that age where I think about guys a lot, so one big factor is that Jeremy Sumpter is really cute! But, I also really love the movie overall. It looks so real that sometimes I go off into huge dreams about visiting Neverland! The movie shows everything just as vivid and bright as I imagined!!! Great work, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"peter pan","review":"Peter Pan was a great and interesting movie.I liked how they flew by putting strings up.

It was so spectacular...! My friends and I are even starting a site for it. The movie explained everything so well, and was actually better than the book. The chemistry between Hook and Wendy was freaky-cool, and the only fault the movie had was Tink's jerky moves. It was super great and is totally underrated for the classic that it truly is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, adventurous, and GREAT acting!","review":"I realllly enjoyed this movie! I thought at first it was some kind of movie that is too cheesy and babyish to me...but its sooo not like that at all! This movie shows the real story of Peter Pan besides the old cartoon version. I know really much like this version than the cartoon one. This movie makes scense for the things that happen. Every scene I was enthralled with the great acting and stunning special effects. Peter Pan, Wendy, and Captain Hook played very well and they draw you into this magical place that makes you wish after watching the film never to grow up! In the DVD I really loved the special features too. This is a great movie with nothing horrible to say to it! It's perfect!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not your bedtime story peter pan","review":"Peter pan has always been one f my favorite fairy tales. Maybe because it s full of fantasy & wonder & beauty. Yet not a mamsy pansy story. It was meant as a grand adventure. It was meant for us to get just a bitt scared in places. This is the best film adaptation of that intention!Not for the little kiddies mom. There is betrayel, death, insecurities and cold blooded murder. Insecurities? Yes like the rest of us peter pan has insecurities even issue though he'd never admit it. It ends happily for most. Like most mens minds I can't spak for him too complicated.I would highly recomend this film but not to the very young, simply for content. It's a beautiful; poetic thinking version. very visual & vivid with excelent dialoge. definatly a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, complex, true to Barrie's story. Hurrah!","review":"This is a beautiful, fantastic film! It is a feast for the eyes, and remains true to the complex themes of the true Peter Pan. There has never been a better, stronger, more beautiful Wendy than Rachel Hurd-Wood. Jason Isaacs as Capt. Hook is wicked, charming, attractive, and NASTY! He delivers some great lines along the way...\\"Wendy.....Darling.\\" The special effects are fantastic, the sets gorgeous, and Peter is really a great, fun, dirty boy instead of a girly-boy like in previous interpretations. Props to the cast, crew, and director -- this is the best Peter Pan ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect story and perfect screen","review":"I went to see this movie for 4 times. It's such a great fantasy movie I have ever seen before. Casting and custuming are excellent and screen-playing is so smooth. And the kids,Jeremy, his friends and the girl are so cute. Don't ever miss this great phenomenon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Peter Pan film!","review":"I adore this film. I never saw it in theaters, but the second I saw it, I fell in love. It's a really interesting take on Peter Pan that will appeal to both adults and children. Jason Isaacs is brilliant as Hook and Jeremy Sumpter is perfect as the self-centered and adventurous Peter Pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"peter, this century","review":"I thought this was a great and more recent (w/ all of our new technology) version of the original Peter Pan. I'm a big fan of the musical, the book, and everything about the boy who refused to grow up. I'm also a big fan of \\"Hook\\". I thought the special effects were great but in not giving the novel justice, I still felt it was missing aspects (this is why I didn't give it 5 stars).-Tinkerbell didn't give her famous \\"silly a**\\" talk to Wendy-Peter Pan didn't return to Jane at the end(only in the special features part of the DVD, an unfinished scene)-Tikerbell came back to life from what the children were saying, not clappingThe acting was really good, and it still kept w/ Peter Pan tradition in having the same actor play Mr. Darling and Hook. Great Movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Most Favorite Movie","review":"In my opinion, the Peter Pan movie is the most fantastic fantasy movie I've ever seen, beating The Lord Of the Ring and Harry Potter in my personal record as I've seen it more than 130 times, while LOR or HP less than 100 times.This Peter Pan version is the version I'd wished to see, the romance between Peter and Wendy. Not to mention how cute both Jeremy and Rachel were, what a lovely couple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Pan","review":"i saw this film a little while ago after being forced to by my friends. i didn't want to see it because i really liked the book and films are never as good as the books they come from. i also didnt like the idea of an american boy being peter pan. BUT, i did watch it and i really liked it. it was a lot like the book, and im even quite happy that they didnt use the original book ending. the one they used for the film was a lot more definite. also, the boy who plays peter pan is quite cute.stacey, 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boy Who Never Grew Up","review":"This is a wonderful movie adaptation of the favorite novel Peter Pan. It really is a shame, that the movie didn't do well in box office, because it really is a good family movie.The graphics are very good and aren't way over the top like a lot of movies are. The back ground music is very beautiful and fits the story well.Jeremy Sumpter as a very beautiful and rich looking Peter Pan really fits and Rachel Hurd-Wood as Wending Darling really paces the mood at the begging of the story.The cast really complement each other and the full package is great to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Pan=Heaven","review":"This is THE best film EVER! I walked out of the ciemia and was like \\"woah!\\". Did I just watch that? Was I really there? The CG effects were perfect. They were real enough to believe but still had that \\"fantasy\\" look. eg. pink clouds.When I found out that Rachel Hurd-Wood (Who plays Wendy) had never done acting before. I said \\"yeh whatever!\\" She obvisously has a natural talent for acting.Jeremy Sumptor even tnhough he was 14 during filming, he had this cheeky \\"impish\\" smile and personallity which I think was pefect for the roll of Peter Pan.Jason Issacs. What can I say he was born to be bad. And he was born for the part of Captain Hook (and Mr Darling)indefinatley.In coinclusion,I just want to say that while this movie may not be for everyone, Im sure YOU could connect to the storeyline in some way. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Pan","review":"Beautiful, magical and absolutely fantastical retelling of J.M. Barrie's classic tale, PETER PAN - the special story of a boy who could never grow old, who took three children into his world where pirates, mermaids and indians dwelled, and where dreams really could come true. This film is amazingly well-acted and surprisingly, only one child in this film annoyed me; however I do believe that he was set out to do so, and if so, he does succeed. The film is also very handsome looking, with its fairy tale like qualities and so on. Of course, since it is quite faithful to the original text, this PETER PAN is a dark journey into an imaginative world, rather than an always happy and comically thrilling movie. The mermaids in this film are portrayed as traditional, hissing, creepy villains. Overall, this film succeeds as being excellent, although it does have its share of minor flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good family movie!","review":"This movie is appropriate for all family members.

I was surprised they had not already watched this version, since they are (unfortunately) movie-buffs at such young ages. I'm so glad I recorded this on my dvr before their long summer visit! They were mesmerized all over again and again by the characters, the plot, the danger, the tenderness of family ties, etc. I knew I had to buy this DVD for them to enjoy at home! While they stayed for a few weeks over the summer, they watched this movie at least 5 times if not more!!! I think I enjoyed watching them excited about watching a well-made movie as much as they enjoyed watching it. I highly recommend this version of Peter Pan to boys and girls alike (for any age)!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS MOVIE","review":"My daughter and I just loved this when we saw it on cable. It was on our wish list for a long time and finally got it for her birthday. Mommy is just as excited about it as she is! Very well done version of the Peter Pan story. Jason Isaacs is terrific in dual role of the Father and Captain Hook.Beautiful visuals. Very nice all round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie for anyone","review":"I have just recently bought this movie. It was fantastic even though the releasal year was 2003, I have wanted to see it but never got the chance. And I absouletly adore it! My mom thought this was a childish movie and actually told me to grow up! But after forcing her to watch it I caught her laughing in so many scenes and smiling too! And I just had to rub it in her face saying that I knew it was a good movie. She became angry of course, lol.This movie is a wonderful movie for any age. My three old sister does not watch anything but cartoons but had actually sat there quietly and watch the whole movie. She couldn't help but giggle through the whole movie.It has any emotion a human can feel; love, sadness, jealousy (that you can't work in the movie ;) happiness, energy. But of course it's lacking one emotion..hatred. You have to love the movie of course!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This classic tale about a boy who never grows up whose name is Peter. Also the Story is about a girl named Wendy and her brothers, John and Michael, who Peter Pan one day takes on an adventure to Neverland where he lives with the Lost Boys. My personal opinion of the movie was that it is fantastic! I was glued to the movie screen the whole time. By the end of the movie, it had seemed that the movie had gone by so much faster than the actual 1hr 53min movie. The special affects were outstanding! The flying looked very realistic and it made it look like the characters were actually flying. I also liked how I didn't recognize the actors. The only actor I saw that I recognized was Jason Isaacs, who played the Father/ Captain Hook, who suited the role perfectly. To sum this all up, Peter Pan: The Movie is deserving of the five star rating. I urge that you go to this movie and bring your whole family too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking.","review":"I've watched this film a 100th time now and I still get teary-eyed over it!

I could see what it would be like to go to Neverland and have adventures. I loved this movie and have watched it countless times.

There has been several retellings over the years, but this one just didn't get off the ground with me. Seeing a half naked boy flying around with a ferry and trying to kill people seemed more creepy than cool. It also takes far too long to get to the meat of the film, and then seems to end shortly thereafter. That being said, the audience couldn't disagree more. \\"Excellent,\\" \\"amazing,\\" and \\"great,\\" were the words by the patrons as they left the screening. So once again, don't take my word for it. However, I believe that they may all agree that if you are going to see a pirate movie this winter, rent PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL was one of the few films to come out of 2003 that over-delivered!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie - lousy DVD","review":"The movie is pretty good but if one shells out the $$ for this DVD, one is forced by the manufacturer to watch previews up front and that warrants a negative rating.I totally resent being forced to view any preview on any DVD I buy - and the DVD player I own will NOT skip ahead with this DVD as it does with the other DVD's we own.Take my advice - buy the video tape version and fast forward past all the crappy previews."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID I JUST PAY 20 BUCKS FOR THIS JUNK!!","review":"I can't believe they force you to watch The Cat & The Hat trailer bfore the movie starts horribly irritating. The movie was not enjoyable at all I felt like I was watching HOOK all over again. Hook was an excellent movie because,of Robin Williams, Julia Roberts. I really came close to turning Peter Pan off. Besides the awesome talent by Jason Isaacs the acting was horrible. You could even tell when the blue screen was up & rolling. I did not care for the awful special effects either. Don't Purchase this movie!!! If you have to see it RENT IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Peter Pan ever!","review":"First, you should not buy this DVD for the fact that you will be forced to watch trailers for Cat in the Hat, and Two Brothers. This is a very aggressive sales technique, and I believe it to be unacceptable.Most of the lines from this movie were taken directly from the book. Unfortunately, this was not done well, and caused a chunkiness to the movie. The acting was sub par. The special effects were colorful, yet poorly done. The bluescreen effects were obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"they ruined my Peter's image..","review":"Peter Pan in this movie..is too..too normal boy.Too much feeling, and just pretend to hide it.In the original tale, his feeling to Wendy..is not this way..I think.Actually, I think Peter's heart is quite cold instead.(although he is a kind of good boy)Too much feeling of \\"romantic\\" movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book and Movie don't sync up","review":"I read the book about two weeks before I saw the movie. Let me tell you, If it wasn't for the same basic plot and some of the characters being the same I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be the same. Added characters, added scenes, and changed scenes. What was the screen writer thinking? Maybe if I had never read the book it would have been a good movie. The only good thing about the movie was some of the children's reactions in the theatre. It was a lot darker than previous pan movies. One child exclaimed \\"They can't do that\\" as peter was slammed onto the rock by hook. Save your money and make it a rental unless you havn't read the book or you're sure it won't bother you if everything is kinda off."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Peter Pan like you've only imagined before!","review":"What a perfect movie! This is the beloved children's story that I think has never truly been done justice until now. The movie is perfectly cast, perfectly acted, and the soundtrack is the most magical music you've ever heard. Every scene will draw you more into this lovely story. With a slight twist on the friendship between Peter and Wendy, and amazing special effects, this story comes to life in a way that only the magic of film-making can accomplish. This is not just a children's movie! Families and couples everywhere can appreciate the magic spell cast by \\"Peter Pan.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Pan","review":"Excellent quality and price.

I would return the sample via Priority Mail and log in to check the results at the website (save the TEST # to refer to!).

Don't go through this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not get results - waste of money","review":"This may be a good product, but we followed the instructions exactly and the lab claimed that they didn't receive the kit within the time allotted.

Very convenient. For NJ resident, there is $10 additional state fee. I also used express service and received report 5 days after I sent out the kit through USPS priority mail.

I ran the kit from from Friday afternoon - Sunday afternoon (48 hr). Sent to lab via USPS Next Day for $18 on Monday morning. Lab received the kit at noon Tuesday and I got an email with results by 5pm Tuesday (same day!). I did pay the $10 rush fee. For $42 all in this is really a great way to go, our inspector quoted $150 to run a test but since the house has a mitigation system we did this for peace of mind. Results were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad instructions","review":"The instructions state to use two first class stamps. The envelope said to use five. I should have used five, I followed the instructions and it got returned to me. Unfortunately with MLK day and the weekend now I'm over 10 days so by the time it would get there it would be invalid.The other problem is that the card you print your information on is unnecessarily small. I don't see why they can't make this larger (perhaps a full piece of paper) and give me more space to enter my information.The kit is good and the idea is of decent quality. But after this mess I'll probably just buy an actual detector. If I did this again I'd make sure the test started on a Saturday morning and ended on Monday morning and I'd take it to the post office counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got results-don't buy","review":"Never got results from the company after sending in the test kit.

When I received the kit- I found that in order to do a real estate transaction you must do 2 tests. I wasn't aware of this until I opened the packaging. WHich upset me that I had to go back and purchase another one. Also I didnt realize that it was going to take me 21 days to get my test results in.

When it comes to MP3 software, I have little faith, the iRiver H10 that I own occassionally freezes while the computer interface is problematic. This Sandisk product bypasses a computer interface, which is good, but the thing died with no response.

That's a fact. As of right now though mine isn't working but I think the problem is being caused by Windows Vista's MTP driver. The Express works on all other computer systems. So, if you own Windows Vista you should think twice before purchasing this.As an mp3 player I think it does well. It's inexpensive, looks reasonably attractive, and is pretty easy to use. The buttons are a little too small, battery life is good but not exactly as good as advertised and the firmware isn't that great. I would suggest this player over any other low capacity mp3 player though. Just not with Windows Vista."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't power on anymore!","review":"I've owned this player for about 2-3 weeks and have been generally very happy with it... Until today that is... Like some other have reported my player will no longer power on. In my case it is not due to overcharging, I was using the player and it was almost fully charged. Just in case I just tried to charge it, but it won't even begin to charge.The problem happened when I chose a song to play, instead of the song starting to play normally it suddenly started playing the music funny (like super fast-forward) then it powered off and won't turn back on.I didn't buy a protection plan so I guess I am going to have to contact Sandisk for support.

The problem with any Ipod, is no FM, and the TVs at the gym broadcast audio in FM, so you can listen while you watch and workout. I have a Zune, but it's just too big. I picked this up for about $10 as a refurb. It sounds great, and works perfectly. The record feature is cool as well. I got the lady on the free weights to give me her phone #, and didn't have a pen handy, so I just recorded it. Battery life is great. it seems to last for ever. You can just drag and drop songs to it using window, no special software, no DRM. It holds about 10 CDs worth with built in memory, and has micro SD expansion. Mine now holds 9 gigs, and I've only spent about $20. The ear phones are not wonderful, but I had some Sonys, so I don't use them.I strongly recommend this player. Why spend hundreds on an Ipod when you can get his for under $20"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just died after only 3 months...","review":"...what more can I say, other than it wasn't that great while it was working.

It would say something like the song was called \\"Justin Timeberlake\\" by Purple Haze, from the album \\"Billie Piper\\" It makes browsing through music very irritating.

I made the mistake of buying a different mp3 player with a built-in rechargable...has the battery life of...well a dead battery. How much equipment do you own from tools to toothbrushes that has been been rendered useless by the death of a built in rechargable battery system?

Because every time it starts, it will need to update the database for long time if you have microSD installed. I have installed the latest firmware but there is no fix.

What we have here are twelve perfect pop songs. It surpases anything Kasher has ever written. Black Out and Cursive's Domestica are brilliant masterpieces, but Album of the Year does one up on them both. The album starts out with the story of Tim meeting his new love interest, and ends with it all falling apart. Anyone who has ever heard The Good Life or Cursive know of these stories. These stories are why people keep coming back to The Good Life. Track 6, You're Not You, is the best Good Life song i've ever heard, let alone one of the best songs I've heard in recent memory. Inmates shows us Jiha Lee on vocals, and she mixes very well with Tim. Again this album does very much live up to its title of this year and many more to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horridly poppish, boringly childish,","review":"I listened to this album because of the high rank it got on AMG and it's supposed emotionally-sweeping lyrics.As much as I hate to use such harsh words, this is little more than your average MTV package, lyrics that may have been written with sincerety, but fit all-too-well to very familiar patterns.

However, when I put in four fresh AA batteries and plugged it into my ipaq h3850 and turned on the battery unit and the PDA, the PDA screen flickered briefly, then died. After that, the PDA would no longer turn on, even when plugged into the AC adapter. The ipaq h3850 requires 5 volts of power. The Gomadic unit supplies 6 volts (four AA batteries is 4 x 1.5 volts = 6 volts). Supposedly, the Gomadic unit regulates voltage, but if it doesn't, that would explain why my ipaq died. The construction of the battery pack is also somewhat flimsy -- cheap plastic. Overall, I am very disappointed in this product and would NOT recommend it to anyone. I want my money back (and more than that, I want a working ipaq, but this is rather unlikely)."},{"rating":"1","title":"???????","review":"Typical US representation of ... ...well anything.

To support such independent musicians, I bought her CD. And, much more than I'd expected, I really came to play it often ...though always at night, usually before bed, and usually when I'm alone.

We set up the play tent in the middle of the room and it was a magnet for all the kids. They really enjoyed playing in it. Back at home, he spends time everyday in it playing with his puzzles, trains, or hot wheels.

He already has has a pop up teepee and a tent at his house. Because it has no floor in it, it flips over easily if he hits his head on the lower section. He is only 16 months old, so the lower section is pretty low. It is very difficult to take down and takes up a lot of space. I never did get it back in it's storage sack.

Actually when we folded it up to store I just stuck a downy sheet in between one of the folds and that helped right away!It is actually roomy enough to have an adult sitting inside on one end and a child on the other end.

I can wash my old Playhut things easily. They air dry and can be used for years. Try getting this junk wet and a finger could easy go right through it. The same warning goes for buying Playhut in the stores. Make sure you open it and SEE what it is made out of before you buy it. Playhut should be ashamed of what they are doing to their reputation.

She soon discovers that editors around the world have ignored or buried the greatest coverup of her lifetime: the nuclear power industry has a far-worse safety and bestpractices record than we can possibly imagine. This book represents Cagle's personal quest and, as such, is told in large measure through dialogues with her mentor and friend Max Rogers, nuclear/environmental experts and the victims of the tragedies themselves.

I find myself softening the words up a bit as my son frequently looks worried while we read this particular book.I want my son to know God and see Him as a loving, caring God, not an angry, violent God. I know as an adult that God is a loving, sometimes angry God, but for teaching a 4 year old...

All the men of Israel have run away from him. They are afraid to fight him because he is so big but David is not afraid. David knows that God will help him.

This movie is similar to Magnolia - with its vignette style format and sad, quiet backdrop of Los Angeles - except its much better, avoid Magnolia at all costs - you will Rue the lost hours of your life! - Things you can tell by just looking at her is a far superior movie and will linger with you a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"There's no laughter or smiles in this movie, just a snapshot at the saddest parts of the characters lives.

Boring, shallow, self-absorbed people making dull, obvious choices to leave empty lives. Get a group of people together and see if there is any plot \\"twist\\" you can't predict. Pretentious, obvious and insipid.But did I mention the actors are great?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, Inventive, Beautiful & Touching","review":"I love this movie, it's everything i said from my title! Making this into a vignette film was very interesting and inventive. All the Women in this film (Cameron Diaz, Glenn Close, Holly Hunter, Callista Flockhart, Kathy Baker, Amy Brenneman & Valeria Golino) give outstanding performances! All the stories are very sweet, gentle and heartbreaking.This film was supposed to be released in Theatres, instead it was released on Video & DVD. If this movie was given a chance to be in theatres, surely the this film would be nominated for an Academy.This Movie surely has a palce in my top 10 this year, and every other!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this as a gift to someone you hate","review":"I decided to get this movie because it was on sale at a local store and I saw that it had 4 stars here at [amazon.com] I thought it would be a good movie to watch with my girlfriend...whoops!The movie had no meaning for me. I thought maybe female viewers would relate to the movie better, but even my girlfriend wished she hadn't wasted her time watching this movie. We were really depressed after we finished it. The stories in the movie could've been interesting but were too slow. On the plus side, the cast was great.The video quality wasn't good for a DVD but the audio was decent. There were a couple of times I turned my head because I thought the sound was real.There are no extras on this DVD except for the theatrical trailer.Not a recommended purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just put your head in an oven","review":"I thought this movie was TERRIBLE. Oh, the cast is fantastic but the story lines suck. They lead no-where, just like the pathetic and joyless lives of these women. These women's lives haven't \\"turned a corner\\", as one reviewer suggested, they just went to sleep after a terrible day(s). Not a single thread gets resolved, questions are raised, but never answered. And PLEASE, the \\"wise bag lady\\" cliche! Have the writers ever been close to a real homeless person? I seriously doubt it. This was one of the worst and most pointless movies I've ever seen.

It would seem that, given he died before the age of 30, his entire known work or paintings could have been reproduced in one book. Nevertheless, this book does represent a more complete collection that I have seen in any other Schiele books to date. I have been hanging out to get a good book of his work, and finally purchased when I saw this one in a bookshop. In other publications, the colour balance of some works has been a little different (for example I have seen more vibrant/colourful versions of the family squatting)."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous","review":"The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because im rating the book.. if I were rating the artist it would be a perfect 5 stars! I think Schiele was an artistical genious! It is really very sad that he died so young when it was seemed that he was about to reach the worldwide status he deserved so much.. i feel that art has missed out on a lot of things from his death..

Thanks to the Saint theme song I decided to buy an Orbital CD and through pure serendipity chose Diversions. It was one of the best decisions I've made. Diversions, I think is Orbital's best work. Each track takes you through a little mini-journey, orchestrating it perfectly. It takes you up, takes you down. All smoothly, all with a perfect blending of electronic sounds. I don't make any claims about knowing all about the electronic scene (living in the Midwest makes that difficult), but I've been listening to all sorts of trance, techno, and electronica and Orbital is definitely one of the best, and Diversions is their best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"For people who want to know why not just how","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The included CD has a great collection of images that really make the lessons work.But this guy is a horrible writer. That's not his fault. The floggings should begin with the editors. (Which begs the question: Were there editors? Some are listed, but what did they do?)I don't mind dense text, when it knows where it's going. But being verbose on the excuse of being conversational just doesn't make it. Also, there are no conventions used in the text to help you navigate. Remember -- the reader will be splitting his/her attention between screen, book, and maybe some scribbled notes. Text conventions like bold-face for commands, different font for filenames, etc., can go a long way.I'm using it in a university course right now, and the instructor feels compelled to explain what the book is trying to explain.

Yet she did. However, the story was completely unrealistic and unbelievable. The overall story left me somewhat irritated at the writer for the liberties she took, expecting the reader to fillin in the blanks.

The concept was good, but the overall plot wasn't executed as one would expect. If you are going to write about the dark side of anyone, you should make the reader feel it. That didn't happen here.

Each posture from the front3. Each posture from the backand my favorite4: a dual frame of both the front and back simultaneously.If you already know Taiji these postures will be relatively easy to pick up.

This book teaches us a thing or two about cleaning out our closets from time to time. The author of this book is real inspirational to me.

Bud says \\"Good Night!\\" a lot and Tom gets to explain his latest endeavour. Phyllis and Sandy provide picnic lunches when Tom is working too hard. Chow the old Texan cook has another loud shirt. There is at least one \\"terrific explosion\\" at the end of a chapter.In this case, there is another scientific group who believes they are just as good as Tom Swift and Swift Enterprises and so when Tom passes on doing something, they decided to do it... and of course blow it. Despite the colossal urge to say \\"I told you so\\", Tom works hard to come up with a solution.The final chapter is pretty cool in terms of the solution and how it ultimately works out.

The story is very fast-faced, a real page turner indeed. The main characters of Drake and Lilah are over-the-top funny and definitely are at a battle of wills. They think that their strong attraction to one another is something to be repressed and that their ideal mates must be submissive types. They fight tooth and nail not to get together and seeing them fight the strong, undeniable attraction is hilarious. It wasn't until the last page that I realized that there were no love scenes, yet I felt the characters passion much more than any more graphic stories I might have read recently. I absolutely adored Drake and Lilah and will defnitely be keeping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"a teenage romance","review":"Diane Farr writes in her usual elegant style, but quite wastes her talents in a teenage romance set, for some inexplicable reason, in the regency period (not that we see much of it besides the dresses). The two main protagonists meet and quarrel their way towards marriage, and while this is amusingly written (if a bit repetitive), I was often quite bored with their antics. It is hard to believe that Drake is in his late twenties, and Lilah of age (21 at least), because throughout the book they are depicted as so incredibly self-centered and stupidly immature that I found nothing whatsoever to empathize with - one of the joys I expect from reading a romance. As I said, this might have been more acceptable had Diane Farr written a teenage romance between a 19-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl and marketed it as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible....","review":"I hate to be so harsh but this book is horrible.While I make many allowances for accuracy (or lack thereof) in a historical romance, SOME inaccuracies cannot be ignored.When an author so blatantly \\"rewrites\\" the behaviors and speech of characters in a historical period as to be laughable then I'll be the first to say skip this book. This is the case here.I quit the book by page 30. By then we know the heroine is a spoiled, supposed upper crust lady who treats her servants terribly. The hero, an EARL, is beyond rude, leers at her and calls her a brat when they first meet in a tavern, even after he knows she's a lady of quality and doesn't even know her name! Even if she was a peasant-no Earl would ever talk to someone the way Miss Farr has her male lead speaking and behaving.Another reviewer points out the obvious immaturity of the book and I wholeheartedly agree! Do yourself a favor and skip this book.1 star for a pretty cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"encourages the lying deceiving monkey in all of us","review":"Being involved with German programs I have seen this film twice.

But the plastic lens that covers the dial is too small to fit tightly in the metal ring, so it instantly falls off when the gauge is picked up. From the design, it looks like the lens is intended to be pressure/friction fit, as there is no groove in the knurled outer ring. This appears to me to be a design defect, not a problem unique to the one Amazon shipped me.Otherwise, this gauge works reasonably well for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It...Love It","review":"I can't find this in any of the local retail stores here and had to turn to the internet.

When first viewed, Katchor's work has an engagingly ethereal quality: crude yet strikingly filmic illustrations are underpinned by liltingly meandering Magic Realist musings. After a few pages, however, the subtle charm becomes smug, narrative rhythms begin to seem like simple repetitiveness and the whole enterprise appears flimsy and self-satisfied. I realise that these are separate newspaper strips not originally intended for consumption en masse but I still found the collection as a whole to be disappointing and ultimately rather irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can only get it here","review":"Ben Katchor's eerie cityscapes evoke the ruins of the kind of world that appeared to be happening in the background of 1950's films noir, and his fanciful industries, charities, and fraternal organizations hearken back to the same imagined time. Reading his work, one becomes nostalgic for a time that never existed. This form of humor is subtle. In fact, it is not the humor for which I buy Katchor's work as much as it is for that strange feeling of fictional nostalgia. You can get humor anywhere, but Katchor's world view is unique to the man himself. If you ever get jaded, remember this review: immersing yourself in a book of Katchor's is unlike anything you've ever felt before."},{"rating":"2","title":"sign Language and Linguistic Universals","review":"Very detailed, although some of the information presented has been contested, it is never the less a good starting point for ASL linguistics"},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny and romantic drama","review":"i seen this on netflix and fell in love with the story, its funny, romantic and even sad at times but you will want more. the disc are much better then watching on netflix or hulu, the subtitles are more accurate on the DVD. if you like korean drama's, then you love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actors completely wasted","review":"The lead actors are great and do their best to make the show work, but even their palpable chemistry can't float this leaden boat.The first few episodes are great and set a quick and lively tone of what happens when a little lie becomes a big misunderstanding and both sides feel aggrieved.

None of that detracts from this book, which is the best (along with companion novel \\"With the Lightnings\\" which should be read first) of recent space opera (meaning the last couple of Weber or Moon novels.) Engaging characters, interesting non-military themes (library and data science, natural history) running through the books, and rollicking adventure. Also the only really engaging space battle I have ever read. A homage to Aubrey and Maturin that works and is a great addition to Drake's canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both characters and adventure--oh my","review":"First off, this is highly reminiscent of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series--Leary is the girl-chasing overweight but likable hero and Adele is the intellectual spy/killer sidekick. So what? Aubrey/Maturin is great and it's still great when Drake does it in Space Opera.David Drake weaves together appealing (not always likable) characters and a plot that escalates from personal danger (lots of that) to threats to whole worlds. The unspoken sexual tension between Leary and Adele adds to the reader appeal without being heavyhanded.Maybe it's just me, but I enjoyed a space battle that didn't come down to the recently invented brilliant weapon which the other side didn't expect and did exactly the wrong thing.Maybe it won't stick to you forever, but you won't put it down either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Not Authored By David Drake","review":"LT. Leary Commanding (LLC) is an almost unreadable book. I'd be surprised if he actually wrote it, as Drake is much too good an author to have been the source of this nonsense. Reading \\"Superman\\" is more productive, since you only have to believe in ONE superbeing; LLC has you believe in commanders who never make mistakes, some subordinates who have the real desire to serve that would shame a 17th Century English nobleman, and others who have a supernatural capability to access any database at any time. Even Superman didn't have all these advantages, being stuck only with flying and X-Ray vision. Buy some other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"A very fresh change in space opera.

It is not really believable, but if one accepts that, it is a real page turner. In the previous book (With_the_lightnings) Lt Leary was taking on a fully prepared and armed enemy cruiser waiting for him in orbit while climbing out of a gravity well in a corvette he had just taken over and that he was not familar with. In this book he has to top that and he does. One wonders what he will attack singlehandedly in the third volume? Perhaps the enemy's main naval base?

But the book seems to have no reason to exist except to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"What a disappointment. Crossing California was a wonderful book, full of interesting characters rooted in a specific time and neighborhood of Chicago. Washington Story reads as if Langer's publisher asked for another book just like the first, demanded it within a 6 month time period, and then didn't take the time to have it edited. This book should have been reduced by several 100 pages, whole story lines cut out. It rambles and makes pointless references to historical events and places in Chicago.

He continually lauds Newton's theism without noting that it was just those theistic parts of Newton's work that were the most unsuccessful. 4, Like so many ID advocates he completely avoids discussing extinction, the necessary other side of any design argument.

Filmed in 1920 in Germany as two features, mashed down to this one-hour cut for 1923 US release. Competently made and occasionally pretty. Brutal abridgement means film often flirts with incoherence, and Emil Mamelok plays Hawkeye like a stolid German burgher. Much energetic canoeing. Lugosi's role is largely cut, but he shines when onscreen. This edition offers a soft 16mm print, ungainly intertitles and no extra features. Essential for Lugosi completists, not without interest for students of early German film, otherwise pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Book on Prayer!","review":"This marvelous book on prayer covers all aspects of integrating prayer and God into one's daily life--everything from using one's imagination to deepen prayer to converting work and action into prayer.

I was NOT expecting the Lenny Bruce of guitar players (no offense to Lenny intended), but that's what you'll get if you buy this DVD.The freakin' guy doesn't even let you see the pedals he's got on his pedalboard !!What saves this DVD from getting only one star instead of two is Les' ribald sense of humour. I particularly enjoyed his \\"witty banter\\" with two Russian pole-dancers from the strip club next door.Bottom line: this DVD is little more that a mediocre Las Legas lounge act featuring a world-class GUITAR PLAYER !?!

The best part of the video is where Leslie breaks down how to play \\"Mississippi Queen.\\" He doen't get very technical in terms of effects, amp, etc.,and more on guitar technique and attitude.Id say \\"Buy it\\" if you like Mountain and want to enter the world of Leslie West. I saw Leslie recently at the West Fest 40th Woodstock Reunion. He still plays a nasty sounding \\"Mississippi Queen\\". Take what you can from the DVD and get inspired a bit.

Yes, you do have to rearrange your life around them. The same holds true about any pet. Several of my friends also read this book, we all felt it was unfairly biased.

Valuable lessons for children.Also, the simple language used to describe stocks and bonds could be very useful for young, inquiring minds.

It can almost be compared to sounding more like Clarity, it's not as upbeat as Bleed American but it has an edgier tone to it. Some people will say they hate it cuz it's not as poppy or its too poppy...the truth is it's just good music and if you like it you like it and if you don't you don't. If you like J.E.W listen to the album a couple times and give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope to see more like Futures in the Future","review":"I got hooked on Jimmy Eat world while playing Burnout 3 and Tony Hawk's Underground 2 so i decided to buy this cd.

The best songs: Futures, Just Tonight..., Pain, Drugs or Me, and of corse Night Drive"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Future Looks Bright","review":"Remember the first time you heard a record that made you shiver because it was so good? Jimmy Eat World's first effort in three years will make you shiver again. \\"Futures\\" is everything you loved about every other Jimmy record combined into one stellar package. The opener/title track is slow but driving and it WILL stick in your head. \\"Work\\" screams instant radio single and features Liz Phair's backing vocals (but it's still good) and the chorus is incredibly catchy. The first single, \\"Pain,\\" is one of the most upbeat songs on the record, and could just as easily have been on Bleed American. The closer, \\"23\\" is driving and epic, easily one of the best Jimmy songs ever written. Other standouts include \\"Kill,\\" \\"Drugs Or Me,\\" and \\"Polaris.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This album is way overproduced and the performance lacks emotion for the most part, especially the vocals, which is one of my favorite things about this band. It's just bad. I bought the double CD special edition, and after I listened to the first disc, which is the studio album, I almost went and returned it. Then I listened to the bonus disc, which is demos of all the songs. It was SOOOO much better. The writing is better, the production is better, and the performance has so much mor energy. I showed the difference to 3 other people and they all agreed that the demos were better. I don't know what the band members were thinking, but they should have released something more like thte demos. The studio album sounds like generic bad pop rock, whereas the demos sound like good music. So, if you are thinking about getting this album, just go for the double cd bonus one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like their last CD","review":"I loved Jimmy Eat World's self-titled CD (with Sweetness, the Middle, etc). When I heard their new single \\"Pain\\", I thought it was so fantastic, I couldn't wait to hear the Futures CD. But when I finally heard it.... BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Everyone else here seemed to love this CD and maybe it's good in its own way, but for fans of their last album, this one is much quieter and nowhere near as much fun. I could go to sleep with songs like \\"Kill\\" and \\"Polaris\\". I know everyone says that the guitarwork is brilliant, yadda yadda yadda, but I don't care... about 75% of this album is really boring.The decent songs on the album are \\"Pain\\", \\"Futures\\", \\"Work\\", \\"Just Tonight\\", and \\"Nothing Wrong\\". All the other songs are very slow, ballad-type songs. But if you like that kind of stuff, by all means go out and buy the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh no no no wrong.","review":"no way it's just a bunch of slow songs!i only like 2 songs, Pain and just tonight, those are the only fast and good ones. my friend Alex Kisor, burned it for me, and it sucked. and i was going to waste my money! don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good JEW","review":"This album is a disappointment. JEW has sold out. Sure, this album is okay if you like cheesy poppiness, but what further evidence do you need that the band sold out than a techno-pop \\"Last Christmas\\"? Sadly, most of the tracks even lack a catchy melody like they did in 'Bleed American,' making me wonder exactly what this album's redeeming values are.Definitely not Emo, and not even good for pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Star cast typical remake lack of recreation","review":"I bought the original 1946 version from AMAZON and loved it. The DVD included 2 versions and I enjoyed sitting through both. It has suspense, lots of bodies, killers known and unknown. The remake was set in Britain and its 1978 English adaptation of Raymond Chandler's famous \\"The Big Sleep,\\" was a let down. Robert Miotchem was super and held the weak movie together. The \\"R\\" rating was because of the two \\"perky\\" women showing skin which highlights their unstable character ,and beauty, but little else. The plot in both stories was complicated but the 1978 version ending was lacking in closure. I bought the 1978 version used and the Jimmy Steward title on the cover was just a bit part. I can't rate this movie over 2.5 stars and it hurts me to do so given the legendary character of the star strewn cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shane Meets Dracula is better than The Black Forest Monster Mash","review":"After first buying The Black Forest, the previous cross-genre book by the same writer & artist team as The Wicked West, a book he wanted so much to love but just felt was lacking as it felt rushed and there was too much cramming into rather than working into the story of the Universal-style monsters, this reader came to The Wicked West somewhat hesitantly. However The Wicked West, essentially Shane meets Dracula, turned out to be a far better book than The Black Forest as it flowed much better than The Black Forest and the juxtaposition between film and \\"reality\\" was accomplished in an appropriately satisfying manner.

The Moneyman is about the incredible merchant, Jacques Coeur (Jack Heart) and the King of France, Charles the 7th. Jacques Coeur was able through his devotion to France to finance the recovery of Normandy from England at the end of the 100 year war. Interwoven with the history is the romantic story of two people of that time. Thomas Costain's description of their lives gives us an inside view of what life was like in France before the Revolution in the 1700's. Chivalry was so ignorant of reality that seeing it in a situation really will open your eyes. Also, the way people were tried in courts is another way to see the amazing way our own founders framed our American constitution from knowledge of the abuses the European courts. If you like to be involved in a story that you can't stop reading, the Moneyman will give you hours of such interesting reading. You will be better for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even the pigeons will eat it","review":"This was a gift for my squirrel box . It seemed promising.

It is quite heavy so it may not be ideal for smaller scooters or bikes. The length comes up a little short than what is advertised, but for the price and peace of mind, that is a minot flaw in my opinion.

The idea is to list laws that seem very strange, dumb or just plain off-the-wall. It could have been a good book but it needs a little more research.Each page has a catchy phrase about some law. The title of the book is one such phrase. There is then some of the text of the law it refers to. Unfortunately, sometimes the blurb is actually the direct opposite of the law given. I found this to be really unforgivable in such a book. Very often I got the idea that the authors just didn't understand the language used in the laws and sometime I felt they never read them in the first place.Still, there are some dumb laws that they did get right.

However, they fail to realize that some of the laws make perfect sense, because they don't posess the necessary experience to understand why the laws are necessary.Also, in a few cases, they completely misinterpret the laws to mean something that has little to nothing to do with the law at hand.For evidence, the title is incorrect. Not because the law doesn't name alligators (it doesn't), but rather because the way it is written, a person has the option of tying the alligator to the fire hydrant.

Unfortunately, the price is prohibitive - try a library, because this biography is a pleasant read for a new student, and thorough enough for a scholar or more in-depth investigation. In second volume are the notes and annotations for the main biography, which are invaluable for anyone wishing to do further research.

Jesus\\", \\"Like Humans Do\\", \\"The Moment of Conception\\" and, especially, \\"Desconocido Soy\\" are joyful compositions featuring Byrne's awestruck naivete and goofy choke of a voice. The quiet moments, however, leave the most impression here. When he's riding a rhythm, Byrne is in the long line of rock and roll freaks; when he's deceptively calm, he's a creepy original - a cross between his \\"Psycho Killer\\" persona and Barry White. Love songs like \\"Smile\\" and \\"Walk On Water\\" are fraught with vicious undercurrents. \\"The Accident\\", a gripping death of love metaphor that's the flipside to \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", is all roiling undertow. \\"When you see an accident,\\" Byrne cautions, \\"do not turn your head and look away.\\" You're sure to find horror, he's suggesting, and even an incongruous beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is very good","review":"finally a cd with depth and great writing that gives us what we have all missed since the glory days of TH- i feel the strength of Mr. Byrne's voice shows up here but also that mysterious vulnerability - great arrangements - how exciting - i love Ub jesus and everyone's in love with you -"},{"rating":"2","title":"GET THIS NOW!","review":"if you, at all, like david byrne get this now!!!

Just TRY not to sing along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done","review":"David Byrne employed a large string section for this album and for most of the songs, it works quite well. First off, there's the bouncy, danceable \\"U.B. Jesus\\" as a leading track. Then, there's the quite disturbing \\"The Accident\\" with eerie lyrics. Easily enjoyable as well are \\"The Great Intoxication\\" and \\"Like Humans Do\\" with catchy rhythms and interesting lyrics. The strings sound quite beautiful on just about every track. The only low-points are the way-too-happy \\"Neighborhood\\" and the forgettable \\"Smile\\". All in all, this is one of the most beautiful things that Byrne has recorded in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I heard this was his best work since Talking Heads...","review":"If so, then I'm glad I didn't bother with any of the other albums. I know it's not fair to compare his solo career to that band. I would have the same complaints had I just heard Frank Black for the first time since the Pixies. But... if you are looking for a more Talking Heads style album, don't look here. Fairly interesting album art concept, though. However, Mr. Byrne is quite the performer and I'm sure these songs would be more appreciated if heard in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, horrible singing","review":"I was impressed with the music arrangement but the singing absolutely killed the experience. The singing is worse when he performs live. I caught a performance on the Late Show. The string arrangement was beautiful, the incorporation of drums was perfect, but when David started singing \\"The Great Intoxication\\" I couldn't help but say: UGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Byrne, baby, Byrne","review":"\\"Look Into the Eyeball\\" is another in a line of outstanding works by Byrne. It is filled with those elements that go into making him one of the ultimate rock performers and paradoxes. Like his persona, his songs are a curious combination of the mundane with the weird, the straightforward with the inventive, the sincere with the ironic. As a singer he is quirky yet solid, off-key yet pleasant, casual yet compelling, distant yet emotive. And as a performer, he remains, even on record, awkward but riveting, spasmodic but rhythmic, mechanical but endearingly human. The production and musicianship are brilliant. And his Boz Scaggs meets Barney Fife rendition of the Philly-soul sounding \\"Neighborhood\\" has us smiling while dancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first david solo cd....","review":"and i love it!!!!:)from beginning to end, this cd is great. it includes some of the happiest songs i think i have ever heard, which is coming from a big fan of happy songs.:)cool. just cool is the only way besides super great to describe this cd. is it a good place to start your david byrne collection?? i dont know, but its definetley persuaded me to check out everything else.and i should say the talking heads are in my top 5, but now david byrne is there too!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the return of Rei Mo Mo ?","review":"I like this CD but, it reminds me of \\"Rei Mo Mo\\" which is my least favorite \\"Byrne CD\\".

I thought that it was the best album that they have ever written. It had a different style of music that they didn't have in their older albums. I know that this album is very popular because of the amount of people listening to it.\\"Meant to Live\\" is one of my favorite songs. I use the song in a lot of my movie making programs on my computer. It is an up beat song that gives the movie a better rating when people see it because of its popularity.

(Not that this is his worst by a long shot.)The beauty of Heads/Byrne is his turgid lyrics mean different things at different stages of life. Same has held true with this album after a few years of listening. Some songs that seemed brilliant the first time I heard them now seem a little silly, and some that flashed past back then have blossomed.I wouldn't recommend this CD for someone who only had enough money to buy 5 of the greatest Heads/Byrne CDs; BUT probably would for someone who was buying the best overall 30 CDs.If he's cashing in, at least this CD sucks much less than what Dylan, Petty, Jagger and the rest of these 60-somethings are putting out lately."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Ghastly","review":"I intially started watching this with very low expectations and was disappointed. Even excusing the deviations from the original, this movie had serious problems. In general the script was poor, the special effects were lacking, and the acting was horrendous (with a few minor exceptions). Helen was very disappointing. I just can't figure what about her is so beautiful as to warrant the launching of one ship...let alone a thousand.The most redeeming part of the movie is the marine landing scene when the ships reach Troy. One of the soldiers was hit by an arrow but I swear there was a banana peel on the shore...we re-wound it three times, just to make sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and rather boring...","review":"I remember starting to watch this mini-series on TV and feeling quite bored with it. While the actors are attractive, I found Helen wanting and the screenwriting terrible.The movie TROY with Diane Krueger and Brad Pitt is infinitely better, on many levels, even though they condensed the story a lot. (the Trojan war supposedly lasted 10yrs, hence the 1,000 ships)I say \\"skip this version\\". >>Buy TROY instead.<<"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the Brad Pitt TROY movie","review":"I just finished watching TROY (with Brad Pitt)and I was greatly disappointed. At least Helen of Troy sticks to the story - for the most part. In the movie TROY, Menelaus is killed by Hector and Achilles & Agamemnon both die inside Troy during the sacking. In Helen of Troy there aren't any huge mistakes - at least not on the scale of TROY. Why oh why can't the directors just stick to the story?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Helen ever","review":"This is by far the worst film on the war of Troy I have ever seen. The idea of showing a little of Helen's side of the story might have been interesting, if only they had chosen another actress. Sienna Guillory is definitely not the most beautiful woman on the earth. Marsden's Paris is dull, Hector almost non existent and Achilles is so fat he can hardly move (should that be a half god?).The real jewel of the film (which is disgracefully not enough to save the day) is Rufus Sewell as King Agamemenon. His acting is brilliant and touching; the sacrifice Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia is a masperpiece of acting.A real pity that it is the only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Iliad and forget this movie","review":"I had just finished reading The Iliad by Homer when I casually caught this movie on cable TV. After a while I just couldn't stand it and turned off the TV. Movies who don't do justice to the book on which they are inspired are legions, but this one reaches new heights in stupidity and bad taste.From the Vin Diesel-style, abrupt, one-sided, acting of Achilles to the meaningless and ridiculous twists to the original story, this movie manages the difficult task of turning the Greek masterpiece into a ridiculous piece of junk.None of the actors are credible, the influence of the Gods is reduced to a bare minimum, CGI's are awful, weapons and armours would not look out of place at a \\"bal masque\\" - overall, this movie is definitely worth avoiding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much Helen, not enough Troy","review":"If you are wanting to see anything that even vaguely looks like the Illiad, forget this movie.

Suffice it to say that \\"Helen of Troy\\" is garbage.

Do not- I repeat- do NOT expend your money or precious moments watching this movie. Read the Iliad- the definitive Trojan War movie has not yet been made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie of a legendary greek epic!","review":"This movie was one of the best I've ever seen! The actress playing Helen was stunning and the acting was top-notch. Agamemnon was particularly excellent (you grow to hate him, as you should by the end...) Achellies was the brute he absolutely was in literature, not the oversexed, brooding, quasi-hero he is in the miserable movie, \\"Troy\\". Overall rather impressive for a TV-mini series and very accurate to the original story. I wish I could give it 6 stars. Definately give this DVD a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A relatively faithful adaptation of Greek mythology","review":"For those seeking to be entertained, this movie fits the bill, as does the movie \\"Troy\\". For classicists, I encourage you to remember that neither \\"Helen of Troy\\" nor \\"Troy\\" ever claimed to be an accurate representation of Greek mythology, so it would be foolish to judge the movies by that standard; after all, neither movie is entitled \\"Homer's Iliad\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but disapointing","review":"a fairly humdrum affairinteresting in that the usual hero roles were not as cut and dried as we are used tobut in the end i did not believe that the lovers would risk everything as the attraction between them seemed non existant mainly due to the fact that Helen was more wooden than the Trojan horse.still the battle scenes were very well handled and the fall of troy was quite moving"},{"rating":"1","title":"what does Troy have to do with this?","review":"As all movies do, this one also has both - positive and negative aspects:Positive: Helene is really cute.Negative: everything else.P.S.

So, this movie could have done the same.I spent a month reading \\"The Iliad\\" in it's original form, then I turn on the TV and see this crap.

The cast is made of terrific actors from many countries, even if they're not celebrities, they're far more talented than those who have made it big in Hollywood.The sex and violence are there but they're NOT extremely graphic, and everything was tastefully done.Is a visual feast and the directors and producers really went out of their way to visualy bring this old world back to us in every aspect you see from the sets, costumes, props, etc.All lovers of the ancient Greek tales and mythology should own a copy or at least watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homer would be turning in his grave","review":"Aside from the names, i dont think the movie had anything to do with the actual story. Thyeus as far as I know died way before the Troyan war. Plus, he was killed by king Lycomides of Skyros, not Polideukis. Ifigenia was not a little girl when her father sacrificed her, and she did not die. The Goddess Artemis took her in a cloud and left a deer in her place. Achileas was no where near the other kings when Helen was given to Menelaus. And that is simply because at the time his mother Thetis had given him to king Lycomides to hide ever since he was a little boy. There are so many other things... All I have to say is that i switched it off way before the Greeks hit Troy...

She wasn't that beautiful and I just couldn't see anyone making a big fuss over her. Also, her acting wasn't that great.

This actress is an anorexic deadpan bleach-blond with a thick foreign accent,an airhead, to use modern terminology.

Mainly because of the story of Helen. Helen lives a stupid life in the hands of these writers. They also chose the wrong girl to play her. Helen's sister is better looking than her. C'mon! They show Helen in stupid nude scenes that are a waste of time. Paris and Helen don't make you feel like there is any love between them. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars is because of Rufus Sewell who plays Agamemnon. What a superb actor. He gets through so much with just a look. He actually steals the show. I felt that I was watching a movie about Agamemnon not Helen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I hate this movie.

In my opinion, everything is wrong and cheap, i'ts a mediocre Hollywoodize version where nothing works, Everybody is misscast, just look the cheap sets, where you see the painted wood, just an example: the Trojan casstle after the ten years, just spread with some black spray paint that you notice. The terrible fighting coreography (like the fight of Paris with the soldiers at the begining) The ridiculous customs with poliester crests, the acting!!, like when Hector is killed by Aquiles. conclusion: It's a kitsch film with no talent whatsoever, it's fun to watch as an involuntary humor piece, don't waist your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"i am a big fan of greek myth and was very VERY excited to learn that there was a mini series on helen of troy. but, sadly, i was extremely disappointed. the person who played helen was somewhat of a good actress but wasn't convincing to be the person who 'launched a thousand ships' (and her dress seemed to be falling off at some parts of the film). and the visuals were TERRIBLE. It was annoying to watch a few hundred FAKE ships sailing the seas. cassandra was annoying as well. the story wasn't really that great either. the guy played agamemnon fit the role and john rhy-davies played a good King Priam (it was nice to see him as someone rather that Gimli from LOTR).Overall - C-Acting - BSpecial Affects - CStory - B-Costumes - BI sincerely hope the new 'Troy' movie will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helen of Troy","review":"TV movie bowdlerized version of a classic tale. Although this story has held up for centuries - this version falls flat. However, Rufus Sewell as King Agemmenon is brilliant and deserves an Emmy Award. Rufus Sewell is the ONLY really strong performance in this film - the rest of the film moves at a snails pace and is BORING. Serena Guillory as Helen of Troy could not act her way out of a paper bag - she comes across as a petulant spoiled brat - definitely not a maiden who could launch a thousand ships. I watched it for FREE on cable and still felt \\"I want my money back\\" - but the magnificent Rufus Sewell has many shining, illuminating moments and makes it worth watching if you fast forward to his scenes and skip over the rest of the wooden performances. This is a vanilla flavored \\"lite\\" version of the classic tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words: SIENNA GUILLORY","review":"They chose the right person to play the most beautiful woman in history.

I love the fact that it's a food-based supplement, so it's safe to take larger doses when you need it (like if you feel a cold coming on), whereas it's not always safe to take large doses of pill-form supplements, since they usually contain chemical forms of vitamins, which do not absorb as well in the body. I've actually used Liquid Health as a prenatal vitamin during two of my pregnancies, just taking a double-dose of the recommended daily amount. I stay much healthier when I take this supplement regularly. My kids also love the Children's multi, and it has kept them very healthy, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great multivitamin","review":"Liquid Health's daily multiple is one of the best liquid vitamins you can buy.It is whole food based derived from sea vegetables,in a base of pure aloe vera juice.Because it's a whole food and a liquid,it absorbs instantly into the bloodstream,giving you instant energy!There is NO higher absorption rate...sooo much better than pills!I take 2 tablespoons every day,and I feel SO good mentally,and have lots of energy!I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Review - Liquid Health","review":"Excellent Product.

Surprisingly though, they only had one copy, and it wasn't even on display. Anyways, i've already heard 'the field' 'dope transmission' 'yes yall' before, but this is still worth it because they tried to make it sound like a non-stop album that they included about 25 seconds of intro before each song. the singles on here were never before released on CDs and i finally don't have to burn them on blank CDs in order to be able to listen to a song like 'the field' in my car any more. This is better than 'the evening with the sound providers'. after all, this is when MC Profile was still w/ the group, so it feels fresh and this is easily the best album for me right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor book","review":"This was the most boring book I have ever read. The author spent way too much time on details and not enought on interesting stuff! My son had to use this book for a book report where he had to pick out 10 important details and find objects to help describe them. This was the most difficult task ever. All we could come up with was a cat, a harpoon, a whale a boat and oil!Horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This are nice FRS radios","review":"These are good quality radios. The sound is clear and the functions are easy to use. The range is good on open ground and very adequate in the woods. I especially like them when I let the kids go to the neighborhood park or when they are outside with their friends. They are also water-resistant so you can use them during inclement weather and they have a 2-year warranty; the best warranty in the business. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"voice-over nightmare","review":"Like many young boys, I first read Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe when I was nine, over forty-five years ago. It was one of those novels that drew me into literature. In fact, it was the very first full-length work of fiction I ever read. Unfortunately, this video utterly butchers it. None of the characters emerge as real human beings. Ivanhoe, himself, is almost a non-presence! And while the background music is very nice, (you may even want to purchase Dave Uhrich's CDs) it is not appropriate to the the video at all (try to imagine Winterhill during a battle scene!). And Isaac and Rebecca?! What happened to them?! At least they remembered to put Rowena in it... though they forgot to give her any character at all.Save your money. Or... buy Douglas Camfield's. That's much better done and it's worlds more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ivanhoe Without Rebecca","review":"Scott's \\"Ivanhoe\\" is one of my favorite stories. I have seen every movie version, and I was curious about this one, so, I bought it. This is one of the oddest. It has been dubbed -- badly -- from what appears to be Russian. It is short. To make it short, the story has been gutted. Gone are Rebecca and her father Isaac of York. Since the story centers around Rebecca, and the love of Ivanhoe and Brian de Bois Gilbert (whose name has been altered, for no apparent reason, to \\"Brian de Buge Gilbert\\") for Rebecca, it really isn't \\"Ivanhoe\\". Also, Gilbert lives in the end. Go figure.I write this review, because I read the other reviews before buying this DVD, and I wonder whether the reviewers watched the same movie that I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I love this book. Maybe meant to be for young adults this is not a dumbed down book. I tried reading Sabriel, the book before this in the series, and couldn't get into it. Lirael, however, hooked me. The crazy library & Disreputable Dog companion definitely helped, but the book is generally well written and engaging (cliche, but I couldn't put it down.) I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lirael","review":"Lirael kept your attention to the very end just as Sabriel and Abhorsen did. It would have been rated 5 stars but I felt the end was weak and kind of ending abruptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Story in a Unique Setting","review":"The second book in the trilogy takes a fresh perspective on the universe with a new set of characters, beginning their own story. This book and the final, Abhorsen, operate as a pair and are a more traditional fantasy book format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of an excellent trilogy","review":"While not as good as Sabriel or Abhorsen, Lirael is a good story in itself. The main complaints I have with it is a somewhat drawn out beginning, and no strong conclusion (fixed by simply reading Abhorsen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Kingdom","review":"Nix and Stanek are two of my favorites for YA teen books. I read all of Nix's Keys to the Kingdom and now reading the Abhorsen ones. Sabriel is my favorite so far of this new series. what I liked best were the parts with Sameth and Clayr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Magic","review":"The way Barth Nix leads you into Lirael's story is priceless. The sentences and paragraphs form a movie screen in your mind where, after you pass the first chapter, you no longer control the stop button. I recomedn this book for all young adults for it opened my eyes into a whole world of fantasy and imagination. Garth Nix is a Mage with words in this gem of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I really liked this, which surprised me since I usually don't like stories about kids of characters in previous books. It got a 4 star rating because I thought it was a bit slow in the beginning. This book may be a bit better than Sabriel in the sense that you don't know what's going to happen as much. Being a prequel to Abhorsen, it let's you get to know the characters, but the plot does not surface till the end and then continued in the next book.I found the switching of veiws somewhat annoying because I liked Lirael more than Sameth (the prince), but that might be because I'm a girl and Sameth's a boy. All in all, this was a pretty good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly good","review":"Like its predecessor Sabriel, this book is great. Lirael is a wonderful character - realistic, likeable, curious, intellectual, easy to empathesize with, yet strong and sensible. Someone you'd like to hang out with. Similiarly the rest of the cast shines; I have trouble trying to point out a single poorly drawn character that's essential to the plot. The story is satisfyingly full of mysteries and secrets and adventure - I literally could not stop turning the pages until I got to the end. Even though the book does not finish the tasks set out for the good guys, the end is still climatic. Like many of the other readers who've written reviews here, I too am waiting on tetherhooks for \\"Abhorsen\\", the final book (or so I'm told) of this so far magnificently written trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best fantasy books","review":"This is one of the best fantasy books that I have read. It is gripping and you feel as if you are actually there experiencing whats happenning. I would definitedly recommend this book for young adults and for those who truly appreciate a fantasy novel which you just can't put down!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lirael: Duughter of the Clayr","review":"It was a graet book but doesn't have the best ending. It's like stoping the story in the middle. Besides all that though it was still exciting and well writen. Definately get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review Of \\"Lirael : Daughter of the Clayr\\"","review":"I thought this was a great book, although it wasn't nearly as good as \\"Sabriel\\" was. It was a great book for information and to sort of bring you back into that 'world'. I am glad that Nix is comin out with \\"Abhorson\\" becase that was a pretty ... way to end \\"Lirael.\\" All in all, i give this book a four and 1/2 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lirael","review":"I was absolutely astounded when I saw that people in Amazon had rated this book lower than Nix's last in the series - Sabriel !at 5 *s. Actually, I gave them both 5 stars, but this one is still better.).This book is written to endear us - and it's better than Sabriel because it has a dog in it!! Lirael is someone we can empathise with, and Sabriel and Touchstone make a comeback which completely explains the life they have made for themselves.The only problem with this book is the way it left us dangling at the end!! I can't wait for The Abhorsen, Garth Nix!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I was initially alittle put off by this book just due to it's size. However, once I begin reading it, there was no turning back. Like the first book, Sabriel, it's a very deep story and more than worth the time and read. I immediately loved the Disreputable Dog much more than Mogget. I was disappointed in Sameth as the book progressed but begin liking him more towards the end. The ending of this book left me hanging needing to read the next book just to see what happens. If you enjoy good fantasy filled with magic and loveable characters, this is the series for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This book was amazingly great. It was like a much more complecated Harry Potter. You really feel the emotion of all the charecteds. The only thing I hate is waiting for Abhorson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait","review":"I loved Lirael but I don't want to be gushy in my praise of it, though Lirael certainly is worthy of being the sequel of Sabriel. We learn a lot more about the magical Old Kingdom, and the story continues with the same tense, sometimes ironic tones as Sabriel. And interestingly, there is not just one main character, as there was in Sabriel - but two, Lirael herself and Sameth, the erring prince. However, I was a little disappointed in the way both Lirael and Sameth indulged in self-pity (the latter more often) and found Sameth's childish, selfish behavior rather annoying. But because Lirael isn't a complete novel, like Sabriel, (it ends abruptly with the story of Lirael and Sameth continuing in \\"Abhorsen\\") I can yet hope these two main characters - Sameth particularly - will develope further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sequel!","review":"After reading Sabriel by Garth Nix, could you think that he could get any better? He did! The sequel was just as enchanting as the first. The only problem I had with the book was that I thought it a bit too complex, making the storyline hard to follow at points. But overall it was generally very enjoying to read! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lirael","review":"Lirael is so real, so human. Nix does a wonderful job portraying her. Her journey is fascinating. Super book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to read this book!","review":"After reading Sabriel I had to get more and Lirael was the answer. In the beginning it was so sad since she had no mom and no dad and no sight(which is what the clayr call if you can see the future). On her birthday they announce they have seen the sight in someone and Lirael knows it is her. She finds out after all that it is not. Years go by for her waiting to have the sight. In the meanwhile she works in the library with her faithful companion the direputable dog. Over all I think this book was the best yet Garth Nix needs to get the next one out since it ended kind of like the Golden Compass series. I also am debating whether this book was better than Sabriel and right now I think it is. If you read Sabriel I don't know how you could not go on with out reading this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small world...","review":"What I love about this book is how all the different stories and characters tie to each other somehow, though, more often than not, the characters themselves don't realize it. The ending was brilliant... *shivers*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Semi-perfect!!!","review":"Just like my title, I thought this book was only semi-perfect because...THEY LEFT ME HANGIN'! I guess it's a good way to get you to buy the next book. But besides that I thought it was a very good book. Garth Nix is a very good writer and I can't wait for Abhorsen to come out. His detail makes you feel as if you really are in the book. The Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre creates a perfect world for Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen to be in."},{"rating":"2","title":"none","review":"With Lirael, Nix joins the ranks of Disch, Jacques, and Pullman when it comes to engaging fantasy for young adults.

I had read SABRIEL a few months before I purchased this book, and I was a little nervous because I loved Sabriel and was afraid Garth Nix would try to replace her with Lirael. However, all my worries were pointless as LIRAEL is a completely different story, set in the same world as SABRIEL, and Sabriel herself still has a fairly large role in the book. I recommend LIRAEL to all book fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn From The Clayr","review":"Have you ever been in a position where you felt much too old for something, but had no way to get out? This is what happens to Lirael, who is 14, living with the Clayr (a race of psychic women who gain the ability to See around puberty) and without the Sight. On the brink of suicide, the most powerful Clayr on the glacier (twins Sanar and Ryelle) tell Lirael that Sightlessness isn't the end of the world.This encouragement spurs Lirael on, especially when she is assigned to the Great Library of the Clayr as a Third Assistant Librarian. After much exploring, Lirael finds her fate. She must join up with Prince Sameth to save his best friend Nicholas, or face the immenent destruction of both Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as haunting as Sabriel but more complex","review":"Good book. For some reason, not quite as haunting as Sabriel, but more complex. Sabriel was more of a stand-alone story. This second novel in the series and the third novel Abhorsen run straight together like one big book. Lirael is a much more conflicted character than Sabriel was and the early chapters with her growing up among the Clayr and her work in the library are fascinating. Prince Sammeth is also much more conflicted than was Touchstone in the first book. Good character development. The Disreputable Dog got on my nerves initially but then grew on me since her \\"dogness\\" was very real and detailed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep reading it gets better","review":"Good sequal to Sabriel. It seems like the story is not as strong, but i think that's because Sabriel has a lot of discovery (not suprising, it's the first book). The other thing is that the prince is a little annoying, but thankfully that doesn't last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like all garth nix - fantastic fantasy","review":"My favorite fantasies are by garth nix.

Nix's novel, Shade's Children, is fine for adolescent readers, but adults may find that it shows the author's potential better than his skill. Sabriel blew out of the water any notion that Garth Nix couldn't keep up. That novel was great, and stood well on its own. With Lirael, though we revisit Ancelstierre and The Old Kingdom, are updated on Sabriel and Touchstone, and taken in by the story of the Clayr-born Lirael. This book is enchanting. I eagerly await the third in the series: Abhorsen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lirael","review":"I think that the book Lirael is an excellent book as is the pre-sequel Sabriel. This book is about a young woman named Lirael who despretly wants to be a proper Clayr which she is not. Lirael becomes a librarian and is sent away to battle evil. On her journey she encounters many obstacles and even something else. Half of this book is also about Sabriel's son Price Sameth and his encounters and adventures.

Sabriel is 5 stars, and i would rate Lirael as a 4 3/4 stars. Now if Sabriel had been the main character, probably it would have been 5 stars. when the truth comes out about Lirael and who her parents are(more father than mother) at the end was stunning. Never would i have guested. When they encounter Chlorr and Sam rages into the fight the unknown necromance at that time, u could tell Sam and Touchstone are father, son. Just like Touchstone, excpet not as wimpy. As i said in my review of Sabriel, Garth has a gift for suspense. all through the book, i kept saying to myself, with is this evil and i want to no now. I definitely gonna read Abhorsen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the first one....","review":"The first one was the best i loved it. When i found out there was a second book i jumped at the chance to buy it! I started it and could never finish it. I really liked Sabriel and her character but when i started Lirael i was like 'what is this!!' i hope the third book is better but i dont see much hope in it. Like a fool i will buy it since i have the other two and i MIGHT (notice the BIG might) get around to trying to read Lirael again, but i doubt it. I would not recommend BUYING this book. Read the first one, then BORROW the second. if u like it then buy it. but dont spend ur money right away. i dont think its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guide in understanding your dreams","review":"I owned this book about 10 years ago and found it to be a tremendous tool in helping to understand my dreams.

I now think critically about my dreams, they are a tool I use to guide myself in making positive choices.This book is not a dry read! (Er, no pun intended!) The dreams are fascinating and brought to light many of my own erotic dreams that I'd forgotten.

One reviewer mentioned that the tall heel tabs cause irritation, and I agree. Just cut them off, as the boots are real easy to get on and off anyway. I like that these have a somewhat narrow and slender profile, as they make getting on my medium sized Blades easier. My thick 7mm ones make it hard to get the fins on all the way. Also, the rubber extended toe caps and on the heel are great.I completely recommend these boots.

It sort of follows the same lines as Battle Royale with the teacher war but is more enjoyable and less of that everbody has to die sort of thing.

It is supposedly the directors cut - but the way it is cut changes the original storyline and is confusing especially if you have seen the original.There are three cuts of Volcano High the original Korean version(122 min) the International version(100 min) then the American version (abt 80 min). If you flip the disk over it does containthe original Korean version(with Eng subtitles) this does redeemthe movie to some extent.The basic plot stays the same in all three movies a good boy with supernatural powers who has been kicked out of 8 or 9 high schools gets one last chance at Volcano High where everyonein the school knows martial arts and is after a secret manuscript.my recommendation is for the International version of the movie(it is not too fast -nor too slow) then the original versionthen lastly the American version."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, it's not a rapper/gangster movie!","review":"I don't know why they have Hip Hop stars adorning and overpowering the DVD cover.

Anyways if you look closely at the tiny images at the top of the cover you will see the fine young korean actors.This is a cool \\"Korean\\" kick-ass fantasy film in the veins of \\"Dragon Ball Z\\".

Accomplished.","review":"Ok, it isn't like this film was the Film of the Year or anything, but it was entertaining... until MTV got ahold of it and ghetto'd it up with a bunch of rappers doing stupid voiceovers. The voice acting on this is sooo out of place and honestly embarrasing. I would ask \\"what where they thinking\\" but judging from the cover art, it is clear. You can practically hear the Viacom execs saying, \\"Hey the kids like those rappers and that Wu Fu Clan game is popular! Let's get rappers that can't act do the voices for a Korean fighting movie! Word!\\" Yep, it is that sad. Buy the import, avoid this turd."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible version","review":"This new \\"hip hop\\" version is insulting and just horrible. I've never been so confused and just lost. It's not enough that it is a foreign film and that there are some cultural differences but now that is all taken away for a hip hop feel and the tone of the movie is lost. The new dubbing is too extreme and feels like you're drinking oil and water. It is also cut up and edited and it is in a lesser audio format. The original is smart and layered with dark humor but also very entertaining as it is a martial arts film. It would be better for everyone to find themselves the original Korean import which is longer and in DTS format. which seems to be a normal thing in South Korea unlike here where we are still on the 2.0 stereo wagon. Do not even give this version a chance. I had the unfortunate luck of seeing it on an MTV broadcast and I couldn't believe this existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martial arts lover HATED this movie...","review":"This is for the Korean version. I didn't think it was funny and was the first martial arts movie that I almost did NOT finish. The \\"fight\\" scenes were idiotic with little direct combat but mostly just \\"energy\\" gathered from thin air and then thrown at the other person. The movie also had inconsistencies. For example, Jang Ryang, or whatever the long hair guy's name is (that's a joke from the movie-pretty hilarious isn't it?) can't even compete with the substitute teachers and then out of no where he comes in and takes them all on and kills one or two (this is after he has repeated been beaten without laying one hand on any of them).

Once I started I couldn't get myself away from it. This story was something anyone can relate to once they fall in love. Maybe not all the things written in the book but there would be atleast one thing that relates to someone in their love life. It can teach you some strategies and make you think about what love really is and what it means. It also talks about what people, who are in love, would do for each other in order to be together. This book was great and I would recommend it to anyone who is in love or thinks they are. This is a good book for young adults.

Though his dazzling mimicry remains intact, Murphy lacks the incisive brilliance of Richard Pryor and gradually burns out his concert material. \\"Raw\\" also suffers from Robert Townsend's generic direction - surprisingly uninspired for a theatrical feature. There's a reason why Murphy abandoned stand-up comedy in the late 1980s: He had nothing more to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Bought it as a present for my sister and could not stop laughing!

But I got to thinking, and although this special is hilarious, I could really do without the bit about his drunk father at the end. That is a continuation from a bit he did during 1983's Delirious, but this time it ran too long (as another reviewer said). Not only that, it wasn't even that funny this time around. I usually stop the tape when that part comes on. But Raw is still worth adding to your collection.Anthony RupertP.S. I understand this special is finally going to be released on DVD.

The problem is that this is where Eddie is now a star and thinks or seems to think that everything that comes out of him is funny. \\"Delirious\\" was new and fresh and Eddie came off as suprisngly likeable and cocky and talking about things that are genuinely funny anyway like relatives and family outings, Elvis, etc. whereas this just sounds like Eddie yanking his own chain, trying to convince himself or someone that he's \\"made it\\" to the star ranks with Michael Jackson and Mr T and instead of 18 year olds getting their first experience we hear about Hollywood lifestyles and so forth.

OTHER THAN THAT, THIS MOVIE COULD'VE AND SHOULD'VE BEEN A WHOLE LOT BETTER. THE LOWEST POINT OF THE FILM IS THE FINALE IN WHICH HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HE HAD TO EAT TOYS BECAUSE HIS FAMILY WAS SO POOR. I'M A BIG FAN OF EDDIE MURPHY, BUT, I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK THIS IS ANYWHERE NEAR AS FUNNY AS ''DELIRIOUS'' WAS.

Blue and red fringing on both edges of any high contrast object.I've not tried this on my shorter focal length lenses, so I can't determine what the quality is for those or how much the haze is diminished.

The farther from the center of the image the worse it got... exponentially.

If you want a baseball movie similar to this, that is a lot better and more realistic, get Bull Durham."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad swtich","review":"Like another reviewer on here says... flashlight switch on cap doesn't do anything but click.

I'm going to think about it for a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound and clarity is not very good","review":"While this is the Swan Lake performed by the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow, the sound and clarity of the film leaves a lot to be desired. The filming of the ballet is poor and the screen is mostly dark and close ups to show the facial expressions are missing. Hence, frankly I was a bit dissatisfied with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it really that bad?","review":"Everyone bases their review of this album on the fact that Thrice can't be defined by their former genre(s). If you stop and listen to this album and put all expectations by the wayside what you might find is a beautifully crafted masterpiece. Teppei's guitar work is progressing perfectly from one album to the next, and Dustins lyrics are becoming more and more captivating. So they're not screaming as much, so the tempo is down on some songs, so they've become increasingly epic... These are all good things because the result is 11 songs that are a beautiful expression of american angst. It's all rock and roll when it all comes down to it folks. Highlights of the album are \\"Music Box\\", \\"Red Sky\\" and \\"The Earth Will Shake\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to like thrice but grew out of it.","review":"A friend of mine bought this cd when it came out.

Can't stand them now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is just boring!","review":"I have to say if your looking for a cd that is powerful and intense and full of raw emotions then this is not the cd for you!I was very let down by this cd.Im not saying that musically these guys suck at all cause they are very talented.BUT THIS CD IS ALOT SLOWER THEN THE PREVIOUS CD'S THEY HAVE DONE.It seems like the majority of the tracks on this cd start out with a boring piano part.I became very upset when i first got the cd and was trying to find a song to really get into.Most of the songs are predictibale for one.Very little Screaming going on.Their is nothing exciting about this cd at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing","review":"This album is slower and softer than any album I would ever want to own.

I think I am going to go puke now. This is so weak..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD freakin SUCKS","review":"im disgusted with thrice after hearing this. its just a bunch of lame computer generated noise with some occasional guitar and vocals that dont have a clue what genre they want to be. what happened to the true thrice??? Deadbolt....now that was the good stuff. this is crap. Artist in the Ambulance, even though it wasnt really the same sound anymore, was still pretty good, but this is horrible. theyre just a bunch of sell-outs."},{"rating":"1","title":"THRICE-VHEISSU","review":"THIS ALBUM SUCKS.

UNLESS, IT'S TWO TO FOUR YEARS OLD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen ???","review":"I think 1 star is pretty good for an album like that. What happen with you guys. This album sounds like linken park. No more hardcore sound. It looks it has been done just by a computer. Theres only one listenable song on the cd and the chorus is very bad. What a waste. It couldnt be worse. Thrice used to be good but now all true thrice fans will be very disapointed by this 100% commercial cd. Your favorite granpa radio station will be playing theses songs. This is not thrice, its soft, weak and i wont pay a buck for that....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrice is three times too many!","review":"A lame group of angry teenagers screaming about themselves. Ironic lyrics like \\"Image of the Invisible\\" do not make them intellectual. This trash is not music. Get it off my radio! If only I could give 0 stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"These screamo bands just don't stop coming, do they?","review":"All the screamo bands sound alike, and this is no exception. These guys are the same talentless musicians seen in the other screamo/emo bands. Whiny vocals and p***y lyrics coupled with puke screaming and simplistic instruments. Other than that, there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said. Avoid this and get Kreator's Pleasure to Kill.Alan Hargrove can go pack fudge, because that's all you're good for. Go back to playing \\"wiener whistle\\" with the members of Thrice.Thanks to the 1 star reviewers for backing me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music","review":"I've listened to all of Thrice's albums and these guys have kept improving with each one. Vheissu is not only their most musical (as opposed to endless screaming and repetitive guitar riffs) and musically mature album, it is also their most diverse and creative.If you're looking for nothing but mindless head banging music look elsewhere, but if you are even a little more open minded then give this album a listen as it is one of the best I've heard in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Descent album","review":"I think it is basically impossible for Thrice to make a bad album. If you've ever seen them live, they never let you down. This album is a step in another direction for Thrice, and it turned out descent. It's a big change from their hardcore-punk roots, but not necessarily a bad change. My personal favorite Thrice album is the Illusion of Safety, but this album is not a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"exciting for some, disappointing for others","review":"I'm one of the old fans of Thrice, one of those blown away by \\"Identiy Crisis\\" and \\"Illusion of Safety\\". Like the others said, these guys are very talented...but are now a completely different band. If you listen to the tracks and pretend that it is not the old Thrice, its not such a bad album.HOWEVER, for those of you old fans that were disturbed by the transformation that presented itself in \\"The Artist in the Ambulance\\", that was the tip and \\"Vheissu\\" is the iceberg in its entirety. Teppei's guitaring has been reduced to a BGM (this hurts the most as I am a guitarist), the drumming has become very mundane...the list goes on.In conclusion, if this is your first look at Thrice, go for it by all means. For old fans, lets just say that I'm demoting them to Twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"yall are out of your mind","review":"seriously, this cd is garbage. if you want to listen to a good cd try out Thrice - Illusion of Safety. I've been listening to Thrice since before most of yall were even a sperm looking for your mother's vas deferens and this cd is trash. I've got a cool idea Thrice, how about yall put out a couple of amazing cd's, get a bunch of fans, and then put out some completely different terrible music and lose all your fans? kthx. Basically thrice and thursday accomplished the same feat of completely changing what worked although a city divided by light to me is still alright (although not Full Collapse or War All The Time). This cd makes me wanna vomit on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Disappointing Album Of The Year","review":"I am a huge Thrice fan, and I love every album that they have done up to this point. If you like any of Trice's earlier albums this album will surely put you to sleep. It is a total change from punk/hardcore to a mellow, easy listening, pseudo Cold Play music. The radio friendly We Are the Invisible is the only half way decent track on the album, but you'll be sick of it after you listen to it twice. This album is boring, lyrically weak, and bears no resemblance to anything Thrice has ever done. If you like anything you've ever heard by Thrice buy any other album but this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrice","review":"I'll make this quick; If you loved the heavy, technical sound of thrice's previous records, you won't like vheissu. There are only 4 songs on here that sound like the thrice I knew, the rest are a complete 180 from the original sound. Download \\"image of the invisible\\", \\"like moths to flames\\" and \\"music box\\", then call it a day. Not a bad record, but not for me. I give them credit for trying new things, but the only reason I really ever liked thrice was for their heavy riffs and catchy melodies. Without those elements, thrice just isn't the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did you do this THRICE?!!!","review":"First off, Teppei, who I believed to be one of those most intellcual-guitarists is virtually non-existent in this record. He was once quoted in saying that in the Illusion of Safety he did nothing but riff the whole time. Well not anymore, and if he does you can't hear it. Thrice's music seems to have taken on an artsy flavor, as if to say \\"we're smart and we think about stuff so were gonna go out of our way to make a record that isn't our style so that we can prove we're versatile\\". Well to me all they proved is that they abandoned what they were best at, which was amazing musicianship and intensity. This record is very whiny and there is generally no complex musicianship, with a few exceptions. Almost every band puts out an experimental record, and they all suck. So yeah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Definitely the worst Thrice album to date. While all the songs are decent, nothing worth listening to, except maybe \\"Earth Will Shake.\\" The other 10 songs are, in my opinion, boring and repetitive. Also, Teppei's guitar playing is absent...they seemed to focus more energy on the minute long introductions and strange Radiohead-ripoff background noises instead of the actual music. I still love Thrice but this cd is terrible, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has been the worst year ever","review":"Wow... lots of high hopes for this album... lots of dissapointment to follow. i see nothing wrong with a group playing with their sound... but when a band that has done basically the same thing for three albums completely places themselves into a different genre... i get a little upset. this is a post-hardcore band tyring to create a post-rock album. this album is slow and not heavy at all. very little screaming... very little riffing. thrice basically made themselves experimental post-rock... they even used morse code on the album... wtf? if you're a big fan of thrice... you're going to hate this album... but you should give it a try anyway... just because it's thrice"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't like it","review":"Truth be told I don't like this album very much. I am trying to give it a chance because this has happened before but i just can't into it. With their other albums, I put the CD in and just let it play. I find myself skipping songs on this album which to me makes it not worthy. Just a little disapointed. While i fully understand that they are growing, I just want something not so polished, that is what drew me to them in the first place. I hate polished and over produced. Anyway that is my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year?","review":"This new release from Thrice is nothing short of stunning, I understand it is a big departure from some of their previous works but for me it is perfect.If you were looking for influences then you could namecheck bands including Cave In, Deftones and Dredg but to be honest Thrice have created a unique sound all of their own.The songs are beautifully crafted with crashing heavy guitars one minute and piano-led melody the next. I must confess to not being a fan of 'screamo' bands but the small amount of screaming on this album somehow fits perfectly with the songs and is almost necessary, the majority of the vocals are melodic and epic which also best decribes the album as a whole.Genuinely this is probably going to be my album of the year, I can't imagine anything coming close to being this good for a long while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is by far one of the most epic releases of 2005, this album has some of the best songs I've hear in quite a while. The first song is like a group screaming \\"we are the image of the invisible!!\\" and the result is great. This cd has just the right number of heavy songs and slower songs. This album just beats anythin that I have heard in a long time. I bought the new hoobastank at the same time and this album is just so much better that I only listened to six songs from hoobastank and ive listened to this album 5 times in 2 days already.The point is this album truly rocks and anyone who considers themselves a fan of rock, punk, metal, or prog should check this album out."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all been said.","review":"Every negative feedback on this album review seems to fit it perfectly. Don't get me wrong I love Thrice and I own their other albums but this album was either extremely out of charector, or it was just awful. I've tried for days to grow to like this album. Not only that but I leant it to 3 friends who are huge fans of thrice as well and they don't even want a COPY of this album. Why steal music you don't want to hear?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I had a nickel for every time I hear someone say...","review":"the more I listen to this album, the better it gets, I'd be rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this","review":"This new album is horrible for a thrice album. I am a big fan of the older stuff and was looking forward to this album for awhile. I saw some good reviews so I decided to buy the cd and I regret it. If I wanted to listen to Radiohead then I would buy a Radiohead album this is not the Thrice any long time fan will like."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Over The Board","review":"Thrice appears to be in that crossroads that many bands face: Do we stay our course or do we veer in a different direction? Unfortunately, Thrice doesn't seem to be sure of which way to turn judging by all the different styles they attempt to employ on this recording.And to make matters worse, if that isn't Skid Row's \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" on the opening track, exactly how much closer could Thrice have come if they did a cover version of it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Thrice?","review":"I've been listening to thrice ever since their debut c.d. came out. they've remained hard-hitting and in your face rock through all their c.d.'s. i noticed on artist in the ambulance a change. not a change like the new c.d. has but still hard-hitting but more singing, more melody in the vocals. it was still awesome. the new c.d. is slow, slow, slow, with the exception for about 2 or 3 songs. the lyrics remain awesome as usual but for the actual music of \\"thrice\\"...i would say people that fell for thrice for their hard sound, ripping guitar riffs, and screams of anger...you wouldn't be too happy with this new one. it's still good, i mean if your feeling depressed but as far as how it compares to the old thrice...they might as well have changed their name and never used the name thrice again."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"IF YOU ARE EXPECTING ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY HEAVY, DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! i cant believe they made us wait almost 2 years for this crap. probably the most disappointing release of the year. this was the only rock band i still listened to (i've moved on to metal/grind/tech metal that sort of thing). Now i cant even enjoy my last guilty pleasure. Thrice, you should be ashamed of yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cave-In Rip Off","review":"If you dig this album just buy Cave-In Until Your Heart stops they were years ahead of these Thrice copy cats. And they are better too. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrice goes Thursday?","review":"...thats what I remember thinking after listening to \\"vheissu\\". I hate thursday, and even though thrice has been compared to thursday in the past, there was almost so similartity. Now there is. If you like coldplay, thursday or radiohead, you'll like this. If you want the REAL thrice sound, get artist, crisis, or safety instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Evolving Band","review":"For many people i know, this album has taken some time to grow on them. After already experiencing a few very innovative follow up albums: Blindside \\"The Great Depression\\", A Static Lullaby \\"Faso Latido\\" and Finch \\"Say Hello to Sunshine\\", which i highly recommend, I was unsurprised when finally hearing Vheissu. But dont get me wrong, this is a completely different album on a different level. As many other reviews have stated, this album is somewhat of a journey, with maybe the best lyrics to date. Thrice created a sound that really says something to me. It fills me with unexplainable joy and completely captivates the soul. I just want to put my two cents in and say, if your an open minded listener or just an old thrice fan then definitely check this album out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing sound...not talent","review":"Well its not what I was expecting. I do like the fact that Dustin actually sings and sings very well, but its just not Thrice to me. Illusion and Artist are still my favorites because they are close in style and music. I miss Teppeis wild runs and Eddies crunching bass riffs. Riley has definetly improved on drums, but the album as a whole just doenst do it for me. I like hardcore and metal that has melody, Im not just a screaming junkie. As far as comparing them to Coldplay...I felt the same way after song 9. Im all about bands maturing and writing better music...but this doesnt sound like Thrice except for a few songs. Ive been with this band since Identity Crisis came out and will remain, but Im just dissapointed with the sound...not the talent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I wouldnt say its really horrible but it kinda sux. Its so boring. I loved,\\"illusion to safety\\" and \\"the artist in the ambulance.\\"Most of the songs are slow. It makes me want to go to sleep. They got way too soft.From the reviews you either like this album or hate it.Most of the old fans of thrice ...do not like it and neither do i."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrice? where are you guys","review":"wtf!!!!!!! what happened to the fast moving punk attitude with the hardcore/ metal approach on illusion of safety, now that album is one of my favorite albums ever, coming from a huge metalhead, and now let me tell you i love alot of soft stuff too, like alot of prog rock and this just sucks i want to hear the old thrice, this is not even progression it sliek they did nothing to these songs theres only one good song, Image of the invisible, now that is some amazing thrice right there, but every other song is garbage, why do none of the other songs have the energy that that song has, amazign singing, chanting, awesome chorus, guitar, i tried for days now to listen to this and see what its all about but there not even the same badn anymore, the last album rapes this, and that one is kinda diff too but still thrice, this is just BOREFEST"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where'd the rock go?","review":"Dissapointing after \\"image of the invisable\\". The rest of the disc is slow. I understand an artists right to make the album the way they truly wanted to with time taken to get it just the way they invision it, which is explained in detail with a booklet with the cd, but I'd rather they have had the deadline pressure and made another Artist in the Ambulance or Illusion of Safety. Did they have to include a piano intro in almost every song on the album? Maybe the songs will grow on me, but they will never feel like the good old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened????","review":"If you were expecting anything resembling any of Thrice's previous works.....then you will be severly disappointed. Gone are the fast drum beats and awesome guitar work replaced with slow repetitive songs. The only resemblence between this album and old Thrice are the great lyrics. I'm all for change and all but this is something completely different and is in no way experimental in any way contrary to what the album is being marketed as. If I wanted to listen to a Radiohead or Coldplay album (which I would definitly NOT want to) I would have done that instead. The only saving grace of this album are the songs Music Box, Image of the Invisible, and Red Sky and that is why this album did not get one star.I still support Thrice nonetheless and really do wish them the best because they are really great people, I just wish they hadn't come out with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very new and experimental","review":"This is what I love and look for in bands and solo artist. Their ability to go out and over the horizon of their standard sound but not to the point where it's altered into a totally different sound - although that can be very beneficial for a band, i.e. Pantera Hair/Glam metal to Thrash. Vheissu no doubt sounds different from the previous albums but in my opinion it just adds more flavor and color to Thrice. I've read a review that states this is the end of something special, I don't think so - I think this album is special. When I listen to Vheissu I just let it play through because all the tracks are that good. All the songs express certain moods to me and shines with different colors that are just beautiful. A blend of hardcore, punk rock, progressive music, hint of Metal and a touch of radiohead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using Old Analog Televuisions","review":"I just bought this Toshiba television used, including a digital-analog converter and antenna. $20 off Craiglist.Kind of sad, really.

Now the fu in this movie i would compare to monkey with 72 magic it's just that there really is no fighting. Maybe 2 minutes at most, and a good 10 seconds with simon yuen. Monkey at least had a lot fo fights even though they all sucked. But the story itself in here is extremely dreadful and hwo it got released without at least a commentary on it, I don't know.

For anyone who has not heard her sing, this is a great introduction to someone who is going to the top! I love every song on this CD, but I guess my favorite has to be \\"Let Go, Let God\\". Her rendition of Mercy Me's \\"I Can Only Imagine\\" shows that she can add her own unique style to a song! With a rousing, upbeat, uptempo rhythm, and with her powerful voice, she makes you want to get up and clap and dance with this number. Included in this album, are some soft, slow, soul-touching gospels mixed in the fast \\"makes you wanna dance and clap\\" performances. I give this album 5 stars!!!

I thoroughly enjoyed how drawn in I was to the descriptive ways the author pulled me in, with the glamorous hotels and yet within the same chapter the disdain of a jail cell in Las Vegas. The characters were intriguing and well thought out. The only critique I would mention was how quickly the ending came to a close, but overall I found the reading well written and thoughtfully researched. I would recommend it to all, especially anyone who enjoys trial mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far the Best","review":"This is quite a step forward for this series of mysteries. The writing is better than it has been. The mystery is intriguing in that it is told with great detail with regards to the defense team's efforts to prove Jessica's friend guilty.

Oh, what a disappointment to see the franchise ruined by tedious and all to common car chases and fight sequences. Ethan Hunt is too smart to get into a fight such as the one in the climax of this movie. Where is the intrigue, the espionage, the thinking man's Ethan Hunt? Apart from the cool opening sequence there is little in my opinion to redeem this movie. The Producer made a fatal mistake in getting John Woo to Direct this movie. Whereas Mission Impossible 1 is firmly entrenched in my DVD collection, the sequel will not be viewed again by this reviewer. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? How?

This isn't mission impossible style, it's action crap that doesn't make much sense and was a waste of people's money. How in God's name did this movie do so well, better than the Perfect Storm and that was a wet piece of garbage too. It did twice as good as X-Men and that movie was amazing...action combined with good story-telling. I want to let everyone know that if you're planning on buying this, I feel sorry for you and your hard earned money. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I am so disappointed at this movie. The reason I give it 2 stars is that it is a John Woo movie with our \\"pretty\\" boy Tom in it. The plot is straight and simple, and the fight scenes are not up to the standard of John Woo's previous movies. One note is that John Woo is not good at directing hand-to-hand combat scenes. And the gun battle in this movie really sucks. If you are a Woo's fan, then go see other movies like A Better Tomorrow 1&2, The Killer, Hard Boiled, Hard Target, and Face Off. If these are unavailable, then go watch The Replacement Killer and Broken Arrow. For those of you whimps used to watching sissy movies like The Titanic and The Wedding Planner, you might find it \\"action-thrilled.\\" If you aren't that type, there are certainly better John Woo movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear...","review":"High hopes for this one were dashed by a awfully weak plot. Cruise is not too bad and holds his character well, along with fairly decent acting from his co-actors. But Acting is not the downfall of this film. It is fair to say that people who will watch this will be the Action/Adventure james Bond watchers. But this is not James Bond. Action/Adventure, barely. There are some impressive special effects which go someway to mask the poor plot line, but it eventually shines through. The use of the Rubber Face-Masks to confuse the enemy is done 10 times too many. Watch the original, or any James Bond movie instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loads of style but no content","review":"The opening scenes were quite impressive but one soon got bored with the tiresome trademarks of Woo imagery, slow mo poses and fire leaping. It was a film made by Tom Cruise for Tom Cruise; A portfolio of scenes starring him rather than a film as we know it. The plot was pretty basic and somewhat neglected (see aforementioned Woo imagery) and the ending was weaker than an American beer. TOP TIP: Save your money and wait for the TV release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Hollywood \\"Blockbuster\\"","review":"Here it is at its finest, the typical hollywood \\"pre-fab\\" movie. Boy meets girl. Boy-Girl falls in love. Girl gets herself into dangerous situation. Boy rescues girl and saves the world in the process. BOO TO MR WOO! This movie was one of the most predictable movies to date. I'll give mine away if you pay the shipping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just an action movie","review":"People need to calm down and look at this movie as it really is...an action movie. Of course the stunts aren't realistic and the love story is pretty cheesy, but that's the magic of movies. The movie supplies wonderful eye candy and you can't help but love or hate the characters. Get this movie and sit back, relax and soak in the magic of John Woo."},{"rating":"1","title":"m:i-2","review":"This movie does not compare with it's predecessor, the plot is very cheesy, and the love scenes even cheesier (especially that terrible car twirling scene). The action sequences are nice and tight, but that is all that John Woo knows how to do well. The entire movie is laid out, and predictable; which on the other hand, being what made the first one so good (all the back and forth temporal activity, much like a Pulp Fiction style). Worst of all, this movie has the feel that is was just made to make money, and boost Tom Cruises ego, stardom, and bank account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie 3 stars - Streaming 2 stars","review":"Saw MI-1 and somewhat believable but this was all about action stunts which were pretty good but way over the top bordering stupid. Too many super close ups of Tom Cruise and not enough of his hottie co-star.I would have given three stars but Amazon streaming and picture quality not very good. I purchased HD version and several times movie stopped citing bandwidth but never have this issue using Apple TV, Hulu, or others."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrilling","review":"All right, so it has a plot-line that is more than 35% recycled. The cinematography (especially the symbolic effects, such as the white doves, etc.) is stunning. And when isn't a good shoot-'em-out thriller a good thing? I found this film better than its predecessor; it has more of a connected storyline and is not as confusing. It has some nice touches, and the action sequences are shocking, exciting, and often suspenseful. While it isn't a seriously \\"great\\" film, it's better than most sequels and is a great ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rubbish!","review":"I have to admit, I am not an 'action movie' person, but I HAD quite enjoyed 'Mission Impossible 1', and thought the sequal might be vaguely entertaining.It wasn't.The plot involved secret potions, killer viruses, test tubes and these 'mask' things which people would sport to look like OTHER people, fooling them completely even whilst KISSING!In short - this movie was absurd. The 'fight scenes' went on FOREVER (no, really - for EVER!), and it was all just very silly and rather pointless.The best thing I can say about this movie is that the soundtrack had a pretty cooking bass line...and that Tom Cruise has REALLY good hair in it!Sorry, Amazon - but I've got to tell it like it is: Mission Impossible 2 is total rubbish (but I'd LOVE to know what sort of conditioner that Cruise guy is using!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad!","review":"After I heard that John Woo was going to be making Mission Impossible 2. I new that it would be all action and no plot. Boy was I right and everyone else out there who predicted the same. I understand that movies are here for us to enjoy. But I predicted 98% of this film. The chase on the mountain with the car was ok but the motorcycle chase was totally unbelievable. Cruise is not at all believeable enough, to be able to flip a gun up in the air from the sand with his foot like he did at the end. I did not enjoy this film from the begining. The acting was cheap and bad. Only Anthony Hopkins was good. The sound and special effects were also bad. Grade:D+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusually dissapointing","review":"Although a usual fan of both Cruise and Woo I found myself fighting the urge to leave midway through the movie. As incredible as Woo may be in his gravity defying stunts (half the stunts could win the high jump in the Olympics), this movie was just a bit much. I loved Face Off, but MI2 has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Boring plot, bad dialog, no charismatic acting, a general bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woo is me for having seen this film....","review":"I can never get back my $8.50 ticket price, or the two hours I spent in the theatre watching this, but perhaps I can save you from the same fate.While it has some decent action sequences, the weak plot and utterly pathetic dialog (with lines like \\"God, you're beautiful\\" at the forefront of key moments) make it truly painful to watch.I couldn't bring myself to actually leave the theatre, always hoping to find something redeeming in this film, but it never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"woo - the master of sedation","review":"Those who have seen this film know the gargantuan task Woo presents the viewer - staying awake. Nevertheless, you really have to hand it to Woo. He somehow manages to avoid delivering on the fundamental promise of the \\"action\\" genre - excitement and thrills - while simultaneously maintaining legions of adoring fans. The objective viewer, of course, calls it like it is - trash. And here's the capper - the DVD promises 45 extra minutes of Woo. I would have thought the marketing folks would want to keep quiet about this little tidbit.For those of you who do like Woo, here's a Woo-it-yourself tip: take any actual action movie, and right at the critical moments of excitement, just when you start to get that edge-of-your-seat feeling, play it in super-slo-mo. When you feel all that exhiliration drain away, you'll know you've done it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu Ray - Rocks!","review":"Having seen other blu ray reviews of this film, I actually decided to replace my original SD version with the blu ray one. I am very highly pleased; the blu ray transfer is very well done and a worthy addition to any BR collection. Unlike many other reviewers, I enjoy this movie tremendously. Sure its tom cruise and all of his scientology sillyness, but like it or not, he's pretty effective in these types of roles. Anyway, good BR, great video and great audio. Definitely worth an upgrade if you enjoy this movie anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"WooHoo!","review":"Once again, John Woo directs a masterpiece. Forget plot, forget actors, instead focus on the beauty within each camera frame. Mr Woo's style is perfect in form and pleasing to the eye. Watch the picture, see the use of symbolism, the fight between good and evil and the heroe's triumph.The movie's plot did lag in the middle, but spectacular special effects and coreographed violence made it all worth it. Villians are a dime a dozen and only few stand out in our mind. This one does not quite do it, however. Tom cruise and his She-ra in the movie struggled through their lines. But remember that movies are not just actors and dialogue, they tell a story. This movie could have just had pictures and music and the story would been told just the same.Surely not the best John Woo film out there, but a masterpiece as only he can deliver. Thanks Mr Woo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF GARBAGE","review":"MI2 is a piece of garbage. Even watching it with your brain turned off, you can't enjoy this lame \\"action\\" movie, where TOm Cruise destroyed Ethan Hunt's character forever, where the bad guy is a joke, where there's no chemistry between Cruise and the female main character, where the action sequence are all in slow motion; where the face-mask device is repeated thousand times; whre everything smells \\"money!!\\". This is the lowest point in Cruise's career, but apparently he did it for the doubtful pleasure of working with \\"genius\\" director John Woo..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Janus Factor","review":"This movie is not exactly in the true spirit of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. However, it contains some of the best action shots ever placed on celluloid. Woo basically takes a skeleton plot and does wonders with it. Over time I have felt that the action scenes in this film more than compensate for the implausibility of some of the plot elements. Perhaps it isn't exactly your father's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. Further still, it is not mission implausible, it is MISSION IMPOSSIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woo hoo!!!","review":"First of all, I would like to say that if you thought this movie was boring, stop drinking! It was full of action, romance, and suspense. I loved it. Who cares about the slow mo's I barely noticed it. I like the romance between Ethan Hunt and Nyah Hall. Mr. Woo did a great job. Mr. Cruise did a great job. I go to the movies to be entertained. I don't go to dissect every aspect of the fricken' movie, if you do that, how can you enjoy it. Great flick!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"good movie. cheesy at times. many of the stunts seem impossible to pull off, but the shots are awesome. does anyone know who is singing when Ethan Hunt(Tom Cruise) is rock climbing in the begining"},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE CRAP!","review":"This movie stinks! The acting is average, the directing is good but bad for John Woo's average. Why so many close-ups?? There wasn't that much action until the end. The scene at the lab, very similar to M:I1 and if that was supposed to be one of the first action scenes why fill it with slow motion?? The story was a bit similar to the X-Files movie! The thing with the virus and the female lead infected with it and the male lead saving her. (In my opinion the X-Files: FTF was much better) - Also there are many cliches in this movie, predictable. In total, terrible movie. Be sure to expect after the success of this in a couple of years M:I3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab a beer, sit back, and enjoy!","review":"...This my friends is what we like to call an \\"entertaining\\" film! Please tell me why films were first invented?... To entertain us! Not for us to go \\"Well thats not very realistic!\\" Let your self go for christ sake!! This is a good all round film. You have great action, lush locations, beautiful lady (and Tommy boy for the ladies!), and lots more. The thing is about most of the other reviewers is that they have a serious look on the film. Its John Woo! Expect great action, fantastic cinematography, and a fast pase! So what if the first one was beliveable with a better story line! It makes the two nice and different! Don't get me wrong the first was better but don't take movies so seriously! I dont want to talk about the plot though. I find it far better to watch a movie when you know little or nothing about it! So enjoy! It looks great, it sounds great, and it is great! Thats all you need to know my friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible acting and no story ruin the good effects.","review":"What an awful waste of time. Tom Cruise did a better acting job in Risky Business. There was some good visual stuff, but it just doesn't salvage the non-existant story and all around bad acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"like unto caddyshack 2","review":"the first mission impossible film is without a doubt one of my favorite films to date. ive seen it countless times and bought it on dvd th first chance i got. i went in the theatre expecting another excellent movie experience with plot twists and turns all over...but instead i was met with a trite action storyline based on nothing in particular which resembled absolutely nothing of the original film. i will never, ever watch another john woo film and i feel very let down by tom cruise on this one.i couldnt believe i actually fronted $7 to see this movie, ugh, i left early after cracking up at its idiocy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's not miss the point","review":"This film is an excellent melding of the Mission Impossible genre with John Woo's directing style. It is beautifully filmed with superb choreography. A lot of people seem to be putting it down for its outlandish action situations and sequences. For me this is the essence of an \\"impossible mission\\" and brought me back to watching the original Mission Impossible as a young boy in a way which the first MI didn't come close. In my view, one for the collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Mission: Impossible","review":"When they teamed up Woo and Cruise to make this movie, they should have just called in something else. They eliminated almost all of the M:I team, leaving only Vinge Rhames to play 10 minutes on the screen. This is a Cruise-fest, plain and simple. And Woo's insipid filming technique, which for the most part does work in martial arts only movies, falls on its face. In a story that is supposed to be somewhat believable, we watch Cruise and cast complete hilarious stunts including a midair chest to chest impact of Cruise and baddie going at about 60 mph (120 mph impact) each. Please! And the repetitive use of rubber masks, upon rubber masks became boring, trite, and downright stupid after awhile. If they would have titled this movie something completely different, I would probably like it more. But this IS NOT Mission: Impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"What a disapointment this movie was. I used to love MI as a kid and it was built around the team concept. Where is the MI team here? This is nothing but Tom Cruise doing dangerous stuff. (That should be the name of it!) Granted the action scenes were well done but so long and added nothing to the movie. It appears Mr. Cruise wants to be a poorly acted James Bond. Well if that was where he was going he got there. My recommendation! Rent it don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"All right well first off I absolutely hated this movie because the whole story was completely unrealistic. In particular, when Ethan Hunt and another guy are riding motorcycles at 80 mph and then jump and hit each other and then get up without a broken bone or anything. The next one is where he is scaling the rock ledge without any ropes. Some people probably think he is a real cool action hero sort of guy, when actually he is a complete idiot for first off climbing without ropes and second climbing up a wall of sandstone, which is one of the weakest and most likey to break sort of rocks. Overall there are plenty more unrealistic stunts in this movie which are supposed to come out has action packed but really are stupid and unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Sequel","review":"This has to be one of John Woo's poorest offerings to date, and his trademark scenes are becoming ever more repetetive in successive films. Perhaps the abundance of hype surrounding the cinematic release of this movie, really didn't do it any favours, as it never lived up to expectations. The sad fact is that a talented ensemble cast and great SFX, have been nullified by a storyline that could have been written on the back of a stamp. Even the super quality of DVD, the sexy Nyah, torrid chase and action scenes can't save this movie from a lame script. Not half as good as the first movie, which in itself was something of a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its So Bad Its.......Bad","review":"What a steaming pile of .... this is. I thought Tom Cruise was better at choosing his projects but this is a return to his Days of Thunders/Cocktail days. The movie is just so high on itself. The scene where the two motorcycles fly up in the air while the two \\"heroes\\" fight belongs in a cartoon. Don't get me wrong I like dumb cartoonish movies like Starship Troopers but John Woo takes this movie too seriously. Even Anthony Hopkins's eyes (his cameo) were missing his usual fire.Some people in Hollywood are WAY OVERPAID."},{"rating":"1","title":"High On Action, Low On Everything Else","review":"Mission Impossible II was a movie that was good on action and low on everything else. John Woo's great action sequences are second to none and should be well applauded. The story line of this movie though completely sucked. This movie should have been called, \\"John Woo presents: Ethan Hunt and his worthless team-mates and foes. Ving's Rhames performance was almost as non-existence as Halle Berry's in \\"X-Men\\". And I \`am sorry but, Dougray Scott did not make a believable villain. How this movie grossed so much money I'll never know. This was almost as bad as watching \\"The Perfect Storm\\"...almost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Action Film of the Summer....","review":"Mission Impossible 2 is the best action movie I saw allsummer. ... . The plot of M:I 2 is excellent, but even if the plot wasn't there, it has some of the best action scenes ever. Probobly has the best motorcycle chase scene. Cruise is the perfect star to play Ethan Hunt and the girl in the film would beat among the best Bond girls. See this now! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mission Impossible 2 Directed by ... Tom Cruise?","review":"This has got to be the worst John Woo movie I've seen since Broken Arrow. I really don't understand why this movie didn't do anothing for me, but I was on the verge of falling asleep through the whole thing. No action sequence for about 1 hour and 15 minutes? This isn't Woo! When I go see a John Woo film, I go to see the cinematic gunplay and the beautiful camera work. The camera work is there, but the action is absent until the end of the film. I won't go on much longer, but it seemed to me John Woo took a back seat to Tom Cruise, who was directing himself .......... Sigh, another disappointment in a long line of disappointments. At least one good thing came from this film -- the makers of X-Men fired Dougray Scott because he had to finish filming this movie and they got Hugh Jackman (kudos!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have done a video clip instead","review":"This movie is ridiculous. I went to see it because of the good reviews it had when it opened in theatres, and because of the theatrical trailer I had seen. But that was it. This would have been a good piece of work for a five minutes video-clip, with the music, Tom Cruise's hair blowing in the wind while flying with his motorcycle, and the excellent cinematography and slow motion sequences. But a movie based on that? Come on. It is a shame, because I was begining to respect Tom Cruise's career as an actor, with some great films he made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This film is great. It gave brillant special effects and without John Woo's new taste of film making we would never have experienced this. The only downside to this film was the music, it was in all the wrong places and thats where I believe it lost a star.If you have not seen it, SEE ITEnjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Chan or Tom Cruise?","review":"This film did not live up to it's billing. I went to the theatre wanting to see \\"Mission Impossible,\\" but was forced to settle for little more than Jackie Chan.The story line and plot were descent, the execution of it was farless than! If you are in the mood for quasi-martial arts, this is your flick. If are interested in high-tech gadgets and gizmos that are synonomous with \\"Mission Impossible,\\" better look elsewhere.In fact the only thing impossible about the movie in general was the fight scene at the end. Could it have possible been longer, more unreal, or more unlike what \\"Mission Impossible II\\" should have been?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ohh Dear......","review":"...Mr Woo is well known for his flashy camera work but he went abit over the top with this film. Impossible shouldn't mean completely unbelievable. The effects are, as you might expect, excellent and all the actors do a passable job under the circumstances. I have quite enjoyed some of John Woo's previous movies but feel this film would have been a lot a better under someone else's direction (Renny Harlin maybe). My advice is try before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity about the plot","review":"This is a example of how special effects has been taking over films rather than acting. Don't get me wrong i love big budget action scenes but it helps to have a plot. Its clear that the plot has been written to fit around the action sequences not vice versa. Lets hope there is no M:I3"},{"rating":"1","title":"For DVD...","review":"THE MOVIE KICK@SS!!!! HOWEVER, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD... STICK WITH PREVIOUS 1 Disc Set DVD... It's exactly same DVD except...

It looks better on blu ray but I had to sell this after I watched it because it's just a bad movie. Imo, tom cruise is actually a good actor, he was great in several movies too but this series is just another bad secret agent movie which can't even find decent villians to fight. Hollywood made money on this one because cruise was in it but most people will not like this flick after they see it. Why not come up with villians we can relate too? evil madmen , cults, evil drug gangs, communists , far right fanatics, muslim or other relgious fanatics. but not another evil agent flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Begs for a negative rating","review":"This is the type of movie that is so bad that it can't be rated. You'd think that with endless millions to spend, someone could be found to think up a creative plot. The same old tired worn out killer virus and the whole planet will die theme--ugh. Then the face masks used over and over and over. Duh, doesn't anyone notice that even though these people have the same face, they're not the same size as the real ones? When Ambrose disguises himself as hunt, didn't Nyah notice that there was a slight difference in height? The script also liberally borrowed from a number of other movies, including the Matrix, among others.All in all, something to avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent Sequel - Must be an Impossible Mission","review":"There was no plot, very little character development and even the special effects weren't very impressive.

Tom Cruise just mopes around and stares. After his brilliant turn in \\"Magnolia\\", I expected so much better of him. I also expected better from John Woo. Man, this movie really dissapointed me. I could forgive the incoherent plot if the actors would've shown a little bit of enthusiasm and excitement for the project they were working on. Even the action sequences were a dissapointment. Just by-the-books stuff. Nothing new. Nothing spectacular. I highly do not reccommend this. Even if you are an avid action fan, this is a real letdown...."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY BAD sequel -- get the first one insead","review":"Mediocre story, too much hype, and dismal acting (Tom, what were you thinking??), made this one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. Thank god I didn't buy this one or pay full price at the theater... I was very close to doing that based on the merits of the first one.In a way it's a fitting followup ... take everything that made the first movie work (gritty action, special effects, suspense) and show how NOT to do it. Trust me -- rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great failure of a movie...","review":"MI2 is simply a bad movie. It is classified as an action movie but really most of it is not action, just bad dialogue. MI2's premise is not bad, Hunt trying to recover a deadly strain of influenza from his arch enemy, but it is all just flushed down the toilet. There is some action, but in no way does this film compare to its predecessor, very disappointing considering it was directed by one of the very best action directors of all time, John Woo. If you are a serious fan of MI or a Cruise fanatic then rent this (certainly don't buy it), however for casual fans of action films, you can do better by just watching the original again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a little while to pick up but ends up action packed!","review":"The first mission impossible movie didnt really stick in my mind that well, and wasnt to great. When the movie started I knew this would be a heck of a lot better than part 1. But I was sent through a roller coaster of ideas before I actually settled down and got into the movie. The begining is action packed but seriously slows down for about a half hour with a lot of story build up. But I felt that once they were attempting the break in this movie seriously picked up the pace. The action scenes were simply amazing with stunts that were mind boggleing. This movie definitly makes up the begining with heart pounding action through the final half of the movie. The acting is superb and all the characters are believable. I also though Cruz did an awesome job of learning a little martial arts for the movie. This movie might not be watched over and over but I highly suggest you check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feature-rich DVD.","review":"This DVD is feature packed with:* behind the scene looks of how each of the major stunts were performed. (And I was amazed to see how many of the actual scenes Tom Cruise performed himself. The final mano-a-mano showdown with the leap and cartwheel kicks were actually performed by him as well.)* a DVD-ROM section if your computer is hooked up to the internet* an MTV spoof by Ben Stiller with him as stuntman/double Tom Crooze. It's hilarious.* a Metallica music video \\"I Disappear\\"* commentaries from Ang Lee (explaining a lot of the motivations behind why he chose to film certain scenes the way he did), Robert Towne (the writer), Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner (producers), and the other actors/actresses in the film. It was both educational and fun to watch.On top of that you get the two hour film in crystal clear quality. What more could you ask for!I highly recommend adding this to the Action section of your DVD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Movie","review":"I saw this movie in theaters the first day it came out. It was a little slow in the middle, but had some great action sceanes at the end. I'm glad they are putting the Metallica , I Dissapear video on the DVD, but why arn't they putting the Limp Bizkit Take a Look Around(MI-2 Theme) on it. I just watched the Take a look around video and thought it is so much cooler than the I dissappear video. If they included the Limp Bizkit video, this would get 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty Of A Film","review":"As a diehard fan of the original television show Mission: Impossible, I was appalled by what Tom Cruise and John Woo have done to this once-honorable franchise. They took what was a subtle, creative, sophisticated package and turned it into a completely generic action movie. Mission: Impossible was about outwitting the enemy--in this travesty of a movie, any enemy who gets in Cruise's way is simply killed--Pathetic and generic. To top it all off, Cruise and Woo are obsessed with gunplay throughout the movie, something the producers and directors of the original television series INTENTIONALLY did not use. They wanted their characters to THINK their way out of situations--Woo and Cruise just shoot everything until somthing works. I had high hopes for the potential movie series after the first one came out, but I will NOT be seeing any others--I'll just go watch Face/Off again (A MUCH better John Woo movie....)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I taught this move was good. There was allot of action and it keep you alert to see whats going on next. I really taught this one was way better than the original MI1. The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because the fake mask making crap kinda cheated throgh the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"..i thought it was good movie...","review":"From the other reviews I've read, I can see this movie will not sell very good. I liked it, in the beginning it was boring, and pointless, but then when Ethan sneeks in that big building to get back the virus thing, thats were it really gets intersting. I think this movie was more about the relationship of ethan and maiya, or whatever her name was, since towards the end you can see how ethan wants to rescue her from being killed by that virus. I didn't mind, I liked that. I think if you are really intersted in buying this movie you should, although I would recommend more that you rent it, and see what you think. I'm sure if you really want it, you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst kind of ripoff","review":"Remember the days when you were writing term papers and realized that every third sentence was a quote, so you started parephrasing, but it just didn't sound as smooth? Well this is what this movie does. I am amazed that the scriptwriter has the guts to claim this as his own. He ripped off the scipt from Hitchcock's \\"Notorious.\\" Of course he changed the Nazi's trying to get their hands on uranium to the \\"evil greedy corporations\\" trying to get their hands on a deadly virus only they had a cure for, but the rest is the same. My favorite part came on the \\"making off\\" part, where Tom Cruise talks about how good and original the writing is. It made me gag.To be fair the special effects and the stunts are good, but I think they might have plyed better on a video game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"John Woo is one of my favourite directors. Face/Off is probably one of the best five films ever made. But this is just awful, lacking all the elements which made Face/Off what it was - the strong story and the human element, not just the spectacular action sequences.M:I 2 is just a money-making machine. The story is just another Bond-film reject script which won't hold your interest past the first ten minutes. And the film is full - completely full - of blatant product placement.But. It's still got some decent John Woo action sequences. So it's not a total failure. But it comes close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy the journey","review":"Let's take this movie into perspective. It's Mission Impossible 2...not the first...or the last. They're laying it out like the television series. Each episode is different. Each movie will be different and have a different feel to it...a different flavor. We can't be too critical about how it was compared to the previous film. The next one will be different still. Enjoy the movie for what it is. A journey into a world that most of us can't go. The cinematography was very Woo. It was fast paced and blended well with the soundtrack that accompanied it. The acting was well done and the story may not have been completely original...but it is still fun to see all the action that takes place from beginning to end. Buy this movie to have a good time and enjoy what these people have worked so hard to create for the audience. A good cutting-edge cinimatic adventure film with loud music and exciting new stunts never before seen on film. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN ! Another \\"Cruise Tribute to Cruise\\"","review":"The opening was beyond belief! The photography was spectacular and the stunts so unbelievable as to be, well, impossible. Of course, if you're a die-hard Cruise fan, \\"acting\\" or plausability are not material. The first hour was better than sleeping pills. The last parts had some pretty good (visually) scenes although still only designed as a tribute to the demigod Cruise. Everything else was just dumb. Glad I only rented this one and with a coupon... better yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRUISE IN HIS WORST PERFORMANCE EVER.","review":"It will be a while before I watch another Tom Cruise movie again, because the dissapointment I felt after watching this movie is unbeliavable. First: Cruise destroyed Ethan Hunt, the TV-series character didn't deserve that. 2) The chemistry between Cruise and Thadie NEwton is non-existant. 3) Most action sequences are laughable, ludicrous - the car chase with the female thief, the moutain-climbing without hopes, the jump from the motorcycles, with the two \\"macho\\" men clashing chest agaisnt chest in mid-air; 4) The mask subject is repeated over and over until it becomes a joke; 5) The coldness of the movie is so shocking, it makes clear the totally formulatic concept of the movie; 6) Hopkins presence is a farse, so brief it is.If all of these motives are not enough to make this movie a turkey, then I don't know nothing at all. I repeat: even watching this as a brainless action-adrenaline movie, it's a horrible motion picture, ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a ridicously boring movie that pays more attention to action and stunts (and trying to make them dramatic by playing them in slow motion) than to a strong plot. While the first was an exciting spy movie this is meant to be an action thriller that is boring and predictable. Whoever wrote up this movie must have been high at the time, and Tom Cast and the cast deliver a poor performance. Short and simple, MI2 is a huge disappointment. Don't waste your money. Buy the first one if youd don't have it. While this is a one star flop Mission Impossible 1 is a magnificent, well written, well acted classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, could be better (though it may be impossible)","review":"I enjoyed Mission: Impossible 2 a lot. The plot was good, there were many surprises, the action was well set, the script was good, the chick was hot, and the soundtrack is my absolute favorite I have heard. The one thing which I think could be better was Tom Cruise. Sure, he is good for action and all the girls think he is good looking. But, he is just not like the original series actors. Such as, when he got the surprise rocket in the beginning, he didn't treat it like it was anything. I think he should have been really surprised, much more than he was. And later, when he was told to go in to the building with the time locked door plates, he took it the wrong way. He should have been more afraid yet cool of the idea, instead of, \\"Sure, I can.\\" Beyond that, it was a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woo drops the ball","review":"Am I the only one who thinks that John Woo is overrated? I have enjoyed many of his films, but he has become a parody of himself. In any given John Woo film, you are sure to see doves fluttering through the air, a stand-off between two protagonists simultaneously pointing guns at each other, a woman whose only real reason for being in the film is to form a triangle with said protagonists, far too much slow motion photography and a healthy dose of obvious religious imagery that has little, if anything, to do with the story. This time around, I just couldn't work up any interest in what I was seeing. It all felt so tired and old. And that motorcycle duel belongs on a short list of the most ludicrous action sequences I have ever seen. This film is only for those who believe that Woo can do no wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm ashamed to admit I own this DVD","review":"It truely is THAT bad. I generally catch the majority of movies at home on DVD. It's worth it to me just to buy it and not go through the trouble of renting. I wish I had rented this one. The plot is idiotic and contrived. The whole way through the movie I was telling myself, \\"Ok it'll change gears in a minute and all this BS will have been some type of foundation for what comes ahead.\\" Wrong. This is by far the worst movie I'd watched in 2000. If you have sooo much time and your hands and are bored to tears with absolutely no way to entertain yourself ( no paint drying or grass growing anywhere to watch ) then buy it but be ready to turn it off as soon as somebody starts painting. Also have a good hiding place for it so it isn't visible in your collection else you suffer the embarassment of owning this pathetic excuse for a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mission: Dumb-Dumb-Dumb 2","review":"Not unlike its predecessor from 1996, M:I-2 suffers from a poor script and wasted talent. Admittedly, the cinematography and action sequences are very appealing, yet the entire movie seems to go nowhere with the plot. I for one like edge-of-your-seat action AND a good story to hold the movie together. The dialogue here is flat and pointless. Director John Woo does a good job of handling the incredible stunts, but has little expertise in supervising the acting. As much as Tom Cruise toughened up for his return to the role of Ethan Hunt, and regardless of how much money it made at the box office, M:I-2 is best described as a high-priced video game. Plenty of action mixed with a lot of boring filler. No wonder I keep humming to myself \\"dumb-dumb-dumb...\\" Sadly, I suspect M:I-3 is just around the corner though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"This movie really stunk !!!

But the result is vastly different. Notorious doesn't rely on high-tech props or unbelievable stunts - just pure good acting and suspense like only Hitchcock can do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"overachieving action flop","review":"This has be one of the worst movies ever made. The prolonged slow motion fighting scenes, the sentimental music, the pathetic apperance of Anthony Hopkins playing the cliched older wise man. All these things combined produce strong vomit reflexes in my gut. When Tom Cruise and his enemy charge at each other as in a joust on motorcycles and then leap off them to land on top of each other the unintentional guy on guy action oozes all over the screen. And when the movie ends with children carrying baloons i know that i have wasted precious timw with this garbage.unfortunatley metallica sells out and lends their music to this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"fails the trade descriptions act..","review":"..which is a statute we have in the U.K., no doubt you have something similar.The main thing to say about MI2 is that, like the first one, it isn't a Mission Impossible story. Mission Impossible, to me, is a caper story, premised on impossible, or at least highly unfeasible missions, carried out by a team. This film, like the first one (which starts by wiping out the team almost as soon as they've been established with the viewer) has a couple of fairly bland henchmen with gadgets and that's all. A film almost entirely about Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt's chiselled features, death-defying acrobatics and intrepid duelling with the chief villain, whatever its own merits, is simply not true to the premise of (or what was so good about) the show we remember from way back when. So don't call it Mission Impossible. Call it the Man With The Golden Grin."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO STOMACH IT WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE","review":"Here's the biggest disappointment of the 2000 movie season. I really enjoyed Mission Impossible 1 and was looking forward to another plot twisting and action packed movie. Instead I saw an semi-action packed non-twisting movie that just didn't seem to live up to any of the hype surrounding its release. Would someone please slap John Woo and tell him to knock it off with the slow motion scenes? If it wasn't for the first mission impossible success I don't think half the people who went and saw the sequel would have gone. I still don't know why I bought this movie. It was part of a large order that I had a $20 coupon for. It's an entertaining movie (until it gets just too unrealistic) for a large group of people, but you can't sit and watch it by yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action","review":"I liked this movie a lot the action and effects are great.

Tom Cruise, a usually competent actor, gives a sub-par performance, but manages to look pretty through harrowing action sequences. Depth in a performance is achieved only by Thandie Newton, who isn't really seen much in the film, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Horror!

What was going through the producers heads when shooting this thing ? Only money, I guess ... There was a way of making a better folloup than this tragedy here: I think Cruise, Woo and the others could just sit in front of theirs VCR's or DVD's and watch the first movie... People that are saying that this is better than the first must be John Woo diehard fans, forgetting to see the truth, which is: this is one of the worst story lines ever made on screen, on the same level of the worst Van Damme's movies !! With one big difference: TOm Cruise is on it. I can't believe it.

Obviously Tom Cruise et al think that it is about himself, overblown action sequences, himself, zero plot and err... himself. Come to think of it, both M:I movies had the bad guy as a former IMF agent (hmm, we seem to be struggling for a storyline here) The sad fact is that for and action movie, M:I 2 is boring.

I thought that there would be interesting action sequences thanks to John Woo, I was right. But, as we have all learned, in this day and age you can not make a movie with just a bunch of special effects. There has to be some sort of a plot to make me want to sit through a film like this. Alas there was none. It was like a second rate bond film. The difference is that in Bond films they do not pull off their faces constantly. What was that all about. It was cool the first couple of times, but after that i only tired of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stuggle to watch.","review":"This movie is bad. I can't believe that this is the best that they could come up with for a sequel. Good effects and stunts are only good when they are believable in the context of the story.

On TV they talked about this movie all the time, they said it would be something very cool... but finally I saw it. What can I say. This movie is like a James Bond movie (it has no normal story... just tricks, stupid monologues... and sefety of the world is in hands of one man). But when we talk about James Bond movies we can say that they should be with only tricks and the destiny of the world depends on one man. Tom Cruise is a very very very good actor but why did he do that??? Or maybe he haven't read the script before saying YES? Who knows. I can say just one thing - this movie is not for pleasure to watch, it is for giving our money for such low-grade movie. If you want to buy this - think. Maybe you'd better offer Magnolia or Eyes Wide Shut...

First of all, the makers of the first MI dared to do the unthinkable...they not only killed Jim Phelps, but they made him the bad guy... talk about sacrilege! Now, in MI:2, they take what could be a fantastic franchise, add a terrible plot, throw in some bad actors (excluding Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins) and \\"spice\\" it up with Mortal Kombat Kung-Fu moves expecting it to be a good movie...well, how about no? Garbage. That's about all this movie is. Utter garbage. I would much rather watch the old tv show. The ONLY positive thing I have to say is that Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins were in this one...acting very well as usual. As for the rest of the movie...what a let down! We miss you Mr. Graves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you an idiot who enjoys being insulted? Then buy this!","review":"This is crap-ola. John Woo, who really should direct music videos and leave feature films alone, shoots a flick full of slow motion, fire, guns, more slow motion, insultingly improbable stunts (come on, the magic-tired-motorcycle that Tom Cruise can skate beside wearing boots and, when he tires of that, he can shoot backward, aiming with the side mirror?), clothing changes with a speed Clark Kent would envy, and hardcore heroes who fall in love after about 1 hour.

After seeing the first film done by a director that actually has talent(Brian De Palma), this film is hard to swallow. The worst thing, I think, is that Sir Anthony Hopkins actually lent his name to this film, if you could even call it a film. I still can't believe that the same brilliant actor who played Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs would agree to do this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or cost, do not buy.","review":"As a Tom Cruise fan I anticipated a much better movie. The story line is weak, the premises are weak, the characters are weak, there is nothing redeeming about MI2. For example, the bad guys supposedly have captured Cruise and shoot him. But it turns out that Cruise in 60 seconds has put his face (mask) on the bad guy and the bad guys face(mask) on himself, so they shoot the bad guy not Cruise. Apparently Cruise must carry a set of masks of all the bad guys plus his own in his pocket??? A weak movie-a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woo and Cruise fail to deliver.","review":"With all the advertising hoopla that preceded this film, who would have expected it to be such a huge disappointment? If you have watched the trailer of this film, then you have seen all that is worth seeing in the full film. Woo does not seem to have come out of the 'Face/off' mode, with the slow motion shots and the pigeons flying reminding the viewers of the classier, more enjoyable 'Face/off'. Cruise does not seem to have learnt anything from the first part fiasco as this film slips from mediocrity to outright ennui.

The villain is a joke, one of worst performances by a bad guy I have ever seen. Let's check the \\"action\\" sequences: the one in the motorcycles is disgraceful to the genre, mainly when the two guys jump from their bikes. I'm not complaining about reality, I'm shocked by the way Cruise destroyed Ethan Hunt's character forever, changing him into a kind of arrogant and indulgent Rambo.

They could have made some part of it where an average person could have done one thing in this movie. The acting is terrible, the action is way over done. By the time you get to the end you just want it to be over so you can say you watch. Honestly, I say don't even waste your time renting it like I did on Pay Per View.

Not only was the story trite and weak, but also the action was very old and unimaginative. To see the brilliance of John Woo, check out Boiling Point and the Killer, two great movies with another great actor Chow Yun-Fat. And most of the action from MI2 was from other Woo movies. Not only did the final battle look fake, but the frantic and fast pace of Woo's other movies were missing here.

Even though I don't admire Cruise as an actor, in general he chooses good scripts and tries to give his best.

The scenes with Roxburgh, and only the scenes with Roxburgh was what kept me alive during the film. Although when that stupid Tom Cruise killed Roxburgh's character the movie ended right there. The scene was when he switched their faces, and I thought Roxburgh's character had beaten the crap out of Cruise's character and they killed him and I was feeling quite happy for the moment, until, they pulled the face off of Cruise and it was Roxburgh instead. I was DREADFULLY upset. And then it showed Roxburgh running, but it was really Cruise since he hadn't pulled off his face yet.

Thandie Newton is beautiful and talented. If you've seen Ever After, it's a trip to see Dougray Scott as the quite wicked villian. And I just adore Ving Rhames - my only problem with this movie is that he wasn't on screen enough! As for the plot? Who cares!

I love big action thriller movies. Unfortunately MI2 didn't deliver.

Example of it being cartoonish: The scene when Tom Cruise and the villain had a chest-collision. That made the whole movie into a a lousy joke. When I watch big thriller movies, I expect the experience to be like what I felt when I watch Terminator 1 and 2, a high-octane thriller with three-dimensional characters and unpredictable storyline. On the contrary, MI2's characters were so cookie-cutter, the plot elements so predictable. Even the love story there was so contrived and so corny. This was just a bad movie.

After watching the movie I looked to my wife to ask her a question but she was already asleep. Why would you spend so much on special effects and make a movie that plot wise would compare to Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure only worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, but it gets wearing...","review":"It begins well enough, I guess. We seem to be in for a re-make of Hitchcock's Notorious. Cruise needs to recruit a female thief to aid him in his latest impossible mission, and finds himself falling for her. And anyone can see why: she's beautiful, sexy, and a full and interesting person in her own right. Unfortunately, that doesn't last long, and she just turns into a plot device...I must also say that I am getting tired of the John Woo never-ending action sequence chase, in which people do incredible forward aerial triple flips while delivering punishing slow motion kicks, and still manage to land in just exactly so that their hair falls exactly into place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I can't believe what they've done to MI TV serie. This movie has nothing to do with the spirit of \\"a team\\" trying to make the impossible possible. This one should be renamed \\"Tom Cruise, Me myself and I\\".The video I rented had an interview about the making of the movie. My favorite quote from Tom: \\"I like the richness of the dialogue in this movie.\\". Says a lot about the guy. All along I thought there was more to him than just a pretty face, I guess I was wrong. Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest joke of the new Millinium","review":"There are allot of horrible movies out there but this is the Worst Big Budget movie of the year. First Eyes Wide Shut and now this. Maybe because it was suppose to be serious and people were laughing in the theatre during parts they shouldnt be . I used to watch the TV show. This was nothing like that. It only took the name. The old show was about \\"A Group of agents who defeated the bad guys. They did it slyly and at the end you were sitting there stunned. During this movie, I sat there Bored. I love action scenes but these were moronic. Hollywood at it's worse. If Thandie Lewis has a career after this, nothing will surprise me although Denise Richards keeps getting movie rolls so.... Avoid this and go rent a good action movie like T2 or Gladiator where is actually character development and not just images thrown at you to make money."},{"rating":"2","title":"To much slo mo.","review":"I liked this movie ok but they putlike the whole first part of the movie in slowmotion and it drove me crazy the first I watched itso I turned it off then I endedup turning it back on again.Some parts were A littlescary I would not reccomend for kids 12 or underAnd some pepole might think man are you A wuss orsomething calling this movie scary but for youngerkids it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Possible Too","review":"Of course the first movie was easy to follow, only geniuses like me understood it. But this time around, \\"Mission: Impossible 2\\" barely has a storyline and it's pure action. Thankfully John Woo directed this 'she's my girl now fool' picture. Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) has a virus that can do harm and is going to sell it at an auction. Good thing Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) met up with Nyah (Thandie Newton) to deceive her ex. Did you see the look on Ambrose's face when he watched Nyah put on her dress? That was peevish. What a crazy guy he was. The movie is action packed with the ample Ving Rhames reprising his role and blowing cars up no sweat. Good motorcycle chases and fight scenes. It is possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like having the set.","review":"Above average remake, driven by special effects. For me, this is quite different from the TV series which was so enjoyable for its twists, and last second resolutions. Still, these movies do deliver good entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Motion Movie","review":"It seems like 95 percent of the movie is in slow motion. Every so-called action scene is slowed down to a crawl. When the action scenes are slower than the parts where people are just standing around talking, you know it's a bad movie. The behind the scenes action footage of M:I-2 was much better because it was at normal speed. If you hate slow motion, avoid this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"M:I 2 was an unnecessary sequel","review":"Did this movie really tell much of a story? Does it remind anyone of the old show? The first one from 1996 was one of the more suspenseful movies of the 90s, and the second one is ridiculously stupid. What was with this face mask garbage? Nobody was anybody. Everybody had someone elses' face on and spoke in their voice. It got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. It ruined the movie. It was so unrealistic. A few of the action sequences were good at the end, but the first hour and a half is so boring and undeveloping, nothing can save it. THE MUSIC WAS BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mission That Made Me Angry","review":"I watched it, and were so angry after it was finished... No spirit - lousy acting - unnatural stunts etc etc etc Well - I sold it forward as quick as possible (when it still was worth something) I bet that after a month it is on sale for 5$ (and even that is too much for it) I think Jonh Woo was mentioned as a director just for increasing sales. This is a guess, but I think Tom was influencing a lot in background. (MI1 was actually a very good movie and Tom did well in it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"suckville","review":"Don't buy this movie, it's terrible. It doesn't get going at all until too late and the ending is boring, the plot sucks, the characters are weak, and Woo went wrong. Buy Face/Off if you want some cool flick, not this trash. People who liked it will hate it when they get older and see better movies, they'll wonder what they were thinking with these good reviews, Goldeneye, or Face/Off instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie was a piece of crap","review":"this movie was horrible. it had nothing to do with the mission: impossible series, let alone any plot or any substance. it was basically a Hong Kong-styled action rolling picture tacked on with a good title. it was messed up, and a perversion of movie action, with ridiculous moves and fight scenes. what a waste. perhaps the director should resort to doing short-segemnt action commercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot is ripoff of Hitchcock's Notorious","review":"Am I the ONLY person who noticed the similarity in plots between this movie and Hitchcock's Notorious?! It's basically a remake. Why didn't any of the critics notice this? Save your money and buy that flick instead. I'm still underwhelmed by John Woo's direction. And that stupid motorcycle jousting scene at the end, PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the word \\"lame\\" come to mind?","review":"This has got to be one of the most overhyped films I have ever seen in my 14 years on this Earth. The story was idiotic, the acting was SOOOO lame, and it all made no sense. The fighting scenes didn't even make any sense! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the action is a little cool at times. But what it all boils down to is that this is a stupid movie. A lame, illogical, overhyped movie that requires no mental effort. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first movie was MUCH better","review":"As others have mentioned, there was no Mission Impossible Team, except for Ving Rhames, and Anthony Hopkins, the boss, (Interesting, we got to see the face that goes with the voice on the tape that introduces the case.)I thought the worst was the agonizing slow motion flips and kicks (often while shooting a gun in midair, upside down)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The impossible mission was to make a decent sequel!","review":"I am writing this reveiw solely on the movie, not the DVD. I made the mistake of seeing this movie in the theater because of my love for the first movie. Watching this movie, I thought I was watching a James Bond movie, and I love Bond movies, but not when I go to see a MI movie. The smothering love story mixed with the utterling annoying slo-mo filming, made me nauseous. I love romances and see the artistic value of the slo-mo, but Woo OVER DID IT. Rhames is the only shining light in this dim sequel and isn;t in it enough to make it worth seeing. The other storyline, the virus, was interesting, but not that much. Maybe its because they focus too much on the dull love story. Unless they TOTALLY re-did the movie for the DVD, avoid this at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WENT WRONG ???!!!","review":"I just would like to know why Cruise transformed a great character ( Ethan Hunt ) into a silly so-called \\"action-hero\\" ? Why they destroyed the almost perfect chemistry developed between characters in the first movie, and changed this MI 2 into a ludicrous production, full of cliches, action sequences that lead you nowhere ??? I think, from the first scene with Hunt ( the one in which he's climbing mountain with bare hands ) the producers warn you: \\" DON'T expect nothing worthwhile here. Don't try to see possible things heres. Just be prepared for journey of impossible deeds, lousy acting and a new \\"action-hero\\" that's marked to last just this movie.\\" What a waste of a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME ... !!","review":"I can't believe Cruise helped to produce this crap. Maybe director John Woo's fame is so big that every actor wants to make an action movie with him. But the result in this \\"MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH 2 \\" was disgraceful. The movie is worst than the first one ( a classic case of a bad sequence ), it's totally commercially driven, heartless, the action sequences in slow-motion are cliched and boring, the plot is ludicrous. All in all, one of the worst films ever featuring Tom Cruise."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like really stupid movies buy M:I2.","review":"One of the worst movies I've seen this year, weak script, weak story, stupid camera angles, about 500billion close-ups, the climbing scene wasn't nothing spectacular, only the little motorcycle chase at the end was a bit entertaining but the rest of the movie pure junk. It had a budget of 125 Million dollars! Where did the money go? And this is the #1 movie of 2000 and has grossed over 500M worldwide! What world is this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we select 0 stars?","review":"If this movie sucked any worse we would all be in trouble because the low pressure caused by such suckiness would create a black hole destroying all life on this planet. Matter of fact if it destroyed all copies of this movie it might be worth it if the planet was swallowed whole by a quantum singularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't shoot the messenger","review":"Tom Cruise as an actor is simply a messenger. As a producer, he is creating the message along with the director and screenwriter. And the message conveyed, the messengers appear 2-dimensional, and in Cruise's case, certainly not wanting to cheer for.One reason for this is Woo's style. It's weird that bullets never ran out in Hard Boiled and it managed to be quite delirious and original. One can sense the angst and uncertainty of early 1990's Hong Kong where its citizens seemed to ignore the looming imminence of the Chinese takeover of the city.Yet when Cruise's character almost never gets a scratch, he seems too cocky. Too smooth, and therefore nothing we can latch on to identify and feel for the hero. I found the toys in Toy Story/Toy Story 2 more charming and believable. They seem better \\"actors\\" than Cruise can ever be in this forgettable movie (only this -- he is a great actor in his other films)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a good DVD","review":"I bought this knowing the plot might be suspect, which it is, but the effects aren't even that good. I bought U-571 at the same time, and it provided a stark contrast. It's effects were outstanding while MI2's were generally unimpressive. All around - the movie sucked. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Movie for sure","review":"I think its a very entertaining movie. Its also better action wise than the first Mission."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Hunt or Ethan Bond?","review":"Somebody should have told Tom Cruise and John Woo.....the James Bond franchise is already taken. That's what this installment looks and feels like, no question. Vastly inferior to the first MI film, this popcorn movie does little to compliment the Mission: Impossible mystique. Instead we get John Woo's tired slo-mo action sequences, a ludicrous storyline and Cruise walking through the movie knowing it's critic-proof. Sure, the action stuff is fun, but I expect more out of Mission: Impossible. I expect my brain to get a workout. Not so, here. Predictable at every turn. And not a subtle frame to be found. This is a John Woo film (Brian DePalma was accused of \\"facelessly\\" directing the first film....EXACTLY; as this one should have been!). Woo's fingerprints are all over this thing. It's excessive to the max. Waste your money on this turkey if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD-very unreal","review":"This movie i hated for a few reasons A)There was a very little plot, just stuff blowing up B)There are a few VERY unreal scenes one being(you might have seen it in the perveiws) where tom cruise and his enemy drive as fast as they can at one another and jump and hit each other...YOU WOULD EXPLODE LIKE A RIPE MELON and other various things of which no normal person would serviveRating-i give it a one because in my opinion a movie is not mad up of explosions and cool vehicles and doodads, its the plot that matters...it you disagree, give it 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie, just plain bad","review":"I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1, because I am assuming when I fell asleep wathcing this in the movie theater that I missed something incredible. I would not reccommend this movie to anyone, maybe if it is on HBO and you are flipping through the channels and have nothing else to do, you could watch maybe 25 minutes of it, before getting upset and turning it.

I hate them. And in this movie, they are a dime a dozen.- The excessive use of the flesh-mask... Three or four times the darn thing got used; and by the second time you can already tell that they guy is wearing it.- Story is bland at best.- Action is so-so at best, only high point was motorcycle chase at the end.- The end sucks.Notice how I am not complaining about how \\"fantastic\\" or \\"unbelievable\\" this movie is...

Woo commentaries, stunt and difficult shots (Tom Cruise himself does many of the stunts in the film, incredible), etc. The movie in its own self is the very signature of John Woo: ACTION. Whoever who expected it to be more than an action thriller, really needs to loosen up. This is a forget-your-problems-and-enjoy-the-movie-with-some-popcorn kind of flic. And it does an excellent work on this. I have almost 200 DVD's and Mission Impossible 2 is on one of the most watched in my collection. Highly recommended for those action fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"All flash, no bang","review":"While the action sequences were very good, the plot and script left a lot to be desired. Even with the glitzy action the movie had me yawning at the half way mark. The plot in this movie and it's predecessor lack the style and subtilty of the original TV series. If there was ever a question as to whether this was simply a Tom Cruise vehicle your suspicions are confirmed at the end of the film with the \\"Making Of...\\" interviews.Your time would be better spent watching one of the old Bond films than wasting a single moment with this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderfully Awful","review":"Wow. Amazing. I was so very impressed at how bad this movie was. There were others in the theater that shared my point of view; I know this because I could actually hear them roll their eyes during the ridiculous courtship and expedited consummation of the Cruise and Newton character's \\"relationship.\\" I know this because I heard them laughing during the tedious, overwrought \\"action\\" sequences.

Bravo Mr. Woo!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the first.","review":"Just when you thought Tom Cruise might make a decent movie after the \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" debacle. Well, it didn't happen. If your into guns, guns, guns, and more guns and unrealistic disguises, then this movie might be good enough for you. This movie has the age old plot of the bad guy wants lots of $$ and destroy the world in the process.

Dated they may be, but they are streets ahead of this disappointing sequel to the revival that seems to drag out a flimsy story into over two hours. It takes 40 minutes for the story to start properly, and then when it does there is way too much invested in lovey-dovey nonsense. This isn't supposed to be a love story; it's supposed to be an action flick and as such needs to move fast. A few fancy effects yes, but who can't do this there days in movies. Does not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"compared to the first one, this stinks","review":"Boy was I disappointed with this film. While the first one was a wonderfully dense and relatively believable tale that could be viewed over and over for that little extra detail, this sequel just makes a one-dimensional superhero of Cruise. You can't suspend your disbelief with this one as the plot is outlandish and Cruise can't do all the things that his character does. There is no psychological depth, right down to the chick he conquers who also happens to be an integral part of the plot.Recommended as throw-away entertainment only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission Impossible II DVD","review":"Good action flick if you suspend belief on a few things - and who wouldn't for a nice time at the movies ?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A W F U L","review":"Do NOT buy this movie.

Dougray Scott as the villian is pathetic and way out of his league. Thandie Newton is T-E-R-R-B-L-E and even more out or her league. Ving Rhames is severally wasted considering his previous strong work and his excellent preformance in MI1. Then again they were given nothing to do work with, the script is awful and John Woo couldn't direct his way out of a paper bag other than \\"gun go boom now!\\".

The MI series revolved around all the characters and not just one man. In here, Ethan Hunt is James Bond and Ving Rhames becomes a two scene side-kick doing whatever James Bond wants. The story was the same old recycled stuff, why not develop that more on the terrorists, etc.The last fight scene and chase were so unbelievable and long (felt like an eternity, especially the bike scene....year right, drive on your shoes off the bike?), I was half out of my seat towards the door, but my girlfriend wanted to see the ending.

Mission Impossible is all about teamwork - there should be no single star. Getting the job done relies on the interdependence of all the team members. If you depart from that premise, as the Tom Cruise interpretation has done so, you might as well give it a different name altogether. This hijacking and raping of a well-loved TV formula looks much more like yet another envious attempt at re-inventing James Bond with an American hero. I was embarrassed on behalf of the original TV cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is lowest this rating goes","review":"There should be a black dot selection for movies that truly suck. I rate this film as one of the worst movies ever made if not the worst. This regard mostly comes from the expectation or the capacity that this movie produced. It was capable of being an entertaining movie and the larger budget, inclusion of John Woo certainly increased expectation. In the end we were left with wire stunts that looked ridiculous, an abruptly changing tempo and so many of Woo's film signatures that I felt assaulted by them.

IT's just a vehicle for Cruise's ego, nothing more than that!Also, it has one of the worst villains ever, and there exists a total lack of chemistry between Cruise and the thief lady.About Woo's direction, the same as always: heartless, mechanic, violent without purpose, a total waste.

While it was a departure from the series in that there was little real focus on the team dynamics so prevalant on television, it was a fun, entertaining, realistic action flick with some great actors. MI:2 has none of these qualities. The plot again deals with a renegade IMF agent (must be those post-Cold War budget cuts!) who hides in plain sight. The technology is completely implausible, the plot is nonexistent, and the characters are poorly developed. (If you thought the characters in the first MI lacked depth, wait till you see MI:2). Tom Cruise continues what I see as the downward spiral of his career as of late, appearing in bad film after bad film. He has apparently forgotten how to act in a good action movie, and John Woo has forgotten how to direct one--sad to see such a brilliant pair decline to rapidly, and succumb to the pressure to create another box-office, but not critical, success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Movie in a Great DVD","review":"If you want a great DVD, this one will not disapoint you. It has a lot of extras, cool 5.1 sound. But as a personal advice, buy another DVD. You know, at this time when you can get Gladiator or X-Files Seasons or matrix or... is not enough to be a great DVD. A DVD must have good movie inside.I'm really sorry that a great director like jhon Woo gets involved in this movie... I have been thinking about this a long time, how a movie with so many explosions, great action, great background (TV Series) could be so BAD. The answer comes with Mummy Returns. In that movie there is no Super-Sayayin (Tom Cruise) who do everything, there is a team, even the brother is important...Now back to MI - 2. Only one man do everything, thats not what MI2 is about..

John Woo, director of the John Travolta/Nichols Cage film Face/Off, has done some visually stunning action scenes in MI2. The plot is simple, but action is the keynote of this movie. The only problem with the film is Tom Cruise - he is just not an action star. Note for film buffs: the plot of this film is a techno update of Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious. Tom Cruise & Thandie Newton take on the roles played by Cary Grant & Ingrid Bergman, while Dougray Scott does the Claude Rains part.

Not that it is bad, but there are more important albums to buy first, such as \\"Bytes\\" (under the Black Dog name) or \\"Not For Threes\\" or even \\"Rest Proof Clockwork\\". Yet, this is a good album for the very simple reason that the music has aged gracefully. It is not at the edge any more, and bears traces of late 80s pop music and a certain falir for exotic sound (like animal sounds) that were popular at the time (listen to \\"Lifeforms\\" by FSL to get an idea...). Still, this is supremely enjoyable music. Although its structure is simpler than the later production by Plaid, everything is here already: polyrithms and catchy melodic loops.I would suggest this to anyone with some knowledge of electronica and a philologic interest in its roots. In this respect, this album is valuable at least as much as the \\"Warp 10+x\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was a joke","review":"I just can't understand how this CD can be rated 4 og 5 star worthy by so many.

Every record they made had a few more or less weird tracks, that I always just skip. This CD is 98% numbers that noone should publish on a record.

This album, while considered atypical by some, is actually quite good. Smokey's vocalization on this album is some of his best in several years, and some of the songs are nicely accented with guitars, harmonicas, and honky-tonk pianos that give them a sort of \\"barroom/blues club\\" atmosphere. On the other hand, there isn't really anything on here as strongly endearing as some of his classic Motown material, but overall it's a pleasant and unusual surprise from Smokey, because at this point, his solo output (while always respectable) was starting to become somewhat tired by this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Abridged!","review":"I don't know how I missed this fact since as I now look at the description I see it mentioned twice, but this is an abridged version.

In These Woods is generally unremarkable, though by no means bad. Hide Me From Next February is another standout for me, with its shrieking guitar and chugging bass. Finally, Rome finishes strong with the lead singer rambling over dissonant guitar (in fact, this sums up the band as a whole quite well).Finally, I'd like to point out $7.99 for a 5 track album is a bit overkill... though I cannot fault the band for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that has started my Les Savy Fav love affair","review":"This is the first Les Savy Fav album that I bought and now I'm a huge fan.

I also wanted to be able to have control of EV, flash, and other features easily, this has a bank of buttons on the side, once learned, easily faciltate control. In addition it has two separate media chips for continued shooting or separating projects. And the battery life is outstanding.

It is my opinion that the 717 was a better camera, even at only 5.1MP than the 828 is at 8MP.One thing that drives me nuts on this camera is the fixed lens. It is an average middle range lens.

Yet the main strength of the book is its introduction of the powerful, yet easy to implement numerically, apparatus of single-particle Green's functions. A device engineer armed with the knowledge of this apparatus and a copy of MatLab should be able to accurately model conductance and charge distribution in devices on the scale of tens of nanometers. Indeed, the book illustrates the application of the apparatus to transmission calculations in devices such as resonant tunneling diodes and single-electron transistors. The book provides much more than calculation recipes; the roots and physical relevance of the transmission formalism are well explained by examples such as the quantum Hall effect and conductance fluctuations. The text should be a great aid to future nanoelectronic device engineers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I just thought this Television was nothing short of superb.

I had Coterie on cassette then and was captivated by the track 'Firefly'. The cassette is long gone so I got my hands on the out of print CD recently to re-live those long past days...and was disappointed. 'Firefly' is still a great track, just as good as 'There's No Other Way', 'Sweetness and Light', or any other standout British tune of the period. But the rest is overlong, wanky self indulgence that has more in common with leaden prog rock than shoegaze. The exception is 'It's Time', a dissonant beaut, but the only real reason to own this is for one track, 'Firefly'."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBALANCED","review":"my friend has this b daman and he let me try it and it sucks.first the foot armour is made of rubber so it has bad balance.the wing grip is kinda heavy so it makes it more unbalanced plus it doesnt give good control.

Walter Horton's playing on this CD swings like crazy, is fluent, expressive, and totally in focus. The mixed blues and jazz material shows the Chicago blues legend's versatility, and the young guys playing with him are consummate instrumentalists. As for the singing -- it is not the group's strong point but it is quite passable.

One might say I have dedicated my life to the pursuit.This is the best blues harmonica album that has ever been recorded (Junior Wells Hoo Doo Man Blues being a close second).Not only is Walter's playing what harmonica players should be measured against, the wonderful material, production andcomsumate support from the musicians for the songs and the artist are beyond reproach.At the end, it is the master work of a amazingly talented harmonica player, with a lifetime of gigs behind of him,delivering a work for the ages. Bravo Big Walter. This recording continues to enrich my musical life.

You know that rectagle in blue that comes up for THX movies with the THX logo in the center and thin blue lines creating the rectangle outline? This TV curves the left and right sides inward so bad you think it was defective. AS A MATTER OF FACT... I did think it was defective and made Amazon ship me another. Sadly the SECOND one did the same thing. I tried two types of DVD players, tried the component video in, the S video, the composite video... NONE fixed the problem. Sadly I just reviewed the Toshiba SD1700 mated to the 20\\" version of this TV and I gave em both a 5 star rating. What value is a competitive price if the product stinks!

If you look at this TV in a store, find an image that contains a large box - like an on screen menu - or any image that you know should be square.The model I viewed on display at an electronics store in Chicago bent straight lines inward - along the left side of the screen, and bent straight lines upward toward the top right hand side of the screen.The picture color and clarity are brilliant on this model, but who cares. Once you know the geometry is off it will make you nuts.Did I view a single bad set? Probably not. I read a review of this TV on another website.

Falwell's unfortunate comments about the tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001, I recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand, \\"Why would that guy say that stuff?\\" Harding presents an objective, intelligent, perceptive analysis of the way that Fundamentalist language shapes the way in which they relate to the world, and how Jerry Falwell changed that shaping from withdrawal to the active Moral Majority of the 1980s. Harding combs through Falwell's history and sermons to observe how the language of \\"being born again\\" affects the listener, showing Falwell's shift from separatism to political activism. She critiques both Falwell and Falwell's critics in a fair and keenly insightful way. Good reading and good understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film - Lousy DVD quality","review":"American Graffiti has always been one of my favorite movies; I have absolutely NO critcism of the film. I would rate the movie itself with 5 stars. But... this review is in regard the extremely poor quality of the DVD. I am purplexed that many say the DVD picture qualtiy is good, because that is my major complaint. The scenes are all extremely dark; you can barely see what is going on even after adjusting the light levels on your televison. I played this DVD on a HDTV 50 inch large screen televison - maybe if I played it on an old tube TV the picture quality would have been better?? Also.. as others noted, the sound quality is not as good as the original film. Very disappointing purchase - I expected better picture and sound quality from a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Moviie","review":"This movie was a favorite and after seeing it again recently decided to order a Blu-Ray DVD for our own collection.

George Lucas served up some really good memories with this one. This was cruising in \\"Anytown, USA\\". Most anyone you talk to, who was alive and kicking in this time frame, will recall some of the events shown in this movie. Simply good fun to watch, and some fairly \\"harmless\\" gags too. Just goes to show that you don't have to shoot anyone to have some fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribute to the 50's and 60's","review":"American Graffiti is a tribute to the 50's and 60's. All the music, the cars, and the people are exactly the way I experienced those years. It's interesting to see Ron Howard and Harrison Ford in their early years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine American Classic","review":"This is where George Lucas' brilliant Hollywood career really got started. This is a magical film that is still fresh today as it was many years ago. The storyline is pretty much about a bunch of California teens in the summer of 1962 who are on the verge of impending adulthood. Everybody can relate to that story in some form or another. The greatest thing this film has going for it is the incredible cast : Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, Paul LeMat, Mckenzie Phillips, Candy Clark, and, of course, the hilarious Charles Martin Smith. I don't know anybody who hasn't laughed til it hurt at Charles' opening scene with the motor bike. Hilarious. This is a feel good and very nostalgic film that can be viewed over and over again. Watch out for a cameo by Suzanne Sommers too. A great teen classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Review","review":"Blu-Ray Quality stinks. I have no idea what the other reviewers are looking at. I have an OPPO BDP-83 and this Blu-Ray doesn't look any better than a standard dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"I will start off by saying I really love this movie. That being said this is really a great deal to have 3 different versions of the film available.On the downside, the picture quality is disappointing. I understand the film is almost 40 years old but it's really easy to tell Universal didn't do much to restore/correct it but simply upscaled the DVD version to a better resolution. Overall the picture is more clear and you can see things (actor's acne, storefront signs) more clear than in previous versions but there is a LOT of digital noise and film grain present throughout the film. On the plus-side the audio seems to have been tweaked a bit so the soundtrack and dialogue sounds great.I give it 4 stars because the film is great, having a digital copy is awesome, and the price is amazingly reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The best movie made, that describe my life as a teenager\\"","review":"I saw American Graffiti in 1973. It left a lasting impression. When the home video became available in 1985, I began watching it over and over. I became addicted to the film. The screen-play became just as hard to put down. I had to realize that my life a disabled person, found its nitch. George Lucas captured my life, before I became disabled, through many characters in the movie. I believe there is a bit of American Graffiti in all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, not the DVD","review":"The movie is of course a classic and always fun to watch.

Not because of poor direction verging on the sloppy, killing any momentum with inept editing and boring compositions. Not because of a leaden script with no sense of structure, that prevents some decent actors from even thinking about characterisation, and which places the burden of period atmosphere and emotional resonance on the soundtrack. Not because of Lucas' usual preference for machines over people, or his misguided assumption that a string of tedious anecdotes makes a compelling, 'real' and nationally symbolic story. No. 'American Graffiti' is George Lucas' best film because it is 11 minutes shorter than 'Star Wars'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas needs to fix this one too","review":"Like star wars and thx 1138, there are many spots in american grafitti that are a bit boring and could use the Lucas magic cgi brush to make the movies more exciting and accessible to a younger audience. Lucas could take some tips from great new films like fast and furious and really add some pop to this weathered looser of a movie. Main problem the movie is old the songs are from the 50's(note to Lucas...could use some 50 cent or soldja boy)and there are no special effects to make the driving scenes more awesome. A few superjumps and maybe a shoot out while driving 100 mph could have saved this movie. Where is the lucass magic in this movie?! Its no willow that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks.","review":"American Graffiti is no different from any other 50's movie ever made. The only thing different is that it was directed by George Lucas (the creator of the miserable Star Wars saga). Nothing about this film appealed to me. 10 min. in I was checking my clock. It went on and on yet I somehow got through it. After I took the disk out of my DVD player I vowed never to watch it again. And I haven't and don't *ever* plan to. American Graffiti was the worst film of 1973, the best film that year was the immortal Exorcist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the DVD for one picture","review":"This is an awesome DVD. Best money I spent for a vid yet. Its worth the whole price tag just to see the documentary, and see the picture of the Modesto Newspaper where George Lucas ran his old drag car into a tree. I can't believe the crash that guy had. Awesome movie, awesome quality, a must buy for any kind of fan of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly One of the Finest American Movies!","review":"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers who rave about this film. The story of one night of cruising in a 1962 California city hasn't aged a bit in the 33 years since it was first released. I \\"saw\\" this movie several times as a kid, but it's meaningless until after you've been out of high school for a number of years. The cast is great, the script is great, and the music is great if you are a fan of early rock & roll. Ron Howard is a fine director, but moviegoers have really missed out since he quit acting. Young MacKenzie Phillips is fabulous. The scene where Charles Martin Smith attempts to buy Whiskey is classic. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember the good old days of cruising?","review":"Great movie. Lots of laughs. I hadn't seen it in years and forgot how good it was.

Folks, this is one of the really GREAT digital re-masters and transfers to Blu-ray out there. The video is clear, and a thousand times improved over my DVD version. The color pops, blacks are deep, and the re-master isn't so slick you lose all of the original feel of the print. There's a little noise and grain (if you sit three inches away from the screen you might be able to see it).The commentary with Lucas is excellent. Plenty of other reviews on the story and the screenplay, etc. This is an American treasure, now looking and sounding as good as you could ever hope. Highly recommend the Blu-ray. It is a BIG upgrade over the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray Edition","review":"I recently purchased and took delivery of this new Blu-ray edition of one of my Top 10 movies of all time. I have a copy of this film on VHS, Laser Disc, and the most recent Collector's Edition DVD. This newly restored Blu-ray has the best looking picture, yet! Whoever did the restoration and transfer made the film look like it was shot yesterday! The sound (which drives the storyline) is still in 2-channel stero, but it is in DTS. I remember seeing this movie shortly after I was discharged from the military in 1974 and I remembered how great the soundtract was, blaring out at appropriate times and becoming a surrounding echo on the occasions when the cruise scenes were shot and everyone on the strip had their car radios tuned to the exact same channel that the Wolfman Jack Show was on. This was a small movie in 1973, but it's charm and influence will carry it through whatever future media it is presented in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Film","review":"I LOVE American Graffiti and was so excited about watching it.. that is until I got it home, and popped it in my DVD player. Everything is so dark, I couldn't see a blasted thing! I realize this is mostly set at night, but I had previously watched this on Direct TV, and remember it to be much brighter, crisp & clear. Just wondering what happened when they made this DVD, that it ended up being so dim. There is a ton of action going on and I'm sitting there just lost, because I can't tell what is going on. It totally ruined it for my viewing pleasure. I'm wondering if there is a particular copy I can get that is not so dark. I don't believe it's my DVD player or television, as I can play other DVD's with no problem. If anybody knows of a different copy that might be more light friendly, could they please recommend.

There were some funny scenes here and there but nothing special. The movie was very slow with meaningless dialogues. I do love the way the movie was directed. This is a movie which starts during night and ends next day. I really loved that idea and found it unique. It wasn't a movie with a time frame longer than 24 hours and that was neat. The characters were likable for the most part . So why Did I rate this movie so low? I thought the movie could have easily been less longer if it wasn't for meaningless scenes that added nothing to the movie as a whole. Too much dialogue and very boring. There was no point to the movie besides showing people what it was like to be a teen during the 50's. This is the first and last time I watch this movie. A one time movie for me nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"American Graffiti is really the sort of film that can be regarded as a classic, without its actually being particularly great. It's entertaining, and it makes you laugh, but it's very corny at times, none of the elements are particularly well done, in fact the only reason it's so famous is that it's a clear sign of the times both in which it was made and in which it is set.The various stories it tells about four friends at life's crossroads in the sixties, and the events that befall them on one particular night, are all really quite good.So overall, despite occasional hammy acting or corny line, American Graffiti is definitely worth a look. A sign of the times though it is, it still gives you a good time and a good feeling all these years later"},{"rating":"1","title":"as faraway as mars","review":"was any place in the world actually like this?

Lindvall so I was quite disappointed when reading through this children's Bible story book. First the positives: loved the illustrations, loved the padded cover, the 2-page format for each story, and an equal number of Old Testament and New Testament stories - about 70 stories in all. However, in simplifying the language the author has substituted the word \\"juice\\" for \\"wine.\\" Wine is simply not juice. Better to choose other stories than to change the biblical content. If sacraments are seen as symbols in your Christian tradition, this book will not be so offensive to you. In my opinion, as a Lutheran Director of Christian Education, Lindvall's \\"Read Aloud Bible Stories\\" in 4 volumes (which also have wonderful illustrations) are a far better choice for toddlers as far as content is concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought.....","review":"Although the stories are supposed to be 2 pages long, alot of them are 1/2 page.

The speakerphone (even with Mute on) has minor dropouts, seemingly at loud points, as if the amplifier circuit is underpowered.

The signal on the headset is also very noisy; for comparison an older Sony 900 MHz DSS phone has much less noise and equal clarity.

The sound of movies is preaty cool though dialogs appeared to be much too lower than the audio effects. I had to raise the volume of the center speaker and it improved a little.

I recently wanted to thin my stash, so I got the kits out to compare and see which ones I wanted to sell. With the parts trees out, I could visually tell no difference between the kits. In fact, when I was putting everything back in the boxes, a few times I had to find the company name stamped on the parts tree to know which box to put them in. There may be some difference in fit of the parts, but just as likely not. I haven't built the kit yet so I don't know.This product is listed under toys, and so the star rating system asks me to rate this as a toy. Obviously it isn't really, therefore I dinged it on durability.

So far, it has been a good clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 OUT OF 6?","review":"Sorry, but we originally purchased one for ourselves we loved it and still do!

Out of the 6 purchased, 2 are still working."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad projector","review":"I liked the looks of this model, and the big numbers on the clock, but the projection had a mind of its own! It worked fine the first two nights - after that it would sometimes turn on, sometimes not - if I got it on, then it might go off in a hour or so, and maybe come back on several hours later. After almost a week it just quit completely - nothing would get it on! My husband told me not to buy an Emerson! I should have listened to him - then I wouldn't have had to return it. Don't waste your money - buy a better quality brand even if it cost a lot more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used not new shouldn't sell it","review":"This item was not new, it had been used unlike what you posted. The stickers on the clock radio face were re-applied badly and clumsily hiding a scratched screen. The clock does not keep it's time nor does it ring accurately if at all. It is already been put in the garbage as it is too expensive to return to the seller. Bought two clocks at the same time. One is in the garbage, the other one is only being used for displaying time as alarm does not work. I had purchased a same clock-radio model from a local retail store 4 years ago and it runs beautifully. That is why I wanted 2 more because they are so dependable.

Great not having to worry about the power going out. The \\"time on the wall\\" (projected time) feature is pretty lame. It is too dim and you can't adjust it to any angle but it is cool anyway and has saved me from having to (OH NO!) roll over a couple times.Update 12/31/2012: Still love this thing. It just works.

Another time I thought it didn't work, bought another one just like it, read the user's manual and realized I had messed it up, followed the directions to fix the old one and then returned the replacement.

Projection is easily visible on the ceiling and keep me from having to sit up at night to see the clock on the nightstand. Clock autoset works very well too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Clock","review":"There are so many different ways to use the clock,the projection of the time on the ceiling was one of the features that swayed my decision but after two weeks I do not use it. The reason is the size of the time display is so big that is all I need, I set the radio to a favorite station and the volume low so as to not wake anyone else up and that is it. The buttons for snooze and radio on/off and the display on/off are all big, so there is no problem finding them in a half awake state.The last feature I like is the selection of only weekdays wake up or every day wake up, I only use the Monday thru Friday selection so that I can sleep on weekends.So all in all a great clock for a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EXPEXTATIONS","review":"This product is just as it was expected to be. Enjoy the fact that dual alarms can be set to radio, not like some other dual alarm clock radios. Would recommend this itme to anyone that is looking for a dual alarm clock radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice value","review":"I ordered this for my daughter to use at college. The dual alarm is nice because she can set one for her MWF schedule and the other for her TR schedule. The only drawback is that the alarm gets louder and louder. A good feature for some people but not for her. It takes her a while to wake and turn it off and by then it's so loud it wakes up her roommate too. The projection works well though, and is a good size and clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until it quit after a few months.","review":"I LOVED this alarm--it is so easy to use and I enjoyed the projection feature, but, after only four-five months, it just quit working. I tried changing the back-up battery, but, like many other reviewers, I could not get it to work again.I've never had an electric alarm clock quit on me so I'm frustrated that the warranty is only 90 days or I would try to have it repaired. From the other reviews, it looks like there are a lot of us who are having similar problems with this clock just quitting for no reason after a few months. If you don't mind replacing your alarm clock every 2-3 years, its still a great clock, but I'm going to look for a different brand since I don't want to spend the time and money going through this every few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is NOT an Atomic Clock that Updates Via Radio Waves","review":"I liked this clock/radio so much that I bought a second for my wife's nightstand, but I was surprised when I noticed they showed different times, by about 2 minutes (neither was the same as time on our cable box). After investigating, I learned Emerson's \\"auto-time\\" feature simply means someone at the factory sets the time (not precisely), which stays in the clock thanks to a small watch battery. It's not a major problem, but for those who want the clock to syncronize with the U.S. Naval Observatory's master clock via radio waves, this is not the clock to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"The numbers in the projection feature slowly started to \\"fall apart\\"; that is, to lose their digital parts. Thus, the \\"7\\" became a \\"1\\"; the \\"4\\" became a couple of strange dashes, and so on. After a few months the projection feature was completely worthless. The other parts of the clock may have been all right, but we only bought the clock to have the time projected on the ceiling.This clock was as useful as a having a rock on our nightstand.Would I recommend this clock to a friend? Definitely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Projector is dim","review":"The projector would not work at all when I opened the box and set it up. Later in the same day I tried again and it worked fine. I set it up in my bedroom. The next morning the projector worked but was very dim, much dimmer than the night before when I set it up. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it worked fine again. Went to bed the 2nd night and it was dim again and will not get back to its original brightness. Very disappointed. Now I have to package up and return.

Now I am on the third one and am crossing my fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how this clock gets such a high rating","review":"I bought on of this clocks at radio shack and within a year both of the alarms stopped working.

I should have went with the ones without.... But, if you like light shows you will love this product...."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good choice","review":"I have both this Emerson clock and the Homedics Sound Machine used in two different rooms in my house. Both have the projection feature. I like this Emerson better because of the way the alarm works (allowing you to set the same time for Monday-Friday and either a different time for weekends, or not at all) and the fact that the clock set itself when I plugged it in. I like the projector better on the Emerson as well. It's brighter but not bothersome while sleeping. I wish it had the nature sounds that the Homedics has, but all in all, it's a better buy. The Homedics has a terrible radio antenna and this one picks up all stations very well. It also has a smaller footprint, which is a bonus on my small nightstand."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great I gave it to my mother for Christmas","review":"I got one of these for myself and liked it so much I gave it to my 86-year-old mother for Christmas. It's great in the middle of the night--the image projects to either a nearby wall or the ceiling, and can be turned 180 degrees. The dual alarms provide great versatility, the sound of the radio is fine and the fact that it resets itself after a power outage is wonderful: when every other clock is questionable, this one is reliable. It's compact size allows it to fit anywhere, but the display is large enough to read from across the room. A great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than being late","review":"Really nice alarm clock with features that my wife and I really like. The only flaw in the design is the ease to turn off the alarm when you don't want it to go off the next morning, like on a holiday. You can set it to go off Monday through Friday with different times for each of you but if it is a holiday then the slide switches to turn off each alarm is on the back. Other than that we think it is great, especially the backup power for when the power goes off and we don't have to reset the times and alarms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Thing it's discontinued","review":"This thing died after 4 months. Started showing the wrong time, error messages, the radio going off for no reason and wouldn't turn off. It's a good thing they stopped making it as its a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"all was dandy until the projector bulb blew","review":"I have had this clock for eleven months. I loved all the features about this clock until the bulb went out for the projector feature. I tried to take it apart to see if I could just replace the bulb but there isn't just a lightbulb component once you get inside of it. It is a giant part that is soldered so the entire part would need to be replaced and I am guessing that one part probably costs as much as the entire clock. I really loved this clock until the projector decided not to work anymore and this was the primary reason for choosing this clock out of all the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, if and when it works!","review":"This was my second Emerson CKS3516. I very much liked my first one, but it failed to function after a power outage in our neighborhood, although no other electrical or electronic devices in the house were harmed. I purchased another, through Amazon.com. The tuner was of such low quality that our favored, local NPR station could not be pulled in with a legible signal, even though every other radio in the house (including the first Emerson CKS3516) receives this signal with no trouble and with great clarity. This deficit caused me to return the radio. I read online reviews, and discovered that many buyers complained about non-functioning radios, many breaking within the first few months of use. The features are wonderful, but there appears to be no reasonable expectation for a reliable product. That is a shame, since the time projection system is a rare, but useful, feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the features - Hate the lack of quality","review":"Bought two of these from Target because I and my daughter wanted the projection feature and like the dual alarm modes. Only can use the red projection because the blue and green are too bright even on low. They setup pretty easy for a clock radio and all seemed well. After less then a year my daughter's completely died...no clock, no radio, nothing. Around the same time the center line on the ones digit of ours stopped working...and it started to make a very high pitch electric whine. I have to get rid of it because it keeps me up at night. Other one already went to electronics recycling heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Projection Broke","review":"I really liked the clock when I first got it, but the projection broke after about 2 weeks.

I do not have the box anymore, but am going to try and return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Features","review":"love my new projection clock, numbers are nice and big so I can see them on my wall at night. it's also easy to use the other features practicely without reading the instruction it's that easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and entertains the kids too...","review":"I got this for my wife who has rather poor eyesight. She loves the large display. I, and my three year old, love the projection feature. I like no needing to lean over my wife to see the time. My daughter just likes the idea of the time being on the ceiling.The ability to set two separate alarms and restrict them to go off either Monday - Friday, Saturday-Sunday, or Everyday is a definite bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightly Padded, but don't seem to be for Girls","review":"I was looking for slider shorts for my two girls when I came across these.

One friend has a particularly high-energy child. By the time we saw the close-up of the kitten closing its eyes we had to make sure that we weren't getting a too little relaxed ourselves.

On my son's first birthday, my mother found our old tape and gave it to me. My son LOVES it and so do his friends (20-24 months). They watch it from beginning to end and ask for it again. The video features quite a few of my son's favorite things: a dog, choo-choo train, carosel, trucks (including 18-wheelers, fire trucks, etc.), hot air balloons and bikes. Some of the songs that appear on the video are \\"The Wheels on the Bus\\", \\"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\\", \\"I Love Trucks\\", \\"Off into the Wild Blue Yonder\\" and many more.

The doc chooses the right people, the right moments, and the right place to tell its story, not only of Crawford's turn in the spotlight but also of small town life in general, a life, lives actually, that may get passed over if you only stop to admire the kitsch in the souvenir shop. The editing is superb; the film coheres more than other place-based films, and the people interviewed are alternately funny, insightful, and moving.

If you think about it, he may lose his voice forever in the next 5 years.That being said, this dvd is a great find for the new Slayer fans. If you wanna hear what his voice was like back in the day, pick up 'Show No Mercy' or 'Hell Awaits' Otherwise, like always, Slayer puts on a great live show, and it shows on this dvd.

Meade does a very poor job of explaining what some of the controls do (histogram, offset - you can slide them around but what do they actually do? Don't ask the manual). Focusing is still a problem (despite a software focusing assist included - it's pretty much useless). In addition the camera does really poorly in high contrast situations.

Using other peoples old jokes could really ruin your image. May be this book is good for a humor historian. It may be useful in stimulating your own joke creation.

You should check your TV listings or rent a few from your local video rental store and experience it for yourself.

Unfortunatly I had to purchase & return this 3 times (season 1). Once from Circuit City, twice from Amazon.The 1st disc freezes and skips and is basically unwatchable. I think Amazon should pull his item from its inventory and complain to the manufacturer. They should have never put this on a double sided dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned!","review":"I received the Magnum DVD set as a birthday gift, and thoroughly enjoyed watching a favourite childhood tv show.

This will seriously interupt play for you miss 2-3 scenes. Perhaps the cheaper price is a hint for the poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great from the beginning...","review":"Often times new TV series start out a little weak and eventually pick up steam. I'd say this was the case with shows like the X-Files, Star Trek TNG, and even Seinfeld. Magnum PI started out strong from the very beginning and stayed strong throughout most of the life of the series.Even the first episode draws upon Magnum's ties to Vietnam, a theme that was continued throughout the series and made the show fascinating. Magnum's buddies Rick and TC are there from the start, as is the love/hate relationship between the three of them. And of course there is Higgins, Magnum's arch-rival and delightful comic relief.This show is an absolute delight to watch. I thought after growing up with it as a teenager it might have lost some of its luster in the 21st century, but I was pleasantly surprised to see it had not. It holds up incredibly well even by today's standards, and remains, in my opinion, the best PI TV series ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note to Heather W \\"AtomicAntiquarian\\"","review":"I've only watched 4 of the episodes so far but I give this set 5 stars.

This was absolutely one of the finest hour-long TV dramas of the eighties, and there is very little out there today that can compare.

I ended up having to return it because one of the episodes on disc three would not play properly. I always play all the DVDs I buy right away in case there are any defects.

I got to try it with night vision optics, and I got to practice with it on a number of different ranges. It made target acquisition fast and effective. It compared to the (at the time) military issued \\"Red Dot\\", there really was no comparison. The Red Dot had a 60MOA dot, which for that long target covered the WHOLE target, so you couldn't tell whether you were adjusting for round drop appropriately or not. The EOTech, with its 3MOA dot, allowed you to see EXACTLY where you were aiming on the 300 target, so you could appropriately adjust for elevation drop. It was great on battery life, and was always an excellent site. I now have it mounted on my M&P 15-22 and it will get transferred to whatever .308 caliber AR-15 type rifle I get next. I love this sight and would recommend it to ANYONE looking for the top of the line holographic site!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HWS for a good price...","review":"Perfect as a ready sight for my flat-top M4 style AR-15.

I love the optics. i cant stress enough the importance of having a quality parts for defense weapons. the only difference in the models i own is size.this model The 512.a65 is the larger of the two and uses simple AA batteries which can be purchased from just about anywhere and weighs about 3 ounces more than the xps. Battery life is a tad shorter on the 512.a65 as well. documentation states ~600 hours on a set of batteries and i havent needed to change mine yet so it may be accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality","review":"This is a very high quality holographic weapons sight which is solidly built. It is a large sight, using two AA batteries, so make sure that you have room on your sight rail for it. I have found that using this sight allows quicker acquisition and the ability to target with both eyes open thereby increasing your situational awareness and enhancing target ID. The only criticism I can offer is that EOtech does not offer any sight covers to protect this expensive optic, and you must shop for an after market product if you desire one."},{"rating":"2","title":"best ever","review":"EOtech makes the best weapon sights.

I am shooting a 1\\" grouping at 50 yards with a good breeze, and I am so pleased. I don't think you can get a better sight for the price.

Very easy to zero in and no telling how many rounds ive put down range its held that zero. I was pleased with how fast the package arrived and came in a very durable box. The only thing i have to say dont do is use the know installation just makes the item look cheap and its pretty much a huge bugger sticking off the side of something nice.

There were so many scattered random dots that Sort Of formed part of the outer Circle of the reticle it looked like an Etch-A-Sketch drawing. Very poor quality control and or engineering. The rest of the unit seems fine but the reticle made me wonder if this was a Chinese Knock off instead of a real one.

I could not resist having a wireless pair of headphones that would (finally) give me the freedom of reaching for something without almost snapping the headphone cord. Alas, the dream was just a dream. The headphone is of course wireless, and even looks somewhat cool but that's where its usefulness stops. The sound quality was poor to extremely poor depending on how far I moved from the base station. Mind you, the maximum I must have moved was probably some 20 feet and I could already hear crackling in the sound. As ridiculously inane as it sounds, for me the most important thing in a headphone is the sound quality. I am willing to put up with a wired (and consequently, clumsy desktop accidents) headphone set just for the sound quality.

I wouldn't purchase a book that accuses and thus publicly defames a father of murdering his own son, with no proof (according to reviews here.) I am amazed anyone would be willing to accept this theory without proof.I had a friend who had been very close to a very famous person, and he used to say, \\"It takes no courage to defame the dead.\\" Charles Lindbergh had many faults, but he is not here to defend himself, although I suspect he wouldn't lower himself to refute a criminal accusation like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish this","review":"This book doesn't even rise to the position of revisionist history.

I only gave this product 4 stars, however, because I want to see how it grows with her, i.e. when she can face out or ride on my back.

I got the Bjorn for my second daughter at my baby shower and oh what a difference! The Bjorn does not sag or loosen up. Where you adjust it to is where it stays. My daughter obviously loves it because when she starts fussing and I need to get something done, I put her in the Bjorn and she goes right to sleep. The main reason why I wanted it was because I decided to put my daughter right into a Britax MArithon carseat. So I needed something to carry her in to get shopping done. The Bjorn is so easy to get on and adjust. But Beware...it is VERY difficult to get chores like dishes or folding laundry done with the Bjorn on.

Unfortunatly, her face gets burried in the shoulder straps no matter how I adjust her or myelf.The only thing I can think of is maybe it is because I have a large chest. My chest kind of pushes her out a bit in her torso area and causes her to not be really able to lay flat against me. However, I doubt that I am the only large chested person in the world to own this so maybe mine is defective or something.I can see that when she gets a little bigger and can fill it out better then it may be just fine, but for now I don't think I can use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"History of Back injuries -caution!","review":"I purchased this item based on the numerous reviews and placed it storage for my pending arrival.

I do have a history of prior back injuries and as a therapist I am aware of the additional strain placed on my back with a front carrier.

Living in a metropolitan area, I rely heavily on the subway system. Putting my baby in this carrier, made traveling in the city a lot easier. You don't have to lug around car seats and strollers (on top of everything else you have to bring). I used this product for the first 3 months. My baby would nap in it, while I ran errands. But after 3 months, when my son weighed about 15 lbs., it became uncomfortable for me to carry him in this. Just too heavy. It was fine for my husband, though. This is a nice item to have, as long as you know that you'll probably only be using it for the first few months. It's pricey, so try to borrow one from a friend,(as long as the carrier is not more than 2 or 3 years old) if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"Don't even bother with the other brands.

He was very heavy, as in a 25lb 1 year old. I am not a big person and when I used this, my back would be killing me. It was hot for him and his fat legs were weird in it. It also seemed uncomfortable that he was essentially hanging by his crotch. So I researched and found an Asian Baby Carrier for my second baby. Half the price, WAY more comfortable for him and me. We use it all the time and I can carry my now two year old with it as well as my 4 month old. You can sometimes get one on ebay, or use a search engine for an Asian Baby Carrier. Mine is a Kozy Carrier, but there are many. They are made by stay at home moms. They are also called Mei Tai's. I can't say enough good things about it. It's not a mainstream thing so you probably don't know anyone with one, but if you get one, all your friends will want one.

While there may be no alternative for those early months, we have recently bought a backpack and have had MUCH better results. The backpack costs a few dollars more, but it is much more comfortable and we can use it a lot longer.

Carrier's made of black, thick material which was too hot for my infant (who's hot-natured). This resulted in a hot, cranky baby with lots of spit up.

Even if you spend xtra $$ for the XL size it still didn't fit right. Head of baby still seemed to be right at my husband's nose.3. When on, you have to bend at the knees so the baby doesn't fall out if you try to lean forward to pick anything up. Having it right in front of you makes it difficult to lean to pick anything up if you're shopping. If baby is trying to sleep, leaning is out of question.4. Having this on you is just like being 9 mths pregnant again.5. While in the carrier, the 'fold down' part still didn't come low enough for baby to 'see' out when facing forward.6.

The Baby Bjorn was by far the best built and most comfortable to wear. Even my husband who swore he would never use a front carrier uses it. I even use the pack for the quick run in the post office or store, because it is easy to put on and helps to keep your hands free. The straps are easy to adjust. The hardware that holds your baby in is very sturdy. The fabric is great quality. Our son is now old enough to ride looking out and he laughs and kicks his legs, He LOVES it.

I am a strong person and am able to carry my baby with other carreirs for much longer periods of time. The Bjorn puts way too much pressure on your shoulders and back! I love carrying my baby, but not in this contraption! Who wants to hang from thier crotch? I wouldn't like it and I dont think you would either, so why make your baby? There are much much better carriers out there for less. Much more comfy for you and baby and cheaper too! Try the Sachi Carrier, the Kozy Carrier or a wrap, the Sachi and Kozy are so great! [...]are my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carry in Style and comfort","review":"I use my Baby Bjorn all the time! Started using it at 2 weeks for a doctors visit instead of towing around the infant car seat. As a first time mom I believe it's given me independence for running around town with the baby. She is six months old and loves it because she gets to see the world in comfort with mommy! I didn't want to get something that would swallow the baby and I... like the Sling \\"thing\\" and the other carriers just did not look sharp to me with the pastels or the awful patterns. My husband uses it as well and enjoys going for a stroll and bonding with the baby. We have the City Black Carrier and we get so many compliments!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but don't waste your money","review":"There are other child carriers out there that are almost EXACTLY like this one, for half or less than half the price. Don't buy into the hype!Also, the leg openings weren't made for chubby babies. If you do buy one, PLEASE check your child's legs often, as these can cut off circulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BUY!!!","review":"I would like to start by saying that I am 6'3\\" tall and my wife is 5'7\\". Well naturally just because of the size difference my shoulders are much wider and I have a tall upper body. The Baby Bjorn carrier doesn't advertise it very well but they make the regular, XL, and XXL. They are meant to match your shirt sizes in order to purchase the correct carrier. They typically sold regular that can be found anywhere doesn't come close to fitting me, with the straps fully extended the baby would be at my nose, yet it fits my wife fine. This means we would have to purchase two of the carriers, personally I don't like wasting $160 (for the math challenged 80 x 2)when I have a baby on the way. Save yourself $40 and get the Euro Carrier. Much more padding, and a ton of adjustment straps. I am a Firefighter and understand the importance of a versatile product, and this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I thought it absurd this item cost this much, but after using it, you'll understand why. Baby feels secure in a quality made carrier. It is also an attractive item for Mom or Dad to wear with baby close. Our son has had a few fussy times and putting him in and walking around the house settles him right to sleep (facing you). I had been given another product and felt uncomfortable with its design safely holding my baby (much less my baby at 15 lbs!) My husband also loves Baby Bjorn as it is not a challenge to figure out how to put it on. This product also adjusts with straps on the side so you do not have to become a contortionist to properly adjust. Great for outings and saving yourself from well intentioned strangers asking to hold your new baby, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable to wear","review":"This item is very comfortable to wear. He always falls asleep when I have him in it, so he is comfortable too. The only complaint I would have is the way they have you put your baby in and take him out. I just don't think it is a safe way to put your baby into the carrier. I lay my baby on the carrier on the bed and attach him in that way. I feel it is a safe way than what they suggest, as the carrier is not completely connected to you the way they suggest you to put you baby in it. Taking the baby out is a little difficult too, since the clasps on the side have to slide in order to unattach the front of the carrier. However, it is probably the best carrier on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A LIFESAVER!","review":"This carrier is one of the best investments we made! I first got the Snuggli carrier from my baby shower, but i returned it because it was such a hassle to figure out how to use it. So I went and got this one instead, and I just love it.My baby is now 3 weeks old and of course wants to be cuddled all of the time, and with this carrier she is so snug and secure that she just sits in it and stares for a while and then falls asleep. I have been using it since she was 2 weeks old, and she has never even fussed while she was in it. It lets me get so much done around the house while she is in it, and at the store she is very content in it too.I would definately reccomend this carrier to anyone, it's a lifesaver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars are not enough...","review":"We went through 3 different carriers and this one is the best one. It feels so much more secure than the others. The baby's head is supported, and their body is held close to yours so you don't feel like they are going to fall out. It's worth the expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our baby loves it!!!","review":"Well worth the money. My baby loves riding in this carrier. As a newborn he did not like it. When using it for the first time make sure baby is already in a good mood. We were trying anything to sooth him and it upset him even more. A friend said to keep trying it each day and he would get use to it. She was right. Our son loves it. I was also surprised to see how well it fit on my husband who is 6'3\\". I have a new father son team that works on the weekends fixing up the house. This carrier is a great way to keep baby part of your daily living."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must have...even with the cost.","review":"This is far and away one of the best items to buy for yourself or another new mom. Both my husband and myself use this to carry our daughter since she was born (she is now 8 months and nearly 20 pounds). This truly is a necessary item when traveling. I carried my daughter in this around Chine, climbed the Great Wall with it--she was 6.5 months. Also, you can breastfeed while carring your babe...it takes a little angling and a blanket for privacy, but we walked around China and she was happily eating!! We will have to buy another with our next baby as this one has taken a beating from use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY!","review":"This carrier is the absolute best. It really made moving into a new home four days after our baby was born a lot easier than it could have been. Having the freedom of movement with arms and hands free to work was great. Also, having the extra weight of the baby while walking around and needing to bend at the knees when picking things up was a big help with losing the after birth weight. It might take two or three tries to get your baby use to it, but they soon adjust. A great way to get your baby to sleep too! I would give this 10 stars if it was possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"All I have to say about this product is it's GREAT!!!! Both of my hands are free to do whatever I need to do and at the same time I have my baby near me at all times. My husband even use it to carry our daughter against his chest while playing 18 holes of miniature golf....My daughter loved it(Mini-ME). Yes, too bad it can't hold a baby over 25lbs, But THANK GOD it doesn't or else I would have major back pains;-) It's a must for newborns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"My husband and I love the Bjorn. My son is 3.5 months now and faces outwards. We have been using it since he was just 3 weeks old.We find it very useful now that it is summer and we have a lot of parties to go to. Although I really don't mind people holding my baby, it can be a little overwhelming when we first get to a party and EVERYONE wants to hold him immediately. So, we use it when we first walk into a party so everyone can see/talk to the baby. Then, once we get settled in, we'll take him out of the sling. Then only just the people we've settled down with are still interested in holding him.The only bad thing I can say about the sling is that it can tend to get hot in the summer. But, so can holding your baby without the sling, so I can't complain too much.I recommend ALL new parents get this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"All three of us like this product - me, baby and my husband. While it can be tricky at times to get my son in and out of the carrier, he seems to like it when he is in it. He is four weeks old and goes right to sleep once he is situated. And it's comfortable for me and my husband to wear. My husband has even mowed the lawn while Aidan rides along in the Baby Bjorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"MVP \\"Most Valued Product\\" for Baby","review":"My husband and I agree that of all the baby gifts we received the Baby Bjorn carrier is by far the BEST! We started using the carrier when our son was 2 weeks old and at 3 months old he still enjoys being snuggled close to us in his Baby Bjorn.I'm only 5 feet tall with a petite frame, so lugging an infant baby seat in and out of stores is not a practical option for me. Instead, I find that the Baby Bjorn carrier is easier to manuever and carry. It's also great for doing chores around the house, hiking, walking and sightseeing. It helps soothe baby's colic, gas and eases him to sleep. Not to mention, our son loves being able to stay close to us and see things from our perspective.This product is a must have for all new moms! It's well worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly ever used it","review":"I can honestly count on one hand the number of times I have used the Baby Bjorn. I really only found it convenient when our baby was 1-2 months old and wanted to be held all the time. I would wear it around the house and do chores, but I still felt more comfortable just carrying her sometimes. I also didn't find it easy to get the poor little baby in the carrier with the straps, buckles, etc. I was nervous trying to get her in and out of it as she felt so unsupported when I had to hold her with one hand and unhook with the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby hated it","review":"I was so excited when I got this carrier. I thought I could just carry my baby everywhere in it. But he hated it. First, it was uncomfortable for him to try to wiggle his leg into the one side. Then he was strapped down on the other. He tried to move around and he couldn't. So he started to wail. I waited and tried it again when he was three months and it was no different. He got in it easier but then couldn't see as much as he wanted so he cried again. I have been told that he may like it when he can face forward so I don't know if I will try again. Just so everyone knows, the product may be good but my baby didn't like being confined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for hot weather or big babies","review":"I purchased this carrier because of the rave reviews and because I was keen on practicing attachment parenting with our newborn son. We first tried it when he was a newborn and he tolerated it for about 15 minutes at most. I think he found it too hot being sandwiched between our warm bodies and the carrier's thick padding (we live in a climate with hot muggy summers.) Now that the weather's cooled off a bit, we've tried it again- facing outward this time. I think he would like it now, but unfortunately, it's already way too tight on him! He's only 21 pounds and supposedly the carrier is rated to 30+ pounds, but I have to really squash his legs and bottom to lock him in and I'm sure that is going to get really uncomfortable really quick! I like this carrier, but unfortunately it's turned out to be a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six thumbs up","review":"My husband, my 12 week-old daughter, and I all love our Bjorn. We have used it since she was a newborn, and it allows us to get so much done while keeping Baby happy. Worth the money - I only wish it were available in more colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"This is one of the best baby products we received! It is incredibly comfortable, with wide straps to make it easier on your shoulders and back. It also has a good latch system, so you can get the baby in and out easily and still feel as though she is secure in the carrier. We started carrying our daughter in this when she was just three days old. I have put her in it for shopping at the mall, neighborhood walks, and even cleaning the house. She falls asleep in it every time! As she gets older, we have the option of turning her to face outward, which I think she will also love. It is also easier to use than the 3-in-one stroller system we also received because it is not as bulky and is quicker to use. I just strap on the carrier, put her in, and we're off! I don't have to mess with setting up the stroller, latching in the car seat/carrier and trying to manuever it into small spaces. With the carrier, she fits everywhere I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He falls asleep in it everytime.","review":"My son is only 3 weeks old, but already he loves his bjorn carrier. The moment i put him in it, he falls asleep! I find it's really comfortable to wear and for the most part, he looks really comfortable in it. The first few times i used it, it was pretty hot out and i had the buttons on the tightest they go being that he was only weighing 8lbs. But when he woke up, he seemed really hot and irritated. I think for a hot day, it might not be the greatest thing to use. So during the summer i just plan on using it first thing in the morning or later on in the day or evening. It's so wonderful to be able to share something as important as exercise with my new little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for newborns or small babies only","review":"I thought this product was great when my son was a newborn (born 9 pounds, 4 ounces) but by the time he was two months old this carrier couldn't handle the load. The other thing I didn't like was that it was not easy to put him into or take out of the carrier - he would scream and scream until I got him settled. If you have a smaller baby you could probably get a lot more use out of it, as I did enjoy it a great deal for those few weeks I was able to use it - but if you have a bigger baby I personally don't think it is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I just love carrying the baby around in my Baby Bjorn. It soothes the baby when he sleeps. I can take him out in cold weather and feel his body heat against my sweater while covering him under my coat."},{"rating":"1","title":"baby gets squished and overheated","review":"This is not a good carrier if you live in a warm climate. The material is too thick and the baby held too closely. My son never seemed comfortable in it. It was a tight fit for him and he was never over 50 percentile for weight. I would retry it every now and again and he always looked like he was so squished, it was hard for him to breathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very much needed product after all....","review":"I was very excited when I bought this item for my 3 month old daughter. We are 6 months now, and maybe used it twice for about 5 minuts or so. It's much easier and more comfortable for the baby to stay in her portable car seat in case if we need to go to the store. Otherwise , the carrier is a little too tightly presses her against my body, I saw that it made her feel uncomfortable.After all, I didn't really need it , and the price is pretty stiff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible carrier","review":"I wish there was an option to give this product zero stars because I feel that even one star is too much. This baby carrier may be safe but it is not convenient or comfortable for the parent or baby. Somehow the design of this makes it not comftorable to carry a baby over 15 lbs. And the baby is just hanging there by his crotch, I wouldnt want to hang by my crotch for any length of time so I wont make my baby do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what is the big deal","review":"I can not believe how many people like the bjorn. I tried it on in the store and put my daughter in it who was at the time about 8lbs. I could not wait to get the thing off!!!!!!!! She hated it and I have never been more uncomfortable. Everyone I know who has an infant has a bjorn and I do not know what the big deal is. I am so appreciative of the girl at the store who let me try it out before I spent the $79.00. I also believe you get what you pay for, but not this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Great Carrier","review":"This carrier is wonderful. It is a must for the busy parents. We use it to carry the baby around the house & free up our hands when she wants to be cuddled while we want to be busy with chores. We usually put it in the car when we go out because it is great for quick errands when we don't want to pull out the stroller or carry her in her car seat. This was a gift and we loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best carrier!","review":"Everyone asks me about it all of the time...mostly parents who have a carrier that they hate. This carrier is very convenient and easy to use. There are 3 attachments on each side...and they are easy enough to open and close once you familiarize yourself with them (the bottom ones seem to be the hardest for me). If you are a breastfeeding mom, you will love this. Just undo one side of the carrier, and the baby easily lays in a good position for feeding. The padding helps cover you up as well.Highly recommend this carrier, don't waste your money on a cheaper one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have so you can get things done","review":"I love our baby bjorn, there are some days when our son just wants to be held. So, put the baby in the carrier and you can still get stuff done. Its also helpful while shopping since your hands are free. The only downside is that if you are busty its not always comfortable. But, its still a great item to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the extra money!","review":"Yes the Baby Bjorn costs more than other carriers but it's well worth it - even if you only use it for one child. Put it this way, how much do you like your back?My husband and I trekked across Manhattan with our daughter in this carrier and both baby and Daddy (who was wearing it) had a ball.In response to those who say it's too complicated, I can't imagine other brands being simpler or safer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable","review":"My husband bought this carrier when our son was a week old and we use it everyday - in the house as well as outside. Our son hates to be put down and either of us just carry him around in the carrier. He can sleep upto 3 hours when put in the carrier! Helps if you want to do stuff around the house or go to the mall. Also very helpful for colicky babies.Its very easy to put on and does not put pressure on your back - the straps are wide and probably distribute the weight very well. It is very comfortable although in the beginning (when my milk supply was getting established) my breasts hurt a bit but now there's no problem at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This was one of the best gifts I received at my shower! I had to wait a few weeks to use it because our son wasn't big enough at first, and we wore it around the house so he'd get used to it. But he really loves it and it's very useful. We use it to travel - it's great for walking through the airport when you don't want to carry the car seat or take the stroller, especially if traveling alone. One of our baby's favorite is to snuggle in the Baby Bjorn while I'm vacuuming. It's like a light switch. He falls asleep the second I turn the vacuum on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Carrier","review":"We started out with a carrier someone gave us as a gift from fisher price. It was so complicated i never even finished assembling it. when my daughter was about 6 weeks old a friend gave me this carrier. It is great! We also tried a sling in the interim and my daughter hated it! This one is so easy to use. I can put her in with no help. It is wonderful for the mall, grocery store, home, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"Husband and I bought this carrier when our son was several weeks old, and it was a total waste of money. Ten minutes after being in the carier, our son's legs and feet were icy cold, because the hard straps cut out his circulation. Also in this carrier, all his weight was pressing against his crotch and he didn't like that. My back and shoulders were in pain. It didn't work for us at all. We started using Over the Shoulder Baby Holder sling, and after several awkward tries, we totally loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"life saver!","review":"i never thought that i'd have a colick baby, but I did. I thought I'd go crazy. Before we bought baby bjorn I had to carry him around ALL THE TIME! He wouldn't let me sleep, sit or eat. I was in tears myself from exaustion. WIth baby bjorn he's been snoozing 15 minutes after I put him in. I love that it's adjustable for any hight and length. I am a smaller person, but my husband can adjust the carrier to his hight and width just as well. Baby is very comfy and secure inside. I love that when he was smaller (born at 7lb), we could just use the snaps for his legs and he was very secure and injury-free. Other carriers that we've looked at do not offer anything even close to this.Now,at 2 1/2 month I still love this carrier! It's so easy to out him in and go on a walk and just as easy to take him out without waking him up. It was our life saver! buy it, is't worth of money. Don't waist your time (and money )on cheap stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Recall","review":"I think this product has been recalled. I've seen the recall in two separate locations - a magazine and the doctor's office. I'm not sure why it is still on the market, maybe the recall was for a previous release of the product but I would check into it before purchasing.I have an Evenflo Snugli baby carrier and I love it (so does my son, he falls asleep in it without fail) - plus it is MUCH less expensive than the Baby Bjorn (it retails for only $30). I would recommend this instead. I agree with the person who said to avoid the product altogether if you have back problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"RECALL: U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission","review":"I was about to purchase this product online after reading the wonderful reviews from other parents. However after researching this item for recalls I feel compelled to warn other parents about this recall and would like to encourage Baby Bjorn to fix this product defect as soon as possible.For more information please see:http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml04/04214.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislike - dangerous","review":"This was a baby shower gift. I used it once and returned it. I was very scared that my child would fall out of this and get hurt. It was very difficult to put him in and out of it. Not worth the money. Your child is very small for only a little while enjoy holding him and if you need to carry him put him in a stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"best buy for your money","review":"My 2 month old loves to be held during the day, and sometimes I just have alot to do!my dad got me this carreir and THANK GOD!its pERFECT for when I hvae housework to do.just strap her in and she sleeps the whole time, and holding ger a few hours a day not feeding her and while shes not crying really helps reduce fussy crying overall.Its also great because were stationed in Europe and its not very stroller friendly here.Plus, when she gets older, we can turn her around in it. Its the best buy for your money. It costs a lot but is the BEST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I registered for this item and did get it. However, I used it only a couple times. When my son was a newborn, he cried a lot and wouldn't stay in the carrier and then he was too heavy to go in it. It is too expensive not to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved design","review":"I purchased a Bjorn 2 years ago. The old model was difficult to use. My son hated being placed in it, therefore I rarely used it. I received another Bjorn a a gift for my second child. I was impressed with the redesign. It is easy to place my baby in it. He lovesit. I use it instead of a stroller. It is great for grocery shopping, my 2 year old sits in the cart and I place the baby in the Bjorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best carrier we found","review":"We tried several carriers and this was by far the best. I agree with other reviews stating it's better for older babies maybe starting around 6 weeks. Before that, use a sling type carrier because newborns usually prefer to be wrapped up tightly in a sling to feel secure. Our baby had colic and we had to carry her constantly until about 3 months. This carrier saved our backs. It's the only one we found easy to adjust while you had it on and the best part is how easy it is to take the baby out and lay them down once they are asleep. Our daughter was too big (wide) for it by about 6 months though."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best innovations for baby and mom!","review":"My daughter is 10 weeks old and we have been happily using this carrier since she was big enough to fit in it.(8 lbs.) I use the carrier when I'm running errands, cleaning bottles, doing laundry etc. It is so easy to use and my baby girl is always comfy and cozy in it. She is not a big napper, but she can always fall asleep and stay asleep in here. I love having her so close and she loves it too. My friends with older babies love the ease of this product too. Every mom should have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby hangs by crotch!!!","review":"I got the baby bjorn carrier original and used it with my newborn for about a month. We used it all the time and baby seemed happy in it. However, after doing further research on baby carriers, I discovered that the type of carrier that allows baby to hang by his crotch is harmful to both baby's spine and hip development. I advise that anyone thinking about buying this carrier do further research on this and find a carrier that is best for baby's health. I am disappointed that I spent $60 on this carrier and wish I could get my money back. I didn't want to sell it on ebay because I didn't think any baby should be in this type of carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I was hesitant about purchasing this carrier versus the less expensive models out there. But the Bjorn has earned its keep in our household. My son is now 4 months old and is happiest in his Bjorn. It's great for mall trips, grocery shopping, walks around the neighborhood even when he's fussy while we're entertaining or eating at a restaurant. I love having him close to me and he loves getting a bird's eye view of everything I'm doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use!","review":"When I first put on the carrier, I didn't think it would be very easy to get the baby in and secured all by myself - but it was surprisingly easy. It looked comfortable, and my son appeared to be quite cozy after he got used to it. The only drawback is that the baby (newborn, at least) has to turn his head against the chest of whoever is wearing the carrier and his little face was rubbing against one of the straps. He didn't seem too bothered by it and I imagine once he gets bigger it will not be a problem. Overall, this is a very functional product."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE!","review":"Absolutely my favorite item! Must have. Grows w/ baby. Used it for our baby since he was a newborn. He slept in it every time! Great back support. Well worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every penny","review":"This is a great product. It takes a little adjusting to make sure it doesn't hurt your back but my baby has loved it. Something to think about...he wasn't able to use it until he could face forward in it because he rooted for food when he faced me.Overall, he is 5 months old and still loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Worth the Price","review":"I registered for this product and ended up purchasing it myself and just started using it (my daughter is 6 weeks old). I love the fact that I have both hands free (finally) and that it's very secure. You don't have to worry about baby falling out or anything. At first I thought it would be hard to use, but after day one, baby and mom are old pros. I also have a sling and use both, but the Bjorn allows you to have both hands completely free and it provides better support for the baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute","review":"My 9 year old got into the bunnicula series last year and her 5 year old brother felt left out.

He's more interested in showing just how much he knows about Warrant, Poison, KISS, Guns n' Roses--he's set on showing off his metal trivia: what band members wore in each video, who replaced whom on guitar before the big record deal, cover art.Too bad. I wanted to like this book, and I read it cover-to-cover, but there's something about a dork who feels the need to spout metal trivia interjected with disingenuous self-effacement that reminds why I always changed the station when Ratt came on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fargo Suck City","review":"I picked this up expecting a portrait of Klosterman's youth in rural ND and how it, and he, was affected by music--I was sorely disappointed. There is no odyssey, only Klosterman's opinions of the 80's metal scene (some interesting, some annoying, and some flat out dumb). Fine for anyone between the ages of 35-45 who actually obsessed over hair bands as much as he did, but if you were born after 1975 (I was) and aren't interested in a meaningless avalanche of names and dates (I'm not) don't bother reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"great writer, bad book","review":"I could write a book full of factual and analytical errors in this book. For an avowed fan of metal and a paid rock critic, Klosterman knows little more about the subject than the names of the band members. Virtually everything else in this book is incorrect. There are the occasional witty one-liners and a few slightly interesting stories, but the overly lengthy yet superficial analysis--and countless inaccuracies--are too annoying to make any of this worth the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories","review":"I have to admit, I really enjoyed this book. It was enjoyable because with each chapter I would remember a point of my life as a teenager. My husband who is nine years older than me and never really understood \\"hair bands\\" also read the book. He liked the writing and humor, but didn't get into the topic as much as I did. I would certainly recommend this book to other people around my age group, but if you were not seriously into the \\"heavy metal hair bands\\" of the 80's I do not think you will enjoy this book very much. The writing is exceptional, but the enjoyment really comes from reliving periods of your own life, as you read each chapter. If you do not have that connection with the music this book may not be as enjoyable to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting and funny but flawed...","review":"This is a funny and interesting book, but I had some very strong differences of opinion with the author. What kind of person likes bands like Poison and Cinderella but thinks bands like Judas Priest/Iron Maiden/Slayer and old Metallica are not worth listening to? Very strange. I guess maybe North Dakota is as warped as I've heard. Anyway, this is a good little book for nostalgia purposes if nothing else. The \\"growing up\\" stories are pretty funny, and the author's take on all those Gun's & Roses videos featuring dolphins is dead on. This guy was right to be frightened of the crowd at a Slayer concert: they'd eat him alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amen","review":"I thoroughly agree with Craig Werner, the previous reviewer(who wrote a damn fine book on music himself) on this one. This book reminds anyone who writes or thinks deeply about music that the essential component to any good criticism or analysis is a personal perspective; you gotta come from a real place. Klosterman's book is funny, smart and strangely touching, and while non-fans of metal may find it silly to believe some of his assertions, he argues them eloquently and plainly. Great writing with a real understanding of the subject in all its glory and absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Klosterman, but not this book","review":"I'm a big fan of Chuck Klosterman's writing, so I thought I might enjoy Fargo Rock City even though I do not care about metal music in the least. But I only made it about halfway through the book before I had to give up. I assumed that this book would be as much about Klosterman and his teenage experiences as it is about metal, but I was wrong. This book is ONLY about metal. All 270 pages of it.And what I discovered is that Klosterman is a great writer when he is writing about characters, not when writing about concepts. That's what makes his novels Downtown Owl and The Visible Man so good--Klosterman can conjure up rich, fascinating characters in just a few pages. Sadly he cannot do the same for metal music.I would only recommend Fargo Rock City if you are/were in to metal music or if at least has some bearing on your formative years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klosterman rocks.","review":"Klosterman understands the universe, and why heavy metal had to exist to make it balanced and just."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Pop-Culture Read!","review":"This is a great, easy to read book for anyone out there who grew up in the 80's and/or was/is into metal or hard rock. Brought back a lot of memories for me! Generally well written and engaging. I disagreed with some of his arguments about keyboards (hey, Dio used keyboards, and they were heavy!!) and i think he missed the significance of Operation:Mindcrime (which is eerily relevant today. check it out!!). Also, he didn't give enough credit to Iron Maiden, et al, in my opinion, but he obviously liked the Crue and Poison's more, so can't fault him there. I thought his excuses for some of the racism and sexism and homophobia in some of the 80's metal was a bit thin as well. All in all though, this is a great book, and it's fantastic that someone is thinking about this stuff seriously, and trying to give it some of the context and relevance it deserved. So, if you like heavy music, well worth your time. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call a spade a spade","review":"I really didn't understand the marketing of this book. Reading the book, I kept wondering \\"where's the beef?\\" I expected information that was useful but instead all I found was an autobiography that not only wasn't what I was looking for, it was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big \\"O\\" = Overrated","review":"From a male's perspective, I found this book to be nothing more than the poor man's version of \\"Prince Of Tides.\\" Sure I was able to climax with the help of this book, but heck, I can do that even with a strong wind from the south. My advice, buy a dildo, vaseline and Jack Daniels and call it a night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Yourself First","review":"Informative, enlightening, not at all disappointing! Before you can love another,you must love yourself first, and this book is a terrific guide. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly obvious material with boring autobiography","review":"Maybe this was helpful 20 years ago, but as the author herself states in the foreward, masturbation is relatively accepted now. If you've masturbated before you probably don't need this. And if you hadn't you probably wouldn't want to read a book on it anyway. Author illustrates the book, and the pictures are pretty interesting. I swear that one of them is Lenin masturbating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was really disappointed especially because I had read so many positive reviews of the book. It very boring and the only exercises there actually were was one little chapter. The book was more of an autobigraphy of the author as well as about the history of the acceptance of women's masturbation which I could have read online if i wanted to. I wouldn't consider this a self-help book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engineering review","review":"While talking to the author about designing and marketing a medical device to assist women to exercise their pelvic floor muscles, Betty recommended that I buy this book to learn more about the anatomy and physiology of the female orgasm, and how the device I am designing might play a role. Betty writes from her three decades of experience teaching \\"selflove\\" to many women and some men. But it wasn't until page 157 that I found the relevant information. Betty was part of the early efforts in liberating women's thinking, and her stories of that effort are fascinating. She writes well, and makes her story interesting. I had hoped that there would be more clinical information that I could use for the product design; that is the only reason I subtracted one star. If you are expecting an instruction book, this isn't it. But if you want to learn about the emotional and sexual history of one pioneer of the sexual revolution, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not what I was looking for.","review":"It's an okay read, but it's not that helpful regarding orgasms and other practical advice in reaching the big O. Unless you have serious insecurities and negative thoughts about your body or have been abused, this book isn't really for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help......","review":"I bought this for my wife. Hoping it would show her that it's OK to touch herself. She has always seen self satisfaction as wrong. This book really missed the mark. The section on group masterbation and homosexuality really turned her off. This book portays the writer as a sex know-it-all out of the free-love sixtys. It does not begin to help those who don't know what they are missing and need a little push. The book hit the shelf after 1 day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This book has opened my eyes and made me look at thing in a whole different light.

Two new reed switches for the rain gauge required, each failed after a couple of months. Anemometer bearings failed indicating much reduced wind strength. Now several lines in the LCD have ceased to work. Not a happy relationship and to cap it off the local agent here in New Zealand was of no assistance what so ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"not reusable","review":"This gel holder is not really reusable.Actually, it is a very fragile item.There is a metal holder inside the gel that doesnt last more than a couple of days.Kids have fun and looks nice inside the box... but very poor quality manufacturing."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Oates Is Finally Recognised For His Hard Work","review":"Frankly, it's about time that John Oates got the recognition that he so richly deserves. In regards to their 40 year plus partnership, Daryl Hall took all of the credit and got to do all the great tracks and John Oates was lucky to get whatever tracks he could get to do on every album they had released within the last 40 years or so. In short, Hall got the meaty tracks and he gave Oates the scraps..or at least that's the impression I got from Daryl Hall. But the songs in this finely crafted album by John Oates are superb and show that John Oates is every bit as talented and worthy of recognition and admiration as Daryl Hall. I wish John Oates many more years of singing and songwriting success."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is as great as her live shows!","review":"Soem artists just don't sound as great on record as they do in concert, but Shipley & Her Sharp Shooters, sound delightfully rockin' amd swingin' on thier debut. Shipley possesses a voice uniquely her own even though she has been described as a more rockin' Patsy Cline. She possesses a warm rockin' voice, and her band is tight and energetic. Swing damcers, as well as jivers and boppers will ove the band and thsi exellent cd. I've seen her in Arcadia performing at the races, and she really gets a good reactipn from a veriety of audiences. Great cd, really upbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Origin of Hal Jordan rewritten","review":"This book retells the origin of Hal Jordan, the GL of sector 2814. It focuses on Hal's personal life, and about how he grapples with becoming a GL with the \\"most powerful weapon\\" in the Universe. The book revolves around the interaction between Hal, his family and friends, and the Guardians. There is also a small hint on a plot device that was later used in Emerald Twilight.

First, the 8 X 6 inch size is somewhat larger than other hand wipes. Each morning, I like to sanitize my phone, computer terminal, computer speaker controls, and my hands. Small wipes tend to run out of juice during this extended process; these larger wipes keep working. Second, Purell wipes tend to have a bit more sanitizing liquid in the envelope, so there is plenty when putting them to work. Finally, Purell claims its wipes \\"kill[] 99.9% of Germs.\\" While this is quite a claim, and I don't know if it is completely true, I do know I sure feel better when I go through my morning ritual with one of these wipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Discontinue A PERFECT Product???????","review":"I bought this 8\\" X 6\\" Purell hand sanitizing wipes (case pk) and was absolutely satisfied with its size and quality. However, I was also informed by the seller that it will be discontinued & replaced with a smaller size! A sample of the replacement was included in my shipment, and I was instantly disappointed!It had a very rough texture and was so tiny that for a moment I stood in disbelief! The poignant question is-Why replace an outstanding product of high quality with this sort of cheapness? Shouldn't the consumer at least have a say in this matter? Please, we are the ones who use the product and know what our likes and dislikes are and I can tell the Colby Co./manufacturers that this is utterly ridiculous and unacceptable!

I've tried several of their black work support socks, but haven't liked any as much as the white athletic sock.

Couldn't finish the book","review":"Mr. Ludlum wrote a real clunker here. Some of his previous books were notable -- even good. I struggled with this one, however, for weeks, falling asleep during each read. I finally gave up -- and actually was relieved when I did so.

For a supposed accomplished author, I was unimpressed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best ever...","review":"These three things struck me about this novel: 1. The character development was lacking Instead of developing the new characters, Mr. Ludlum used half the book to cover old ground (Matarese Circle) in case you forgot, or hadn't read it (I guess). 2. The suspense was generated by things that never happened It strikes me that, if the world's intelligence agencies were as deeply penetrated as the Ludlum would have us believe, then this plot should have had a substantial number of twists and turns, none of which happened! 3. Every page in the book had at least one italicized word, usually in a question or exclamation. After I finished reading the book, I felt like I'd just listened to a screaming contest! As so many others have said before me, \\"If that's the best you have to offer, then, Mr. Ludlum, it's time to retire\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this book if you watch auto races just to see crashes","review":"Wow. Who edited this atrocity? Is Ludlum such a big name that no editor would dare question the hundreds of glaring problems in this stinker? Ludlum's insistence on advancing the plot through dialogue makes for some extremely painful reading. No one talks the way he constructs conversations. And the storyline, well, PU. A CIA operative, Army intelligence officer and MI-5 bigwig discussing the Matarese Circle with a bunch of teens? Wisecracks and one-upmanship as the world teeters on the brink of economic disaster? Did anyone else experience the frightening mental image of Hume Cronyn and Don Ameche, as the ancient wet-suit clad Beowolf and Togazzi, climbing aboard the boat--weapons at the ready--to capture the evil Cardinal Paravicini? As I read this book I couldn't help muttering to myself how bad it was. My wife told me to stop reading it, then. But I couldn't. It was so bad I had to slog to the finish. It is truly terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author seems to have lost his way again","review":"I have read all the previous books by Ludlum. After The Bourne trilogy, it seems like he has run out of characters as well as new plot situations.I hope this will be his last novel until he can again become the Ludlum we all read and couldn't wait for another book to be published.I found the story and dialog tiresome and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I struggled through 100 pages & gave up","review":"I have read many books by this author but his recent efforts have left me cold. Rather than an exciting spy novel, this book reads like a political soapbox. The author spends all his time trying to convince the readers of the \\"rightness\\" of the heros views and filling us in on history as if we were idiots. The poor enemies are dispatched only after listening to the hero provide a 3 page recitation of their political views. This gets very tiring, especially after it repeats itself two or three times.

What a shame Bob has faded so. I have read all of Ludlum's books (save the \\"Road\\" comedies and the last half of the abominable \\"Apocalypse Watch\\") and he should be ashamed of himself. If you haven't before read Ludlum, try ANYTHING before 1993's Scorpio Illusion; books like the Bourne trilogy are masterpieces of the genre.

I am on p.130 and just can't read another page. If you are considering buying this book let me tell you this...it's not worth reading if somebody GAVE it to you.Just the dialogue between characters is enough to make you feel like sticking an icepick in your ear, it is ignorant, unbelievable, and childish. I have no doubt that I could write a better book.It feels so good to get this out of my system after blowing almost $8 on this piece of trash.

Shame on the publisher for putting their name on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a formula effort.","review":"I found the newest Ludlum effort to be nothing more than a weak effort to produce another book for the masses.

Please, heed my words and avoid this pedantic tome at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing","review":"I decided to have some fun last week -- go back and re-read one of my all time favorite spy thrillers, Ludlum's MATARESE CIRCLE. I wasn't disappointed.I hoped the fun would continue, and the minute I finished that I dived right into this sequel.Ye Gods! Ludlum has truly lost it! In the same hour I was reading the prose of an author 18 years ago, and then his work now. I was shocked. This book is so lacking in everything that made Ludlum good -- a gripping narrative, intense characters -- that I've given up and put it down. His worst trangression was in changing the whole history and purpose of the Matarese. Instead of master-assasins, Ludlum gave them a new backstory as evil bankers or something. Unbelievable.Here's the worst part: I just read that Ludlum signed a new 7-book deal as of July '99 with a new publisher. That means *seven* more painful exercises in watching my once-favorite author fade away to oblivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"With the Bourne books, Ludlum confirmed himself as the master of intrigue, although you quickly learn that if there is something difficult, or impossible, like Carlos knowing everything everyone in the U.S. Government knows, or having nearly supernatural powers, Ludlum just does it. He doesn't explain it. For awhile it comes across as mysterious and clever. Then you realize no, it is impossible and I just bought it. With this book, The Matarese Countdown, Ludlum clearly shows that whatever skill he had is now gone. This book is horrible. It is so unreadable as to make it painful. The plot and dialogue are insulting. If you haven't read this, don't! Stop now before you have to throw the book across the room. Read a cookbook instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully melodramatic and extremely wooden","review":"Ludlum's books are usually fun page turners.

I find it difficult to believe this book was written by the same author. In fact I honestly believe it was ghost written by a first year intern as a test to see just how loyal Ludlum fans are. My complaint is not so much in plot line or character development as it is with dialogue.It would seem that Mr. Ludlum has arranged an agreement with his editor to be paid not by the word but by the exclamation point. The dialogue was juvenile, sophomoric and written, I swear, by a high school student. I kept with it, but like viewing an auto accident. I just couldn't help myself. I have read a few more of his books since and they are on a completely different level. Intelligent, well paced with great dialogue. So Mr. Ludlum, who really wrote that book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"'The Matarese Countdown' is a mistake.","review":"Mr Ludlum you are my favorite author and have read most of your books. But I have to say that 'The Matarese Countdown' is a big disappointment right from the start that i just have to stop reading it. I can't stand the inconsistencies of the details relating to 'The Matarese Circle'. Why refer to the past when you can't even give the correct details today. Why continue the story of the Matarese.

He picked one of his best books and then tried to draw from it something that was never intended. One good point and the reason I finished the book is that I liked the people, even the new players. They were just given bad dialogue. I could have lived with the story if he didn't keep depending on stupid name calling like \\"squinty\\" or my favorite, reminiscing about the previous adventue that didn't happen to be mentiond in the former book. This great hero should have been left on his island. He served his time. A note to Mr Ludlum: Please don't write another Bourne book. I don't want that excellent series ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Ludlum's better efforts","review":"I loved the Matarese Circle, so I was greatly looking forward to the sequel, the Matarese Countdown.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME SEQUELS SHOULD NOT BE WRITTEN","review":"Several years ago, being an avid Ludlum reader, I purchased and read \\"Matarese Circle\\", I thoughly enjoyed it and was happy when I heard the story of Scofield and Antonia was to be continued. In anticipation of the release date I reread \\"Matarese Circle\\", so I could refresh myself with all the individuals. I was disappointed, in this book, a few things were new but most was the same old stuff. Scofield had grown old but not gracefully, he has turned into a crotchidy old man, and Tony always his suffering wife kept finding excuses for him. When there was action, it was good, but there was way to much talk and not enough action. The spark that was in the first one, has been lost in this one. The story line is the same, and a few twists and turns, maybe I have been spoiled with the \\"matarese Circle\\", and expected more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"The original Matarese was a fascinating, if slightly paranoid, discussion of world domination by an underground organization. Following Ludlum's inimitable style it built to a strong climax and kept the reader glued to every page. Unfortunately the sequel falls a long way short of this mark.Ludlum makes excessive use of the same trite expressions; the story-line requires wild leaps of faith and assumes completely unrealistic coincidences; and the characters remain completely flat.Having read and enjoyed almost every book Ludlum has written I found myself bitterly disappointed by this one - which ranks with \\"The Road to Omaha\\" in my top list of books NOT to buy!Better luck next time Robert!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written, flat characters--need I say more?","review":"At the very least, Ludlum should offer a public apology for this poor excuse for modern fiction. Characters don't tell each other something: they roar, they shout, and they generally overreact to every little thing. Come to think of it, Ludlum's editor(s) should offer an apology as well. The characters are one-dimensional, and I found myself cheering on the Matarese, hoping against hope that they would win out against the incompetent agents Ludlum has sent after them. Reading this book was like having your car stall on the railroad tracks; you can see the train coming, but you just can't move out of the way. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a terrible book","review":"A well under par Ludlum book. Seems to have been scribbled on the back of a (very large) menu by Mr Ludlum. However, suspend your disbelief, put your tongue in your cheek and you will find reading it a pleasantly enjoyable enterprise. I speak as a fan of Ludlum - new readers of his may not find this a good introduction to him - they should try the Matarese Circle, Ludlum's best book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old, Same Old","review":"I agree with the previous comments, Ludlum's best stuff was the Bourne Trilogy. This book just serves up more of the same stuff...bad guy wants to take over the world...one man can stop it. By the half way point of the book, I was simply skimming the pages reading the dialogue so I could finish the book as quickly as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Over the years I have read nearly all of Ludlum's novels. Some of them are among the best written in the genre. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. This book starts off with a weak premise, and declines rapidly thereafter as soon as Ludlum tries to build a story on it. At the end of the book, I was angry at myself for buying it in hardcover, and angry at Ludlum for putting his name on it. I would simply say that this book is horrible, except that doesn't really capture how insulting a lot of the writing is. If he can't do better, he should stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludlum has lost the gift","review":"I have to agree with the previous review written by David. I have read every Ludlum novel ever written and I must say the Matarese Circle was done a complete injustice by this sequel. I could not believe the one time master had sunk to levels so low. I agree particularly with the comments about the amatuerish dialog. It is almost as if someone else wrote the book and Ludlum signed his name to it. A real pity for the one time master of suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly? Who was the ghostwriter.","review":"I usually love books by this author. For the most part, I feel this is a \\"go to\\" author that I can count on to write a really good, really suspense filled novel that is both believable and entertaining. This book was neither. I really wonder if it was actually Robert Ludlum that wrote this book. I have never seen him write such a poor excuse for a book. The dialogue in this book is awful. It reminded me of something out of a seventies B-movie. I found myself cringing at least once per page whenever the characters would talk. The characters fell totally flat for me. No on in this book has a personality. I hate to have nothing at all nice to say about a book, but this one just isn't worth the time or the expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joyless hours you'll never get back","review":"I agree with those who say Ludlum didn't author this book--but even if that's true, it doesn't let him off the hook for lending his name to it during his lifetime.The worst element has to be the dialog--the more the characters say, the less they seem to exist, so un-genuine are their words. And there's no redemption to be found in the story, which stillbirths one anticlimax after another. The author can't manage drama, so he asks his characters to shout a lot. He can't create suspense or surprise, so he asks his characters to act astonished by everything, sputtering lines like \\"That strikes me as ludicrous!\\" Painfully wretched stuff.Ludlum built a really interesting world inThe Matarese Circle; it's a shame to see it dismantled, brick by brick, in this unworthy sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Swedish Chef Meets Dudley Do-Right","review":"I bought the book-on-tape of The Matarese Countdown and have been listening to it in my car for the past few days. Big mistake. The dialogue in TMCis so hilariously awful -unintended, I'm sure, by the author and the actor who's reading the book to us -- that I'm laughing too hard to steer the car and see the road. Every German character sounds like Colonel Klink; every Swedish character sounds like the Swedish Chef; you get the picture. All of this comes at you in a pulsing staccato reminiscent of the urgent voiceovers on 50's newsreels. I see from other reviews that much of the dialogue in TMC is punctuated with !, which may explain the breathless narrative. Reading this book couldn't be any better than listening to it, so I recommend that you give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludlum is getting old!","review":"I found the book to be interesting at first however it became very repetitive and predictable. The same words are used over and over as filler material. He is also becoming less believable in that the characters are just not able to do as he writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly padded by publisher","review":"I just listened to this book on tape. Sounds as if the author was being paid by the word. My guess is that is was too short and the publisher tried to add length by fudging the dialog. Two phrases are over used and abused to make the book longer: \\"son of the shepherd boy\\" and \\"pig of the world\\". They ended up being finger nails on a chalkbored (spelling appropriate for the book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book \\"It's not so gooda\\"","review":"Ludlum should be ashamed to have put his name on it. Too bad your ratings don't go much lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable, as in the story was","review":"The most unbelievable thing is that I actually managed to make it to the last page. Having shied away from Mr. Ludlum's last few offerings, I eagerly went out to get a copy of his sequel to the Matarese Circle. While I did not fully expect his newest novel to live up to the intensity and power of the earlier work, what I didn't expect was the sloppy writing and unbelievable mistakes being made . A Navy Lieutenant Senior Grade?The USS Ticonderoga is now anaircraft carrier?Naval Officers on a Coast Guard Cutter?Birdsattacking and killing two men? Actually I think what happened here is that a portion of Alfred Hitchcock's script from The Birds was accidentally placed into the story.I find it even more unbelievable that an editor didn't catch these and other glaring mistakes. Perhaps next time Mr. Ludlum might consider having experts in the various fields he is writing about in his novels read his drafts for accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Failing talent, but still Ludlum","review":"It was good to get away from the \\"Road to...\\" books and back to a genre that Ludlum handles better. I only wish that this most recent effort measured up to his earlier work.In \\"Countdown\\" Ludlum revisits his storytelling skills in fine fashion. However, some of the facts seem a bit irregular and characters unreal. It is too bad to see a fine author, perhaps, begin to \\"run out of gas\\". Regardless, I will continue to read any future books of this sort that he writes because Robert Ludlum with less than a full tank is still infinitely more enjoyable to read than most of his imitators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Ludlam, please retire with dignity & peace","review":"Mr. Ludlam, you have in your time given me such light, diversionary reading joy that I purchased by reflex your works in hard-cover for nearly two decades. In this, the best of your recent works, you burst my most willing suspension of disbelief by stating on page 17 by stating that this \\"new circle\\" of eight collectively is worth over a trillion dollars. Please, even eight Bill Gates' would have less than a third of that. This was a calculation I made while simultaneously diverting by this opus and Letterman. Thank you for the many, many hours of joy your past works have given me. Wow! In your field you were once the \\"king\\". Please retire with dignity or employ a demon researcher/writer as a co-author. Even in this disappointment you show that you can still \\"plot\\" with the best. God bless you and, again, thanks \\"for the memories\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"I don't review much, nor read much Ludlum. My wife had this laying around and knowing the following RL has, I picked it up. I usually read a book in a day or two. It's been 3 weeks and I'm about 40 pages in and each time I read more, I can't get over how lame the characters are. Had to look for reviews to make sure this wasn't the type of book Ludlum built such a huge following from. The reviews confirm it. I can't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludlum no longer has the touch","review":"This once great writer has produced in this latest novel a work that comes across as a poor characacture of his once powerful style. I suppose he and his editor believe his name will still sell. Unfortunately, they are probably right. However, I couldn't even finish the book-if I read one more reference to the great \\"Beowulf Agate\\" I would have screamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What it could have been, and what it was","review":"It could have been an exciting weekend in Paris, London, Amsterdam and Rome, full of daring-do and saving the world(once again),outwitting the evil Villians while romancing a beautiful woman. Instead it was a \\"pleasently ok\\" book. It was after 10 o'clock on, a dark and stormy night when i first found out that Roberet Ludlum had a new book out, Knowing that the local Book store stays open til eleven. I raced to the phone to reserve a copy and anticipated going to work the following day half asleep from staying up all night reading. when I arrived at the store, barely minutes before closing to snatch up a copy, the clerk said that I was the second person to buy a copy that entire week! Sad to say that this latest book by Mr. Ludlum like his last several others have recycled characters and plots"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to cliche - Overly dramatic","review":"The main characters were over-blown with spy personalities. General plot was okay, but could have used some refinement. Worldwide financial cartel decides to wreck worlds economy and the become the savior to gain world dominon. Didn't see enough of how they planned this because Ludlum focused too much on making the heros into cowboys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this really Ludlum?","review":"I've read almost every book Ludlum has written and this was by far the worse. In fact, I found it written so poorly, that I have a hard time believing he actually wrote it. The characters were two-dimensional and the dialog was cheesy. Put the story into an outline, and it's great... but whoever developed this outline into a novel did a poor job. If you're a Ludlum lover, stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbelievable letdown","review":"Made the mistake of not scrolling through all reviews to see that the vast majority of readers panned this book. In this case, numbers tell the story. Like other readers, I just couldn't believe that the author of one of my favorite books, The Matarese Circle, could have written this sequel. The characters in The Matarese Countdown bear no relationship to the original cast of \\"Circle\\". The tension of the unlikely duo in \\"Circle\\", the intellectual and physical skills of two spies at the top of their game, is nowhere to be found in \\"Countdown\\". The new characters are never developed, and the old characters are no longer engaging. If, like me, you still find it difficult to believe how inferior this book is, at least try to borrow it from the library or buy it at a rummage sale for 50 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book continues an apparent downward trend.","review":"I bought Matarese Countdown because I have read all of Mr. Ludlum's novels. Absent strong reviews for any future works, this is the last I'll bother reading. The gripping turns of the plot that made his early works page turners are more contrived than ever in this one. To say that the dialogue is wooden is a serious insult to our friends from the plant kingdom. The narrative is downright silly in places, and even contains obvious grammatical errors (which the editor should have caught).This book continues an apparent downward trend in quality; though nearly as poorly written, at least the Cry of the Halidon had an interesting plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book??","review":"Certainly not Mr.Ludlum,I stake my life on that comment.It is the worse book I have read with his name on it.I know that latter books published since his death are obviously not written by him,his name is just a trade-mark now,so one has to be careful buying R.Ludlum books.This I thought would be by him.It is the most disjointed,exagerrated,childish,foolish script I ever have read.It shows no writing skill at all and is written by some cheap 2 page pulp writer from the 1950\`s-or seems that way.Save your money like I didn\`t!! and give it a huge miss-I ask myself how anyone who wrote the superb Rheinman Exchange could have written this-impossible,he did not and its a publishing rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Players Never Die....","review":"It's always sad to see a sports professional stay around for one season too many. Unfortuantely, that, in a nutshell, is all that needs to be said about The Matarese Countdown. It was a complete struggle to finish the book.

This book was horrible. I really tried to read it, but after awhile I just couldn't take the outrageous diaglogue and stupid plot. The original character of Brandon Scofield was an intelligent, soft spoken, man of action. This Scofield was a bufoon!! If he were real, he'd being suing for defamation of character!!! I did manage to read to the end (though I did have to skip several sections) and it was one of the most anticlimatic endings ever. I would love to read some more of his newer books, but after this I'm very reluctant to take the chance.

I've read everything he's written - and he's obviously not present in this deceptive piece of trash. It's as hard to beleive the collusion of publisher, editor, and author in this blatant deception as it is to swallow the poorly conceived plot and the incredibly sophomoric dialog. Unless an apology is forthcoming, I'm sure that I as well as other fans will never touch another new Ludlum creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst novels I have ever read","review":"I am a great fan of spy novelists like LeCarre and Clancy. I bought this book at an airport bookstore before boarding a flight. This story is full of some of the most unbelievable plots and characters I have ever been subjected to. The dialogue is amateurish, the character relationships are childish, and their actions are downright silly. I had to put this piece of trash down.

The other one? - The Road to Omaha. Ludlam's characters are unbelievable and the dialogue is inane. No one just speaks, the shout or scream and seem to be mad at everything that is said. No more Mr. Ludlam for me. Twice burnt is enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Despite what other people have said about this book I really enjoyed it.

Yes, you can cook many things on a grill, but you need an accurate recipe to do so properly. At least half of the dozen or so recipes I have tried burned up while cooking. I find it hard to believe that her publisher would put out a book without trying out the recipes, but I suspect that that's the case here. Too bad.

I suspect indoor grilling might work better for some of these, and if I had an indoor grill I'd try it that way, but if so, that's a failure for the book once again as it ought to specify this.

Some of the books are better than others, but they're nearly all worth a couple of lazy summer days. They are the ultimate summer time (or any other season for that matter), quick-read books. At their core, they're good mysteries. But Travis McGee is such a great character, with such a wry outlook on life, that often the mystery seems secondary to McGee's views on whatever topic author John D. McDonald has selected for his soap box. Most of them take place in Florida, (a Florida no one will ever see again given they were written mostly in the 60s and 70s) and all have a color in the title. Don't take them too seriously, just have fun in the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as it gets","review":"No one has or will write better in this genre.

John Wesley Powell and his companions (including a wonderful illustrator) set out on the Colorado River to chart what was the last unexplored territory of the U.S., the Grand Canyon. Powell was a Civil War veteran who, despite the loss of one of his arms, took on the mighty untamed Colorado in wooden lorries. He is the person for whom Lake Powell is named and interestingly his story is featured in a short IMAX film about the Grand Canyon. The book had originally been sold to a magazine in serial form and Powell's adventure followed avidly by \\"folks back East\\". Reading this book transports you back to a different time when the written word was the primary means of reporting stories like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold Explorer","review":"I got this book to read while I was rafting the Grand Canyon. It was well worth it. John Wesley Powell's description of his unbelivable expedition helped me put into words the spectacular scenes that makes up the Grand Canyon. I recommend this book to anyone who is considering traveling down the Colorado River."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bears comparison with Lewis and Clark","review":"Even if you are illiterate, the drawings in this book are frequently incredible. While true, that the drawings don't always fit with the adjacent text, this will neither lessen the impact of the journal nor irritate the enjoyment of its descriptions. Like Lewis and Clark, Powell suffered great hardships on the way, going so far along known courses, and then emerging into the great unknown. His account of his last ten critical days on the Colorado River is compelling, his descriptions of the Grand Canyon and other canyons are frequently better than the illustrious drawings, and his geographic and geologic explanations of the basin's creation help shape a broader view of one of America's most visited places.I highly recommend this as a reference book, a history book of the area, an adventure story, and an art portfolio."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Huge Fraud!","review":"I hate to burst the bubble of all those who have been taken in by Gayle Rivers, but this book is one, huge fraud from beginning to end. Rivers was shown to be an ex-Air Force officer from either Australia or New Zealand many years ago. He had absolutely NOTHING to do with SpecOps during the Vietnam War. Just another hoax out of thousands over the past 20 years. In fact, he went on to write another bogus book about his \\"commando\\" operations in Lebanon during the early 1980's.Rivers fits in perfectly with the type of Vietnam frauds depicted in B.G. Burkett's, \\"Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation was Robbed of its Heroes and its History.\\" As a former Marine Corps infantry officer (1984-1991) I am absolutely amazed at how many people buy into this trash. There are many fine books out there regarding the Vietnam War. This one, however, is pure fantasy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus Story","review":"I could probably give this book another star had the authors held it out as fiction. Alas, they did not. I thoroughly enjoyed this book when I first read it in the early 1980s. Of course, I was only a teenager then. After doing a stint in the US Army, I slowly figured out that the story is complete fantasy. One of the authors claims to be a New Zealand SAS trooper who accompanied the seven man commando team sent to assasinate North Vietnamese and Chinese leaders, yet he doesnt even know the color of beret NZSAS soldiers wear! The story is replete with error after error after error. Leave this dud on the bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of this Best books I've ever read hands down !!!!!!","review":"This story (be it ture or fiction) shows what an American soldier is willing to go through for his Country, his buddies, and to see that the job is Done right!

I found it horrifying and astonoshing. I have never finished a book in less than a month and I finished this one in two and a half weeks. It is absolutly amazing. A harrowing account of the Special Forces in Vietnam. It is a must read for any war buffs out there. If anyone knows any details on this mission please e-mail me ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS ON THIS ONE!","review":"This story has an interesting premise: during the Vietnam War the US Army sends an international team on foot up through Laos and into southern China to take out a group of Communist big shots. The story understandably drags a bit through the preparatory phase of this squad's impossible mission. And I was a game reader, even letting a few incorrect factoids pass regarding the weapons they were to use. But when the author in the first person indicates that he is going to carry ammunition components and reload his empties along the way, it was just too much! One has to wonder if the author is just another \\"drug store cowboy/soldier wannabe\\" when he cannot even get the basics right in this obviously fictional piece.

If they disagree, then they or someone else must have added something in. Sigh.As well, for years Vermes has been trying to slot Jesus in with someone called \\"Honni the Circle-Drawer\\". This is beyond absurdity. In fact, all the books Vermes has \\"dedicated\\" to Jesus are absurd. They all simply wreak of agenda-politics.Is this what passes for scholarship at Oxford University? God help us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good foil to \\"The Five Gospels\\"","review":"This book is a must for anyone seriously trying to sort out what might be the authentic words of Jesus from additions made by the gospel writers. My first such journey was with the \\"Five Gospels\\", by the Jesus Seminar, which is also a \\"must\\" read. Vermes uses a different approach, using his background in Judaism of the first century, including being an expert on the Dead Sea scrolls. Remarkably, these two sources agree on the majority of the possible speeches. Vermes has valid reasons for rejecting some of the Jesus Seminar's choices. He adds many more sayings. Some of these are very short and don't add much to my understanding, while others are well worth considering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating, scholarly work","review":"The sincerity of the author shines through this most interesting analysis of the gospels.

What a great line-up: Stroger and Smith are as solid as it gets, and they are joined by Steve Freund on guitar, who is very underappreciated. Everything here is very ensemble oriented and understated; old school 50's style. No hyper tempos, some are fast but nothing hyper, no self-indulgent solos (piano or guitar), no throat-twisted screaming vocals; really just a solid, professional effort that deserved a higher profile when released in the 80's. We can correct that now, and in light of the direction of popular modern blues, this is truly a breath of fresh air. I only wish it had a longer playing time.Really, really nice one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Guidance Required","review":"Dr. Wilson does assume a lot when asking readers to follow his ramblings, however as an introduction to basic historiography the book can be useful. Having been part of an undergraduate seminar with Dr. Wilson in the first edition's formative stages, I can only assume that the 2nd edition was meant to be used by undergraduates only when assisted by a very knowing and able guide. The author himself and/or possibly other scholars could help unleash the benefits of text, but to ask most undergraduates to read as a stand alone without guidance, it is probably asking too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for Professors, NOT STUDENTS!!!!

Urza is older by 364 days, and as such, generally gets more breaks. Mishra enjoys the last day of the year, when they are equal of age. A fight between them splits them apart, and over years, a war brews between them. I'd hate to break too much of the story. For players who either have the cards mentioned or have seen them in a magazine, many of the battles are unbelievable in a card-game mindset, while people who have never played will find the book more understandable, since they have no knowledge of the cards used. This nuance aside, the book is excellent, and you will want to read it again and again (I've already read it three times)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Fantasy Book, Good for M:TG fans","review":"I loved this book.

What amazes me is that someone had to approve this. I tried looking for credits & found none.In some sections the music is so loud that you can't here the narrator. In others, the narration is missing, the music dips, like the narrator is going to come in & there's nothing for a few minutes. At other times the narrator's voice sounds completely different, it might have even been someone else. I accedently put on the Japanese audio track at one point & it sounded like it was recorded on a $25 home recorder with a $5 mic.It doesn't really cost much more to have some quality control.

To see how much rain has fallen while the in door temperature is showing I have to press buttons. To reset the total rain fall or any other history, I have to press an incomprensable set of buttons that I can't remember so they don't get reset.

I have never shelled out more money for less quality. I am one of those people that have all of The Doors material in every format it has been released in. As bootlegs these tracks were barely able to be listened to. As official release material they are just pathetic. If \\"Live in Detroit\\" was the glorious heights, \\"Boot your Butt\\" is surely the depths of despair for any Doors fan. Buy it, if you most. I did, not that I'm proud of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"when the music's over........","review":"you're going to wish you never bought this rip-off. the thing that kills this over priced 4 cd set is the sound quality. there is not a song on here that is not available in a better recorded version (studio or live) elsewhere. while the raps and monalogues are dispensable most of the intensity of the doors performance is lost due to the poor sonic quality. granted most boots from this era have low-fi sound but when a project like this is put out by the doors themselves (who have done an excellent job with the bright midnight releases) you expect more. unless you're a doors completist and have money to burn, save your hard earned cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY Live recordings of Morrison singing LA WOMAN and Changeling","review":"Boot your Butt is short for \\"bootleg\\". These recordings are mainly audience tap recordings, 2 gems are from the very last Jim Morrison show ever, Dec 1970 in Dallas, TX. The Changeling and LA WOMAN, LA WOMAN itself is over 16 mins, just a real shame it wasn't professionally recorded. Good to buy those 2 songs via MP3 download, the rest you can shelve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This One","review":"Instead of taking revenge on bootleggers, the Doors (specifically Robby Krieger) take revenge on their fans with this box set. Specifically those who bought the earlier Bright Midnight releases and were satisfied are going to be mightily disappointed and feel betrayed.I would heavily recommend passing on this set due to the poor sound quality and very high price.If you can handle the poor sound quality and want this for historical purposes or completism, I would recommend waiting for the price of used copies to drop around $20.If \\"war is too important to be left to the generals\\", well this proves that archive catalog releases are too important to be left to the artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"good from a historical point of view","review":"i bought this when it came out, not sure what i paid for it, but it didnt seem exorbitant at the time. i would not recommend anyone paying more than 50$ for this. the audio quality is terrible, most of the performances are sub par. as any doors fan knows or will come to know the doors could be electric live, but for the most part jim is drunk an not commited to giving his best perfomance, there are some gems, and there are some songs worth having on this just from a historical point of view other than that stick to live in philly an detroit if you wanna hear the best of the doors live. I listened to this whole album all the way through once, an from then on it sat on my dvd rack collecting dust, while the doors superior perfomances are on constant rotation."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!TOO!!!!","review":"THE GUY BEFORE ME SAYS IT ALL!!!! AND I QUOTE \\"what a disappointment. After reading the material I had to buy it, only to be severly disappointed when I listen. The sound is similar to the old tin can and string communication device we fastened as kids. It does give the discalimer of being bootlegged material not the normal quality but I would no more distbute and price this offering at what they did. This should be for diehards only who have to hear these rare recordings because you will only want to play one time. If you want a real quality recording with the Doors and Jim Morrison at their best try \\"The Doors, Live in Detroit\\" I would happily pay $100 for material like \\"Live in Detorit\\" than $80 for some shoddy bootlegs.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The producers may have had good intentions, but this was the most poorly donemovie I have seen in a while.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperback & Kindle Editions DO NOT Match","review":"This is a fantastic volume for studying the history of the western church, particularly the development of Protestantism alongside of the Catholic church. This book, however, is NOT the same edition as the paperback as one may believe. A quick review of the table of contents reveals that the paperback contains additional material, though both are listed as 2nd Edition.BE ADVISED: there are significant differences. If you require a specific text, especially for academic work, consider the paperback edition, linked below.The Story of Christianity, Vol. 2: The Reformation to the Present Day"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story of Christianity Volume 2","review":"This review is more of a continuation of the review for Volume 1. This book covers the turbulent years of the reformation and its aftermath. The Reformation triggered decades of relgious war between Catholic and Protestant and had ramifications across the western world. Gonzalez analyses these events and carries the history forward to the establishment of America (which has its own challenges).Again, this book should be part of any interested person's reference library. It is well written and very readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning mom","review":"I am not a theology student, I simply wanted to know more about how the church has developed over time. This book is perfect for someone like me: it gives the overall picture, with enough details to grasp the issues, but not so many that we get bogged down and lose track of the overall storyline; I am making notes of books or historical characters that I want to look at more closely later on, after getting the big picture, but for now, the story itself is fascinating. This book (both volumes of it) truly is \\"The Story of Christianity\\", and I'm finding that it's pulling together everything I thought I knew about western history from the start of the current era until now. I no longer see how anyone can really understand western history, without having a clear idea of the strand of Christianity from the beginning until now.The book is rigorous enough for a serious theology student, but also readable by someone like me, who simply wants to learn more about this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great translation!","review":"Love this book in English and its just as great in Spanish.

DON'T BUY THIS RE-RELEASE !!!!! Buy the ORIGINAL COLUMBIA VERSION !! On this one, the sound is absolutely terrible. I don't even think its in stereo !!!!!I love all the Ray Conniff Christmas albums (including Christmas with Conniff). Its what I grew up with. As soon as I hear any of these, it instantly takes me back to my childhood.

I taped all my favorite Christmas songs to a tape when I got married 30 years ago. This album's songs were first. Several years ago my tape went bad so I found the tape of this album. Now I am getting ready to purchase this a cd. The songs just made an impression on me. I think it was because it was because it was a group of singers not just one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas music doesn't get better than this","review":"I originally had this as an LP in the early 60s, and I loved it thoroughly. Burned into my brain as the embodiment of what Christmas can be. Sure it's corny as others have observed. But it has stood the test of time very, very well. I was in a restaurant the other day and heard \\"Christmas Bride\\" come over the PA system, and it just transfixed me.I think this one is in the same league with Nat King Cole as Christmas CDs you can live with forever.

What seems to bug this other 'Me' about the book, is the tacit assumption that such superpositions are *never* experienced in the 'classical' world. Well, jeez, what else is schizophrenia all about, eh? And if you read some of the old Zen Master anecdotes, they are clearly talking about living in a world of superposition, where 'to go one mile east, is to go one mile west'.

I read all these great reviews and was excited to read it. I'm not even sure why someone tagged it as \\"scary\\" because there is nothing scary about it. When I started reading this book I discovered that the book is written on such a surface level, that you never feel any emotion toward the characters or events, and the description is so lacking, that I felt that I was reading a book written by a high school student (no offense to high school students). If you choose to read it, be prepared for a light-fluff read, a no-brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, horrible execution","review":"This book was a severe disappointment to me. It's such a shame, because the concept was truly promising. Unfortunately it was totally destroyed by poor writing. Seriously, I wrote better than this in the 6th grade! The language usage is just plain amateur. And don't even get me started on the similes and metaphors (\\"her red hair shone like rubies in a pirate's treasure chest\\", that's just classic). I ended up skipping half the book and reading only the last chapters just to see what happened. I couldn't even force myself to read the entire thing. Pure pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique story","review":"This was the most original story I've read in a long time. The blending of the stories blew me away.

I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like good literature, don't read this book","review":"When I started to read this book, I noticed the characters were very \\"flat\\" and the story is painfully predictable. The writing is poor as there were some very obvious spelling and grammar errors that were very annoying. In addition, the story was not well developed and about halfway through the book I almost called it quits. However, I wanted to see if there was a point to it and decided to give it a chance. I'm sorry I did. If you are a fan of Stephen King or Dean Koontz, please do not read this book because you will be even more disappointed. Unfortunately, the \\"horror\\" genus is not as prevalent as it was in the 1980s, but, if you are looking for a good thriller try some of the books by Douglas Preston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought provoking, but it is not horror","review":"Came across this title from a must read list. I have only two more books to go till I finish my spring set of recommended reads. Now, I have to say I didn't believe in ghosts before I read this. But, all the science in the book made me feel like it was nonfiction at times. I found that very enjoyable because I love to learn as I read.I liked the Michael character the most as his arrogance reminded me of mine during my youth. (a trait that I finally have under control) I have recommended this book to a particular few as some of the ideas are a little jarring and are not for everybody.Still, I have no idea why this book is in the horror section at all. I can tell you that when I finished it, I was more in reflective thought than someone too scared to shut off the lights.Overall, I would recommend this book for lovers of sci-fi, romance, thriller, and possibly spirituality.Easy read, good endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solar battery is marginal","review":"The solar battery circuit for this watch is marginal; if you don't expose the watch to a lot of light every day, either sunlight or artificial, this watch will go blank at odd times, so you're without the Time, or it will die all together and require several hours \\"charging\\" before it can be used aain.

The solar sensors never worked correctly on the 2010 in a year of use. Many times they would loose power at critical times. This unit doesn't disappoint.

After I set it up I found the LCD display almost unuseable due to the extremely low contrast. I contacted Amazon who suggested I contact the Mfgr., who said that there was nothing that I could do to improve it except to return it to Amazon for another unit. In the meantime 30 days passed and when I contacted Amazon (you leave your no. and they call you back), they said that I would not receive the full amount back, even if I asked for a direct replacement it would cost me 15% of the purchase price.

I didn't have any issue with batteries dying on me or even running out of tape. I would say I did a medium size job (50 labels) without issue.

When I was stable and no longer a threat to myself or others, I would brave another ten minutes of this thing, only to have to surface once more. What can I say of this experience?

Similarly, I loved \\"The House Without a Christmas Tree.\\" When I had children of my own, I would read a chapter a night each year about this time and then as they became readers, we would each take a turn reading a chapter. My children are now 15, 17 and 19....too old to share in the tradition with their mama but I will read it again and again and again until there are grandchildren to read it to. Priceless, timeless and sweet. It is books like these that make me long to be a school teacher so I can share the story with more generations of children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set for the price","review":"I bought these to use with our built-in fire pit on our paver patio. They work well and my 4 year old son likes to roast marshmallows with them. My only complaint is that I wish the shorter forks were a bit longer (4-6 inches would be great) because my son has trouble reaching the flames sometimes if the fire is low (and I don't really want a 4 year old too close to the fire). The longer ones are a bit too long for him. We've used the multi-dog basket fork to cook four brats at a time and it worked really well. The set seems pretty sturdy and well made.The forks all arrived with safety tips on them to keep from poking you when opening the package. We keep them on when storing the forks for the safety of the small children in our house.I'm pleased with this set and think we will have it for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"All but the hot dog rack","review":"These things work great. The extendable forks seem to be the best buy and the best quality. I would buy a pack that only included these extendable forks if they offered them. They store small and extend to approximately twice the length of the colored marshmallow sticks. The hot dog rack works but only with large hot dogs or sausages. We grabbed a pack of Nathan's brand dogs and they were too skinny and would just slip right out of the rack. I ended up just using the extendable sticks instead for the dogs. See my picture for a picture of the dogs on the extendable sticks.We also roasted marshmallows on the colored sticks and they worked great. They cleaned up good too. After roasting, I just scrapped the sides against our fire pit and dropped them in a bucket of water for a few minutes. They wiped clean with a damp rag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good...","review":"My only problem was with the 4 dog holding clamped thing.

We were always whittling sticks for marshmallows, and having the marshmallows slide off into the fire or continually rotating one side to the fire. With two prongs, the forks hold the marshmallow steady. The bigger forks also work well for hot dogs.Just be careful when stowing them away. They are somewhat sharp, so you don't want to ram them into any other camping gear. Also, being long, you can break them (the tines fall off with enough leverage). We broke one, but felt that it was our fault and not due to a weak design.A great addition to the camping equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderfully-made set - very happy!","review":"My husband and I were very impressed when we opened the box and saw the quality of these marshmallow sticks. The different colored handles in the regular length are great, but the ones that extend are AWESOME!! All have really nice wooden handles so your hands don't get burned. We haven't used the hot dog cooker yet, and although people have said the hot dogs slip out (it looks like they would), we will probably be using it mostly for brats so we shouldn't have that problem because they're thicker. The spring holding the two pieces of the holder together is pretty chincy (sp?), but if it doesn't hold up my husband will be able to make it work better somehow. All in all, definitely worth the price for many years of campfire fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Rome's Set of 9 Forks for Marshmallows and Hot Dogs, Chrome Plated... arrived in timely fashion and as described.

There is a lot of conversation going on. Unfortunately sometimes I just miss much of what the actors are saying to each other.For a great show like this you don't want to miss out on any dialogue.

The straight woman was so repulsed that she killed the guy/woman and then mulitilated the body and this jerked around hetero woman confesses all to the star of the show without a lawyer. This episode is so unlikely and wierd your more likely to be struck by lighting. Therefore the end ruined the whole episode and the series with the lead role of a talented, difficult woman who is calle the B word in this episode that could have been good, a female sherlock holmes of the old variety.

I bought the first season because I wanted to share it with a friend. Before I did that, though, I was compelled to re-watch it and found it just as interesting the second time through. The characters are well-developed, even in the first season and it was interesting to go back and compare their development over the seasons. Kyra Sedgwick is excellent as Brenda Johnson, but all of the supporting characters are complete individuals, as well. The plots of the individual stories are complex and intelligent enough to be interesting, but it is really the characters and their interactions that I find most entertaining.

This set should have been released in anamorphic widescreen. Shame on Warner Home Video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and well-written","review":"Although it doesn't quite scale the same heights as The Shield, The Closer has to be one of the smartest and most interesting police shows on television.Kyra Sedgwick's often-unlikable deputy chief careens through Los Angeles crime like a bull in a china shop, with a bemused (or outraged) crowd of law enforcement officials in her wake. She's ably supported by a great line-up of actors, including veterans like J. K. Simmons (who will eventually appear in every crime/cop/law show) and James Avery.The middle of the season lags at times, when Kyra's character is implausibly romanced despite not being the only woman in Los Angeles, but the crimes are always interesting and the ways she deals with seemingly intractable suspects is always worth watching. By the end of the season, it's clear the creative team has found their voice, suggesting that season two will be even better.Strongly recommended for fans of cop shows, Kyra Sedgwick or J. K. Simmons."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Thank you!!\\"","review":"\\"The Closer\\" is one of the best crime dramas to come around in a long time. It's a breath of fresh air in an oversaturated format.

The show ended but morphed into Major Crime, with out Segwick who, in my opinion, played the part of an outstanding Southern woman thrown into a California setting with great skill. Her southern accent...although as fake as a dollar bill with Obama's photo on it...was too much, but it was what added to the show.

Possibly, but disconnected and pretty boring - and fashionably 'minimalist'. An obsessive, fastidious and reclusive young Japanese man, Kenji, living in Thailand, perpetually contemplates and often attempts suicide - seemingly with ultimate success. He meets a wild and disorderly Thai girl, Noi, and sits around her for most of the movie - despite Noi's several vain attempts to initiate sex. There is a sub-plot, in which a nest of gangsters kill one another and, for good measure, try several times (unfortunately without managing it) to kill Kenji. This movie is brought to a merciful conclusion by her departure for Japan and his arrest. It takes a smarter man than me to make much sense of this pretentious waste of film, which in some ways recalls the genre of Alain Resnais' \\"Last Year in Marienbad\\". I suppose I am just not into deeply-hidden meanings, because it has received almost universal rave reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sad Introspective","review":"How sad Fanny has made her life. What strikes me odd is that she is quite intelligent yet doesn't see that she may be to blame for the unimportant life she leads.This novel is not the typical formula novel. There is no huge plot, no large turn in events, but just the thoughts of a young single girl in London. She is quite perceptive, if not overly contemplative when she meets and makes temporary friends with Nick and Alix. Then she meets James, and things don't seem so gloomy for her, for now she has reason not to hurry the days away.I think this is a great book for what it's worth. Great literature minus a huge plot. The author does a great job in making a memorable character without having the reading see her through countless events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"(Can I say it without sounding sexist? I suppose not.) Yet another self-loathing woman author with a feminist axe to grind.A good author with tremendous control over her art form, but tiresome nevertheless.

It took me forever to find this color again, since I couldn't find it in any of my local stores. The one it replaced had been in my sink for at least 5 years and was finally falling apart.So imagine my surprise when this new one not only stained from tomato sauce two days later (the old one never did that), but it also buckled within a week! Now I have a three week old mat in my sink that is stained and warped!! I've already bleached it twice, which seems to help the staining problem, but the buckle is driving me crazy.I'm really disappointed.

While I have done and seen a great many things since those years, every once in awhile I pull this book off my shelf, read some of the passages, and smile...her wisdom is applicable even today!

This book should never really have been written. All it does is rehash the events of #33, keeping the uncharacteristic elements of Tobias and leaving out any originality or furthering of either plot or character.

It's an ever bigger test for Tobias, seeing that he should trust this evil Yeerk. But it's seemingly an offer he can't refuse. Morphing a Taxxon is risky indeed, but isn't it worth the outcome? Or is the outcome darker then Tobias and the others could expect..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt look like Barbie anymore...","review":"...but more like a doll sized version of a mix between Jessica Simpson and Pamela Anderson.

This one looks fake...it's like opening up playboy and seeing Pam Anderson or Paris Hilton clothed for once. Look at that face-mold and the eyes. Yuk.

Tanous has figured out why the vast majority of investors can't get rich simply by following someone else's advice. The ingenious test which determines investment personality works with scary accuracy, based on the tests we did with a number of friends and colleagues. The investment advice is very sound and well grounded, and the portfolios in the back of the book offer a much more sophisticated approach to portfolio creation than I have seen before. I admit, it took more careful reading to understand some of the intricacies of these portfolios, but the effort was well worth it. I recommend this book highly for those who want to create an intelligent and well-balanced portfolio of stocks or mutual funds geared to their own personality as investors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative tailoring of strategy based on personality type","review":"Excellent advice for every investor. Uses analysis of your personality to determine the investment style with which you'll be most comfortable. Then recommends asset allocation and specific mutual funds, based on your time horizon.

He shows how he has learned from his own experiences, and the experiences of his congregants and other rabbis, that there IS life after life. Not only well written, but persuasive. Most important, I think, Rabbi Spitz shows how belief in the afterlife can show us how to live more profound lives today, in the here and now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottom Line - the Soul Survives","review":"this book on reincarnation is an interesting examination of the author's journey to belief in reincarnation and the Jewish sources supporting it (gilgul neshamot).

However, this is the first time I have ever heard the Jewish side of the subject. What I have read in the past was very Jesus-oriented which is not relevant to me as I am Jewish. I think Rabbi Spitz uses a very balanced method of teaching. He neither speaks down to the reader nor is his style intimidating.

This is one of the worst pieces of literary drivel I have ever had placed in front of my eyes. What on earth was the author thinking. The characters were empty and 2-dimentional. This lousy excuse for a novel centered around a character who was rich and spoiled. Who though he could continually do whatever he wanted without consequence. And do you know what, in the end that is what he learned. I was really hoping that the Mr. Merrick would wise up and just kill off the protagonist. What shocked me more than anything else was the idea that this was a sequel..... What possibly could have come before this piece of trash. Believe me I won't inflict it on myself. If you see this book sitting on a shelf run the other direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected","review":"A fine low budget film.

Anne Schroeder chooses every word so carefully that with each sentence the reader is drawn into the story of her family. The opening chapter, Sweet Partings, tenderly and lovingly bids farewell to Nana, the author's grandmother and the book's inspiration. As Schroeder and her family deal with the loss of their much loved matriarch, the reader feels the strength of familial ties and is brought back in time to a less complicated, more idealistic era. I found Branches on the Conejo a very heart warming and inspirational book, a much needed reminder of the value of a supportive, hard working, and loving family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee's worst movie.","review":"I bought this expecting it to be good because I like Christopher Lee.

Not really going to rehash the story here, but give my opinion of it. Story was alright, not what I expected with the title \\"The Pack\\" which was a pleasant surprise cuz you're figuring werewolves. The rest of the book though was pretty darn slow. Far too many characters to keep track of and it takes forever for Jonathon Crowley to show up. I am interested in how this will conclude so it's still worth reading to keep up with the story for \\"Dark Carnival\\". Overall, just not enough suspense and too slow of pace to rate anymore stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality maintained","review":"After setting up the dark historical background and giving a brief introduction to present day Serenity Falls in the first book of this trilogy, Writ in Blood, Moore gets down to telling the story of the curse taking effect in the town. The social fabric of the town is efficiently set out, particularly those who will become a tool for the coming evil.As with the first book, Moore has crafted a real page turner that is difficult to put down. He can let his most memorable character not make his entrance until halfway through without impacting this reader's enjoyment. Moore gives just enough description to fire the reader's imagination, allowing the rare piece of graphic detail to have a larger impact.Looking forward to reading the final book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good indeed!","review":"I read the first one in the series (which I gave 5 stars) and this one is very good, but gets a little confusing with the number of characters.Still I would recommend getting this one too.

Not even close. His idea is a bit 'done before', but that's not really the main problem. Where King creates well-rounded characters, Moore simply gives you a cardboard cutout of the person and then kills them off two chapters later. There's so many characters, it's hard to figure out who is who BECAUSE they aren't well-developed. And because the story is all for shock value ie: many people killed, but we're not really quite sure why (except for the husband of the woman killed as a witch), you quickly lose interest.I bought the first and the second ones in the series together, but wouldn't buy any further books. Stephen King makes people think that writing these kind of books easy. Stephen King, however, is a master storyteller, which definitely shows up when you see the difference between any of his books and something like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lo mejor de la musica de Bolero en Mexico","review":"Recordar es Volver a Vivir!!

I liked the Advanced Fighting Techniques and Workout tape the best -- which is the real reason I bought these tapes anyway.

Lenny Magill is the same age I am and is in really great shape which is his own testament as to the effectiveness of this workout. The downside to these tapes is that they are a bit disjointed in places -- and he should have spent a little longer on martial arts basics for those who don't know the proper way to throw a front kick, side kick, knee, jab, whatever.

It is also a perfect gift for anyone you know who is mis-guided when it comes to responsible pet ownership. I and my entire organization give this book 2 thumbs up.

It dispels the myth that animal shelters can always provide an unlimited supply of new and better lives for pets that we find are no longer convenient, although the shelters do everything in their power to reach this unattainable goal nonetheless.This book illustrates the consequences behind our love for purebred animals, and exposes the often unscrupulous industry that supplies them. it will make you think carefully about the choices you have made about pets in the past, and it may change the choices you make in the future. It did so for me, and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about animal shelters and people who own animals","review":"This book was a great read. It focused as much on people who own(and sometimes abuse) animals as the animals themself. It delves into the everyday workings of an animal shelter in detail (which is not all fun and games). I think this book should be read by anyone considering adopting an animal because it is also a resource on how to find the one for you. I will definately adopt all my future pets from shelters rather than purchasing them from a pet store after reading this book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was hoping for a little bit more James Herriot type stories with happy endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.

If you know someone who's not sure about getting a pet, I highly suggest they read this book. It'll make them think twice. If you know someone with misconceptions that all shelter animals get homes, give them this book as a wakeup call! A pet can take up as much or more of your time than a human baby, but the human race has made dogs, cats and other animals disposeable.

I ordered the \\"Sahara Beige\\" which on both the Amazon and Flexi-leash websites appeared to have a pearlescent sheen. It does not. It is a flat, putty-like color. It's ok, just not what I was expecting. If I had known what it was really like I probably would have chosen another color, but it hasn't bothered me enough to return it. The leash itself seems to work fine. I had a cord version of this leash before and now that I have the tape kind I realized that the tape is much better. The handle itself is a little bit slippery because of the slick nature of the plastic. If your hands are sweaty or wet it might be hard to keep a strong hold if you have a hard-pulling dog. I think the ultimate flexi leash would have a rubberized, non-slip handle and have the tape extend up to 26 feet as some cord versions do. And, of course, they would be pearlescent and pretty. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flexi Elegance Retractable Leash","review":"I love the Flexi Elegance Retractable Leash!

A marriage of French art film and horror movie, this is not your typical film. The basic premise is that Jenny, the troubled daughter of a murdered Judge, is abandoned in Rome by her floozy mother. Yet Jenny is happy in her circumstance, because at 12 she has unlimited freedom, until her grandmother, Rose, comes to bring her back to America. Jenny proceeds to launch a campaign of murder and terror on her grandmother, tutor, and all of Rome.While this movie is a marriage of art and horror, it's a rocky marriage at best. At times the movie descends into wackiness, with an original song track of cute songs that at times distracts from the scene. The ending is beyond horror, into an odd, head scratching finale. Jenny is utterly unlikable, which makes the film hard to enjoy.Overall, not the best movie out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of those where the box cover is better than the movie!","review":"I saw the cover to the movie and after reading the synopsis on the back decided to rent. Sounded original and the wolve mask appeared somewhat frightening at first glance. Then I watched the movie. I am a major horror movie fan and have seen some crap in my day. Yes, this was a disappointing movie. But it certainly was not the worst. It at least was done on somewhat decent quality film and not amateur like alot of horror movies. The idea behind the story is very original (tying in a fairy tale and ridding the world of sinners, Sleepaway Camp 2 and 3). Even some of the incidents are somewhat amusing. Sadly enough, the main character is the worst actor. The grandmother wins best actor. What ruins the film is the horrible ending. That scene could have been done creepier with less cheese and saved the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh...","review":"The other reviews pretty much cover this movie to death (pun intended) and are pretty accurate.

If you've read the other reviews then you don't need another recap. Let it suffice to say that Susan Satta is fantastic. Watch this film and you'll be rewarded with an original tale (how often have you been able to say that about a movie in the last 20 years?) and a glimpse of what a determined little girl can do. You won't be disappointed. I wish movies of this caliber weren't so rare.

The sales office never returned my call. When I called customer service again, they said fax them the receipt and they would send me a new filter holder. Again, nothing. This filter holder was for the ground coffee (not pods) so I figured because I didn't use feature very often I would live with it.

The machine seems well built and reliable, but it failed the real test - making a decent espresso. We found it produced a very watery espresso overall, even after experimenting with different grinds (we don't have a burr grinder, btw). A few other small details were bothersome, like the inability to get anything other than a small teacup underneath to catch the espresso, and a pretty strange system of buttons and indicators to run the brewing process. We ended up buying a Capresso #101 (a bit more expensive and no longer produced, but if you can find one its a good deal) and are very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent value","review":"I have been using this thing for 2 weeks non-stop. Are there better machines out there? Sure, but this one gets you in the game with a pump machine for [very little money]. It is fairly easy to clean, espresso is messy no matter what, though.I could have spent a ton more, but I like the lattes and this works great for making them. I am sure the quality of the espresso is sub-par compared to the [more expensive] machines but so what? It all gets doctored up anyway.Two things. 1- espresso comes out at 160 degrees max. That might bother true espresso fans, not me. 2- steamer can do two 12oz lattes and then needs about 5 mins to reheat. Not a big deal for my wife and I but could be if you want one of these for dinner parties and such.Overall I am totally pleased with my purchase and would buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!","review":"I bought the Apollo as an entry-level espresso machine, so I wasn't expecting grand things. However, after about a week of moderate use, the pump seems to have malfunctioned - the espresso now only comes out in slow drips. It now takes about 15 minutes to brew two shots of espresso.Specific complaints:1. Poor quality construction - witness the already-broken pump.2. Even when working, the machine didn't produce hot espresso - I needed to warm it in the microwave.3. The steaming wand doesn't extend far enough from the machine to allow easy steaming, and (despite the hint given in other comments here) doesn't detach easily for cleaning.Positives:1. Price.2. Good espresso when the pump worked.3. Produces lots of steam quickly after brewing coffee.I'd guess from the range of comments here that the construction quality of the Apollo is very uneven.

One major disagreement: the author makes the assumption that any advanced alien culture would have just as much rapid change as we have. I believe this would indicate the beings to be from Earth.

Well, dare i say it i felt the humour pretty childish and repetitive.

I found it extremely stable (it doesn't rock or shift at all when I use it) and effective. I think any juicer would leave a little unpressed fruit if you're trying to do something thats very large (some oranges are as big as grapefruit), but a little preparation goes a long way. If I have to use a big orange I just cut it into 3 or 4 pieces (instead of halves) and get great results. If I'm pressing a navel orange with very thick skin, I'll take a knife and quickly chop off some of the rind. That seems to help too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great juicer","review":"I've had this juicer for a few years and it's a reliable, strong appliance. I like that it squeezes the citrus rather than pulverizing it. You get only juice - not the connective membranes or peels that make juice sour. We have orange and lemon trees in our yard and use it often to make orange juice and to squeeze lemons for lemonade (5 lemons=1 cup of juice, add 1 cup sugar and 5 cups water). It takes two hands - one to hold the left handle and one to pull down the lever, but the gearing makes it easy to apply a lot of force to the citrus. Yes, the juicer is tall and won't fit under a cabinet and may be cumbersome to store away, but it is handy to have out and looks just fine in the narrow upper-cabinet-free space next to the sink. Most of the parts come off for easy washing in the dishwasher and the rest can be washed in the sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilot Point Tip a Big Plus and a Bigger Minus","review":"I used these bits for a heavy duty job drilling both wood and aluminum.

So once the Tip is dull you'll either need to sharpen it, which is difficult because its so small, or throw away the bit.Its a real shame because until the tip dulled the bits did a fantastic job.

I believe Pinetop was well into his 70's when he recorded this amazing debut album following a long stint with Muddy Waters. Songs like GOT MY MOJO WORKIN and the title song AFTER HOURS are performed with great enthusiasm and power by Perkins and the band. Pinetop also displays a light, playful side on PINETOPS BOOGIE. There is not a weak song in the set. This is truly a \\"must have\\" album for blues enthusiasts, and music fans in general. Disregard the other review. Not only is the English poor, but so is the critique!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got my Mojo Workin'","review":"This kind of song has a deep feeling of blues and also has the corus behind, what give to the song some feeling of gospel song.

But nope, I'm terribly disappointed. The disc is only 2.73GB when put in a computer (where the old one was dual-layer), has NO captions or subtitles whatsoever, and not even surround sound, ONLY English stereo. It's the same blue-tinted 4:3 fullscreen transfer as the earlier Miramax DVD, but this disc has no special features like that one did.It's as if they took the original release, stripped it of all its extras and subtitles, and shoved it on a new disc. Avoid this one, hopefully the Blu-Ray will be proper.

Maybe even Ash and MIsty would fall in love! But, nope. The dudes who are creating these movies are sucking kids in with exclusive Pokemon cards, and the animation is just getting cheaper. This movie is totally different from the original movies and the TV series, and it sucks. I'll hold on to the older series and DVD's, but, nowadays, Brock and Misty are gone, and it's just boring without them. For those who agree with me, get the message out there that Pokemon is going down the tubes and it stinks. Bring back Brock and Misty!!! IT WILL SAVE THE SERIES! Oh, and I'm only giving this movie two stars because they went so far as to make a movie about something so ridiculous, with so much change, and so little things the same. :-( Boo."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was fantastic!!!!","review":"I loved it.

At least for those of use that saw the moive.This is a must see for the whole family, it's very lovable, it's amzaing how well the plot is in this one, and once more, the story is very moving, I'm getting the DVD, no buts about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Product Info","review":"It says in the product info that this DVD is in widescreen format, but I was upset to find out that it was full screen.

This movie is awesome, the animation is detailed and beautiful, once again they use a lot of computer animation but it's blended much better than in Pokemon 4ever (the 4th film). The new characters are fun and the movie introduces you to a whole new side of Ash, because he gets a crush! How cute, huh? The story line is great, a little sad at the end, but what's a movie without strong emotions? I definatley think this movie deserves more than 5 out of 5 stars, more like 10 out of 5. It's my all time favorite and I am SO psyched for it to come out on DVD.

It doesn't have much structure at all and at the end of the ab segments she just tells you to basically do whatever you want. The production quality is beautiful and the music is great - I just wish it was slightly more traditional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something different for the stomach","review":"This is my first Shiva Rea workout that I have done.This is definitely one of the more unique core exercise DVDs out there. Not too many have instructors that tell you to improvise during the course of the ab workout.Deceptively easy, if you perform the flow correctly, you will feel it the next day. Takes a little getting used to the flow, for me a few times through. On the new-agey side of yoga in feel and flavor, if that bothers you skip this one. A lot of leaning back while on your knees (example, the front cover of the DVD). There's a little bit of dance/rhythm to this, but really it's about a flowy rhythm.The 35 minutes can be broken up into three segments, and the segments are distinct and of different styling.I purchased this to add to my existing regimen of running and gym weightlifiting, and this seems to serve that purpose. Currently in my workout DVD rotation."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointing...","review":"Like some other reviewers, I found this workout to be a little weird. It lacked instructions, which is what I was expecting when I purchased this DVD. The music can also get irritating after a while. I assume it would be great for creative types, but then again, if one were creative enough to do their own yoga/ab workout, one wouldn't need to purchase a DVD for such a workout, right? Anyways, I did all three parts and didn't feel much afterwards. I have been practicing yoga for about a year so I am familiar with most poses, yet in this DVD not many yoga poses were used (just planks and the like).I feel so disappointed I wish that I could return this DVD, but obviously cannot anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU'LL FEEL IT","review":"there is only one shiva and this will work the core like no other yoga program. as typical shiva there is a big dance element and very 'flowy'. may not be for everyone but it is a beautiful practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Core Workout","review":"The first thing you notice about this DVD is the breathtaking scenery--it's filmed in White Sands National Park, New Mexico.The roughly 35-minute workout is divided into three segments: Water Core, Spontaneous Core, and Fire Core.

It is very much about \\"move on your own\\" \\"feel the music and work your abs\\" The background music is trance drumming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluid, freestyle ab workout","review":"For those who desire a break from the mundane abs crunch workout, this video features a freestyle way of engaging your core muscles. Once you perform this, it seems natural that there are many very fluid movements for tightening up the abs, and in the process improving flexibility. I also find it to be somewhat meditative, and definately de-stressing. It is very creative. Although I still do my crunches and standard stomach exercises, using this DVD with the wonderful music in the background once or twice a week is a nice addition to my routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiva Rea gives you the most bang for your buck","review":"The length of these segments makes them perfect for a \\"before work\\" workout, or any time you want to include core work with another dvd that doesn't offer any.Even more remarkable is that Shiva has produced another dvd that is miles ahead of similarly priced competition. The cinematography and music are beautiful (just like on Yoga Shakti) and the sequence of movements is well thought out. If you've never seen one of Shiva's yoga dvds you will be shocked how much work some people are willing to put into a production, and how crummy other yoga dvds seem in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout in 30 min","review":"i love Shiva's other yoga dvd's, as always i really feel the workout and the movements, you can feel your body tone and work and she makes all the moves easy to follow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Video and sound is skipping.","review":"Has anyone had issues with this video skipping?

I rented it from the library and plan to purchase it. I usually read reviews before buying and had to write a review because I can't believe the complaints about this DVD. It's creative abs because she gives you the tools to take the basic of what she shows you and express yourself. Go somewhere with it. It's awesome. Do we have to be so programmed that we're unable to do creative work? The only think I wished is to do some of the ab postures a little more to get a deeper workout. However over all my core felt the work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"After reading most of the positive reviews, I chose to purchase this program and was eager for the arrival-much to my disappointment.

This DVD definitely does that. I have tried various Abs DVDs that claim they really beat your Abs down, but after awhile I found that most overlapped on quite a few exercises. This DVD though is very new and creative and works your Abs in a different way. I agree with another reviewer that it's nice to use your whole body to work your core. I like the water workout the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy this if you like yoga","review":"This DVD does give you a good ab workout, but there are a lot of yoga moves that are difficult for a beginner.

Not impressed- but i had sore abs afterwards, I am embarrased to ever do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"no instructions at all","review":"This was like watching someone do a belly dance on her back, but there is no instruction!

I was disappointed, but maybe it works for others who like this free form style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiva Rea is a cool cucumber!","review":"Shiva Rea takes is very unconventional when she takes you on a journey to your core. She talks about more than just muscle and twists--she talks about where your power derives from and how to harness it and be creative with in it. If you are tired of crunches and sit-ups you will enjoy this video! She is very creative and you can go as fast or as slow as you need.

I have enough experience in Yoga but still found this very difficult. I got dizzy trying to follow her. The exercises could be great, except, she needs to re-create this DVD with better instructions and camera angles (Shiva! Are you out there? Please pay attention).

Perhaps Jillian Michaels should help out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I can't believe I'm writing about the same book as all the other reviewers. This book is terrible.

A friend gave me the Russian version of the first book, and I was quite interested to see how it went. To be blunt, it is poorly translated, and appears to be the result of the Russian publisher hoping to get something on the shelves as soon as possible. A great deal of Rowling's humor lies in her turns of phrase, and the translator made only half-hearted attempts to convey these, if he made the attempt at all. I frequently wondered about his grasp of the English language. Most baffling to me was that the translator changed Neville's pet toad into a turtle--but only on some pages. I cannot recommend this book even as a curiosity, since that would only encourage the publisher to continue putting out shoddy work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter makes it to Russia","review":"I have been reading the Harry Potter novels for ages, and they will always be my favorite.

But last year, while visiting my family in Russia, I found and bought the translated version of books 1-4.In my oppinion, the translation wasn't perfect, and not as good as it could have been. Nothing much was changed, but I found a strange loss of humor. I was more than surprised to find that my friends were also reading these books in Russia, and I'm happy with the translation since it's better than nothing. I suggest if you know or are learning Russian, and have read Harry Potter in another language, that you definately buy this book to compare.

Now imagine one of those padded out to feature length and you have this film.The acting is horrible, everything takes place off camera since there was obviously no budget for any kind of special effects. The few times a makeup effect appears onscreen, the camera shakes all over the place like there was an earthquake during filming, while the image goes in and out of focus. This is done to hide the fact that the \\"makeup\\" is just a couple pieces of rubber glued onto the person's skin. It literally looks like they took a hunk of rubber, painted it pink and stuck it on the actors.You can find better amateur films on YouTube.Bad acting, bad effects, bad camera work, and a bad story add up to a bad movie!

First of all, the samples and dubs seem incongruous, moving from one extreme mood to another as each cut proceeded. This is music that's undefinable, shifting from rock to ambient, to something in between. I'm sorry. I just don't get this music. But given the enthusiasm of the reviews gathered here, it's clear that there are people who enjoy this music and are hearing something profound in it that I am not. Or maybe I haven't chosen the right Lemon Jelly disc to which to listen. But this one really burned me. I mean, in one hundred years, will anyone be listening to this group? That may seem like an unfair standard, but if artists would just _try_ harder and write better music (certainly music better than this) the world would be a lot better off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Testimony to what would come...","review":"\\"Mis Primeras Grabaciones\\" is a re-print of Selena's first Freddie Album.

He had given up opera for oratorio. And his oratorios here come close to opera. Indeed Semele and Hercules from the same period have frequently been produced as operas. These works freed Handel from the restraints of baroque opera. So he could focus more on the drama.In Belshazzar it all comes together. It's a Handel music drama, and it's a marvel. Glorious music. Good drama. Jacobs and his troop do a superb job. The production is minimal but quite effective. It furthers the plot rather than going against it as so many productions do todaty. No trenchcoats.If you like Handel you must see this production. And if you think that Italian baroque is not your cup of tea, you will still be enchanted with Berlshazzar. There are no extras but the included booklet is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Feels like I've spent a month or two or three with Clarissa, traipsing the countryside shooting game, getting away with antics in law school, and of course cooking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"20th-century music for violin and piano","review":"Graf Mourja and his duo partner Elena Rozanova offer technically assured renditions in this interesting collection of twentieth-century music for violin and piano. Ravel's Tzigane, of course, has a huge number of competing versions on disc, and Mourja's reading comes off as a bit too restrained and Gallically elegant rather than abandoned, at least for this listener's taste. Similarly, the Blues movement of Ravel's Sonata has been projected with more lowdown humor than is the case here. The prizes of this CD are the Schnittke Sonata, a large-scale, closely knit and intensely emotional piece, reconciling twelve-tone and tonal textures with moving results; and the Szymanowski Nocturne and Tarantelle, which pairs perfumed exoticism with bacchanalian revelry in an technically taxing display. This latter work in particular is tossed off with superb aplomb by these two performers, making for an exciting conclusion to this recital."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Like McGonagall","review":"I gave this hat to my son's girlfriend and she looked great.

It's incoherent at many levels, most notably concerning the switch from the accepted idea in part one that beauty is always particular, to the claims in part two that it is a function of certain qualities, especially symmetry. Asthetic symmetry promotes ethical justice? The idea of beauty as enlivening is also too simple. This is not good enough as a theory of the link between aesthetics and ethics. The account of the so called 'political complaints' against beauty is a set of caricatures. There is also a very weak accounts of Matisse, whose Nice paintings are regarded by Scarry as stand ins for real windows and real palm trees; some sense of what modernist art has done to the concept of beauty and why is needed here. There are many better books on the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a gift, you must open it!","review":"This book may change your entire outlook on beauty and justice.

The reviewer equally clearly has a problem with the English language, since Scarry's tiny book -- 8 oz., 5\\" by 7 1/2\\" -- is by no stretch of the imagination a \\"tome.\\" Now, stretching the imagination is what \\"On Beauty\\" is all about -- how beauty can, among other things, inspire us to creation. Connect-the-dots logicians, quite naturally, will not approve, but they can't see the point for the dots. One may agree or disagree with Scarry's thesis, but wholesale dismissal of the kind below simply smacks of bad faith. Fitting that a book about beauty should so clearly expose the ugliest in its detractors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last reviewer dosn't know a thing about lesbian witches.","review":"This bumper sticker is perfect.

The focus is on the struggle to create a modern democracy, as attempts at reform (especially agricultural reform) are stymied repeatedly by an electorate that includes only the wealthy landowners: \\"in Moldova, a population of nearly 2,000,000 was represented by only 1,724 voters, while in Muntenia, some 2,500,000 people resulted in 2,072 voters.\\" Complicating political reform further is fear of the growing Jewish minority in Moldova, and the obnoxious political usage to which that fear is put.

My recommendation is to go to a home improvement store where you can purchase pressure treated wood (and where they will cut it into pieces for you)- just some 4X4's for the corners, plywood for the floor and walls and roof, and some screws.

But in this book, all of the strips from 1995 are published. The strips aren't the best in Peanuts history (I think Schulz did his best work in the 1970's), but they still are interesting to review. This was a period when Schulz did away with his typical four panel weekday strip and mixed things up (with many of his strips being just one large panel).Since the new Fantagraphics series, which will publish all of the Peanuts strips in order over a 12+ year period won't get to the 1995 season for about 10 years, this book is a must for the Peanuts collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bike for the money","review":"The bike arrived via super saver in 2 days and in terrific condition.

The second time I realized what happened and looking closer at the pad I could see how the pavement ground the edge of the pad down, pulled it off my arm and now I'm nursing two huge raspberries on my elbows.They might protect you from falling straight down, but if you slide on the pavement these pads are not going to work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junior size is very small","review":"We got the Junior size based on what we read.

Recorded at the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1985, this album presents virtually his entire set. [Note: The album is a bit short at 39:16.] Rush's soulful vocals and stinging guitar leads are featured throughout, especially on the instrumental \\"Tops,\\" one of three originals (\\"Right Place, Wrong Time\\" and \\"Keep On Lovin' Me Baby\\" are the other two). Rush also does some extended soloing on the nearly 9-minute cover of B.B. King's \\"Gambler's Blues.\\" The nearly 8-minute instrumental \\"I Wonder Why\\" is a highlight. Rush is ably backed by a six-piece band, including a horn section.

How do we know the alarms are false? First, the alarm isn't continuous. The unit sounds long enough to get us out of bed and get our hearts pounding and then stops. Second, the display reads 0 ppm CO. Third, when we check the peak level of CO it is always below the threshold level where CO would be a concern. I have tried replacing the battery even though \\"LB\\" is not displayed. The result is the same behavior and frustration a week or two later. Our first two units were the combined CO and explosive gases units which others have noted are problematic. However, we have had the same problem with this unit (CO only). Interestingly, the alarm usually sounds in the summer when we have the AC on, rather than when we are heating the house with natural gas. I'm wondering if others have had this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"long lasting and able to detect levels as low as 11 ppm","review":"This is probably the best CO detector on the market. It will last you 7 years - the cheaper non-digital detectors will only last 2 years and will end up costing you much more money in the long run.The best feature is the peak level dectector which will allow you to monitor carbon monixide levels as low as 11 ppm (the alarm will go off if ppms excede 50). There are some reports and studies that show that a constant exposure to low level carbon monoxide gas can cause long term health problems - so this is a handy way to check different parts of your house for this.I am suprised at the Amazon price for this. I got this at Home Depot in West Roxbury MA for $49.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I, have been buying Kidde products for years. In, my opinion, they are the best on the market.

Yes, folks, a carbon monoxide detector that needs both an electrical current AND a battery to run. Yet, according to the information, the battery is supposedly for backup. I took the bad battery out - this caused the alarm to scream at me (and it's very loud too). Put a new battery in - the the alarm still screamed at me. I can't even use the thing now because all it does is scream, telling me the brand new battery is low.

Took me 15 minutes of holding my finger on the disable button while trying to get the battery out - but that is not the issue, I guess (you should have seen me, though - I was hitting it at one point - alarms that loud and are horrifying when you have already gotten the message and CANNOT disable it without tools). Like another tester, this alarm still went off when I took it outside - ambient air made no difference. It was a malfunction and it was not the 'malfunction beep' pattern.

My basement filled with combustible gas.While this unit is not a combustible gas detector, the alarm sounded. It was loud enough for me to hear upstairs and I was able to shut off the gas and ventilate the area. I don't know what would have happened if I didn't have a detector. I am trying not to think too hard about it.If you don't have a detector, go buy one today. They are cheap, and many units (like this one), require ZERO installation.

A quick look at the two manholes further down the block and they had even more smoke. You could hear what sounded like a massive electrical short under the street. So bad it was actually vibrating the street. A quick call to Con Ed (Electric Company here in NY) and 911 and emergency services showed up. Evacutated about a dozen houses because they all had detectable CM levels. But only I had a detector. I would have to say it kept dozens of people from getting sick or worse.

It super light, smells delicious (but not over powering),and makes my skin nice and soft. It's the only thing I've ever been able to use on my face without breaking out or seeming greasy.

Sure enough, we tried it on a few other volunteers and everyone said the same thing.This lotion is light, and doesn't feel greasy after applying it - so it has that going for it.

I use organic coconut oil all the time as a shave oil, for smoothing my hair, and on chapped lips. It's great, so I thought that Skin Trip would basically be that experience in lotion form.The lotion is nice as far as moisturizing properties, the texture is good, and it absorbs in to my skin quite well but the added fragrance is overpowering, sickeningly sweet, and just unnecessary. I can't smell like a Baskin Robbins all day, it's just too migraine-inducing. Someone call me when they make a perfume-free version. It would be different if this literally smelled like coconut -it is after all one of the main ingredients, but it has been heavily scented. I somehow doubt that this is an 'original' formula, especially given the silicones etc on the ingredient list.

You will know when you are getting close because your hands will begin to become frostbitten. Allow the libation to rest for a couple of minutes while you prepare the glass. The idea is to pour clear liquid, not a foggy solution. If your drink tastes like glacier air, then you have created the perfect martini.

We have seen three seasons in the Series and enjoy them very much. It is great family entertainment for children 12 and older. I'm afraid that smaller children will spend too much of viewer's time and attention asking questions. However, there is little or no foul language (and it's mild at that) and very little nudity outside of that one might catch a glimpse of in the routine of living in rural 19th Century England. My wife thoroughly enjoy the great story, the many well developed characters, and the truely professional presentation. One is transported mentally, as an observer, to a very interesting and, in some ways, fun and much less hectic life of an English country village, Lark Rise, and it supporting country town, Candleford.

You care about them, so you WANT to know what happens to them. My only beef is that near the end of this series, it started to feel like a paranormal soap opera. I mean, what's with the premonitions?

Senior citizens who can't stand the sound of hard rock/heavy metal will love this collection. Afterall,many of the songs were hits during their younger days. The material is a lot like some of the songs on 1990's DON'T EXPLAIN. However on this album,there are either re-releases or alternate versions of DE and YOU'RE MY THRILL,also from DE. The late great Robert Palmer is so elegantly dressed in a tuxedo,surrounded by orchestra musicians in the cover photo. Palmer was a fan of easy listening artists like the late Nat King Cole,the late Billie Holliday and the late legendary Frank Sinatra.

Alas, Will could not keep his political bent from infusing into his writing style, which was way too intellectual, and his feelings about the game(the DH has ruined the tradition of baseball!). At the end I learned 3 things: being a Cubs fan means suffering, the Baltimore Orioles are the greatest franchise in baseball history, and George Steinbrenner is an anathema to the game. Unfortunately, a series of pieces written at various times becomes repetitious and Will often mentions the same thing over and over. It shouldn't be a struggle to read a baseball book and I found myself anticipating the end of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"George popped up this bunt into a double play!","review":"I cherished Men At Work. I further fostered my love of the game with his classic tale. Bunts has a few interesting tales and tidbits but overall fails to live up to the predecessor.

Or are these his scraps left over from Men At Work?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too \\"gwill\\" opinionated and not enough objectivity","review":"just because george says it, doesn't make it true. in my opinion george strayed from his usual objective baseball writing in this book. sorry george, this one didn't hit it out of reading rainbow park!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball, Philosophy, Politics and Humor. What a treat!","review":"George Will's ability to weave the fabric of Baseball into everyday life is incredible. I found myself wondering, after finishing this wonderful book, had read a book about Baseball or Mr. Will's philosophy of life? Bunts is a copulation of magazine and newpaper articles written by Mr. Will over the last three decades. His strings them together so that there is never an obvious seam and it flows as if it were written at one time. I found myself laughing constantly at the humor that is ever present in the game and magnified my Mr. Will's writing. If you are a fan of the \\"worlds most wonderful game\\" and if in addition you are a fan of Mark Twain's you will love this book. Thank you George Will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable and unique, but not without caveats","review":"The book should come with a large disclaimer: A GREAT DEAL OF THE MATERIAL IN THIS BOOK WAS ALREADY PUBLISHED IN WILL'S PREVIOUS BOOK, MEN AT WORK. I would estimate 40-60% in fact. In addition, Will apparently still only knows how to write two kinds of sentences, one of them so laden with commas that one would have enough time to engage in foreplay during all the pauses. Is this is what Will was doing while writing it? Still, the book is still worth reading since few others are writing so intelligently about the game. And it is interesting to see all in one book this supposed conservative's attitudes change toward things like the Designated Hitter rule, Ted Williams and free agency. San Francisco readers will especially appreciate the tribute to broadcaster Jon Miller, even if the facts it recounts differ somewhat from those in Miller's own excellent and much more readable book, CONFESSIONS OF A BASEBALL PURIST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good -- But Others Are Better","review":"Has anyone else read _Off Base_ by Andrew Torrez?

RUCHA! just because look whether the original Japanese said rucha or not it doesn't matter they meant to say lucha. You can go to the Japanese track with subtitles to avoid the voice acting but that does not change the poor transition.That brings me to the second point bland menus and no extras and not even a play all button or scene select whats up with that?

What would Charlotte, such a brilliant correspondant, have written to Arthur Bell Nicholls, the man who eventually b/c her husband? What would Emily, such a terse correspondant, have written to Charlotte while she was in Brussels. Barker attempts to balance the book by including Emily and Anne's diary papers.

I adore animals and I have many of them. Of course that I feel great when I spend my time with them. They are good friends. One of the problems with this book is that the author didn't use the right title; the appropriate title would be \\" Animals as our friends\\". The book is actuallly the collection of different stories which the author received from many different people. And, in every story we can see just a good relationship between humans and animals.I've expected to find out in what way animals could be \\"used\\" in some particular treatments. I know that there are some clinics where animals are good \\"medicaments\\" for mental patients and not only for them.

The stories are profound and touching beyond words. Animals are definitely \\"man's best friend\\" and it seems to be proven over and over again in this book, with each tale telling a compelling and poignent story of how an animal touched the life of someone in need. In my own perception of it......animals are true angels, put on this earth to help us and guide us along our own journeys. We should be thankful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animals as Teachers and Healers","review":"This is the Best book that I have read and I have read quite a few books. I purchased this book in a train station in Washington, DC because I had a long time between trains returning to Pittsburgh from North Carolina. After I started reading this book, I could not stop. I read most of it in the train station and finished it when I arrived home. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the various stories about the animals. When I read some stories, I cried because of what happened to the animals. In some of the stories, animals risked their own lives to save a human life. I love animals very much and for anyone who loves animals, this is the book to read. The author, Susan Chernak McElroy is an exceptional writer and I would purchase any book she writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great DVD of a great collaboration","review":"I saw this on Ovation TV and loved it so much I wanted to own it.

The last chapter in this book is dynamic in that it teaches us the difference between purpose-driven prayer and problem-centered prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This book is so great! As a morbidly fat, bitter person with no hopes of establishing a long-term relationship that might produce children, I got plenty of value from this book. Now I can sublimate and legitamize my sense of grief and overwhelming self-loathing by sounding intelligent in my bitter hatred of those who have what I never will. God I hate those pregnant women who get to park close to the supermarket door while I have to waddle in from the second row! It's discrimination! I also like the neato politically correct terms that I can apply to myself (\\"child free\\" - it's so cute!) and the nasty names I get to call other people (\\"breeders\\" - take THAT Mr. and Mrs. Happy!).So, if you're bitter like me, you will love this book. Buy it today and enjoy better living through rationalized hatred of other people!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems backwards to me","review":"I don't really understand Burkett's thesis at all. It seems to me that raising future generations is a social obligation. Someone has to do it. One could reasonably argue that society ought to pay all of the costs of raising children. Instead, in our society, 90% of the costs and the work are borne by those who volunteer to be parents.Burkett does a reasonable job of analyzing how society subsidizes child raising in various rather minimal ways. But our taxes subsidize research, oil exploration, military defense, and all sorts of other things that are socially desirable. If your house catches fire, taxes pay a hundred percent of the cost of putting out the fire, not just a small fraction. As long as raising children costs more than the financial benefits (and it certainly does, by a long shot), why should we think that those subsidies are too large? Burkett doesn't have a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Sigh*","review":"I remember before I became a parent and those that were already would tell me I had no idea how it would change my life and I thought to myself, \\"oh yeah, right. I've got a good imagination.\\" But they were oh so right. I had no clue! Kind of like the author to this book. American is family-friendly? News to the rest of us! Maybe there are some inequities, and some frustrating imbalances where the author did her research, or where some of these other reviewers live, but everywhere I've looked being a parent costs a great deal of power and possibility. Parenting is about the larger spiritual picture of humanity. If children are important, it's because what this world is like ten, fifty, and a hundred years from now is more important than any one life today. With such ignorance, luxury, and malevolence this author writes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting!","review":"HI, I chose not to have children by choice and to suggest that some companys are cheating the childless is insulting.

It not only confirms all of my suspicions about how we child-free are being discriminated against, but it showed me many more reasons I should be worried. Discrimination stinks, no matter what. And this book brings to the forefront a very subtle discrimination that hurts active, productive contributors to society, only to favor \\"breeders\\" and their spawn. I'm an extremist who would love to see mandatory classes, parenting licenses and required income levels in order to have a baby. So whereas Elinor's book is a great start, we need to keep moving on and making this issue even more important."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wakeup call","review":"This book confirms what I have suspected all along but have been afraid to say. It's sad that there is such a divisiveness between parents and the childfree, but unless something is done to correct these inequities, the bitterness will only get worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh view in a pronatalist world.","review":"Finally, a book that throws mud in the face of America's obsession with pronatalism.

My husband and I have chosen not to - we can't afford the time or the money and (here's my big, dirty secret) I don't want to! I would never suggest to someone else that she should *not* have children - it's a choice. Too bad I'm not granted the same respect. I resent \\"women's issues\\" meaning \\"mothers' issues.\\" Am I now some sort of third gender? I am so glad this book was written to give voice to what we all know happens every day. The Baby Boon raises issues that many people would just as soon keep quiet - and it's about time somebody wrote about them. I especially appreciated the story about the New York Times columnist who had the temerity to suggest that maybe life was about making choices and was promptly ripped to pieces in the press. How dare anyone suggest that motherhood comes with any adverse consequences?"},{"rating":"1","title":"who told you that America is child-friendly?!","review":"Raising children is a very hard work, but, as most other industrialzied countries have realized, it is one of the most important jobs outthere. Our children will be the ones taking care of us, curing us, cooking for us, making our clothes etc. and most importantly moving the economy forward so that we ALL can enjoy a retirement. It is only fair, that those who do not raise their own children chip in to help those who do. United States is NOT family-friendly. It is the only industrialized country with NO maternity leave, and daycare costs are higher than college tuition. The child tax-credit is ridiculous and doesn't help all that much. Stop whining and thank those who choose to have children inspite of all of the difficulties and costs involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"CF People of the world unite!","review":"Finally, someone says what needs to be said. Despite all the PC bullcrap about treating people equally and giving everyone equal opportunities the truth of the matter is revealed. Our economic system favors one choice (bearing children) over another (being childfree). For the childfree, it gives credit to what we experienced for years. For the childed, it is a book that threatens the very entitlements that discriminate against the childfree. This is an amazing powerful book that needs to be read by all. Warning to Entitlement Parents: Your Golden Age will Soon End."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boon, baby, boon!","review":"Elinor Burkett points out that Clinton administration tax breaks go only to the well-to-do; poor children don't have a lobby in Washington. So the spenders keep spending (mommy vans, SUVs, home theater systems, ski vacations, designer child togs...but they're all FOR THE CHILDREN, doncha know) and the childfree by choice foot an unfair tax bill. Not to mention shouldering an unequal load at the office and largely having their employee benefit plan needs ignored. (Fat lot of good adoption benefits do for those who will never adopt.)Burkett includes a valuable historic exposition on how we came to this pass and how feminists sold out women who choose not to be mothers. She tries to be very clear that she (like many other childfree people) does not hate children, but inevitably this message will be misinterpreted by the breeder corps. After all, if you don't have a dog, that must mean you're anti-canine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 90's Alternative music","review":"Please buy this CD! SOF is one of the most under-rated bands in history. There are lots of catchy songs in this compilation, such as \\"Take Me Anywhere\\" (their biggest hit), \\"Everyword\\", \\"Blackout\\", etc. SOF was a bona-fide Alternative band, and a fine one at that.

It rocks, it has intelligent lyrics, it has clean, beautiful melodies blended with straight up rock. It's well mixed and engineered, too, but it's the music that matters most... and these are simply great songs that you will sing in your head (or out loud) for days, after listening to them.

Jim Goll is not only a prophet, but he is a teacher! He explains prayer with Biblical examples from Genesis to Revelation! Another reason this book is so powerful is because he takes revelation knowledge that God has given him, and adds it to teaching from great men of God such as Charles Finney, Paul Cain, Jeanne Guyon, Kenneth Hagin, Dick Eastman, Rick Joyner, Derek Prince, and many others. This is a visionary book for people who want to see God soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and Edifying","review":"Jim Goll is a talented writer with an urgent message. This book serves as a call for believers to devote themselves to knowing the heart of the Lord, discerning the times and releasing grace through prayer. It is a challenging book if taken seriously.

That's the good news. The bad news is that many recipes are just doctored up cake mixes/canned fillings (which is not what anyone I know would give a gift), and a disproportionate number contain Cool Whip and/or require refrigeration, and will only last for a day or so -- but the author gives no hint about how long to keep things. Refrigerated items (such as dips) are bad enough in a cookbook intended for gift-giving, but they are mixed in with the other recipes -- so, if you're trying to find something to mail or travel with, you'll have to go through the entire book, looking at the bottom of each recipe.

The author bucks that trend and gives us an explanation of bioenergetics in a clear, gentle and understandable way. The conversational and informal style of writing allows the author to present topics as dry as electron transport and proton motive force in a way that is more than understandable, it is engaging and actually kind of fun! Brown never lets us forget that metabolic processes are amazing, awe-inspiring and inspirational. While Brown's coverage of basic physiology is excellent, later chapters get into areas (mental energy, etc.) where we really have a lot to learn. These chapters are necessarily heavier on speculation. There is a big and excellent appendix that presents a brief history of bioenergetics, and sources for further reading are provided."},{"rating":"2","title":"The simple energy always prevails","review":"The \\"Energy of Life\\" was full of technical information on mitochondria. Yet, the most practical information was simple. Guy C. Brown told me exactly what I wanted to know, if you want more energy now, do what you like to do. It sounds ridiculously easy, but it works. The problem is most of us most do things we hate. So, I guess we either need to start liking what we do, or do more of what we like, in order to have more energy.

The discussion of the movement from the pre-historic culture to a museum culture and after is fair and well-balanced and insightful about tourism, museology, and so on. And a decent map!!! Altogether great."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This book felt forced and pointless. I got the sense he'd said he was going to do a novel and had gotten an advance, and then he just felt obligated to turn in just anything. Because that's what this is: just anything. It's a numbing list of glitzy people and parties interlarded with whispered nuggets of OJ-iana. There's no plot, few fresh observations, and little insight into what happened. The character, Gus, if truly based on Dominick Dunne, reveals a sad and wearying self-disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heterosexual Truman Capote clone without the talent","review":"Pick a page, any page, PLEASE, as the recently dead Henny Youngman said. There will be at least one and usually several famous or notorious names, almost always a good friend of Gus/Dominick. Almost unreadable unless you subscribe to The Enquirer or The Star, and good evidence for the vacuity of Vanity Fair since Tina Brown left. Also, it is VERY POORLY edited, with numerous repeats, etc. If you want to read a crazy book about LA trials, try Gary Indiana's \\"Resentment\\". Mr. Indiana hated Dunne's book in his review in the LA Times, and also hated Mr. Dunne personally in \\"Resentment\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Simpson Trial Tour Guide","review":"Having read many of the accounts of the Simpson trial from the principals themselves, I looked forward to Dunne's slant on the saga. Perhaps, an experienced writer would place the trial and repercussions in some worthwhile perspective. Wrong. What Dunne delivers is a dizzying rampage through every possible gathering of any conceivable combination of \\"celebrities\\". Although the book is presented in a supposed fictional style, I cannot fathom what the distinction is meant to convey. While the book does include many interesting tidbits about the characters in and around the trial, it is weighted down by an encyclopedic accounting of the author's social encounters. Not my Own, reachs no insights into the ramifications of the Simpson affair larger than the authors resolute outrage. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUH-LEEZE!","review":"I have thoroghly enjoyed this author's previous books, especially the brilliant A SEASON IN PURGATORY from which an also excellent film version was made. Because I so admired Dominick Dunne's writing skills and had found his other books so compelling (I've read some of them more than once) I was eager to read ANOTHER CITY, NOT MY OWN and gladly paid for a hardbound copy as soon as they were available. That said, it is difficult to find adequate words to sum up my disappointment in this book. Inane, pretentious, self-promoting, fatuous and poorly written are some adjectives that come to mind. It is difficult to believe that the same author who produced AN INCONVENIENT WOMAN, THE TWO MRS. GRENVILLES, and A SEASON IN PURGATORY has turned out this poor, lazily-written piece of drivel. What *was* this author (not to mention the publisher)thinking about? Was an editor involved at all? Save your money: this book isn't even worth its price in paperback. Shame on you, Mr. Dunne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T GIVE AWAY THE ENDINGS PLEASE!!!!!","review":"I thought this was a great book.

A fun read.","review":"Although masked as \\"a novel in the form of a memoir\\", even if you are mildly informed about the O.J. trial and its players, it is easy to separate fact from fiction in ANOTHER CITY. If you're looking for an objective chronicle of the trial this is not a reliable source. Instead, view this as a glimpse of the glitterati,-- their opinions, their parties, their lifestyles (although namedropping and self-promoting at times). Sophisticated, discerning readers will view this as a page-turner that entertains so long as Dunne's strong assertions of O.J.'s guilt don't interfere with your having some fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Be Dominick Dunne","review":"Dominick Dunne is a fabulous author -- witty and so insightful.

Big big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginning and middle, goofy in the last few pages...","review":"I was an OJ trial junkie all the way from the white Bronco chase through the civil verdict. Dominick Dunne seems to capture the essence of the trial from the point of view of the 'rich and famous'...people who knew OJ and whose circles of friends overlapped with him. I literally could not put the book down...one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time. The book seems to be Dunne's fictionalized autobiography. I'm not sure if all the events in the book really did occur, but it was written as a novel, so I just accepted them as part of the story. The only fly in the ointment of the entire book is the introduction of Andrew Cunanan, and how he figures into the end of the book. Not to give anything away, but it seems as though Cunanan was a last minute add-in that allowed Dunne to give the book the kind of ending he wanted to. Other than that, it was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book on this case,was it worth the wait?","review":"Having enjoyed Dominick Dunne's thinly disguised fictions as sheer entertainment in the past, I found this book very disappointing. Please tell me something that was not already on Entertainment Tonight years ago! Take out the celebrity names dropped in this book and it would read like a censored letter.

He wants to tell the world why this trial was a farce. Or so you would think based on what his alter ego discusses in this tale of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Instead we get this farcical collection of name dropping, recycled material (This would have been better if it just collected Dunne's magazine pieces), and the conceit of calling this a work of fiction, with the jaw dropping stupidity of an ending that ranks high on the list of ridiculous plot turns in the history of fiction. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"MERELY HOLLYWOOD GOSSIP","review":"I started reading this book as I wanted to know about the O.J.Simpson trial. What do I get? Some Hollywood [stuff] about the author's schedule of dinner parties, at fashionable houses and restaurants and gossip; not facts about the trial. Am I supposed to be impressed by all the name droppings, self promotion and his invitations to posh houses? I'm not. Neither am I interested in Hollywood gossip. The guy is so [sad] trying to be with the \\"in crowd\\" that I felt quite sorry for him. I cannot believe how shallow the book is. ...This I believe, is a best seller, only because some Hollywood women, who have nothing better to do than give parties, go shopping and laze around, bought the book as they or someone known to them were in it. This is the first and the last time I read Dominic Dunne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But Name-Dropping","review":"At first I was amused by Dunne's constant name-dropping, then I was annoyed by it.

Get a life."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT just another O.J. book.....","review":"I see why Mr. Dunne wrote this as a novel. It gave him a tad more freedom to name names and quote off the record remarks. If any of this is fiction it is believable fiction.

You will NOT be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed!","review":"I was expecting to really enjoy this book, but I was disappointed.

Dunne, not about OJ Simpson","review":"Anyone buying this book with the hope of getting an account of what happened in LA at the murder and/or at the trial will be disappointed. You will instead learn -- and learn well -- how popular the author is with rich and famous people.Throughout the book, the author alludes to two works he would like to complete: a novel on the Simpson murder and a memoir. This particular work seems to be more the latter. That being the case, I am hopeful that Mr. Dunne will yet write a novel on the case.I simply was not interested in the story behind the story; nor was I interested in Mr. Dunne's personal background. I want THE STORY ITSELF. I bought the book because Mr. Dunne provided the most interesting accounts during the trial. If Mr. Dunne does write an account of OJ and Nicole's relationship and his theory on what happened that night -- rather than focusing in on the trial segment -- I believe it would be an outstanding book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"Namedropping 101\\"","review":"A very sad effort in my opinion!

What a disappointment! Silly and tedious, self-absorbed -- with a laugh-out-loud ending too goofy to believe. Do yourself a big favor and buy ANYTHING else Mr. Dunne has written, but skip this wasted effort. (I had to rate the book at least one star for the review to be kept. Actually, it's worth zero.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dunne's done it again!","review":"I've been a long time fan of Dunne's, having read his novels and articles in \\"Vanity Fair.\\"There were many things I enjoyed in this book, amongst them the first hand look at the OJ trial, the real names used, the depiction of all the dinner parties. I guess what I'm trying to say is that this book is a fascinating look at an 'inside the scenes' of what was going on at the time of that trial, not only for the participants, but also for the hoi polloi of Hollywood.And I greatly enjoyed the experience of exactly how Dominick Dunne lived his life. I found it exhausting myself. I'll never know how he did it.But I also remember the photo of him with his mouth dropped open in astonishment upon hearing the verdict at that trial, and I was interested in hearing the thoughts behind the gesture. Especially since it mirrored my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a beach book.","review":"Well I didn't fall asleep reading it but I didn't try to stay awake either.

Sometimes I think I expect too much ... especially since I had such fun (years ago, I admit) with The Two Mrs. Grenvilles.

This just doesn't work all the time, does it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book---surely not Dominick Dunne!!!","review":"Mr. Dunne---and his editor---would have done better to have just left in the \\"letters to Vanity Fair\\" and cut all the other prose from this book.

However, it was just an embarrassment---more Kitty Kelly than Dominick Dunne. What a bore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An outline for another book.","review":"I love Dominck Dunne's writing. I read him all the time in Vanity Fair and have read a few of his novels, so when I heard that he had written about the OJ trial I rushed to read it. However, this book unlike his other novels do not tell the story of the crime and the trial, it is a name dropping session. Dunne reports all the parties his fictional counter part Gus Bailey is invited to and who he sits next to.Worse still is the fact that this book is an outline of the book he was going to write about the Mendez trial. A several points during the story he writes about the chapter Gus has just written for his book about the Mendez's brothers. I wish he had written the book about the Mendez it probably would have been a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art of TELLING","review":"I can't remember another book, by an established author, that ignored the rule in writing-- show don't tell-- with such commitment. I have seen this narrow, flat writing in beginning fiction classes, but that is to be expected. Dunne gives us no scene set up or character development. He relies on his readers to fill in all the details, because we probably know the story. I found it tiresome to be told who the people were and what locations had been named in other books. Who cares? What's the story he's writing here? I've enjoyed Dunne's writing in the past and was amazed with the pages of dialogue accompanied by no details or description. I felt, by the end, that I was reading a trial transcript. What a let down. I really had been looking forward to his insight and twist on this well document moment in our history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten apple!","review":"I just finished reading this book and had to rush to the internet to find out if I was the only one who is absolutely stunned at the absurdity of this novel. Disbelief is my primary reaction. I honestly can't believe that such a fine author could take such an urgent subject and turn it into such an almost unreadable jumble of meandering fact and fiction. It was not engrossing enough for me to muster the energy to glean a possible hidden message. If there was one, it was very well hidden under tons of society minutae. If you haven't read any of his other books, please don't be put off by this one. It is the rotten apple in an otherwise juicy barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Load of Crap by a Mere Lunatic Sociopath!","review":"This book is a joke and so is the pathetic nitwit who wrote it! In a nutshell, what he describes in this book is tantamount to stalking, fraud, and identity theft. It gives me the creeps to think that this convicted criminal now has the mitigating gall to believe that he is a reformed authority on the subjects of breaching trust, security, and invading privacy. Moreover, the writing style indicates clearly that this buffoon has had no formal education much less penitentiary rehabilitation. Don't waste your time or your train of good thoughts on this adolescent nonsense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This book is pathetic- this man is pathetic.

I am a 23 year old guy who lives alone in my apartment. I have never thought about buying an alarm system because alarm companies usually don't serve apartments and the ones that do seem to be very expensive for my budget. Lasershield solves these problems because the product is affordable and it offers monitoring that I can afford. This is great! Whenever I move the product and service will come along with me to my next location. I can control the alarm system with my cell phone in order to arm or disarm when I forget to turn it on before I leave. This is cool!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this product","review":"Laser Shield Security System is not recommended.We have had this product for two years. It has created problems with our telephone line, sometimes \\"answering \\" our phone, despite numerous attempts to fix. Last fix was a new monitoring station that not only answered the phone line on the first ring but also left the phone line disconnected until the monitoring station was cut off. Customer service is bad--long waits (20-30 minutes.)Alarm was triggered once and computer called neighbor, who didn't imput code fast enough. They came to our house to await police and explain what happened. Turns out the system never contacted the police.Customer service offered a three month service charge credit, then billed my credit card for three months.Company I bought this from no longer sells these units. You can figure out why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comes complete with visiting police officers","review":"Let's see....I like my Lasershield home security system, but for some reason, it malfunctions once in a great while, as it spontaneously goes off when I'm just minding my own business at home. I \\"deactivate\\" my already deactivated alarm, and just 4 hours later, I get a knock on my door from the cavalry. Well........I guess it works properly in THAT aspect!!!! The cop told me that he gets a lot of alarms going off when there are drastic changes in the weather. Changes in the weather? Huh? Whatever. On the more serious side, it's a decent security system for the price. You can purchase extra monitors for every room of the house. The units are fairly small, so they don't take up too much space. Normally I don't buy anything that's endorsed by Rush Limbaugh, but this security system got my attention back in 2007, and I have no regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and easy setup","review":"I bought this security system for our daughter-in-law who lives in off base military housing with our two grandchildren. Our son is currently deployed and there had been break-ins in the neighborhood. The setup was easy and the keyfob remotes are a great idea. The unit itself looks like a radio with speakers. We bought an extra sensor unit for more coverage. The system is totally wireless and the sensor units communicate with the base even if they're not in the same room. We set up a sensor in the living room and the other in the kitchen. We set them up about waist high. This allows the motion detector to pick up a person but lets the pets wander around without setting off the alarm. Buying through Amazon was quite a bit less expensive than getting the same unit through Target or HomeDepot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for the money.","review":"Easy to set-up. The sensor had no trouble spotting me and sounding the alarm.Criminals look for easy targets. When the alarm goes off, they are not going to stick around and load your goods into a moving truck.Also, if you are home alone and you hear an intruder, just push the key chain remote panic button.One of the older reviews complained about the unit not working. The unit is guaranteed and he should have returned it to LaserShield for a replacement.As with all security systems, you must arm it when you leave the house or apartment and disarm it when you return.And, additional security measures should always be taken--Lock your door! Use window locks! Light up the outside of your house or apartment and be vigilant of your surroundings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Nothing more than a huge waste of time!","review":"We had high hopes for this system. Then it arrived. I never worked right so we tried more than a dozen times to work with them to get it to work. Even the remotes wouldn't work. We got a set of remotes that would kill the battery in less than a day. They sent \\"new\\" ones. Same thing. Then another set. Same thing. The hype is really great but the system really sucks! Don't waste your time or your money. Now we have a high tech looking paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"craptacular","review":"I ordered this product from another website. The product itself is cheap and clunky. The motion detector was terribly inefficient as it could not detect my 100lb son entering or exiting the room when activated. In the middle of the night the alarm must have went off because when I awoke, the voice in the box said the alarm sounded overnight. The siren is so low I could not hear it over the noise of the fan that I had running in my room and I sleep very lightly....Don't settle on this product, KEEP SEARCHING! Though I live in a rental unit, ADT was more than happy to install a wireless system in my home. You may have to get permissions from the property owner but it is worth the extra effort to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"No programming required?","review":"In the box it says... \\"No programming required\\" it should state \\"No programming possible\\" as it is not possible to program it to call you on your cell or any phone at all. Not much to do without the service. Even the sound from the alarm itself is very mild, a little louder than my alarm clock, but nowhere scary. I have had other low end systems with better functionality and more powerful alarm sound. This system has a lot of potential, but not well developed for my needs... Maybe it would work fine with the subscription. I think this should be on the description, because I had no idea it was useless without the activation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the place to start a swing collection...","review":"Dodgy recording quality, spend a little more and get Anthology of Big Band Swing, a 2 cd set."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Girl With The Silver Eyes","review":"This is an awesome book. It is about a girl named Katie, who has(of course)silver eyes. She has the ability to move things w/her mind, which is called telekinesis, I think. She doesn't have any friends her age, because they all think she is weird and they are afraid of anyone that is different (namely, her). Katie hears about some kids her age that might be like her.

Its main advantage is its small size, especially these days where each bedroom is supposed to have its own smoke detector. It gets good battery life as well, I only had to replace the battery it came with just once. However I did have a problem with false alarms due to dust building up inside of it. The fact that the room has a ceiling fan did not help. This unit is difficult to clean inside. The small slots in the front of the unit go to the horn, not the ionization detector. A vacuum cleaner will not be able to throughly suck up the dust that will eventually build up inside the front cover.

Weird! This unit is truly all A/C w/battery back-up.CONS:- It alternates between time & temperature instead of just showing both at same time.- Inside temperature is not projected.- Projection only shows at four angles: 0, 90, 180, 270.

The rest of the clock features are amazingly poorly designed. The buttons are finicky and feel cheap. The base is too small and ill-formed to support the clock well making the clock prone to tipping over. This becomes especially annoying when you try to hit the snooze button (on the top of the unit) only to have the clock flip over forward without engaging the snooze. The other big flaw is that the LCD is largely unreadable in anything other than direct light. This means at night you only have the projection to see what time it is and in the daytime it is often too dark to see the LCD but too bright to see the projection, rendering the clock useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total mess...","review":"This product is one of the worst I've ever ordered from anywhere.

The external power source connection required for continuous projection was loose and only made proper connection rarely. The cord was plugged in securely but the electrical connection was poor which caused the display to stop working until you moved the cord around.

When the clock arrived, I noticed the clam shell packaging was stapled together. After I set up the clock, I observed that one digit failed to light up - an obvious flaw. At this point I realized that I had been sent a returned item. So, I returned it for an exchange. When the replacement arrived, I was shocked to see that the clam shell packaging had obviously been opened and glued back together again. And the clock had a major scratch on its face.

I live in new mexico, we have very low humidity 95% of the time. The display on the clock usually has between 70-90% humidity, and the temp is usually off by about 30 degrees. Right now it is about 42 degrees and very dry outside. my clock reads that it is 69 degrees and 96% humidity.

The projection is bright enough to see at night with maybe the glow of street lights going through the window, but no where near bright enough to disturb your sleep. The outdoor tempature is accurate, and I have the sensor out on the deck and the display in my 2nd floor bedroom. I did notice that the best way to sync the display with the sensor is to either do it next to a sliding glass door or outside, but once you have it sync'd, you can move the display anywhere you want in the house and still get a reading.

The projection to the ceiling is a nice feature, and is clear enough when the room is dark.It is a bit odd that you have to turn the clock face away from you to orient the projection to the readable position.

This one had the outside temperature in addition to the time. I did have a little issue getting it on daylight savings time, but after that it seemed to work very well. The temperature seemed to take a while to stabilize, and it does seem to measure to the high side, but all-in-all, it works extremely well. The projection size of the digits are a little smaller but more precise than the Oregon Scientific but what a great device that allows you to see the time and temperature without twisting and squinting.

It's a great little device and I hardly even use the features it offers. I say, the only features that are helpful on this device is the time (obviously), the indoor temperature, and the display on the wall (works only at night - duh).

The clock has a very weak projection that we could never get to project continuously or get the outside temperature to register. We emailed and called the customer service of La Crosse and it was 4 days before we received an email that gave us a lengthy description of removing the batteries, unplugging the AC adapter, replugging, etc. They also said over 30 clocks were returned for this very thing and nothing was wrong just a bad connection with the AC adapter.

I'm still giving it four stars because when it works, it is very useful. My wife won't go outside without knowing the temperature. I like it because I try to keep the indoor humidity below a certain percentage. Also, sometimes I need a sanity check when I feel hot or my wife feels cold. This thing settles any question about that. I ended up buying the exact same model due to the fantastic price on Amazon. I am hoping this one lasts much longer than two years though."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap construction, poor design","review":"The outdoor temperature unit has stopped working in just 8 months! I tried changing the battery, following all instructions, but it does not work even if I keep it right next to the clock.The user interface is also bad. Most watches are more easier to use than this clock. I would have expected a clock to be more easier to use as it has more surface for more buttons(if necessary) to be put. When you change the alarm time, you cannot change the time backwards, you have go through the whole cycle (fortunately you do have separate buttons for hour and mins).The buttons don't feel very good.The clock is unstable, it can fall easily.If you won't use the alarm functions, it is probably a good clock while it lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Projection clock disappointment","review":"This clock was great when we first received it.

Has worked now for 6 months, perfectly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for a great price, but not perfect","review":"I thought about buying a projection clock for a while. When I saw this one for $26 I couldn't refuse. Like other reviewers have stated the projection isn't the brightest. It cannot be seen in the daytime, but I don't need to see it then, I can look at the clock. At night the projection is perfect. The body construction is better than some have said. It's not gonna fall apart on you. The outdoor temp sensor works great. I had to manually set the time because the clock has never connected with the atomic clock. I have another atomic clock and it hasn't either. It may be where I live. One thing I don't like, when you press the backlight button (snooze) the display changes from indoor temp/humidity to alarm time so if you want to see what the indoor temp is in the dark better have a flashlight. All things considered it's still a good product for a great price considering similar clocks cost $60 to $90...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel cheated","review":"I received this clock very quickly.

(Are the designers idiots????)3. There is no automatic adjustment of time using radio (or whatever they call it.) You have to adjust the time all by yourself.4. The adjustment of time is very confusing since there aren't enough bottons.5.

It nevers syncs up except when I keep in on the window aisle. Buttons are hard to use; they either don't press or press and don't do their thing. Projection is pathetic, doesn't work well and is hard to read except when the room is really really dark. It does not have day and date indicators - horrific for any digital clock instead has the option of displaying external weather which by the way is not even close to accurate! The green backlight is not so great either. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bedside Clock","review":"This is our second La Crosse projection alarm clock with temperature.

Before one of us would have to raise up to look over our partner while laying in bed to see the clock on the bedside table. You can choose to project just the time, or have it switch between time and then temperature. We also like the atomic clock update that sets itself for accurate time."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, low quality","review":"This is an excellent idea product, however very poorly built.

I recently purchased two clocks and in both cases the sensors did not work. Stayed stuck on 77 F. When contacted CS, had to provide lengthy explanation of the problem, including proper installation steps, etc. In both cases they replaced sensors and they working fine.

Yes the laser is impossible to see in the daytime, though its so nice to look on the ceiling for the time instead of having to roll over in bed.

So I'm returning it as well and this time will buy different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"My husband works (I'm an at home mom) so the old alarm clock was always on his side of the bed - to see the time I had to sit up and look over him. Was looking into second clock for my side of the bed when I found this clock (at Cabela's for $39.99 plus shipping). Bought it and we love it. And yes, the room has to be dark to see the reading well but my bedroom IS dark at night. There isn't anything so complicated about this clock that the average person can't run it but it does have more buttons than the plain old alarm clocks. Buying one for my parents for Christmas.UPDATE 2010 - both sets of parents use one, kids have one in bedroom, realized I hate sitting up in bed looking for the clock when we travel so now we take it with us. BTW - it still works perfectly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOW brightness","review":"Hi, I just received my WT-512U projection alarm clock that I ordered 2 weeks ago and I'm disappointed by both the LOW brightness of the projector and the backlighting of the display.I'm engineer and I develop LEDs-based products so I can tell you this is bad quality. The projection has to be seen in the dark and also has to be at a distance between 1 and 2 meters from the wall to properly see the numbers. It does not have a focus feature if you wanted to put it closer or farther to a wall. The backlighting of the display is made by only one ugly greenish led. As a result one side of the display isn't well lighted.The only thing I liked in that product is that you can rotate the projection by an angle of 90 degrees (but you have to see it in the dark) So I would not recommend that product but if you want a dim projection of the time AND the temperature in your room it can do the job. Anyway I decided to return the product.Charly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Support nearly non-existent","review":"I received the WT-5120U-GB as a gift. It had a problem that should be a warranty matter. A request form on their web site resulted in a reply a month later asking for more information. A month after that a return authorization arrived, then the next day a different model (no outside temp, no projection) arrived. I've given up and now have a Honeywell PCR825W- a larger, brighter projection of time, outdoor AND indoor temp."},{"rating":"2","title":"time ane temperature clock","review":"We love having the time and outside temperature showing on our ceiling at night, Just wish they showed at the same time instead of going on and off separately but still love the clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as nice as others","review":"numbers are too small and appaears more cheaply made than other La Crosse models I've had."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],W={key:0},j={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(x,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-b3d61e84"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/68.md","filePath":"sponsor/68.md"}'),H={name:"sponsor/68.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{R as __pageData,P as default};
