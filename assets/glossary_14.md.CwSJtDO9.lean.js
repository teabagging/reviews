Her series get too bogged down with the number of characters and reminders of what happened previously. But this book was really good; you feel for all the characters, and how she talks in the child's voice for Max is so sweet, really brought a smile to my face (or tears, depending on what he said of course!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another keeper","review":"Karen Kingsbury's books are always wonderful, and Oceans Apart is no exception. I read it in about 3 hours one evening. It will definitely make any married person, or anyone planning to marry think about their relationship. I loved Max, he was such a cute little boy. I also felt quite a bit for Michele. I won't spoil the ending, but it's a tearjerker in classic Karen Kingsbury style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable Story and Characters","review":"While it was certainly pulled at the heartstrings and was enjoyable in parts, overall the tone of the book turned me off. The little boy character was like a symbol - too perfect - not like a real child at all. The wife character was unlikeable and unforgiving for 99% of the story. The story's treatment of the orphaned boy character, about how he was just some terrible mistake, and the fact that the characters even considered sending him away, unacknowledged, was a little repellent to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Oceans Apart Review","review":"Oceans Apart, a touching and intriguing novel by Karen Kingsbury, makes readers turn pages. The book places the characters in tricky and undesired positions, as the truth about a secret affair gets out.Connor Evens, just found out that the woman he had an affair with eight years ago died and left behind his unknown son. He and his family have to decide if they can survive living with this newly discovered little boy, or if Connor will have to choose between his only and loving son or his family.Kingsbury made this an exciting and moving novel that has audiences wondering what's going to happen to the little boy and what choice Connor Evens will make. How can anyone get over this mistake and the loss that makes the heart ache? This piece of art is truly full of wonders, questions, and the ability to believe in God and forgiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"oceans apart","review":"wow this was a wonderful story. it made me cry and smile at the same time. i truly believe what max said you can not love unless you forgive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"I enjoy all of Karen Kingsbury's book, but this one is my most favorite so far.

The adultery portrayed in this book was exposed, forgiven and then given a happy ending in what seemed like weeks. Poor story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"Karen Kingsbury has done it again! This story of love and forgiveness is a powerful testimony to what God can do when people allow Him to do His work in the heart. I don't usually cry while reading a book, but I must have been a sight walking on my treadmill while reading my Kindle with tears running down my cheeks as I finished this book! I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good love story! Karen never disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Oceans Apart is a Christian fiction book focused on forgiveness. At the center is a delightful little boy and Kingsbury really does an exceptional job capturing the boy's voice. However, I found the plot to be predictable and a little preachy. The adult characters were also not very realistic or engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too perfect","review":"I usually like Karen Kingsbury books but this was just too much. The characters were so unreal. The seven year old boy was perfect. Totally unlike a normal seven year old especially going through the loss of his mother.The book was way too mushy for my taste. It was also too predictable. An affair in a marriage is devastating. Not something that can be fixed in a few weeks.The other thing that really bothered me what the way she wrote when the boy was talking. I really didn't like the little kid talk she wrote in. Everything was \\"my mommy\\"... or some mispronounced word. It was kind of like reading Junie B Jones.I did not like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as advertised","review":"Big, sturdy tent that takes about 1/2 hour to assemble the first time.

I have tons and tons of music and only a few albums can roll as smoothly from front to back as this one.

Carmen and Betty truly compliment each other's singing techniques. While Betty is smooth and low-key, Carmen is clear and comical. While Betty is 'Miss scatting queen', Carmen is 'Miss interpretation'. For the scatting fans out there, I highly recommend that you listen to \\"It Don't Mean A Thing (if it ain't got that swing)\\" and \\"Sometimes I'm Happy\\". These wonderful renditions are fun and enjoyable. This recording which was taped live in 1987, always has you on your toes. As many times as I've listened to it, it still keeps me laughing. There's nothing better than hearing Carmen and Betty improvise, joke with one another, and completely make up things to sing and say as they go along with their performance! The audience loved it, and I'm sure you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcomed duo","review":"Two of my most favorite jazz-blues artists coming together, and to an appreciative audience.

After a couple listens, I traded it right back to them. I don't know why this CD gets such high ratings, both here and in the jazz guides. The sound is muddied, the singing far from serious, and the banter hard to discern.It reminds me somewhat of another very overrated CD....Tony Bennett MTV Unplugged.I don't begrudge either Carmen or Betty their place in jazz history....but this CD is really a poor example of that of which they are capable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nao puppy review","review":"The Nao puppy I purchased through Amazon was a delite !

I advise that one reads all of Millman's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and insightful; an easy read","review":"Millman's writing style is simplistic, which puts more of an emphasis on the meaning and philosophy behind the words. It was an eye opener in that things are not always as they seem in this world. This didn't exactly 'change my life', but has certainly transformed and redirected the way i view and think about it. Any message that is positive deserves a chance, and i would suggest this book to anyone of any age who has an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story blending one's past & present into the here & now.","review":"Fifty years of my life has passed and in every minute of each of those years I spent part of each moment redigesting the past and anticipating the future. Is it any wonder that my memories are not vivid. Millman's message: \\"What time is it? NOW! Where are we? HERE!\\", is for me a perpetual reminder to turn my focus inward to the wealth of strength and creativity that I hold within. Saying those words to myself jog me out of my personal habit of reviewing my failures and worrying about my future losses. Those simple utterances: the HERE AND NOW hold deep meaning HERE AND NOW. Thanks Dan Millman, I'm am most appreciative for your insights, I GOT IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind/Body/Spirit... Balance","review":"This book reminds me of The Guru Delivery, or Illusions, in that it is a wonderful story of an unexpected master/student relationship. It expresses a way to balance the mind/body/spirit relationship and does so in a very entertaining fashion. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading about things of a higher nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritual motivation book","review":"I read this book because it was recommended by the person who has been guiding me on my own personal spiritual journey. I guess I have reached a point in my developement where these lessons are no longer that relevant to me (or perhaps I am not avanced enough to appreciate the teachings). I would not recomend this book to my students. I consider this more a book to motivate one to begin one's own spiritual search than a book that has any actual answers and I would not recommend it to someone that who is already advancing on the path of becoming a humble servant to the God (aka the Univese, the Source)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This the book that slapped me, shook me up and got me movin'","review":"Great book!Way of the Peaceful warrior is a fiction/non-fiction hybrid that is about the story of a man in the process of self discovery.

This is a perfect book for anybody like me who is turned of by fundamentalism of any religious persuasion but knows there is a deep spiritual wisdom out there somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable for children or the intellectually challenged.","review":"This is a reasonable fairy tale which can help to pass the time while on the train. However it is very simplistic and not at all inspiring since it's nothing you haven't heard a million times before. The 'insight' into life is given through a mystical, supernatural old hippie called socrates - this makes the story far too abstract and cannot be applied to real life. Dan Millman has made a lot of money out of some very gullible people. If you want to know about the meaning of life etc then go to the experts and read the views of a real philosopher. Hey..what about Socrates. Or else, try 'Sophie's World' by Josteein Gaardner, which is a far more insightful and intelligent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring read.","review":"I found this tale to be both boring and a waste of time. I wouldn't suggest this book be read by anyone over the age of 14."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Book lacked balance required in life! If someone is homeless and starving this book is irrelevant.

This book makes you think about what really matters in life, and helps you deal with stresses in a much more relaxing way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fantasy not enough reality","review":"I was looking for the life lessons that I found in the way of the peaceful warrior, this was more Harry Potter meets Karate Kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually Fortifying","review":"A coming of age book of a young male having dimmed hopes of gymnastic glory, this book is a must read for any young male seeking a path to enlightenment. Through numerous exchanges with an old saintly Wizard named Socrates, the narrator expands his perspective on the journey of life. To truly becomming a peaceful warrior, one must continually explore, retain, and focus in on the present, sub-consciously feeding one's life meter with new experiences and observations upon which to accumulate and feed off in future years. Just as a saintly oracle would profess, Socrates' message is to always strive for more optimism, better relations, and more knowledge and curiosity by being in the now."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books of all time","review":"I read this book when I was in my twenties and it has remained on of my all time favorites even 20 years later. I have re-read it a number of times and this summer I encouraged my 13 year old to read it before we saw the movie \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" based on this novel that came out this summer. I feel that the book lived up to the sub-title \\"A book that changes lives\\". It certainly changed mine. The images and personalitites of the characters stayed with me years after I read it. It was a book like no other I had ever read. Rather than just being another self-help book, Way of the Peaceful Warrior put concepts that I had been thinking about and stuggling to understand, into a story that brought everything to life and was wonderful to read. It showed me that you can be both a warrior and peaceful which is the most important lesson of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"convoluted snooze-fest","review":"The premise of this book piqued my interest... but it never really flowed well or made much sense. Sort of like the entire series of Lost. So much potential then it all falls apart. I did not see an awakening of a person. i read other reviews about how this one book changed their life... how? What was the message in this book? I missed it. Laugh at life? That is a given.

If you like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Barney the Purple Dinosaur, this book may be for you. Yeah, this book changed my life.........for the worse. The 6 hours of mindless, self-absorbed fantasy drivel in audio form nearly sent me looking for a hanging tree. I stuck it out to the bitter end hoping this story would just END. I didn't care if the guy got hit by a train or got VD from one of his numerous trysts or if he ever figured ANYTHING out.

It is not that it is such a well-written book. However, it is one of the few books that has a nice and interesting story, is easy to read and has profound spiritual lessons. There are a lot of spiritual books but few are novels which are easy to read. Another plus is that the story sets in our time and the main character a normal person we all can relate too.For me the best books are interesting novels with spiritual lessons, such as this one. I like to lend this book to my friends who are starting out on the spirtual path. They get a nice and easy to read novel and while they are at it, learn some powerful spiritual truths.

I really wanted to throw the book away, but i kept searching and hoping for some great revelation, so i eventually finished it. How do i feel now? Like i wish i could get that portion of my life back. The message was hokey, the story telling was stupid, and the writing was garbage. Did i really need to read 200 pages to understand Dan's message of living in the moment and being happy? Nope.

People just do not talk like that. It was far too corny, and it really took me out of the story quite a bit, smiling at how absurd some of it was. I was also, surprisingly, turned off by the whole \\"magical\\" aspect of the book. Stories like this always seem to work best when you believe they could happen. With this one, I found myself openly thinking to myself (quite often), \\"I'm supposed to be buying into this?\\"I thought it was a decent story, and I can certainly tell it is something that could be very meaningful to some people.

Reading through the book i enjoyed the easy-to-read and high detail explanation of the main character's journey. But as i went deeper into the book i just noticed that it was obviously 'New Age', now that is something most people won't argue about, and i don't hate some of the truths in it, but i don't like the overall of that 'religion'. So even though i like the author's storytelling and some of the philosophy (like the one of living in the present) i don't go into the 'new age' being a christian. I can read a story of metaphors, but when the author makes the story into an obvious religion which contradicts mine, i can't go further.

If anyone hasn't read Castaneda, I suggest you start withThe Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledgein which details are given of Shamanic knowledge and experiences.The entire \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" series allows the reader to journey with the narrator into experiences of spiritual transformation. I had originally read the \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" in my teens and found great inspiration in it then and now with more life experience I can understand certain experiences presented in the book even better. The book does change lives as the subtitle says and I've bought copies of this book for friends in my circle.I also recommend Nexus: A Neo Novel, which is the best book I've read since Dan Millman.

I've given it as gifts to those I love and everyone who has read it has told me the same thing. A must buy! However, as good as Peaceful Warrior is don't read Millman's other books, Sacred Journey or Socrates. As most reviews have stated, they are a disappointment. My opinion is that Millman had one good book in him, and that was Peaceful Warrior. His only other book that was okay, was No Ordinary Moments. If you really want to read a book by Millman after Peaceful Warrior read No Ordinary Moments, but that's it! Lastly, another really good book is University for Success.

At the end, it won't leave a good taste in your mouth.It is hard to sympathize or relate to the woes of the main character who is a born world class champion without really trying, without having to sleep, rich enough to do and travel wherever he wants since his freshman year, doesn't have to study ever, can basically seduce and have any girl he ever wants on a whim and still is chosen among millions apparently by a Zen master of unlimited power to be trained into perfection. His trials and anguishes to \\"find himself\\"and his obsession with his happiness while giving zero concern to the welfare of the world at large are truly heartbreaking first-world problems.It doesn't help that the author is a mediocre writer at best.

A novel for anyone who has an open mind to change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good insights","review":"I have read several \\"self-help\\" books, and the advice in almost all of them is to focus on what you want to get.

If you spend all of your time focusing on the home you \\"will have\\" in 10 years or that dream job/car or whatever it may be for you(and this is exactly what \\"The Secret\\" suggests you do) you will not be able to enjoy the moment you are in.

The thoughts presented by the author have been clearly borrowed from Eastern culture and you see a \\"cocktail\\" version. Yet the world is full of different people and someone or the other will purchase this book and make their own judgements. To conclude, the book is fake concotion and not nearly original.

Reading this book is boring at best; but dangerous at worst. The protagonist IS a willing slave to Socrates...who uses physical abuse and mind control in order to destroy Dan's ability to think for himself.

That's the idea, and somebody must have caught the great director William Wellman in a genial mood when he agreed to direct this. It's a measure of his tremendous talent that Wellman actually made something enjoyable out of an utterly absurd script. A motley assemblage of mail-order brides heading to California are abandoned by their hired male teamsters thanks to trail boss Robert Taylor's poor people skills. Instead of high-tailing it back to St. Joe the fiances push on by themselves, with mixed results. Several dozen make it across, however, and face the far greater perils of marrying complete strangers. Taylor, one of Hollywood's most under-rated talents, is absolutely great, and the large female ensemble acquit themselves very well.

The two individual segments, if laid end-to-end, are 20 feet long. The \\"maximum reach\\" assumes someone of 5'6\\" height is standing at the highest recommended rung (IOW, their height combined with the ladder). Why does Werner use such ambiguous specifications?

No problems with functionality or design. The main issue is the manner in which it was initally shipped. While not damaged to the degree that it isn't usable, it does have a couple of gouges and scrapes in the fiberglass rails. Not what one would expect when buying a brand new item. The Werner company should probably consider some means of protection by perhaps wrapping the ladder in cardboard or some other material.

The film is too uneven and unpleasant even for a movie about slicing bodies up.

But for the sheer reason of boredom, I couldn't get past the 4th chapter. She tells the same details over and over again with a different character's voice. I tried REALLY hard, but this didn't do it for me. This is a book for devoted Kingsolver fans who want to read it just for that or for the hype that it got from Oprah. Depressing subject matter, drawn out story, and a whole lot of foreshadowing without much action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's social agenda takes over","review":"I found this book exhausting, irritating and preachy. I slogged through it as I felt compelled to learn about the fates of these four women. Kingsolver is a talented author but this work is burdened by her obsession with a social justice agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece of contemporary fiction","review":"By far the best novel of the year, Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible is not only her best work yet, but it is also the best book I've read in years (and I read a lot!). The story starts off a bit slowly, but soon you will find yourself attached to the characters and emotionally involved in the text. I seriously could not put it down. Don't let the general subject (the lives of a mother and her four daughters doing mission work in Africa) scare you off. Kingsolver's story is simultaneously beautiful and treacherous, joyous and heart-wrenching, complex and yet wonderfully simple. Reading it is doing yourself a favor. If you liked her other works, you MUST read this. If you've never read Kingsolver before, read this and become a devoted fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound and the Fury-like","review":"I think, although the book was very long (narrative flow could have used some work) and Kingsolver has written more elegantly before, it had some really interesting aspects. The main thing that sticks in my mind is the technique; Rev. Price, the man around whom the story turns, is described obliquely by the people who surround him. This is a very effective way of telling the story, as it emphasizes the unbridgeable gap between the minds of the Prices. This is the same way that Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury works, by weaving a story around Caddy Compson. While Kingsolvers book is not as cleanly written as Faulkner's, ultimately it is almost as devastating."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Barbara Kingsolver at her best. A gripping story.","review":"This is Barbara Kingsolver at her best. A fascinating story told through the eyes of 4 young girls and their mother. Kingsolver knows her subject - the Belgian Congo in the 60's - and is a master at keeping the reader's interest piqued while at the same time showing us history. Often we see the same scene through different eyes and this is when the novel is most compelling. The author's skill keeps each chapter in perfect voice of the character who's eyes we are using. I loved this book and can't wait until until Kingsolver treats us to another novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite, annoying","review":"I guess I expected a lot more from this book,as I did like her earlier books. I found the characters inane, the writing poor, and very annoying with her cutsie on-purpose mistakes like \\"Thyroid Mary\\" and the stupid palindromes. Enough already, stop trying so hard as just tell the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Profound Novel","review":"It took three tries to get through the first 90 pages but after Genesis, I was transfixed. I thought about things I'd never thought about...as far as I'm concerned, this is a must read for anyone who takes reading and great writing seriously. I intend to read this again and again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"I enjoyed this book up until about 80% through it. Basically, I thought at first that I would completely hate it since it was about religion and about Africa - both of which frankly don't usually interest me. However, I found it captivating and intriguing. I was addicted and read it non-stop. ... That is, until the main story ended and the \\"aftermath\\" story began. Then, the book lost it's magic and lost what made it so captivating to begin with.The first 80% of the book was tremendous - deep, beautiful and just grand. The different conflicts that were going on - between husband and wife, children and parents, and community and preacher are just terrific.Some other reviewers call this book \\"male bashing\\" - I don't quite see that one. I guess the antagonist happens to be male and a wife does battle her husband, but I don't think I would characterize it as \\"male bashing.\\"My recommendation is to read the book. However, be aware that the interest may be lost after a certain time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Gothic","review":"First, let me say that I loved this book. I don't agree at all with Kingsolver's politics in the real world, but I didn't read this so much as a political novel as a novel of family relationships, and five women trying to escape their patriarchal chains (with varying degrees of success...) At first I was a little offput by the prose tics of each character, especially Adah (I admit, I kind of glossed over a lot of her backward-forward stuff), but by the end I found that the narrative effect worked. I did keep expecting to have a chapter titled \\"Nathan\\", but the book works so much better without his point of view.I have had varied reactions to other Kingsolver books--pretty much nonplussed by her earlier novels, but I really liked Prodigal Summer--but this was by far the most moving and satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Eye Opener","review":"The Poisonwood Bible was a great book. Even though it is lengthy, you will finish it in a couple days because you won't be able to put it down! After reading this book it made me think about other cultures and respecting their rituals and ways of doing things. This book also made me realize how lucky I am and that I should be more grateful for what God has given me. Great book -- everyone should read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Kingsolver was able to write in each character's personality and appropriate vocabulary. I have recommended this book to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Layers, Many Messages, Many Provoked Thoughts","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has written a dynamic text that asks much of the reader as she guides you on a journey that is both physical and metaphysical. The reading has many layers from mere plot to intense comments on religion, politics, power, masculine vs. feminine energy, geography, history. This reading is in part a slice of liberal education at large. A caution to the reader is the fact that the narration is shared through five visions, five life philosophies, and five life experiences. Kingsolver does a fabulous job reminding us that \\"truth\\" and \\"experience\\" are subjective as each of the narrator's views the same situation and translates that experience in very different ways. What I liked best about the book was that I questioned my own belief systems as I was either identifying with or disagreeing with the characters.Cheers to your interpretation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"Next to THE BIBLE, it is the best written book I've ever read. I recently bought a 1/2 dozen more copies to give to my best friends and family. Barbara Kingsolvers ability to jump from one character to another reminds me a bit of Robin Williams nearly insane ability to do the same. You'll find yourself identifying with one of the characters perspective, from which the story is told. A story of a family of 3 daughters, and a missionary couple headed from Georgia to the Congo, this novel will lead you to laugh and cry.It took two years for my wife to get me to pick up this book. I listened to it on audio CD and then read it. Simply Superb and now I want to read some of the author's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur writing","review":"Sooooo disappointing; I saw all these wonderful reviews from so many newspapers and I thought it would be wonderful. I love stories set in Africa, regardless of the era. After the first 100 pages, the book seemed like it would never end. I felt it was a book written for children, from the point of view of 4 children. Definitely not a book for someone who enjoys good literature!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Barbara Kingsolver's other books, but when I read this one I was really disappointed. The book had wonderful writing, but the ending was disappointing in that the father put his family through all that, and then it seemed that he never accomplished what he went to the Congo for in the first place. The family was forced to stay in the Congo by the father's choice, and it kind of leaves a feeling that the family went through alot of unhappiness for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many voices","review":"By telling the story of a missionary family in the Congo at the time of Mobuto's rise to power, Kingsolver makes a valiant effort to inform and interest the reader in an event that Americans have little understanding. But in her use of different narrator (The four daughter of the missionary and his wife)Kingsolver fails to convince the reader that her narrators are speaking in their own \\"voices.\\" From a far too precocious 5 year old,the tomboy and her crippled genius twin, whose knack for palindromes and clever word play only distracted from the narrative, to the eldest child who seems to get less intelligent as time goes on, each character becomes less believable as the book continues on (and on and on...)A great book may have been written about this time of upheaval, this is just a missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Finish","review":"Right of I just wanted to say that I didn't finish this Book. I found it hard to get into and I was periodically skiping lines to try to get to something good that might be in the book. In my opinion, if you can't wait untill you're in the 300's before you get into a book, then you should not be reading this book. The reason I did not like this book is because it was continuously repetitive. Narrators changed throughout the whole book but the story kept on repeating itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"She did not find the real voice","review":"Arguably, this is her most \\"worked\\" book, but she came short in her effort. The transplation to the middle of Africa, the way the daughters talk, the way the novel resolves, all created a sort of false atmoshpere.It was intelligent to use the girls as narrators, but this, paradoxically, and after the difficulties of establishing themselves, formed a non credible situation, and thus, the novel lost strength.Perhaps it's time to start an interesting discussion about marketing and literature, and what deserves to go to print, or, at least, invest big marketing dollars"},{"rating":"1","title":"A history lesson and a boring novel.","review":"This book goes on and on about a lot of things. The author uses too many descriptions to describe simple things. I didn't feel sympathy at all for any of the characters. I felt that reading that very thick book was a waste of my time. I love to read but I didn't get any satisfaction from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that stays with you","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is an excellent chronicle of one family's evolution. My only complaint is that it peaks too early, with the novel's climax coming around page 350 -- with 200 pages left to wind down. I felt like each of the characters was very rich and well developed. My favorite was the mother, whose voice we rarely got to hear. But when she did narrate a chapter, it seemed she was answering all the questions the reader would be asking/demanding of her. I felt very emotionally attached to these characters, as the author did a formidable job of developing their fully believable, individual personas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"A Missionary and his family in Africa. The author combines religious zeal, politics, rebels, war, separation and survival into a moving, graphic tale of redemption. Alternately tragic, harsh, yet beautiful. Highly recommended reading. You won't be able to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"\\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is one of the best books I have ever read. But let me say it is a very hard read. What I mean by that is you really have to concentrate and read every part, there is no skipping. I don't usually like books like this, I enjoy being able to skip over parts I don't like. I didn't find any parts I didn't like in this book. The first two chapters can be kind of slow but after that wow! I would recommend this book to anyone. If you never read anything else again you have to read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck on page 438","review":"Eventhough I enjoyed the chapters individually, I had a hard time following this narrative as told through the eyes of Nathan Price's wife and his four daughters. The book as a whole is not better than the sum of its parts. Disjointed I'd have to say...but oddly interesting. Some day I will finish the last 105 pages...but I am in no rush as I am now reading Stolen Lives by Malika Oufkir (much better)...no I did not buy the book based upon Oprah's recommendation, I bought it in spite of it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"This is the most depressing novel I think I have ever read. I am racking my head to think of one single happy moment in the novel and I am drawing a blank. Plus, the characters in the book seem so cold and flat on paper. The family at the center of the book is completely lacking in tenderness and intimacy and it makes for truly gloomy reading. You have to spend 300+ pages with these awful people. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"I could not wait to read this book! I love Kingsolver's writing, and have read 3 other books by her, all terrific. I labored to get half-way through the Poisonwood Bible. Not being one to stop in the middle of any book, it was with great relief that I broke this habit, after my friend spoke similar feelings and revealed the rest of the book to me. I left it in the motel I was in, for anyone else interested. I could not, w/good conscience, recommend or give it to anyone!Yes, Kingsolver is a fine writer, but this book was monotonous, boring, depressing, and as dredging as the topic it undertakes. 250 pages into it, and I could still not keep the daughters' names connected to their personalities. If I want to be bored, depressed, or confused, I'll watch the news. I so strongly disliked this book that I've undertaken my first book review. Pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most excruciating read","review":"I would never recommend this book to anyone it hurts my soul that other people enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"I really tried with this book, hoping it would improve as I got into it. Normally I will read a book in one or two weeks. Well six weeks later and still on page 130 I gave up. I kept falling asleep after about 2 pages......I can recommend it to all you insomniacs! As I said 130 odd pages and NOTHING happened, just a boring tale of boring day to day events, the characters featureless, the attitudes so predjudiced. First of all I thought the book was set in the early 1900's so out of date were the attitudes but no to my surprise it wasn't. There must be parts of America that are quite unenlightened. What a nerve to go into a foreign country and expect the people in it to go for all thay dribble, even witch doctors have more logic. Well Barbara Kingsolver I'd like my money back. I probably won't get it but I'll never buy another of hers. Never mind it seems she has a lot of relatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh...Shoot Me Now","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read. By about the 35th page, I was simply lost in a confusion of boredom. Poor characterization, and lack of steady plot forced me to only be able to read about 50 pages at a time. If you want to retain your will to live, do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"This book came highly recommended but it's just plain awful. I kept reading hoping it would get better but it just got worse and worse. After finishing this book I made a decision that life was too short to spend any time sticking with books that are clearly rubbish on the off-chance that they'll improve toward the end.The characters are neither believable nor likeable and some parts of the plot are so harebrained that I actually found myself feeling embarrassed for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best pick for a first-time Kingsolver reader...","review":"Don't hate me for dissing this book, but as a reader who LOVED Animal Dreams (by Kingsolver), I couldn't get into The Poisonwood Bible. The main thing that bothered me was that each chapter is narrated by one of four sisters. They have interesting personalities but I kept getting them confused. Their voices weren't unique enough for me to distinguish. That structure grew tiresome and I stopped reading the book after about 50 pages.I also found the topic of a Baptist family moving to Africa to convert people off-putting. Even though it is supposed to be set in the past, I don't want to relive that time period and be reminded of that kind of mentality.The Poisonwood Bible should not be the first novel you pick up by Kingsolver. A better sampling would be Animal Dreams. It is more accessible to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing - not up lifting","review":"This book is long on words, and moves very slow. It is not a very up beat book. I found half way through, I skipped around and never even finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"I avoided this one for quite a while--too much hype for my taste. However, this is really well done & sensitive. The view the reader has into each of the female protagonists is intoxicating. The social studies lessons are important, and not often examined here in the US. It inspired me to want much more information on the African continent, how it evolved and how it continues to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly ironic & tragic look at the Congo - Stick with it!","review":"If you're like me, and you decide whether or not to read a book in the first 15 pages, go against your gut and stick with this one. It took me a good 80 pp to get into it, but I was well rewarded. The story is told from mulitple points of view - family members who travel with their patriarch to Africa to \\"teach the heathens about Christ\\". Hilarity & tragedy ensue. You will argue with your friends over which sister's monologues are the most interesting. Good reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poisonwood Bible for kindle","review":"This book is a classic example of why you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Initially starting out slow, the plot gets better and better with the initial character development out of the way. The plot draws the reader in deeper as we follow a slightly off-kilter pastor from Georgia into the hostile environment of one of Africas' wildest nations...where everything seems to go wrong. The author segregates the book into Bible-inspired chapters, each continuing the story from a totally different perspective.I was initially concerned that the book would be a little too 'God-preachy' for a normal everyday read, but Poisonwood isn't like that at all.In short, Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a must read. Fantastic plot twists, superb climax, and a conclusion that satisfies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutley wonderful","review":"I was assigned this book as a summer read and quickly became one of my favorite books. The novel leads the reader through a missionary family's struggles while they were in the Congo. The multi-perspective story telling gave the book a very real feel as if it were each person's account on their times and struggles in the Congo. It invoked deep pain and interest as the reader lives and dies with the characters. I would highly suggest this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing well is the best revenge.","review":"I feel like I'm from another planet when I read comments saying that the first half of the Poisonwood Bible is hard to get through. The four voices are witty, insightful, at times engagingly clueless, and all in the midst of the full force gale of FAMILY. Add being semi-trapped in the Congo, a place I knew hardly anything about beforehand but rapidly came to know thanks to Kingsolver, and this is a definite can't-put-it-down book. By the time the ants invade, if you're not completely into this story, please check your pulse. If anything, I was a little let down once they leave their ramshackle place in the Congo. Then it's just another story about female angst. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Anyway, this is a lovely book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I expected....","review":"After reading such great reviews, I decided to give the Poisonwood Bible a chance. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't entirely thrilled reading this book. The author is great with descriptive words, although at times she did get a bit wordy; the story overall lacked excitement. I did not find the book compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Book","review":"This is one of the best novels I have read. Well-written, original and insightful. It is a book about relationships, broken families, and the cultural chasm that separates idealistic Westerners from the reality of the lives they seek to change. I read this book years ago, but there are lines and images that I have never forgotten. A masterpiece. Pity, she is not producing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me thanks.","review":"This is a character driven story as you may have read from other reviewers. Each character is very rich in description and motivation. However, there emotions are so extreme as if to prove pts about society. The good people in this book are sooo good and of course the bad are sooo villainous. I didn't care for most of the characters because to me they seemed very flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"The First Summer Assignment Book","review":"I wanted to like this book, I truly did. I have liked many of the books we've read for school, long and short. But this was simply awful. I couldn't even make myself like the characters, with the exception of the cussing bird, which was simply funny. The characters were flat and unchanging, and I completely agree with the post who mentioned all the mistakes Kingsolver made with Baptist rituals. I don't like to be preached at in any situation, but I especially hate it when it's in the guise of a real story. Whether or not I would've read any of Kingsolver's other books before I read this one, I cannot say. But I do know that I'll never read another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't finish it...","review":"I didn't finish this book. I got 90% of the way through, got over it, and never finished it.The thing about this book is that it didn't make me want to read and read and never put it down. It was long, and tedious, and drawn out, and it didn't seem to have any structure. There were no highs and lows and expectations to keep you reading. It was just - boring.I was particularly drawn to any of the characters. I did feel like I was there in the Congo - but as soon as they left there, then it all went downhill for me.No structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allegiance to Schoolteachers & Nurses, Not Plastic Explosives","review":"According to an interview I read, the intent of the author was to expose the US interference in the politics of Congo and Angola and thought that few people would read a non-fiction book about it. I emphasize with her. A lot of writers are preachers or prophets.The premise is good and important, but maybe a little one-sided. As a political moderate, I think that both sides have a story to tell. The story idea was very good, but the vague, poetic narration made the story less attainable. I wanted to see the beauty and suffering more clearly, not just through a veil. Nevertheless I read it all the way through and liked it okay. I understand that writers don't usually choose how a book comes out -- it has its own life and method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I was forced to read this novel for my English class, and I must say it's not something I'll be reading again.I give Barbara Kingsolver a well-deserved compliment for her ability to use amazing figurative language, and this novel contains a large amount. The concept behind the story is somewhat interesting, but after the first half of the book, the plot becomes rather pointless and boring.Kingsolver uses the last 250-300 pages to write a political satire which is not needed, since she had made her point throughout the first half. She also drags us through the next thirty or so years of the characters' lives, and it becomes extremely trivial.Most of the time the story is just way too drawn-out and can give you a headache.The book was not AS bad as I thought it would be (considering what I had heard about it), and Kingsolver can certainly write, so I will give her two stars.HOWEVER, I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mist interesting book,","review":"Written from the perspective of the characters in alternating chapters. It's a marvelous character study and narrative of the days gone by...I can see why this was on Optah's book list."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the thinking reader","review":"Still reading the book and enjoying it very much. Interesting to see it from the point of view of each daughter as they watch their parents struggle with their life choices. Also makes you rethink what you may have thought about missionaries and their impact on those they are supposed to be serving. Good book, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great from kingsolver","review":"This book was a little hard to get into at first, but it was definitely worth reading. It was not my favorite book by kingsolver but i thought it was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend Highly","review":"I had a hard time getting into the book and had to plow through the first chapter. The book really grabbed me when this poor family began their life and adventure in Africa. The fanatic preacher wanted to convert the \\"savages\\" but lacked the understanding or concern for their culture. As the preacher went over the edge of sanity, his wife suffered depression and the daughters basically had their own life in a very dangerous environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when you though it could not get worse!","review":"I think I would have gotten more enjoyment out of this novel if I had read it in German, which I dont speak. Even sounding out multi-syllabic words like a baby would be more enjoyable then understanding 400 pages of absolute garbage. I regret the 10 hours of my life I wasted reading this book. I could have been doing much more productive things, like staring at a wall or counting to ten a million times. But unfortunately, that time is lost, and now I just have to wait and answer to God when he punishes me for wasting so much of my precious life on absolutely boring and mindless prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are Christians and then there are Christians","review":"I enjoyed many of the wry observations made through Adah and found some of the use of language by other characters quite beautiful. However, I was disappointed that none Nathan's daughters discovered true Christianity as they matured and wriggled out from under his brand of God's love. It doesn't wring true that a person,for example Leah, would truly be seeking God and not find Him. And for those of you who are thinking that she did, there is evidence of God in his creation, but He is NOT his creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This is the worst book i have ever read...It put me to sleep after every third page...It had no plot...It did not go anywhere...I would have stoped reading after the 10th page, but i was required to read this garbage for school...DONT READ THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I have ever read.","review":"This book is nothing short of a literary disastor.

What a waste of time. These characters are so flat and unbelievable--esp. the tyrannical father. I mean, I know that kids often perceive their parents in this way, but are parents really like this? I don't think so. Moreover, I felt like the role of the Congo in this story was a gimmick--this story could just as well have been told in an American setting, which Kingsolver could have done more believably, because she apparently needs a bibliography to prove to her readers that she knows something about the Congo. It was hard to like or sympathize with the characters or believe in what they were going through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book was horrible I wouldn't give it a 1 star but there is no zero don't waste your time or money on it.

Kingsolver is successful in adding both influences from her past as well as historical context into the novel, adding substance and giving a strong background to the book. While the novel seems to be simply a well-written work of fiction, there are many underlying meanings that all relate to Kingsolver's life, as well as the historical timing of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oren's review","review":"The Poisonwood Bible takes place in the Congo in the 1950's and 60's. It is about a family with a preacher for a father that is trying to christianize the natives. He is of no help to his family and they go thourgh hard times. When they are suggested to leave because a civil war was just won, but the father choses for them to stay. The rest of the book is about what happens to the family.If you make it through the first one hundrad pages it is a great book. The beginning of the book is a bit too slow but after that it has a lot more action. It has incredible detail that makes you feel like you are there in the jungle trying to survive. It is incredble to think about what a hard time the American would have to been in the Congo with no previous training in the languge or culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"I can't even put into words how spectacularly amazing this book was. It is \\"I took off a couple days from work\\" amazing. It's \\"I finished it in 4 days\\" amazing. It's \\"I bought ALL the rest of Kingsolvers books and finished THOSE in a few days\\" amazing. There were a few slow spots but none that I had trouble getting thru. I want more of this family - I want more of their live. I crave these people like I crave more Ya-Ya Sisterhood stories. (If you've read Ya-Ya Sisterhood and loved it like I did you'll know what I mean!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many stereotypes","review":"I struggled to get through this book. It certainly has some good points. The contrast in cultures is interesting, as is the drama of following a family as they venture to a new land. However, the book just perpetuates too many stereotypes. There's the narrowminded, arrogant white evangelical Christian man and his emotionally neglected wife. There's the four kids who, judging by the quality of their writing, are far smarter than any of the adults in the book. It's just too predictable...and horribly depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a command of language!!!","review":"This is my first Kingsolver novel. I picked it up knowing nothing about her other than she was considered a good writer, and nothing about the book other than a brief 2-sentence plot description. After just a few pages, I was struck with awe.Barbara Kingsolver is an amazing artist. Her prose is often poetic and full of wisdom and pith and truth. I'm not even going to give a synopsis. You can read that anywhere else on this page and quite frankly it is unimportant. It is the writing that shines here. Everything else takes a back seat.This definitely won't be my last Kingsolver novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"preachin ain't just for the preacher","review":"While I found the story and characters compelling I grew very tired of the preaching...from Leah. I agree that Kinsglover was giving the reader her very one sided perspective of the many woes of the Congo..interesting but not why I chose to read the book. The best of the book comes from the various stories from Adah I believe. And, I really wanted to hear from Mrs. Price again. I would have been interested to know how she felt about her departure, her children, her tragedy, and the splintering of her girls. It occured to me that the struggle Rachel and Leah live with and through in their own ways, is the struggle to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprah's pick--Poisonwood Bible\`","review":"I found it to be very well written and extremely captivating. A man chooses his Teachings of God to 3rd world over his own family. The writter gives such good wording, it makes you feel you're right where they are. I enjoyed it immensely. Hope you enjoy it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus is Bangala!","review":"I just finished reading The Poisonwood Bible and it has instantly become one of my favorite books. The style of writing is vivid and poetic. Barbara Kingsolver is a master wordsmith, writing sermons, prayers, poems, and palindromes. In one sermon, Nathan Price declares that Jesus is Bangala. He means that he is most precious but because of a mispronunciation it sounds to the villagers as if he is saying Jesus is poisonwood. She blends in words and phrases taken from Kikongo, the language of the Congo as well as French. The storytelling is amazing and unique. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the main characters. The foibles and quirks of each character come to life in the telling. It is an absolute must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's novel and loved every one of them-except for this one. Wordy, boring, unfeeling. For a good Kingsolver novel, try Pigs in Heaven or The Bean Trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I suppose there is potential to be disappointed by any of Oprah's recommendations because there is so much hype around each book, but this one was so tedious I gave up half way through. As hard as I tried I just couldn't get into it.I am never without a book and will read just about anything I can get my hands on, so I'm surprised that so many people gave this book rave reviews - I just can't see the appeal!In defence of Oprah's book club, the best book I have ever read is \\"I know this much is true\\" by Wally Lamb. If you read one book this year, make it this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful !","review":"I was given this book as a gift and enjoyed every moment.I first assumed the story was of a black family, but discovered I was wrong. I truely enjoyed the aspect of how each character was described and how their relationship to the family played an important role of their survival.This book captured my attention by allowing me to actually feel like I am there going thru what they are going thru.The book was a combination of sadness, realism, survial and struggle as well as love and completeness.PLEASE READ this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprah was right!","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable and highly readable. Great characterizations, unique plotline and lavish attention to detail make this a book you'll hate to put down! And you'll hate when it's over. Author Kingsolver masterfully speaks in the different voices of her characters and structures the story with magnificence. Buy a second copy to give as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Live Up To The Hype","review":"I think a lot of people just assume that if Oprah recommended a book that it must be wonderful. I had heard so much about this particular book that once I finally got around to it, I was expecting an inspiring and enlightening story of strong women and a new insight into Africa. I found that it was none of these things. I thought that for most of the book the women were exceedingly weak. In the later half, I didn't find their lives believable in the least. I persevered to the end, but felt that Kingsolver didn't live up to her potential in this disappointingly long effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not anti-Christian","review":"I am almost finished with this book. It is an very good read--it has held my attention quite well. Some of the reviewers believe it is too PC and anti-Christian. I do not see it this way--it simply questions whether we, as Christians, have a right to shove our beliefs down the throats of unwilling participants and whether we should be endangering our families in the name of Christ. Some things simply can't be solved with Christianity. Many Christians have a bad history of doing this in the name of Christianity--and I consider myself a rather devout Christian! I highly recommend this book for both education and entertainment. I loved the characters in this book--even Nathan. I see a screenplay in the works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm exhausted!","review":"Well, If you have come this far (reading this review), you already know what the book is about. Let me tell you how I felt after I finished this book. Exhausted! Melancholy! I needed a nap! I further felt like exploring more of the history of the Congo. I was a child who's knowledge of anything to do with the Congo was limited to the pictures in National Geographic. I have been exploring other mediums of history on the Congo since I put this book down. I bet you will too! What else can I say? Read this book! It will enrich your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Commentary and Sybolism","review":"I recently saw that Oprah has selected this book as her Book of the Month. Normally I don't agree with many of her selections - but in this case I do. Kingsolver has created rich, believable characters. Each character has her turn at describing the events that she witnesses. What I found interesting is the recurring events, being told through different characters and how they, in turn view and process what they witness/encounter.Without giving too much away - I can say that the book is laced with excellent uses of symbolism. The witting is easily understood and at times, you can hear the distinctive voices of each of these ladies as you begin to read their story.There is a message contained within the story and it is not difficult to pick up on it - and if you think about it after you read the book - you will find yourself referring this book to other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisitely written, many layered story telling","review":"Having just returned from Africa, I was hungry for more about the mysterious and facinating continent. Kingsolver is my all-time favorite writer, so I was delighted to read the book and savored its length and detail. Now, I need something else to read but fear that nothing will satisfy me as this book has. I feel a great deal like I did when I finished The Handmaid's Tale. Thought provoking, troubling and delicious book, makes me want to talk about it to everyone. I love the evolution of the characters and the history that I learned from reading. I am still wondering what to read now. I hope to use this book in my high school literature classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSORBING READ","review":"Thouroughly enjoyable novel by a great writer. Kingsolver totally sucked me in and made me care about every character. Highly recommended for its expose of life on the other side of the world"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different from her other books- well written","review":"This book was not easy to read but well worth the work. The different perspectives add much to the telling of the story and had quite distinct voices. I am still processing the book -- there were so many levels to consider -- the history, the relationships and the personal growth of all of the female characters. This definitely did not contain any strong or growing male characters. The good ones were one demensional and the bad ones were evil women haters. I was moved to tears, thought, outrage and to read the book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"With patience, this book is worth reading.","review":"I had been anxiously awaiting this new Kingsolver novel and looked forward to delving once again in the Southwest culture which she brought to life so vividly in her previous novels.I was initially disappointed when I discovered that the subject of her new novel was Africa. It took a while for me to get into the \\"flow\\" of the book but when I did I was delighted. She made each character believably unique. My only criticism is that the final chapters became political lectures which were tedious and unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was the most well written book I have ever read.","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is a wonderfully written account of four sisters and their mother who have been taken to the Congo at the whim of their hypocritically religious, missionary father. I found the book extremely easy to read, and even easier to enjoy.I really enjoyed the books diversity...using each girl's/woman's perspective to narrate different situations. I particularly enjoyed how the characters evolved into completely different people as their experience in the Congo affected them. They became what they never expected.This was not the best book I have ever read, but it was close. I found myself enjoying the authors choice of words, as well as her symbolism. I definitely forgot myself, and became an observer of the family as it struggled in the foreign environment of the Congo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vivid and colorful, but way to slow","review":"I must be the exception rather than the rule but I didn't enjoy this novel. I highly anticipated the arrival of Kingsolver's newest book. Although vivid in description of the Congo and its lush surroundings, I found it difficult to like the characters.The story seemed to jump to much and at times and tended to get way to \\"wordy\\". The book was purchased in October and I just finished it tonight.(this is very rare for me to take this long) I found myself hoping the story would pick up and for me it just never did. To sum it up.....250 pages would have been sufficient to tell the same story. \\"It just wasn't Bean Trees\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a great read.","review":"I've been reading Ms. Kingsolver for years now but this book convinces me that she's writing on a whole new level. I loved the narrative structure: chapters written in first person from the point of view of a different daughter. Each daughter is well drawn and very different from the other three. I could not put this book down and stayed up late two nights in a row to finish it. I wish they had more than 5 stars that I could give!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Bias","review":"In this book the portrayal of the characters generally follow this unfair pattern; if your a woman you are good. If you live in a third world country you are good. If you are a white male you are bad. That's kind of it in a nutshell. Also, this book attacks the United States. Personally, I'm tired of this kind of hatred directed at me and my country. In this book the US can do no good, no matter what. Negative, negative negative. This books political viewpoint is very, very one sided. And not for me. I did finish the entire book, for my wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, Oprah has done it again.","review":"Why in the world Oprah would want to show a book like this on her show is beyond me, it was the most backbone-breaking, SLOW, BORINGEST book I have ever read, and believe me, (I have read a lot). I am real sick of Oprah Windfree and her retarded ideas, my wife likes to sit on the couch, eat doughnuts, and watch Oprah all day while Im at work, she has ALL of the shows taped. Just because of this book, I am divorcing my wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible.","review":"There is no way that there is more than 5 people out there that visit this site each day. There must be some prankster out there who keeps clicking on the \\"no, this review was not helpful' button. Stop doing it or post your own reviews that I can disapprove of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"As good as the writing style and character development is, Barbara Kingsolver uses the Poisonwood Bible as a vehicle to support a viscous murderer. Anyone who would purposely seek out the input of a cowardly murderer to critique their book doesn't deserve to get it published, no matter how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good....with reservations.","review":"This was the first Kingsolver book I'd ever read. Several of my college professors were reading it and talking about it, so I decided to give it a try. Having lived overseas myself as the child of missionary parents, some of the issues in the book hit very close to home. I understood the cultural faux pas and the shock of moving to a strange new world, and Kingsolver's portrayal of these things was believable. It is not the best written book I've ever read. The multiplicity of voices at times makes for a rather cluttered narrative, and some of the word play gets a bit annoying. The techniques Kingsolver uses are not highly original, but it is a good read because of the conflicts it presents"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is one of the most thought provoking and thoroughly enjoyable books to come out in the last ten years. I finished it last night and have already sent the book off to my mother so that she can see into the lives of these women as I did. Ms. Kingsolver's use of the English language was wonderful and intriguing - such as the backward/ forward reading by Adah. As some of the other reviewers metioned the book did slow down at the end but how would we all have felt if we did not get to see into the sisters lives in their 30's, 40's and 50's. I would not have changed one sentence in this novel and I thank Ms. Kingsolver for sharing this story with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Reading","review":"Really good book! Interesting to read from all different family member view points. Definitely an eye opener on the situation in the Congo! I recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book that Begs for a Discussion Group","review":"The five Price women, mother Orleanna, daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah, and little Ruth May tell of their trials the year their father Nathan took the family to the Congo in answer to his mission call. Each of the women tells of her experiences, but this disjointed style does not tie a story together. Each person tells their version of seperate incidents. While the others may refer to an episode, the reader only gets one person's perspective of the incident. A perplexity pervaded as to how the story tied together. By the end of the book, the conclusion was that the story is how the time in the Congo affected the futures of the Price women.Recently it was suggested that this is more of a literary work--the richness of the words and the pictures they paint are the story. Quite true. The reader needs to savor the prose and not rush through the book looking for the tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A leading cause of depression among readers","review":"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's previous books, essays, and short stories. I enjoyed them all. That is not the case with The Poisonwood Bible. I found this book depressing, preachy, and not at all enjoyable. I felt like reading this book was a penance I was being forced to do. I donated it to the local public library, so maybe I can save some other unsuspecting reader from having to pay for it. I got the message that the white man should not change the Africans way of life, and that culture is a function of environment. I hope Ms. Kingsolver has done her preaching for her career, and can get back to writing that is of the high quality of her earlier works. She does not have the only truth, as the Baptist missionary did not have it in this pitiful novel,"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total disappointment from a consistently good author","review":"This is the only book I have ever returned to Amazon -- I couldn't bear to own it a minute longer. Kingsolver jumps into new territory with this latest novel and from page 1 you have nothing to hold onto. Chapters jump from one of five characters, Kingsolver's interpretation of young thoughts, teenage insecurities, adult regret is nothing but contrived. I am an avid reader, enjoy challenges, but this just left me wondering who Kingsolver is writing for and why she went so wrong with this book. She's lost one formerly devoted reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraordinarily Overrated; Mindnumbing","review":"I read half of \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" which was on the top of many must-read lists and purports to be \\"literature.\\" I had hopes of gaining real insight into African culture, and to experience a well-written female narrative (like the voices of Atwood and Diamant). For the first time in 35 years of reading, I couldn't finish a book. Barbara Kingsolver's blathering feelings-oriented tome was, well, tedious, neurotic and sleep-inducing. By the middle of the book, I was hoping the Congolese would strangle the four female protagonists -- to put them out of their misery, for being such stupid pitiful \\"victims.\\" The only victim, alas, was me the reader. The characters were one dimensional, and the tale of shoe-horned Western-Civ gone wrong too often told. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one, unless you're looking for a cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political piece","review":"None of the characters was worth investigation. All were handling a poor situation very poorly. The author is clearly against US policy of the time and against the Bible as a world book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read this year","review":"The book was a fasciniting insight into the conflict between the arrogance of the westerner who always knows best and the indiginous population who actually do know what they are doing. The conflict between the two was clearly outlined. This was relected in the internal conflict present within the family structure. The use of the females family members to narrate the story gave it a slant which would not have been possible if the father had been narrating. It could even be said that the males are for the most part described in less than flattering terms. I noticed that the official reviewer found the 'malapropisms' of one daughter annoying. On the contrary, I found that if you think about the word mistakenly used in context with its surrounding thoughts, that quite often one could see a meaning just as relevant yet totally different from the surface meaning. Please look again!All in all, this was one of the most riveting books I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic...","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is one of the best books I have ever read! It chronicles the journey of the Price family as they travel to the Belgian Congo as missionaries. Although the book is over 500 pages long, the story is so captivating that the length is not an obstacle to enjoyment of the novel. This book is not only a provocative story, but also inspires the reader to reflect upon his or her own questions regarding faith. I absolutely loved this book and now consider it to be one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I love this story. I think Kingsolver did and amazing job of writing the book in 5 different voices. I thought it was really interesting- I learned a lot about the history of Africa. I think that the author paints a vivid picture of the area- I could picture the people and the places while I was reading. Occasionally the narration seems to get a little long-winded, but overall I really enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara Kingsolver is a great writer...","review":"I've enjoyed her other novels, always thick with nature & the natural world. I've been resistant to reading the Poisonwood Bible because it was an Oprah Book Club Book. (I usually find them banal) Kingsolver uses several characters to (all of which you can probably find within yourself) depict the hardships of the people of Africa & the political goings on the East is so unaware of. When a book influences my ideals in anyway or gives me a perspective I didn't previously have I consider it a good book. That's what Kingsolver did for me in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a snoozer","review":"Although I felt the book was well written overall it could not keep my attention. The book spouted off too much religous jargen and I cannot say I enjoyed the ending. As a matter of fact I had to force myself to read the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite boring...","review":"This book is quite boring. The story is toooo slow... you can practicall fall asleep, plus the characters are not very likable. I found it very hard to identify with any of them. There have been very few ocassions when I have found myself skipping pages of a book in order to finish it but this was definitely one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The heart of Africa","review":"I have two friends, who are not well-acquainted with each other, and who both spent a year in Africa. Both of them have told me, at different times, that they wanted to write about what it was like to go to Africa to return to the United States and then try to sort out what their experiences had actually meant to them. When they each read The Poisonwood Bible, both commented to me that they probably did not need to write that book themselves, since Barbara Kinsolver had written it for them. I think that is a very important endorsement of this book.I have not been to Africa, but it has become one of the personal \\"filters\\" that I use when I think of Africa, recent African history, and evangelical Christianity, all of which are major topics in this novel. It is very different than Kingsolver's earlier novels, and it has places where it drags or is repetitive, but I think it is an excellent, thought-provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful,thought provoaking read","review":"I have read most of Barbarba's earlier books, and found them funny and loving. I picked up this book, out of couriousity and started on the winding emotional and historical journey of the Piosonwood Bible. Wonderfully written, albeit somewhat different form her earlier works, but no less touching. She opens the readers eyes to a different world, where you will question the Industrialized nations' commerical,obsession with \\"things\\". The characters are amazing...heroic...weak...human. Do yourself a favor pick this up today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"I read so many books that I now keep a list of titles because I actually forget which ones I have read. I will never forget this book or the characters in it. It is such a profound book and made me really question the things that we value in our lives. I think this book should certainly be included in required reading lists for high school students and/or college students. I have recommended this book to many friends. Before this book, when people asked me, \\"what is your favorite book\\"?, I used to be at a loss, considering all the books I have read. No more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is the first Kingsolver book I have read and it was compelling. First of all, she develops each of her characters in depth by having each of them tell their portion of the story. Secondly, she paints such a magnificant picture of life in the Congo that the reader can't possibly leave this book in ignorance. I don't think I would like to live under such primitive conditions but I certainly do have a deeper appreciation for the cycle of life that is so entirely different than my own. I found that this book gave me great insights into what I have in my own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful work of ficton","review":"I though this book was great, the characters were descibed in vivid detail and i got to know all of them quickly. I also think it was interesting how he showed the different point of veiws of each girl in the family. Although some chapters did drag, it was still worth reading to the end, my favorite part was especially the haunting fate of one of the character, which left me shaking after i read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is one of the best books to come along in a very long time. Barbara Kingsolver has an incredible gift. Her insight into human life - our strengths and frailties - is uncanny. I was right there with the characters throughout the book. Her knowledge of the history of the Congo was excellent. This is one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingsolver paints her characters well, without stereotypes","review":"Barbara Kingsolver does an absolutely masterful job in describing both her characters and historical significance of the period. Yes, there are \\"evil whites\\" and \\"good blacks\\", in the book, but there are also good whites and evil blacks. More to the point, noone is stereotyped. I particularly enjoyed the character Adah -- she was portrayed as having a complex personality, whimsical one moment, intellectual the next. It is particularly gratifying to me, as a person with a disability, to see such a complex characterization of a fictional character with a disability. Rather than circumscribe her personality, Adah's disability lends a subtle nuance to how she views others in her world. This is a wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A magically written piece of literature.","review":"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's previous novels and while I enjoyed them all, I feel this is her strongest and most powerful work yet. The characters in this book were so well developed that I could anticipate their thoughts and actions as I might those of a family member or close friend. I was transformed by this magic book and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingsolver's fan","review":"Writing a story through the voices of 5 different women is ingenious. I love Rachel's malpropisms, am deeply touched by the mother's suffering and feel I know all the girls well as I read. Kingsolver knows human development and her history and what is wrong and what is right in the world. I wait for her books to come out,but hope she is having a good life if she isn't consumed with publication"},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL READ-MAMBO SNAKES AND ALL!","review":"POISONWOOD BIBLE WAS MY FIRST TASTE OF BARBARA KINGSOLVER, BUT CERTAINLY NOT MY LAST. HER STORY OF THE PRICE FAMILY, BABTIST MISSIONARIES TRANSPLANTED TO THE CONGO IN 1959 WAS EXTRAORDINARY. WHAT STRUCK ME MOST ABOUT THIS BOOK WAS THE AFRICAN VIEWPOINT. SO OFTEN WHITES MOVE IN SOMEWHERE TO \\"IMPROVE\\" AND ONLY DO DAMAGE. AS THE OUSTED MISSIONARY TOLD, THINK OF YOURSELF AS A BRANCH OFF THE TREE OF AFRICA. WHO AND WHAT CHANGES DURING THEIR YEAR IN THE CONGO IS THE REAL STORY."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!","review":"Wonderful! The four daughters are very independent; it is hard to believe they are all described by the same author. This is an example of truly skilled and masterful writing. A tour-de-force of a remarkable family whose members live remarkable lives. You will laugh and cry, but most of all you will think about this book long after you've read the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired","review":"This book was a major disappointment to me. The first hundred pages were slow and hard for me to get into. It got more interesting around the middle but ended horribly with boring, trite, and preachy politics along with a lot of guilt. The historical background on the African Congo was a good history lesson for me, but not enough of a reason to suffer through it. Yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The magic of deep, dark Africa comes alive","review":"This historical novel was compelling and alive in its portrayal of the depiction of Africa during the 1950's.

The synopsis is much,much,much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love with the characters","review":"The Poisonwood Bible stays with you long after you finish reading it. It is told from the perspective of the mother and her four daughters and I looked forward to reading each of their accounts."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"defintely a five\\"","review":"This book is so fascinating I can't put it down. It's been well researched as one can see from the bibliography at the end, and I feel I'm learning so much about one African country's tragic history, something they never told us about in school. I like one reader's comparison to the Mosquito Coast; the family power structure is very similar, as well as the white Americans' naivete and total unpreparedness for what they find.I'm almost at the end and find I dont want to let it go either. The characters (except for the father) have done so much growing throughout, and the plot never lacks for action. On a scale of 1-5, I'd give this a 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingsolver's worst isn't that bad","review":"A fan of Barbar Kingsolver, I was on the waiting list at the library before this book even came out. I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as her previous novels. As a Kingsolver book, it wasn't that good. As a book, however, I found it superior.Readers may have trouble reading Ada's palandrome-laden narratives, or sympathizing with Rachel, the beauty queen. THat was something I wasn't used to. Generally, all of Kingsolvers characters are slightly flawed, but likeable. This was the first book of hers I read where I genuinely disliked some of the characters.Still, it was good, but not up to my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it, but not as much as her other books!","review":"When I saw it in the book store, I decided that I had to buy it, even though it had not come out in paperback (not a grad student anymore). I've loved Ms. Kingsolver's lyrical descriptions, wonderful ways of showing the love of native people of the southwest and how her characters deal with community. I believe all she wrote about the political situation, the family of fundamentalist missionaries, the naivety, etc. A bit predictable from my point of view (mainline denomination pastor). She is indeed a great visionary. But I missed the small moments of love that enchanted me in Pigs in Heaven, Animal Dreams, and The Bean Trees, the ways that folk do redeem their lives with love. I guess I felt this didn't have the same measure. Yes, there is a romance, but this one left me untouched, and I'm not sure why. Do read it, but don't expect the same Kingsolver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Slow and Boring","review":"I read this book with my reading group, and after reading all the reviews I am wondering what we missed. Of the 10 in the group only 3 managed to finish. 5 read the first couple of chapters and never went beyond, and the last two quit about half way. I finished the book, but I found it overlong. It was extremely slow moving and frequently boring. I never cared very much about any of the characters with the exception of Adah, and it seemd as if the political agenda of the author frequently overwhelmed the storytelling. Not one I would be inclined to recommend or ever read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid portrait of Africa","review":"This is an excellent book and paints a vivid portrait of colonial Africa. The descriptions are both colorful and perfect. The characters are especially well drawn and each is unique and memorable. Telling the story from the viewpoint of each of the women is a masterful touch and the author makes wonderful use of this device. I enjoyed reading about African politics and thought Kingsolver did a good job of weaving them into the story.The only reason I deducted a star was because the story seemed to go on for too long. Cutting back fifty to seventy-five pages would have made this book a perfect five-star read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I missed the point","review":"Other people love this book and others say it's slow but stay with it. I got 170 pages in and found I was annoyed at the characters (what did they expect to find in Africa?) and didn't really care anymore about what happened.I know I'm one of the few who didn't like it but I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A multi-voice book that allows you to be part of the family","review":"I picked up this book because the title intrigued me. The book speaks to the reader from the 5 voices of the mother and daughters. It is an amazing evolution that takes place. Each daughter view the Congo and the father in a completely different way. From embracing the experience to counting the days that they can return to the US. I find my self with conflicting views of the father who is heavy handed and dogmatic. I find my self siding with one of the daughters and eagerly wait for her to continue talking. It is like you become a part of this family and live the trials and few joys of their lives in the Congo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to say except thumbs down","review":"I won't take your time with jargon as I'll assure you that you will want to quickly move on reading descriptions about another book.

This book is written in the voices of the four daughters and the mother, which I thought were each distinct and believable. It is fascinating to see the exploration of faith, love, hate, ego, and bigotry as it is played out among the stranded Price women and the increasingly insane Nathan Price. Unlike the typical novel, which would have probably ended when the Price women finally left Nathan, this one continues on so that you find out what happened to the girls after they grew up. A thought-provoking lesson about African politics and culture and America's ethnocentrism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets worse as you go along","review":"Great start and wonderful character development, but the book becomes tedious about midway through. In the intial stages I loved the parts about how the family was learning and adjusting to life in the Congo. Halfway through after the incident with the youngest child, the book seems to devolve into a laborious mass. The injection of overt political rants really shifts the focus away from the characters and onto the author who is obviously trying to make some statement (although one is never quite sure what her point is). In the end it becomes a chore just to get to the end. Even then, there really is no resolution in the final chapters, the book just comes to a stopping point."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grating load of nonsense","review":"It took all I had to read half way through this book. But I had to finally succumb to boredom and throw it away. It is a very rare occasion when I don't finish a book, out of pure curiosity if nothing else. But I'm glad to be done with this load of annoying nonsense. If you enjoy corny shallow characters,and stories that try so hard to be funny and at the same time political then you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, don't even bother.How this author is so popular, I'll never quite figure out."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and LAST!","review":"This was my first and last Kingsolver book!

It's a wonderful book that lets you see through the eyes of the five women in the family. The storyline will leave you amazed at the hardships they faced and how they overcame them. Overall it's a wondeful book, but don't read it unless you're willing to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is an intersting book. You must read the entire book to get the true actual meaning f the book. The book reminds me of \\"How The Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents,\\" by: Julia Alvarez. The only difference is the book goes forward in time. Each of the 4 girls and their mother,Orleanna, Rachel, Leah, Adah, and Ruth May have different perspective on how life is in the Belgian Congo. This creative formula makes the book even better. The only downfall of the book is the mother has a boring perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read, sad that it ended","review":"Makes me want to investigate our true American History as well as appreciate all that we take for granted everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opener","review":"bought it when son and daughter in law were in africa. it sure gave me an idea of what history and life was and is in africa"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader","review":"I have been disappointed with Oprah Book Club choices in the past.

Many of the problems the characters experience are still true 40 years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately interesting first half but way too long","review":"Even the moderately interesting first half was way too long and repetitive; the author essentially told you in the first chapter what was going to happen, so it was just a question of how it was going to get there. It got there slowly.I was going to say it had the longest denouement I have ever read, but online reviewer \\"Ellen\\" expressed it better: \\"page upon page of endless bla bla bla-ing\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I really really tried to like this novel. Barbara Kingsolver is one of my favorite authors and I've relished all of her previous writing. But this book was dreary in the extreme. I tried to force myself to read it but finally rebelled after about l00 pages. The family endures relentless pain, suffering, and misery. I don't mind heavy books (like \\"Animal Dreams\\") but I don't submit myself to books about endless misery with no joy or hope. For a life-affirming book, try \\"The Color of Water,\\" a serious book but one that inspires and uplifts, rather than this dark and depressing tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good or Bad Message?","review":"Overall I found the book very intriguing. I was interested in the Price family, as I am fascinated by missionary stories. However, I think that Barbara Kingsolver shows obvious disdain for the Christian Religion, making the missionary husband (Nathan Price) the main obsticle in the way of the Price women's survival. It seems as though Ms. Kingsolver has generalized Christians as arrogant know-it-alls from the Bible Belt. It is obvious from the very beginning that the Price family (and particularly Nathan) are in for a rude awakening. In fact, towards the end of the novel I found that all the characters were turned off by the very thought of Christianity, associating it with their deranged father and husband they left behind in the Congo. This is the feeling I believe the authoress was trying to create in her readers. By all means, enjoy this book! I know I did, but keep in mind that Christianity is in fact skewed toward a negative light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get into it.","review":"This book had some promise. It could have been good but I did not feel part of the story. The author was just telling the reader what happened. I like to know what the characters are experiencing inside as well as out. I lost interest in the first quarter of the book. I gave more than one star because the premise was good and the characters at least potentially were interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ambitious book which boggs down into preaching politics.","review":"I think that Barbara Kingsolver must sit down and decide whether she is writing a novel or a political tract. It is not that I disagree in a fundamental way with her political beliefs. My problem is that she has them on her sleeve, or at least her character's sleeve, to such an extent that character development is truncated. Most of my friends do not agree with my politics. If either they or I were defined by our set of political beliefs, I would have no friends, and I have a good many close ones. Barbara Kingsolver is a gifted writer who starts with a good idea and creates believable characters and plots, but all too often gets bogged down in preaching at the reader through her characters. Certainly, Animal Dreams suffered from this and The Poisonwood Bible is all but sunk by it. Telling a story through five different childhood voices is a monumental task--perhaps really impossible--and I congratulate the author for trying at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Oprah is Bangala\\" says Cincy Country Day School","review":"Popular American 50s culture clashes violently and fatally with an upheaving Belgian Congo in this masterful work by Kingsolver. While using a Baptist missionary family to display how lives are changed by a radically new environment, the underlying author's messages about colonialism, religion, and family values are indelibly impressed upon the reader's soul. The rape of a virgin African wilderness by a consciousless, impersonal European power is blatantly shown and condemned. The effect upon each individual of the country, from the inhabitants of the European-named cities to the subsistence farmers in the remote villages, each is drastically changed by faceless, rich, white, foreign governments who selfishly steal the resources of a country still searching for its own identity. Read this novel for a deeper insight into how the other half lives. Two enthusiastic thumbs up, fun for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poisonwood Bible Review","review":"Overall, I thought that the Poisonwood Bible had a great plot, although I thought that the beginning was slow. It would have been nice to have a background on the Price family living in the US. It also would have been nice to see their reactions to their father's demands. I thought that each character in the book was excellently portrayed. No character was the same as another, and their emotions and feelings were obvious and realistic. I enjoyed the author's writing style. Although, sometimes it was boring, especially in the beginning. Sometimes she was too descriptive, and other times, she was not descriptive enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has me...","review":"The Poisonwod Bible grabbed me and tore me into pieces. I finished it two weeks ago and still cannot let go of it. I recommend this book to everyone. Only racially biased people and man-haters will not be engrossed with this book. The way it was written helped you FEEL every character. The only downside to this book, is that it did not give me the closure I was looking for. I have not found a book that can match it as of yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Preachy","review":"I thought the book was good and would have given it 5 stars, except that I felt it was a little too preachy and anti-american. Rachel's stupidity didn't bother me as much as most of the time I felt I was being forced to sway my belief of how I feel about our great country. I also felt she droned on way too long after they left the Congo. A short synopsis of what happened to them down the line would have sufficed. Instead it just kept going on and on for chapters that never seemed to end. It just wasn't necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Reaching","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's THE POISONWOOD BIBLE is a far reaching novel of epic proportions. Orleanna, Leah, Ruth May, Adah, and Rachel are all engaging characters. Kingsolver's research is apparently meticulous, and her prose is smooth. The one drawback to this novel, I felt, is the setting. Kingsolver seemed to focus so intensely on an accurate portrayal of the exotic locale that it was possible to forget the characters for a time, which is unfortunate.Overall, this is a tremendous read, although I wouldn't suggest trying to read it in one night -- it takes a bit more time to digest the implications of the situation Kingsolver examines with her stellar prose. I commend her for resisting the urge to lecture about hipocracy and religious and family values; her work is richer for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!!!!","review":"I gave this book a great deal of time and effort,but it was all in vain. After hearing all the gushing from Oprah and her audience members, I thought it was a book I would enjoy. It has to be the most frustrating and confusing book I've ever read. I was constantly confused about which character was speaking at the time. I had to give up less than a quarter of the way through. If you have to work that hard at reading a book, it looses it's enjoyment. I'm never without a book, and I'm always buying new ones, so I consider myself well read. But this one never lived up to the hype. More power to you if you enjoyed it. Maybe there's something wrong with me, but after reading some of the other reviews, I tend to doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poisonwood Bible","review":"I had an incredibly hard time getting into this book. The beginning was slow, but it began to pick up through the middle. The middle was full of excitement and for about 100 pages I found it hard to put down. But toward the end I found it hard to finish. The excitement was over and it was back to dull. I believe the book could have been shortened from 600 pages to about 300 and it would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Kingsolver should have done her homework","review":"As I read this book, I felt swept away in a different era of which I was totally blind. However, when Ms. Kingsolver began to trash the Baptists, I held a different view. First of all, Southern Baptists do not believe in infant baptism. A person has to know Christ in a personal way and make a commitment to be saved and turn from their sins - baptism is an outward gesture to the world that you have faith in Christ and are willing to make a commitment to follow Christ. Ms. Kingsolver clearly has no clue on the Southern Baptist faith. She should have done her homework!!! If she is so totally wrong on the issue of Baptist religion - One can only determine that she may not have done her homework on the political issues either!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I think my headline says it all.

Run, run, run (or click, click, click) and get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"After hearty recommendations, I found this book to be bogged down with personal agenda. There were interesting moments, compelling words ... but the author's apparent disdain for things American (including white men, capitalism and Christians), kept peeking through the story, distracting me. I'm discouraged that so many reviewers take her \\"facts\\" as truth. After Ruth May's death, the book took on a feeling of socialist propaganda. I totally lost interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Yet Beautiful","review":"The Price family are a missionary family that are in the Congo to spread the Word. Kingsolver does a beautiful job describing each of the 4 daughters reactions to their situation. I really enjoyed Rachel because she was so real to me. The other 3 girls point of view are also interesting. Finding themselves in a foreign land, with all the wrong things they have toted from home. There is so much pain here, from both the land and the father of the Price family, and of course the people of the land. After reading this book I feel as though I have been to the Congo and lived it right alongside this family. Such injustice for these people is unthinkable. You will also find a lesson in history. A wonderfully written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poisonwood Bible","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. Not only was it a moving story but I feel like I have visited Africa at it's best and worst. I also feel as though I have known this family personally.

It certainly gives a good history lesson on the Congo in the fifties."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is one of the masterpieces of English/American lit","review":"Kingsolver has written a true masterpiece. It is part history, part novel, part sociological study, a large part poetry - and all of it is saturated in a truth that is too seldom spoken. All of the viewpoints presented (the mother's and each of the daughters') ring true, and one wonders how one author's mind could have entered so convincingly into each of those beings. Kingsolver's great understanding of Africa in general - and specifically the Congo - puts all other studies in the shade. I feel my own understanding is greatly enlarged for having read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gees, Man oh Man","review":"Just when I thought \\"The Bean Trees\\" was my favorite book ever, she goes and writes this one!

I believed this fiction to be nonfiction by the end and know these people will be a part of my life forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY not my favorite book","review":"Reading this book, I cannot understand how so many people could have recommended it to me--I even BOUGHT this one b/c everybody told me it was so good...well, I barely dragged myself through it. I felt absolutely no attachment to any of the characters (maybe I was slightly interested in Adah, but even that was minimal) and found them to be flat and bland at best. Moreover, having grown up in Africa (Zaire, in fact, along with parts of West Africa), I found that Kingsolver completely failed to capture the soul of Africa and what it feels like to grow up there. As a deep, meaningful novel, I think it missed the boat; if her point was to do a political analysis, then she should have spared us the Prices...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember this is FICTION!","review":"I am almost through the final chapter of this book and want to remind readers that this book is a work of fiction! So any discrepancies or expansions on the truth were the author's perogative! Who cares if lions don't live in this part of Africa? Who cares if the savannah and the rainforest cannot exist in the same geographic area? It works with the story and makes it a spellbinding tale if you remember to give up any need for total factual reality. Perhaps the author is trying to make political statements; if you take the book as pure entertainment (however gutwrenching it can be at times), it is worth the read. I am reminded of the Clan of the Cave Bear series, the proverbial caveman soap opera, which was also criticized for its lack of accuracy. Who cares - did it keep your attention and did you enjoy reading it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book, though with some great flaws.","review":"I picked this book up on a whim to read over my Christmas break for school, and found it to be SO difficult to put it down. \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" had me wrapped around it's finger, to say the least. What I really found troubling, however, were the flaws with the Baptist faith. I've been a Baptist my whole life, and can say without a doubt that we do not believe baptism is what brings one into Heaven upon passing away, but asking Jesus into your heart. Baptism is simply the next step in your walk of faith, a public display. Secondly, the Apocrypha is found nowhere in our religious services or devotions, we stick strictly to the Bible. While I understand that these are MAJOR flaws within the book since Nathan Price is supposed to be a fire and brimstone evangelical Baptist missionary, this book remains to be one of the best books that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read book","review":"This is a \\"must-read\\" book. It will certainly broaden your understanding about \\"less-developed\\" countries and their people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful novel of life in a world we take for granted!","review":"I am particularly enticed by the creative literature and precise seperation of character as seen when I move from chapter to chapter exploring the caustic Africa. Kingslover has made a novel both the amature and the advance can obtain knowledge from and wisen for the most part. Every teenager should indulge in this fantastic book. The book created a fear in me for I was oblivious to the world outside the paradise to which I live but now I can empathise and feel that sort of need to explore and discover the ruthlessness of life in a world we often take for granted.I give Kingslover all my support, since I cannot find the dedication she had to write with such intense characterization as I wish to achieve as a young writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Blend of Fiction and Fact","review":"What an epic!I read this book with great interest the plot was good. Arrogant Minister/Father feeling he can change all in the name of God. I felt Nathan's character was also a mirror to America's cold-war mentality: Go Out and destroy Communism wherever it may crop up/Go and preach the word of god among the highways and byways... funny parallelism there, no?The story told in the form of the Mother and her children was done well with each have their distinct voice this was rich. Kingslover thickens her plot with the very real historical and political backdrop -- it made very good auxilliary reading to understand the time.Thank you Ms. Kingslover for telling us a wonderful story of fiction, but moreso for educating us somewhat on a part of history that few folks stateside will choose to recall."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 stars","review":"So many reviews means so much passion! No surprise since this book is amazingly phenomenal in its scope - the mother and her daughters are so amazingly diverse, the plot is as suspensful as as a thriller, the writing flows off the page to transport you into the jungle. Take this book through to the end and you will be amazed. I have read hundreds of books (honest) including all of Kingsolver's work (except her latest) and I can honestly say that Poisonwood Bible is the best novel I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"a hole at the center","review":"With all the fancy stylistic posturing to which Kingsolver resorts to tell this story, she denies a voice to what should be the most interesting of her characters: the father who brought them to Africa. Without any intimate knowledge of him and his motives, we have to take them for granted, which is smug. Are we deprived of him because he's a man (arbitrary) or because of a complete failure of imagination at the heart of the structure?I think this is why the book is much too long and self-indulgently \\"cute\\" - Joseph Conrad's tight construction would have been a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and That's That","review":"This book was a birthday gift from my son so even though I wanted to quit reading it so many times, I trudged on to the end. I kept hoping that it would get better but it never did. I found myself confessing to my husband that I'd be so happy when I was finished reading this book. My main complaint is that I never really connected with any of the characters. Plus, there was the element of being \\"preached\\" to by the author, which was both irritating and tiresome. I do not enjoy being coerced by an author to feel a particular way. There's no need for that. I believe if a story is told authentically, without an agenda, then it can be appreciated no matter which side the reader comes down on the substance of the story.I really wanted to like this book but I just found it lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Book","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in the last three years. The story is breathtaking; the descriptions go beyond reality itself and into poetic depth, and the characters are fascinating. It is impossible to read this book and not to have one's heart go to Africa and to the people so movingly painted by Kingsolver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Book about the Congo and Missionaries","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book about a family that moves to the Congo (a preacher, his wife, and four daughters). I learned a lot about the area and culture; it is evident that meticulous research was involved here. I liked the writing style where chapters are devoted to the voice of a particular character. I did find the political ramblings a little much to take, but it was worth it in the long run. Great book -- highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poisonwoood Bible","review":"This book was presented to me as a school assignment. I looked at it and said o great we got the biggest longest book on the list, and its about a pastor's family blah .. but was i wrong .. this is one of the greatest novels i have really read . it has captivated my attention throughout the whole book and the \\"orleanna price\\" chapters keep me going and striving for the next one due to their immennse intensity and interesting ideas that are put forth. i would highly recommend this book to anyone of any age . and do not judge it on its size!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spell binding fictional history","review":"Barbara Kingsolver captured my heart as we see the Congo of the late 50's through the eyes of a zealously neurotic, (psychotic?) missionary's four female children and his wife. The Price family arrives to find political unrest and a tribal culture that captivates and hones the heart and soul leaving all of them bewildered, embattled, and scarred, tearing the foreign family structure to the ground. It makes one realize the strength of our cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Breathtaking!","review":"As a male reading this book, it is hard for me to totally identify with the characters, however, I was able to identify with their struggles. While friends of mine criticized it for being a decidely female book, the story is universal, breaking gender and race boundaries. It is simply the story of the impact of the jungle (or any other serious trial) on a family. Each character is totally unique and it is difficult to pin one down as the \\"heart and soul\\" of the story. I found myself emotionally drained after prolonged reading (definitely a good thing). This is one of the few books that actually gave me goosebumps more than once. I reccomend it to anyone that can read."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoy and learn","review":"I'm disappointed that so many readers dismiss this book as \\"too political.\\" Unless you already happen to have extensive life experience with Africa, are you really in any position to run up your nose at an outstanding novel that also informs us about US involvement in Zaire? If you think it has nothing to do with you, then like Rachel Price, you're living in denial. Incidentally, I do agree that the book drags towards the end, thought for me that had less to do with politics, and more with repetitious material regarding the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written historical fiction.","review":"Kingsolver does an amazing job of portraying the rise and fall of the Belgian Congo, as well as the tumultuous time afterward, through the eyes of young women. As we follow the Price family into the heart of darkness, we are consumed by the hardship and tragedy that befalls them. Africa refuses to succumb to their expectations. The characters are real, and the story riveting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Novel","review":"I have always been a big fan of Barbara Kingsolver, so I was thrilled to see a new novel come out. The Poisonwood Bible, however, is quite a departure from her earlier novels in that it blew me away. It really is incredible. The story is very interesting, but it is the telling that makes this book so special. Kingsolver tells the story through five different narrators with five distinct voices and personalities. Sometimes the narration can transform what would otherwise be a dull scene into a hilarious story.The Poisonwood Bible is the story of the Price family, a missionary, his wife and their four daughters as they travel to Africa. The story is fascinating and its affects on each member of the family are completely life changing. None will be the same when the book is over and we are the richer for having read this novel. I highly, highly recommend this novel. It is perhaps the best one Oprah has picked and is far, far superior to her normal selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boom da da da da boom da da da boom","review":"You can almost hear the drumbeats of the Belgian Congo leap off the page. Imagine, dragging your four young girls off to live in the jungle. The father Nathan Price has some serious character flaws which are fascinating to uncover. The first part of the book is voiced by each daughter and the mother taking an alternate chapter. This book is long and it is good. It is not for the Danielle Steel crowd. In addition to learning about the Price family, the \\"natives\\", and missionaries I also learned a great deal about the Congo and the politics that surrounded it in the 1960s. This book is an excellent book, the kind you may keep on your bookshelf for years and actually re-read years down the road. Highly highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poisonwood Review","review":"The Poisonwood Bible is the first book I ever read by Barbra Kingsolver. Parts of it were truly amazing. I really like her writing style and she did a good job developing the character of Leah - although I agree with some of the other reviewers that the character of Rachel was one-dimensional. I feel that the best part of the book was the first half, when the family was still living in a small village in the Belgian Congo. It reminded me of \\"Little Women\\" but with a terrifying survivalist kind of edge. The later part of the book was a little disappointing to me (the last 20% - I don't want to give anything away plot-wise). I felt that much of the character development in this section fell flat, although I really enjoyed learning more about the history of the Congo. I wish I could give this book five stars. It had a great plot, excellent narrative but I have to give it four stars because I don't think that some of the characters were very realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my all-time favorite books!","review":"Every day I could not wait until I could sit down and get back into this book. I loved the unique characters and the way you were able to hear all their voices. And to grow with them and see where their individual reactions to their bizarre Congo upbringing took them. Do yourself a huge favor and read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best long book ever","review":"Since this was an assigned book for school, I picked up this book with great trepidation. (Most of the books our school assigns are rather boring.) This book definitely broke the mold. This well-crafted story of Nathan Price, his dynamic daughters and submissive wife is entertaining as fascinating. The book was the longest book I have ever read, but the pages never stopped turning and I honestly had a hard time putting it down at night. Each character is exquisitely developed throughout the novel. The plot is unpredictable and memorable. You will hate some characters and fall in love with others. This tale of love, racism, politics, imperialism, abuse, and womanhood should be read by all those who enjoy a blend of genuine history and tantalizing fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This is not a book one can read in a day (atleast for most readers).

I thought at times that I could feel the rough conditions in which the characters were living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara Kingsolver knows how to touch my heart!!!","review":"First off, I would like to tell everyone that Barbara Kingsolver changed my life with this book. Her book The Poisonwood Bible, is like a bible to me. I was once a beggar on the streets of Chicago, when a kind man let me read this book. From that day forward I have been a changed man. This compelling story has touched my soul in a way nothing else has ever been able to do. It is a heartwarming novel that should be read by everyone in Chicago - especially you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY AMAZING READ","review":"This book is in a class by itself - The story which pulls you in from the first chapter and shows you the irony of religion within the small minded gives you Africa and the lives of these people who you know in such personal ways. I have never been pulled into a book like this before to the piont where I feel that I have experienced these truths and hurts along with them. Barbara Kingsolver has a true gift that few writers possess - READ THIS BOOK - it will become the one you recommend to any and everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"gab gab gab","review":"I read the book cover to cover waiting for it to get off the ground. Barbara has some worthwhile things to say on philosophy, politics, religion, economics, and culture. Unfortunately, she rambles on and on in first person accounts from four females. She could accomplish her literary objectives with half as many words."},{"rating":"2","title":"thank god i was'nt born into that mayhem","review":"the poisonwood bible was very well written and gives a fairly modern view of the history of the congo region.i thoroughly enjoyed this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story in text or audio.","review":"The characters are well developed and the story has great humor (black humor). One of my favorite reads! Listening to it in audio is a delight. The narrator is highly skilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS NOW","review":"One of my all time favorite books. Great characters. I keep an extra copy just to lend out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and historically inaccurate","review":"This book contains so many historical inaccuracies and untruths that it is barely tolerable reading. The author continually exploits cliches of race whether they apply or not just to manipulate the reader's emotions. Leave this book at home, and read \\"AFRICA\\", the true history is so much better than this weak fabrication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy the AUDIOBOOK version (The book itself is great)","review":"I have loved this book ever since I read it when it was first published. It is a fabulously written and engrossing story. A haunting tale of a family and a country that lingers with the reader long after you're done reading. It is one of the books on my keeper shelf, and one I buy for others as gifts. It has also become one of my comfort reads, a book I reach for when nothing else captures my mind enough to escape from the everyday pressures of life. With that said, I bought the audiobook version (unabridged on CD) for a long car trip. Big mistake. DON'T GET THE AUDIOBOOK version! It is horribly read by Dean Robertson (fyi, a female, not a male). There is absolutely no inflection to the voice, no feeling, and the pace is completely wrong for the story. Very rushed and hurried from the start. There is no change when switching from one character to another. Don't waste your money on the audiobook. Buy the paperback version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I truly enjoyed the first 250 pages of this book. I enjoyed the different perspectives of the 5 women and I thought that the author did a great job describing the feel of the Congo. BUT then everything went downhill quick- I feel that the author put down her writing for a long time and then picked it up again in a rush to finish it for publishing. The last 250 pages were rushed and the characters were suddenly boring and one dimensional. I hated the last part of this book- It was awful. If the author had continued the in the same vein as the first 250 pages the book would have been about 1500 pages long and would have been marvelous. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poisonwood reading!","review":"We read this book in our book club last month and four out of five of us hated this book. I really don't see the appeal at all. Yes, it was well written drom a literary point of view, but also dry as dirt. I had to force myself to finish the book. If it had not been a club read I would have given up! It's starts slow and then climaxes half way through. The last third of the book is a big anti-climax. Perhaps I enjoyed it less becasue I disagreed so much with her liberal political and religious views, but it was definatly one of the worst books I have read in recent memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct Kingsolver","review":"If you want to be preached to by our culture read \\"poisonwood\\". Kingsolver does us a disservice by feeding us the usual politically correct bull. She unashamedly promotes her agenda that is in lock step with the general culture of our land. Anti-Christian and anti-life. I knew it was coming but I had to wait till about page 500 before she outright promoted contraception as a possible end to African troubles. She, of course, didn't make me wade into the book any length before she showed her hostility to Christianity. Her intellectual smugness was too much for me to take throughout the book but I perservered not liking a book to defeat me. I closed it five pages before the end in protest."},{"rating":"1","title":"started off good...had to force myself to finish it","review":"I found this book really interesting at first because of the historical context and the idea of writing a book from four different perspectives, but rather than adding objectivity, all four characters only serve to reinforce anti-American, anti-Christian sentiments. She creates unlikeable characters that you don't even love to hate. I found myself relating most to Leah, having been to a third world country and having struggled through the culture shock of returning to the U.S., but the more I read her voice, the more self-righteous she sounded. The saddest part was that there was absolutely no sense of cohesian in the family from the very beginning, nothing that bound them together, and no remorse for the father's fate. But reading this book did get me interested in learning more about the historical context and finding out how true the allegations are against the Eisenhower administration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, dull, disjointed -- couldn't finish it","review":"I was intrigued by the subject matter and the ultimate question of whether we should be sending missionaries to the Congo or other areas to change the basic beliefs of a culture. Unfortunately, this book did not wrestle with this question. The style (different voices for the 5 female characters) leaves you feeling as though you are reading 5 separate books; and the chapters by Rachel are unreadable due to the author's attempt to make her nearly illiterate.I finally quit half-way through the book (and the other reviews suggest that the first half was the best part!) If you are interested in the basic question of sending missionaries to new places, read Mary Doria Russell's \\"The Sparrow\\" instead of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent but way too biased author","review":"There is no doubt that Kingsolver can write, and certain descriptions of Africa and the world are quite excellent.However, she has the canny ability to show her political views with every character--a view that not all her readers may share.All the far-lefts are warm and friendly people while the far-rights are cold and unbending.I do not like the flatness of characters produced in doing so.There are bad and good democrats just as there are bad and good republicans.Adah, one of the daughters, is portrayed wonderfully. Definitely a perk of the book.I think this book is worth it in the end but I wouldn't read any thing else by Kingsolver from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get hooked","review":"I am only on page 40 of this book--but it's taken a week just to read that. I just can't seem to get into the story. I've read several books that keep me going and I'll stay up all night trying to read as much as possible. Maybe I prefer more suspenseful and action filled books. So far Poisonwood has been a yawn!! I guess I give it a chance --it did have good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible...","review":"this book was just plain lousy. I have no idea what message she is trying to convey about missionaries or foreigner arrogance in the midst of the 'natives.' The only message that came across is that the missionaries are psychotic and the natives stupid, hardly a message worth reading about. The characters were two dimensional, especially the 'natives'. The setting was not fully realized and the plot never played through to a believable conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best reading ever","review":"Poisenwood Bible is a must read for everyone. I hope it has been translated into every written language and that it becomes required reading in every institute of higher education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, moving","review":"I'll keep it brief because there are a lot of other reviews here. This is an excellent book that you'll want to read again and again. A friend lent this to me 10+ years ago, and I've never returned it. Every time I've read this book (about once every 3 years), I'm left with a feeling of awe. This is truly the kind of book that transports you to another place and time, and I'm so glad my friend hasn't asked for it back yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"How do we get this book as required reading in American schools?! Impressive material!!! Great writing style!!!If an author captivates you in a story so much that you want to do addtional research on her subject matter even after you've finally closed the book for the final time, she has done her job and then some.Fasinating story! Even better written, told through the personalities of each of the main characters, not all of whom we would be proud to be represented by.While it is clear that she didn't like all of the characters she wrote about, she told the story from her perspective, it's her artistic right not to like a character and to write in such a way that the reader also dislikes them.Loved it! Would like to think that I am a changed and better person after having read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I walked into this novel thinking that it would be an utter waste of my time, since I had to read it for summer AP English work. Having finished it, I've realized that I was completly wrong. This book was amazing! So many words of praise come to mind when I think of this novel. It placed me in the center of a bitter-sweet experience that not only affects the lives of the characters but also that of the reader. The Poisonwood Bible was touching in every sense of the word and it was definitely worth the hours I put into reading it. Kingsolver's characters were believeable and extremely well-developed. The plot was unique and intriguing and I found it virtually impossible to put down. The beauty and majesty of this novel are hard for me to express, after having found myself drowning in such words and such a story. I am exceedingly pleased that Oprah has placed it on her Book Club list for June and I would whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone. Enjoy this mesmerizingly wondeful experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful to read and even better to listen!","review":"I read this wonderful book as soon as it came out and thought it was fabulous. My husband had not read it and we purchased the unabridged \\"books on tape\\" for our road trip to Yosemite! What a brilliant idea it was! We were captivated by the language and appreciate the beauty of the parables and analgoies. I HIGHLY recommend the audio version of this great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful writing Marred by One-Note Characterizations","review":"How could Kingsolver have ruined her book with such an obvious error? Nathan is a strident paper doll that flattens the whole story. Just as bad, the author has all the narrators using the same ironic tone to describe him, deadening their voices as well. At the same time, Kingsolver doesn't have the guts to show him doing something trully terrible. I don't trust an author who can't let the reader make up his own mind, and as a consequence I couldn't trust her views about ANYTHING in the story. I'm giving this two stars for her descriptions of the African landscape, and that is all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read","review":"Besides being a wonderfully absorbing story (tho it took about 50 pages to grab me)..this is one of those books that changed me a little...made me look at myself from a different angle..and peaked a formerly nonexistant fascination with African history. Kingsolver's characters are rich with beauty and ugliness and familiarity. This book is a new experience..a story to be read slowly and absorbed, tasted. There's unbelievably dysfunctional family relationships, the gentlest of love, breathtaking danger and hardship in everyday life, fascinating insite into a remote culture, conflicts in religion, atrocities by the leaders.. all set in the Congo..and you are there seeing it and feeling it in a way never before possible. This is a delicious book. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bible according to Jesus","review":"I thought this book was interesting. it was really really really long, but it was also very good. I liked the way it was written through many peoples eyes and how each character was made so dynamic through their actions and personalities. I thought this book was a good read if you have a lot of time on your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing novel","review":"I loved this book - raw, elegant, poignant, humourous - real. This book has it all and is honest. This book is for people who like to think and feel. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Middle is Worth Reading","review":"The whole idea of an American missionary family going to the Congo to save lost souls, only to put their own in danger, fascinated me. What really interested me was why would anybody feel compelled to do so? Was it out of a real zealousness for the Word of God or was it borderline fanaticism that made Nathan Price drag his family into the heart of Africa? This novel answers these questions using the voices of Nathan Price's wife and four daughters in a prose that is wonderful and mesmerizing.However, I had to be patient with this novel, because it took me 100 pages to get into it, and truly enjoy the language. Also, the ending was very anticlimatic, and I think this book could've ended 150 pages sooner. I did give it four stars because I really enjoyed the middle, and I believe that part is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel guilty not liking this book","review":"I'm a big Kingsolver fan and will read whatever she writes next. The Poisonwood Bible was a disappointment. An ambitious but failed effort. You could tell that she was trying very hard, had her heart in the right place, and was very well meaning. But for me, using the different voices as \\"books\\" of this bible didn't work because they didn't seem real and the book was disjointed. I liked her descriptions of the Congo, but actually expected more politics, especially after reading some of the reviews. Unlike her other books, this one felt forced, like she knew it wasn't working and just kept writing and writing hoping it would get better. I kept reading and reading, feeling the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took me to a place I'd never been","review":"I enjoyed this novel a lot, but I don't think it holds up to careful consideration. The descriptions of Congo village life are excellent, and, I assume, accurate. But the relationships among the characters are never fully developed and the father remains a mystery. All the characters are just described and remain the same throughout. The last 100 pages or so are boring, especially Leah's political viewpoint. Yet the book made me laugh and cry and kept my interest. I don't think it's a great book, but it is one of the best of the less-than-great, popular books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Retrospective","review":"Simply wonderful reading. I could kick myself for not paying enough attention to my wife's recommendation several years ago, but she was exactly right: this is a story well worth the amount of time in your life you sacrifice to read it. In fact, it is many stories interwoven and they each grow as a vine of their own before interlacing themselves through each other. For me, most good books take quite a few pages before the hook is set but the author had me with the first paragraph."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could I have missed this one for so long?","review":"Wonderful book... so well written and engaging. I thoroughly enjoyed how the author got into the head of each of the daughters to present their unique views along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Valium and Read this Pap!","review":"I recently read half of \\"The Poisonwood Bible,\\" which is on the top of the best seller lists and purports to be \\"literature.\\" I had hopes of gaining real insight into African culture, and to experience a well-written female narrative (like the voices of Atwood and others). For the first time in 35 years of reading, I couldn't finish a book. Barbara Kingsolver's blathering feelings-oriented tome was, well, tedious, neurotic and sleep-inducing. By the middle of the book, I was hoping the Congolese would strangle the four female protagonists -- to put them out of their misery, for being such stupid pitiful \\"victims.\\" The only victim, alas, was me the reader. The characters were one dimensional, and the tale of shoe-horned Western-Civ gone wrong too often told. Do yourself a favor, and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will never think the same way about leftovers again.","review":"This book is one of the most impactful I have read in the last few years. Barbara Kingsolver captured my attention by presenting different characters with their respective personalities and dialogue about the experiences of a family far away from home. It is at the same time humorous and extremely thought-provoking. The Poisonwood Bible brought to light economic and cultural realities of Africa in a way that I will never forget. Don't miss this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First 85% of this novel is 5 stars!","review":"I won't bother repeating what's been said in the other billion reviews of this book, but my one comment is that I adored this book and might have potentially rated it a 5* (rare for me) if not for the last two chapters, which dragged and ruined the great reading experience I was having. I'd still highly recommend it just for the pleasure of the storyline, the charming and interesting characters, and the flowing writing style. Then rush through the ending just to finish what is otherwise a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poisonwood Bible","review":"The book was highly recommended by a friend. Unfortunately after several attempts to read the book I gave up. At no time was I able to develop an interest in the story or the characters. Ophrah and my friend enjoyed it. As for me -- as far as this book is concerned I chose poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I found the story very hard to get into and then I had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Male Bashing 101","review":"Despite universal acclaim, I found the characters cartoonish and predictable. The world of men are bad and women endure and prevail does not represent a fictional world I'd like to enter nor the real world where I live. Dear old crazy dad, we made it despite him or because of him, but we couldn't, didn't, don't love him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't like it.","review":"Nuff said about it. I thought it was depressing (as are all of Oprah's picks). Doesn't she like to read anything upbeat?"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, slow, slow","review":"ugh. the facts were fascinating but it was very hard to get into and just because of that I forced myself to finish it. I borrowed it from a friend and she warned me. I didn't listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I didn't spend money on the hardcover edition.","review":"It is difficult to become engrossed in a book when you actually dislike most of the characters and the plot is thin. This book picks up in the middle, but it's too late by then to really grab you."},{"rating":"2","title":"calling an editor!","review":"in many ways this book is transcendent. very complex and pleasing imagery and symbolism. complex characters that force you to understand them. at page 365 a very significant event occurs, and it is described in one of the most moving passages i have ever experienced.unfortunately after this the author shifts gears. instead of wrapping it up and letting a divine story rest on its laurels she meanders for 150 pages of very unsatisfactory and preachy epilogue. someone should have intervened in an editorial capacity, because as of page 365 this book could stand peerless. unfortunately that potential is squandered leaving the sum total as only very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Congo Remembered","review":"When a book is equally riveting the second time it is read, that's a good book. The range of voices, plain and mysterious, captivated me. I have been to the sad state of the former Zaire as a peace corp mother. Because of Kingsolver's descriptions, I could see the heat, the soil, the indigenous people so very different from us in the states. I remembered again how powerful the influence of the natural world was on the way we moved thru the time (several weeks) as we moved thru the jungle, then the savannah land. But it was the people's forbearance at that time that the author of Poisonwood Bible put into words for me. Kingsolver's knowledge of the culture and political situations indicated some serious research; I was glad that Mobutu was labeled correctly in her writing and that the U.S. collusion was identified. Quite brave of her. We were not allowed to discuss politics during our visit although it was quite obvious the nation's infrastructure was disintegrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending Very Disappointing","review":"The beginning is boring and drags on. About 3-4 chapters are interesting and the ending is very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poisonwouldn't","review":"I had such a difficult time getting through this book that I found myself wishing for poisonwood myself! I found it to be tedious, repetetive and boring. The only good parts of the book in my opinion were the beginning and the last 30 pages or so. The entire in-between was GRUELING! I felt the need to get to the end of Poisonwood because my past experiences with other Kingsolver books have been so great and she is such a talented writer. Reading \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" was almost as arduous a task as getting out of bed very early on a rainy, icky, cold Sunday morning because it's raining on your bed. It's just not something I personally prefer to do, and having had this experience, I feel comfortable likening it to reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men,traditional families and our Christian God ,,be gone....","review":"The writer has great descriptive powers but her basic anti men view and the rejection of traditional values found in the King James Bible along with the ideal as the \\"noble savage\\" should have been stated openly and up front by the author. The reader would then understand the slanted views of the World and Africa presented in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccuracy of scripture","review":"Many people have responded that it is an inaccurate view of Africa. Well, I'm greatly disappointed with her handling of scripture and bible stories. Right from the beginning, her story of Susannah and the prophet Daniel saving her life.....never happened and not evidenced in the bible. Had to quit reading the book knowing that she had no idea or basis to write a novel centered around a preacher (who gives Christianity a bad name, by the way), with no or little knowledge of what is in the bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"I really loved this book. The thing I would say that was difficult was the extensive political history but that was still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgetable Characters","review":"I loved this book! The story, written through the eyes of four daughters and their unbelievable times growing up in the Congo, was entertaining, thought provoking and quite an adventure! Although the author did get a little caught up in her own political agenda in the second half, the story still remained interesting and left the reader anxious to see what was going to happen next to these amazing characters! I loved the writing, loved the characters, and was caught up in the troubled history and story of the Congo. It was a great read; when I hear a story about Africa in the future, I will surely think of this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't breathe","review":"An avid Kingsolver fan, I found this book disappointing. I didn't love anyone in the book. Everyone was pathetic. Her agendas are quite clear about Christianity, the United States and men. That's okay, it's good to be constructively critical. But it wasn't convincing. Like another reviewer wrote, not one character becomes anyone I admire. It's a dark book with no hope. No hope for the Africans, no hope for the four women. No hope for the father. I had to plow through the middle of it just so I could breathe...looking for some hope. I don't want a pollyanna ending. But really, there are a lot better novels out there about women, Africa, missionaries and their effect on other cultures and visa versa..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of man's hidden sins","review":"While reading, \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" I became even more aware of the faults and prejudices of Man. America's influence on the world in the 1950's and the result that took place in the Congo was mind-boggling. As a 17-year old High School student i recommend this book for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Facets","review":"It was a truly different reading experience. Learning about history of the African Congo from 1959 through to the 80's through 5 distinctly different perspectives. I could feel all of them pulling from my emotions, as a mother, as an angry tomboy, as a spoiled brat, an abstract intellectual, and as a innocent child. It was challenging to read and I find myself comparing it's content to current day events and viewing everything differently. It's a masterpiece of work from my perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"As a long-time Barbara Kingsolver fan, I looked forward to this new release. I was sorely disappointed. I could put this book down, I did put this book down. I got about a third of the way through and decided that no matter the loyalty to the author, I just couldn't wade through it.Maybe she should just stick to what she knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"Good story. I did enjoy it, but not enough for 5 stars. I hope my ant problem does not get as bad as hers (read the book).Oprah book club, female author, mom raising daughters, bad/insane dad... I felt this book was stacked against my gender. I still liked it, but it felt a little feminist.A better book, and non-fiction, about growing up female in Africa is Beryl Markham's West with the Night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely dissappointed","review":"All set for a great book, I was very disappointed with The Poisonwood Bible. It was full of predictable characters and a long drawn out storyline. The only interesting aspect was the historical value. Borrow it at the library before you spend a dime on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful wonderful book","review":"I was glued to this book *both* times that I read it. It was absolutely fantastic. I'm sure that I'll read it a third time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out well, ends poorly","review":"I read this book at the beginning of the summer (I had been looking forward to it for a year or so, but hadn't had time to read it during my first year of High School). I expected the Poisonwood Bible to be a tale of the downfall of a family as they brave the dangers of Africa. And, happily, the beginning was written in the poetic (but realistic) voice of To Kill a Mockingbird. It seemed, however, that the author got tired of writing after a while and either subconsciously or consciously began to write sloppily, as if she only wanted to finish the book. She wrote too little that had anything to do with the actual plot (I began to forget what it was, anyway), and too much about the \\"plight of the Congolese\\".That would be a great topic for a book, but it really didn't seem to fit in with the first part. This book just kept going and going, when I believe it would have suited the theme of the book more to finish it about half to three-quarters of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, but great writing","review":"Yes, it's slow.I thought I'd finish this book in 5-6 days, like I have many other books of this length. But, to my surprise, it has taken me over 2 months. Ironically, I've added it to my list of \\"All-time-favorites.\\" BUY THIS BOOK. IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO READ, BUT, FINISH IT.IT WILL DEFINITELY BE WORTH IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start but worth it in the end","review":"I enjoyed this book. Very different from her earlier books, \\"The Bean Trees\\" and \\"Pigs in Heavan\\". The book is told from the point of view of the girls and their mother, and begins slow, but it picks up and is interesting to follow the girls as they live their lives. I was not sure I would finish it but am sure glad I did. Some sad parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's The Poinsonwood Bible is one of the best books I've read recently. Told from the point of view of five different women, this book has so much to offer. The author has such a unique style I almost felt as if I knew these girls when I was done reading. This book has everything from a revoultion, to a love story. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to stay with, but worth it","review":"I almost gave up on this book a few times. I didn't like some of the characters or the way they narrated their chapters, but by the end of the book, I felt I had learned not only some very interesting history, but also how to look at Africa from different points of view. I read it last summer on a trip to Africa and still think about it often. Yes, the author's viewpoints don't always jive with popular beliefs, but that is what I think she was trying to do -- open our minds to the way others see the world and maybe try to understand why the Congo and its people think the way they do"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful novel","review":"This is the first and only book I have read by Kingsolver and one of the first 'modern literature' books I have read in a couple of years. I was very impressed with with the power of this tragic novel.Each chapter is narrated by a different character in their own voice and that voice changes as the characters mature during the course of the book. I often think of this as a bit of a literary tool meant only to challenge the reader, but adding little to the overall impact of the novel. But in this case, Kingsolver does a masteful job of character development so that the reader cannot help but become invested in the characters.Add to this the very descriptive and fluid writing style, a strong plot, a setting in a country that most people will never visit and in a time that was pivotal to the political development of that country and one is forced to admit this is a very, very well written novel. A Modern Classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Navel Gazing at It's Worst","review":"Somewhere in the middle of these 550 pages is a wonderful story of about 250 pages trying to burst forth. However, slogging through the muck and mire of these pitiful preachers of political correctness and philosophical nihilism was not worth finding the diamond in the rough. The narrative was hopelessly broken by the use of too many voices. The word games that are to help define each character are unconvincing and self indulgent. Nevertheless, the worst sin of this Bible is endless navel gazing. African history was interesting. The plot was interesting. These women were not interesting. Pitiful - pit is full - lluf si tip. The heart of this novel began too late and ended too early. Out of respect for their time, it will not be recommended reading for my friends, family and co-workers."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book I've ever met","review":"Barbara Kingsolver tries to sound important, while her work contains so little interesting elements that its almost a chore to read the book. Her plot is non-existant and her characters are semi interesting but still, not quite \\"real.\\" Perhaps if Kinglsover took some classes in plot development then the book would have a half way decent and coherent story. Bad stuff all around, stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good choice for insomniacs...yawn.","review":"What a disappointment! This is a throw away book - first across the room, then either outside or in the trash. I hung in there and read the whole thing...a total waste of time, but friends recommended it highly so I continued to read with an optimistic attitude. Beeg mistake! The author writes beautifully but the story goes nowhere. I was hoping to learn more about the Congo and its independence movement. Why is.... attracted to books like this??? Read \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" for an excellent history of the horrors the Congolese people suffered under Belgian rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 stars for concept, 2 for follow-through","review":"This is a great effort but becomes exasperating half-way through. The techniques the author uses to distinguish one woman from the other become increasingly annoying after they've gotten the point across(Rachel's malapropisms; Adah's private language...)Also, the dialogue among the characters in order to forward the political exposition is very stilted; it didn't sound at all like true conversation but just the author trying to hammer home her belief. I'd give this book 4 stars for concept but only 2 for follow-through. Try a library copy before buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"I had pre-conceived ideas about this book which turned out to be completely wrong. This is a wonderfully crafted story which got better and better as it unfolded. When Nathan takes his wife and four daughters to the Congo in the late 1950s to undertake missionary work, they have no real comprehension of what is in store for them. There are some obvious obstacles that confront them and many that they cannot have envisioned. After a major event occurs (which should not be revealed until the reader reaches that stage of the book), their family structure and future drastically changes and for me this heralded the most fascinating part of the book. A great deal of cross-analysis with the Bible can be made, but don't let that deter you. Even without a detailed knowledge of the Bible, the reader can still thoroughly enjoy this book and gain a great deal from it. Having enjoyed The Poisonwood Bible so much, I will go on to Barbara Kingsolver's other works without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"Poisonwood Bible is by far my favorite book. I have likely read hundreds of books by hundreds of authors but Barbara Kingsolver really drew me in here.

I know this is just a novel, but I was so moved by the characters and the country and the beauty of the writing, that I won't soon forget the Price family or their African experience.

This is the first time I have ever put down one of her books without finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Tedious and Very Dry.","review":"We read this book for July Group and I am shocked and amazed that it has been so popular.

Each day we ventured into the jungle to try to capture some of the original glory of Belizean nature and culture, and at night I read about the incidious influence of missionaries in destroying the diversity that was once existed in humanity and nature. I despise missionaries of every stripe (except medical ones without agendas) and thank Barbara Kingsolver for her rendition of this particular family's experiences. Fortunately, the Congo won in Nathan Price's case. Unfortunately, that is infrequently the case. It was gratifying to see each daughter grow into a life of her own, and to swab the lesions left by Christianity's poisonwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long","review":"And too wordy.

But you can never use them at that total height, since they won't lock together.So this 16' ladder can only be extended to a maximum of 13'. And you are not supposed to stand on the top rung of the ladder, unless you like to live dangerously.In reality I would probably give this ladder a 3 or 4 star review because I don't think you should buy a 200lb capacity ladder.

Thus, like the first Gutenberg printing press, it's the best in it's class! In the tutorials the authors assume that you already know as much about the Unreal Editor as they do. If you do not know the in's and out's and idiotsyncrasies of the Unreal Editor(which is why I bought the book in the first place) you will learn new definitions of patience during the first 23 chapters. In the end you will thank the authors for their altruism and capatalistic guile without which this knowledge would not be publicly available. Thank G-d and the great Satan for freedom of information! Thank America for the freedom to say this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"deception","review":"The book is misleading in that it says you can use the editor supplied with the CD to create the tutorials. YOU NEED UT2004 to create the tutorials.Page 3 of the introduction states\\" the book includes a CD packed with all the necessary assets, the Unreal Runtime Engine demo...\\" This implies that the only thing you need is the book and CD.

It cost $39.00 when it came out. This book is for those who want to make levels that modify the game. For that it works flawlessly, and explains things masterfully.If you download the Free Unreal Runtime from UDN, yes it will not work, but you cannot make levels for the game with just the RunTime. The RunTime on UDN is to show what the engine can do, not to allow you to make custom content.The tutorials in this book are crisp, well thought out and extremely accurate. It is by far the most comprehensive collection of content for building unreal levels that exists on the market today.If you are looking to purchase this book, please realize that the people who know what they are doing love it, and praise it."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative but confusing...","review":"I enjoy learning the system, but the directions on the tutorials were somewhat confusing and the picture references are practically no help.

For most of the options in UED, they give pretty detailed lists of what there is and what each of them do. Yet since they give most of them, there are still portions missing for stuff you will find critical in level design. Overall the book is really well done and their general theme of designing the control room is a good one where they show all the ins and outs of what you can add. There was a little too much info on Maya for my taste, I strictly use 3DSMax and even though it's nice to see how to game dev. for another software platform, 125+ pages or so is a tad too much for me, I would rather see more pages devoted to UED and less to Maya. Other than that, this book is an excellent buy for those who want to break into unreal game development or mod making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super outdated","review":"The new UDK is sooo different than what is described in this book, unless you're stuck in the past...

Olivia was shallow, self centered, and only seemed to want the baby to fill the void left by her husband's death.

The author opens his book with a charming three page analysis of the Roman Golden Age, exclaiming, and this in a TEXTBOOK mind you, \\"If this was humanity's happiest time-God help us all!\\" He relegates the achievements of the Renaissance strictly to the realm of the aesthetic, even going so far to lament the fact that the slender and mysterious saints of the Middle Ages seem to have \\"turned voluptous\\" in the workshop of Michelangelo... Perhaps the author had some bad experiences in the classics and developed an abhorence for their achievements which he feels he must emphasize in his textbook. Even worse is his one sided, clinical and insensitive view of history; only in Hollister can the reader read of the horrorrs of the Black Plague without blinking an eye. AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree, A Poor Choice For A Textbook","review":"I strongly agree with the former reviewer's comments. This book, (superficially ugly, uncolorful and poorly illustrated), is boring and opinionated,cramming one thousand years of history into fifteen or so so chapters. Hollister, who, I'll admit, clearly loved his subject, made the mistake of emphasizing again and again that the Middle Ages were THE domiant force that created modern Europe- history is not a contest, but should accurately reflect the past and incorporate modern interpretation and, (the element most strongly missed in Hollister), constant primary sources. For the responsible instructor looking to teach a worthwhile course on the Middle Ages, numerous sources should be used, and by no means should this out-of-date book form the backbone of the course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introductory text to the period","review":"Hollister's history of medieval Europe is accessable, easy to read and abundant with detail. More importantly, it does much to dispel the myth that the \\"middle ages\\" were a dark period in European history, instead bringing the richness of the time to life. The ninth edition is a further improvement over previous eds, with its emphasis on medieval women.Modern Europe is largly the product of its medieval roots - part Roman, part Germanic, part Early Christian. Hollister's (and Bennett's) masterful treatment of the age (and his ability to demonstrate the relevance of the time) is a rare treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"An especially well-balanced view of the middle ages in Europe","review":"The first edition came out in 1964, and has become a franchise in the American texts on the subject, now carried forward by a younger historian, J. Bennett. Hollister wrote the first few editions alone, writing clearly and making narrative sense out of the confusion of centuries, peoples, without an overload of academic quarrels, so it is a good book for interested readers who are NOT taking a college course in which the book may be assigned reading. Not a trove of original insight, but a balanced view that incorporates the major ideas of more important historians. Readable, although ultimately academic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and borderline offensive","review":"In addition to being terribly written and poorly organized, as many other reviewers have noted, it was, at times, borderline offensive. When she equated the slaughter of chickens for food with the raping and beating of a woman, I had to close the book and be done with it. Anyone who would equate those two things has never been raped or beaten and is probably a crazy fundamentalist with wing-nut tendencies.I was hopeful that this book would be a critical and intelligent analysis of the objectification of women in parallel to the sexualization of meat. Instead it was a mash of PowerPoint-esque bullet point statements, poor writing, and disorganization, without any thoughtful analysis or scholarship. It was nothing but anti-meat, anti-sex, anti-man propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"As a vegetarian, and as someone who is interested in media and the use of it, I had high hopes for this book. They were sadly not met. The idea is good, but the writing is horrible. Adams is all over the place. Paragraphs jump from one subject to another making no sense at all. It is very hard to follow. And there are few references - instead of foot or end notes Adams uses 'citations' at the back of the book and the reader is left to guess what exactly was cited on the page.There is such a wealth of material available on this topic, and in the hands of a better writer this book would have been truly amazing.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pornography of meat","review":"This is an interesting book. The theory behind it no doubt has a place in our society. However, the evidence used to support this theory is ad hoc at best. As a result there is no limit on the range that Adams attempts to apply her world view. The chapters lack focus as jumps from topic to topic. I would have like a little bit more unity and building up to the individual chapter focus. The other issue is the books lack of theory that works towards etiology. She does not describe an explanation behind her theory and somewhat bashes evolutionary psychologist David Buss who would provide an underlying theory. To be concise, the book is interesting but it is chaotic and appears to regress feminism back to the negative stereotype of the anger femiminst. There are better choices out there on both feminism and animal rights."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at 0 degree bag!","review":"after my son put every piece of clothing he had with him (4 layers) during a winter camp out he was just about warm enough!not a 0 degree bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap is what you get","review":"first off i paid for priority msil but that was a waste of money.

It just goes to show though that one never knows an artist's real range until he or she starts exploring it. Although this is as different from the rest of his work as can be imagined, it is all superb. Additionally, these are are very unique renditions of songs I have on other discs by other artists and there is NO overlap. I'm not familiar with Georgie Fame but it is too bad that he and Van Morrsion only did this one work together. What a terrific combination they are. The title tune is worth the price of admission alone. This is a live recording too and I've noticed Van Morrison does particularly well when performing live as opposed to in the studio. Many musical artists do their best work live and perhaps it is the sheer exhiliration and joy of performance that they really need to bring out their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"VAN THE SWING MAN!","review":"Although I've never really followed the music of either Van Morrison or Georgie Fame, Ive always respected their talents. Since I was in to some of the swing music that was going on at the time, I decided to give this a listen. And I really enjoyed it. I especially like the upbeat faster tunes on here like \\"Sack O\\" Wee, \\"The New Symphony Sid\\", and \\"All Saints Day\\" which reminds a little of the song Choo Choo Cha Boogie. It's on these songs that Morrison and Fame are at their best singing in unison with each other. All of this recorded LIVE in London with no overdubs, just that great spontanious jazzy sound by a couple heavyweight talents having some fun. So if there's any swingcats left over out there, I suggest you pick this album up.

The actual locking mechanism is HUGE and the steel cable is pretty thick.So, it's heavier than expected - and that's not a bad thing.Also, contrary to the description, the lock comes with five REGULAR keys. NO lighted key. The keys are also pretty sharp...sharp enough to cut through fabric, so it probably won't be a good idea to keep the key in your pocket, unless you like holey pockets. I have to keep the key separate from my other keys, so there's a chance that I may ride off and forget the lock's key, so it's a bit of an inconvenience.But, for its purpose, the lock does its job. I don't know how long the velcro straps that hold the cable secured while not being used will hold up, but they can be replaced.This would have received five stars if it came with a lighted key and if the keys weren't so sharp..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock Sticks","review":"This lock would be perfect except for one fatal flaw. The lock doesn't work properly. At first it was fine, but as time passed the key would no longer action the lock. This was initially overcome with patient jiggling for a few minutes. Now the lock appears permanently stuck. This leaves my bike unhelpfully secured to an I-beam in Afghanistan. What would otherwise be a strength for this lock, i.e. the impressive thickness of the steel cable, is now a hindrance because I can't find the hardware (bolt-cutters, acetylene torch, anti-tank round, etc.) to release my bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, a bit short, though","review":"The issue with the keys that other reviewers were noting seem to have been fixed - my bike lock DID come with the flashlight key, and the keys weren't particularly sharp, either. (I have one on my regular keychain with no issues.) My only complaint is that the cable is a bit on the short side - locking it to some poles and even older-style bike racks can be a pain sometimes. But other than that, this is a super-tough, super-thick cable lock. I live in a low-crime college town with a VERY high concentration of bikes, and this lock seems a lot stronger/tougher than anything I see around here."},{"rating":"2","title":"did we really need an 8th edition?","review":"Apparently, editions of this book have come out every 3 years or so, according to the copyright page. Given that it is aimed at the high school and first year undergrad level, you might wonder about the need for this. The subject is not even one like molecular biology or politics, where perhaps revisions are often needed at an introductory level of discussion.The Applied Physics refers to how the authors strive to motivate a possibly uninterested and listless reader in the fun of physics. Daresay that most such readers will put fun in quotes. So there are many examples, and colour photos, sprinkled throughout the text, in which elementary physics is applied in daily situations. As you could expect from an 8th edition, the prose is polished and the logic is well done.A cynic could say that an earlier edition would have been just as adequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"No book","review":"I did not recieve this book, Please contact me about this.

It contains images of danger and death and the main character, Jemima, is portrayed as inept and stupid.

It is the tale of a barnyard duck named Jemima who wishes to hatch her own eggs instead of leaving the task to the hens. She decides to leave and find a place to nest and encounters a polite gentleman with sandy whiskers who so kindly offers his help. It is a charming tale, as so many of Ms. Potter's stories are, complete with an endearing if not somewhat naive duck, a handsome yet sly fox and a wise old collie dog. The illustrations are quite nice, with some beautiful countryside scenes of Sawrey where the author lived. This story is a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"brutal, upsetting","review":"I recognize that this is a classic, and can be weighed on its literary merit in that regard. From the perspective of women's history and the allegories in the story-- fine.However, this is a brutal story. The tragedy of the mother-figure losing all of her eggs to dogs, and then only being allowed to keep some of her second set of eggs is deeply disturbing to both kids and potentially adult readers. There is enough real-world tragedy without adding this story into the mix for leisure reading. Better to discuss those realities with kids, when they are old enough, than to introduce a brutal read disguised as an animal story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible children's book","review":"I thought this was such a horrible book.

Not only is the ending predictable, but you'll have to wait through a very long and boring movie to see it. Atmosphere is about all you'll get. Depending on your opinion of jazz or what passes for it in this movie, you may be in for further disappointment. We rented it on line through U-Verse and I'm going to ask for a refund. Belafonte was the only one who was convincing and that's because he wasn't acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone other than Altman should have cut this film","review":"There are the makings of a good movie here, but obviously Altman had final cut approval, and his gift was quite off on this one. Belefonte endlessly pontificates nonsensibly, Jason Leigh surpasses her legendary how-annoying-can-she-get Hudsucker Proxy performance, it's long, the jazz performances just make the film drag.Such a shame - beautifully shot, great actors, shame about the director's inability to look in the mirror and notice the obvious bloat. A dreadful, annoying film."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing and stupid plot","review":"I rented this movie because I like period stories, especially those that take place in the 1920s and 1930s. This movie was about as dim-witted as its main character Blondie. The story was hard to follow because it made little sense, the diaglog really dull,and the movie moved at a snail's pace. And what was with the pregnant black girl? What purpose did that serve and how did it fit into the story?This is one to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atmosphere and little else.","review":"Even the mighty have their moments when they stumble and KANSAS CITY is one of those moments for maverick director Robert Altman. There's little more than atmosphere in this film; the period-recreation of 1935-ish Kansas City Missouri, the great jazz throughout every frame and a bravura performance by Harry Belefonte as a gambler/crime kingpin named \\"Seldom Seen\\" don't mask the fact that the plot's thinner than newspaper and that every other actor save Belefonte is chewing the scenery and burping after every chew. On the surface, this movie's approach isn't much different from Altman's others--there's constant activity, so much that it's initially disorienting to try and figure out all of the threads of the story, but in many of his films (NASHVILLE, MASH and GOSFORD PARK, for instance), those threads gradually come together into a whole. It never happens in KANSAS CITY. The threads stay threads and you're left with a jumble, albiet a jumble with a great score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kickball for all ages","review":"This toy is very durable and stands up to a lot of abuse.

Unfortunately this is not one of those times.1) I ordered the ladder from Amazon for $179.00, sears had it for 159.00. I have a truck so I would have no need to have it delivered ($50), if I had ordered it from Sears. So it wouls have been cheaper for me at Sears.2) ABF was the company that delivered the product to me. When the ladder arrived, it was not in any box or plastic wrap. Subsequently, it arrived scratched (pretty bad) on one side. This is a brand new ladder, and should have arrived as such.I am still going to use the ladder, which looks like it will work fine.

The games are much too long for my son's attention span and I had to use the task manager to quit the program if when I wanted to leave without finishing the game.

It's a lazy, contrived venture, hindered by Robert James Burke's one-note performance, which is odd because the basically TV-oriented actor (LAW & ORDER SVU semi-regular) should have jumped at his first feature starring role. Lucinda Janney as his wife also fails to elicit any real emotion or passion. Ironically, TV vets Joe Mantegna (CRIMINAL MINDS), Michael Constantine (ROOM 222) and Kari Wuhrer (SLIDERS) manage to flesh out convincing portrayals.King himself cameos as the NERDY pharmacist.King's novels may be best read rather than filmed.

Robert John Burke does a great job as the lead role but the movie just seems to be missing something. The speical effects are good but they really didnt give anything to the movie.

What starts off as a horror movie turns into an unintentional, hilarious comedy -- especially after the old gypsy woman gets hit. The characters are charicatures, cardboard stereotypes played for laughs. And I'm laughing. I think the makers of this movie said, \\"Screw it, we ain't deliverin anything near horror\\" and they made it for laughs. The lawyer is an arrogant fathead (literally) who, in one funny scene, shovels in a trainload of food, and mistakenly flirts with the fiercely vengeful Gypsy daughter who flips him off. I think gluttony is a theme running through King's imagination, like the blueberry pie puking kid in Stand by Me. Also, there's not enough of a payoff at the end; you want to see the effects of his revenge on the good doctor who's trying to cure him, but that's cut out. Well, they should cut out slices of pie instead of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have a pie.","review":"It seems that everything that Stephen King writes is turned into a movie of some kind. It is a shame that the thin plot is stretched into a movie. There are some good moments but overal it's to weak to carry the movie. (a curse from a gipsy, after Lawyer Burke kills an old gipsy in a car accident, will lead that Burke loses weight, and more than he would like to lose from his overweight...) For S.K. fans a must to see, but if you want your friends to watch a movie with you, then pic a better S.K. movie from your shell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited; very little redeeming value","review":"My video store actually had this in the \\"All-Time Best\\" section. What a joke. This movie is a mean-spirited piece of junk. What happens to the main character's wife -- whose only crime was to give her husband oral pleasure, then try to help him -- is one of the most abhorrable depictions of cruelty to women coming out of Hollywood that I've seen in a while. The guy who plays Billy Halleck is a terrible actor. I heard that at one time, there was talk of John Candy playing this role and actually slimming down for the part. It would have probably won him an Oscar, saved his life and saved this movie. Instead, we have a guy who's so obviously wearing a fat suit that it's pathetic, and his acting in the suit amounts to some bad impression of Oliver Hardy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad.","review":"Neither suspenseful nor scary, Thinner is yet another weak adaptation of a Stephen King novel. The movie strips the book -- which was severely flawed itself -- of any sense of dread or horror, and leaves us with something about as appetizing as a wet noodle. Questionable casting and rather lame dialogue don't help matters. The only bright spot is the gorgeous Kari Wuhrer as a young Gypsy woman.

He doesn't know why he is getting thinner and so doesn't his wife or daughter. He seems to be enjoying it, until he realises that his weight loss is out of control and it isn't due to a diet, it is due to the curse, so he tries to beg the man to lift the curse and he doesn't.

It chronicles the journey a man must take in hopes to free himself of a Gypsy curse after a tragic accident claimed the life of an elderly Romani woman. The man, a popular attorney, was negligent and \\"distracted\\" or he would not have had the accident. When the police, judge and officials conspire to free the attorney of any criminal charges the olde Gypsy man takes matters into his own hands laying a curse at their feet.

The listener, too. Not on the sublime level of 'Elis & Tom' but lots of fun. I liked Toots's contribution - harmonica, whistling and all, and even his riotous version of 'Honeysuckle Rose'! Elis is all that other reviewers have said, tearing into 'Wave' and Edu Lobo's joyous football song with great abandon. Her duetting with Toots's whistling on Roberto Menescal's 'Voce' is irresistible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two giant musicians !","review":"Two legends : two unforgettable names for the musical story of Brazil .Toots Thielemans is an extarordinary musician . His wide scope has allowd him to face one of the widest spectre of the music .In this famous recording dated from 1969 Elis Regina (the divine , unforgettable and supreme brazilian song goddess and one of most inspired female singers ever) joined theor gifts to giva the world a tresure of thousand carats .Canto de Ossanha, Aquarela de Brazil , O barquinho and Wave are among the best tracks of this spectacular and glorious CD . The only complaint -if I may- is the shortness of this album . Thought and recorded according the LP laws: Twelve tracks and that's all . I have the hidden hope someone finds records not available before or recording sessions never released before to get the chance to enjoy the craft of this fantastic combination .Acquire this CD and get close to the world of this giant couple ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful but....","review":"The reason that I only give this 4 stars (maybe lower?) is not because of Elis who is wonderful on this album - and the songs that she sings on are excellent - but because she does not sing on 4 of the 12 songs, 10 minutes worth on the CD that only lasts 33.5 minutes to begin with. Plus, on one of those Toots wordlessly \\"sings\\" on Honeysuckle Rose.

If i ever get another ladder, the FIRST thing i will do is add these babies again. I LOVE THEM and would be lost without them. I RARELY find level surfaces to work on, and these make ANY surface level. If anyone thinks they are UNSAFE, THINK AGAIN !! My kit came with all hardware i needed. I drilled out my rivets and even \\"SAVED\\" the metal 45 degree brackets and incorporated them into my installation. NOTICE how many GREAT reviews there are here ?

Some models of Werner ladders require an extra installation kit. Secondly, read the instruction manual from front to back (several times), especially when you get to the part on having to cut the bottom rung off of your existing ladder. That's where it gets scary. I've never had good luck with straight cuts with hacksaws and was lucky enough to rig a jig for use with a metal cutting blade on my miter saw. Mine came out perfectly but not without angst. The whole project lasted over the course of two days.

I.E. who might consider buying a gun this way, which skills are essential and what are the pitfalls.Overall I find this book very informative. The chapters are organized in a fashion that make it your choice if you'd like to read up on a single topic or read this work front to back.

Mr. Hobbs let off a number of swear words, there were a number of adult themes including, infidelity & divorce, which were the bulk of the movie.

I watched it with a room full of people and the unanimous consent was that it is a terrible film! It features some mild cussing and basically the whole attitude in the movie is very negative and contrary to family values as we see them nowadays. Don't waste your time with this film.

I have watched it many times and am purchasing it now for the first time.I still laugh when I remember two comedic scenes: one with Stewart's guest, John McGwyer, showing Stewart how to do a bird watcher's walk. The other a hilarious scene when McGwyer's wife, played by Marie Wilson, because of a plumbing problem is stuck in a steam filled bathroom and Jimmy Stewart must come to her assistance.

Although he had most of the comedic lines, Maureen O'Hara's presence shines through. She draws in your attention even if she isn't speaking a word, through her facial expressions, and the way she carries herself on screen.

Abused by a cruel stepmother and ostracized by her family, she was forced to live in the barn with the animals and spend her time tending sheep and spinning wool. Her only comfort came from her religion, and she attended Mass daily and made a rosary from knots in a piece of rope. The book, which includes ten lovely illustrations, tells how she shared her small meals with beggars, taught religion to the neighborhood children, and forgave and prayed for her stepmother. Germaine is a saint who should be more widely known, and any child could benefit from reading her story. Adults could, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate vocal album by Duke's orchestra","review":"This is certainly the best studio recording by Duke's band accompanying a singer. Compared to the collaborations with Rosemary Clooney, Frank Sinatra or Ella herself in the Songbook series, the band sounds well-rehearsed. The arrangements are fresh and beautifully supportive, the selection of Ellington/Strayhorn songs is unique and I wish that more of Duke's lesser-known songs would get such an ideal treatment. The Ellington formation remains unequalled, but the great Ella makes each tune her own and lays proof to the fact that a)Duke was one of the best song-writers and that b)his compositions stand on their own.

I don't know who THIS GUY is she felt she needed to write with, but he brings little to the party, but, I suspect, a higher cover price. Any of her books are a much better choice than this foolish story that perpetuates the worst stereotypes about \\"romance\\" books. One of the most annoying components was the deluge of characters introduced solely by dialogue in thefirst 50 or so pages.

This is more of an action/suspense novel (perhaps why she cowrote it with someone else), which I found satisfying; however, the emphasis frequently veers off the romance angle, so those for whom this is a primary interest may find themselves disappointed.There were certainly humorous moments in the book, and in the main, the plot and characterizations were well done; but they seemed somewhat disjointed from time to time, and I found myself having to reread parts of the novel just to stay on track.Bottom line: This is a good read, even though it may not be exactly what the reader is expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I didn't look down-at this book","review":"This book started off poorly with the strange description of what was going on with the movie set. The plot of the book seemed to be contrived, trying way to hard and not always making sense. It read like it was written by two people, not always melding well.

The male character is a jerk who sleeps with the first female who offers, and then does the \\"love of his life\\" character a couple days later.

We got neither a good romance nor a believable, fast-paced action story. What we got was the worst of both writers -- perhaps there were territoriality tussles or they each agreed to edit the other's work -- I can just see it:Jennifer: \\"Wait Bob, that's a coherent sentence!

Wilder are thrown together for a 4 day shoot of a horrible movie which is merely a front for a more sinister plot. The story is uninteresting and the dialogue is not the witty banter I've come to expect from Crusie. There's little suspense and no humor to this book. There is however, a lot of yelling and talk about Wonder Woman.The readers do a decent job and having both a male and female reader makes the reading better... however, it's just not a good book. The best part was the very last scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I so looked forward to receiving and reading this book as I'm a big fan of Crusie and also action and supense. Having the two combined should have made for a good book. Boy, was I disappointed. The first disappointment was the character of JT (the hero??) He was so one dimensional. The heroine, Lucy, was a better written character. Being an avid reader of romance novels, I was especially disappointed to find JT going to bed with another woman even after he had met Lucy. That really spoiled the book for me right off and made me dislike JT's character from the beginning. It just got more disappointing after that as the plot was not at all plausable.

I thinks she needs to stay with her previous winning formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't look down","review":"I would say Jenifer Crusie should stop writing with Bob Mayer.

BIG mistake.Sure, it said she wrote it with another author, but I assumed that it would still have the best of Crusie. Dialogue that sparked and dazzled and made me laugh out loud. A great story, with humanity, whimsy and real characters, the kind that could actually exist.Don't Look Down has none one of the above, nada. I haven't been this disappointed in a long time.

It was really difficult to sit and actually finish reading this book. If you like Jennifer Crusie, pass on this book, because you will most-likely be disappointed.

So far I haven't finished it but I am going to struggle through and try to get to the end. So having said that, I am going to buy their next book anyway and see if that one is better. To finish I have to agree with most of the other reviews, what were they thinking? I hate putting any book down and especially Ms. Crusie's books but I honestly just didn't get it.

I was really looking forward to this book and was very disappointed. The book dragged on and I was not terribly interested right up to the end. The character of Lucy was OK, but the little bits of background we were told had nothing to do with the characters behavior. The hero was a piece of cardboard who slept around. His only redeeming trait was when he interected with Pepper, the 5 year old niece of Lucy. The other characters were never developed and there were just too many of them. All in all, the book was poorly written and the authors should forget all future collaborations.If you still want to read this book, check it out from the library - don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I've read all Crusie's books and they're light hearted humor usually delivers a punch; along with delving into the characters' weaknesses, ultimately reserecting their strengths, that readers can identify with.

In fact, one day after the hero couldn't say no to sex with one of the most two-dimensional bimbettes in history. What kind of a best friend is that? And has either author ever been on a movie set???

Known for her intelligently funny, character driven, deftly plotted romantic novels, Crusie is all but invisible in this boring, schizophrenic, badly written attempt at romantic mystery with a dash of comedy thrown in.As other reviewers have pointed out, Don't Look Down is disjointed and lumbering, with dull, largely unbelievable and poorly motivated characters, and an outlandish plot. The writing is repetitive, amateurish and at times downright irritating (italized inner thoughts appear with annoying regularity). After the first chapter or two, I skimmed the remainder, hoping something would catch my eye and make me want to actually READ this book. Never happened.I've read and enjoyed most if not all of Crusie's books (Faking It, Bet Me, Fast Women, etc.) but if her future books are collaborations with Mr. Mayer, I believe I'll move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the fun witty girl we know!","review":"I love Crusie's witty, sassy, feminine books, and hated this one! What's with all the army, guns, macho stuff - Ugh! The only decent line in the whole book was when Lucy says, \\"I just don't understand how you guys got control of the world. Half the time there's no blood in your brains, and you're still in charge of most of the governments in the world, most of the companies, and all of the military. Which actually explains a lot, now that I think of it.\\"Please Ms. Crusie, drop Mr. Mayer and go back to writing what you do best. Fun, witty modern romance with interesting characters we actually care about.All in all a very uneven, not fun book. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers. This book was disappointing. I didn't like the characters, they had potential that never developed. I thought the plot was disjointed and confusing. By the end I really didn't care about any of them. I was so sick of the 'alpha' male thinking 'get out of the kill zone' I was ready to kill him myself. I normally LOVE Jennifer Crusie's books, but I had to rate this one a one star read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. Not what I have come to expect in a Jennifer Crusie novel. It was hard to read, the characters pathetic and the story was so slow that halfway through I jumped pages....Don't waste your time, read one of her older books they are MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What HAPPENED?????","review":"What happened to you Jennifer Crusie???? Please,please,please go back to writing by yourself! No offense but I had to force myself to read this book,in the hope of it getting better or even interesting! I waited so long for something from JC and I get this!! Where is the humor and romance of it all ? This is the only book of hers that I haven't loved and read over and over. If ur a JC fan skip this book! Don't waste your time or money! Sorry to be harsh , but this book is definitely below par!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be look away","review":"I am a major Jenifer Cruise fan, but this book was a huge disappointment for me. Read like somebody else ghost wrote it. The wonderful humor and wit normally associated with this authors work was absent and the people, with the possible exception of Pepper were tiresome and humorless.Seems to be a lot foul language for no specific reason.In all fairness I have to say that I stopped reading about 3/4 the way through. The plot was really weak and at times really difficult to find. Just no reason to keep reading....hard to care about how it ended up.Here is hoping that her next book will be back up to her normal standards of excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Look Down is a \\"Don't look up until done\\" Book!","review":"Jenny Cruise fans wonder whether they will see the true Jenny in the collabaration with Bob Mayer. The answer is YES! And Bob brings the strong silent type along with J.T. Wilder to play against Jenny's outstanding women's characters and dialogue. And don't forget the one eye'd alligator, Moot!This romantic adventure is witty and a MUST READ. RUN, don't walk to the nearest bookstore and buy this for you and all your friends. They will love you for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Male and female minds inhabit same book - run!","review":"Well, I had to read it even though the reviews weren't promising. What I liked about having it written by both a man and woman is that the male mind was portrayed more realistically than it usually is in books written by females. What I didn't like is that they didn't blend well together. At all.Could better editing have saved this book? Probably, although I have a mental picture of the editor being transported to a mental health facility after trying..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to get into","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that noted this book was difficult to \\"get into\\". I found the writing style to be disjointed, jumpy, and a detraction from the storyline. Not likely to spend $$$ on Crusie again, as this should have been an easy, enjoyable read and not torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrrible","review":"Put simply - don't waste your money or time on this. I've read a number of Jennifer Crusie and expected a funny, well-constructed read. Instead, I found a confusing tale peopled with characters I couldn't care about.There are too many characters and stories competing for space here, the result of which is that nothing gets enough attention to make you care and the characters are cardboard. There are also a number of points where the story seems to jump or miss something - but I couldn't even care enough to figure out what I'd missed.The only consolation is that it was 50 per cent discounted, even in hardback (which says it all, I suspect, about sales) but I'm still sorry I wasted the cash on this sloppy junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longtime Crusie fan ... what happened??","review":"I have totally loved every single book she has written until this one. The writing style was horrible, the story weak and not engaging (basically, it was dumb, like cartoon action), the characters superficial - in particular the cardboard, lifeless hero was totally uninteresting. I put it down 2/3's through and can't make myself bother to finish it. Bleh is right. Can I get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Look Down","review":"It is difficult to believe Jennifer Cruisie actually had a part in writing this book. It reads like a macho male author deep into special forces effects and language. Where is the quick wit and laugh out loud comedy she is known for? Not here, for sure. There is nothing clever or funny about this book at all. Please return to your own style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This was the first time I've read either author and I never will again. Story was BEYOND slow, characters and dialogue unrealistic and boring. Don't bother with it, reading bad books just isn't necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated and a thoroughly unromantic, unlikeable hero","review":"Promising start, but then it just got way complicated and Wilder turned into a lecherous pig, sleeping with Althea. It just seemed to drag on and on to the point where I was just looking forward to being done. The only character I really liked was Pepper; she was adorable, but she couldn't carry the story on her own. Just not a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it","review":"I wanted this book after reading Agnes and the Hitman, but didn't buy it because of the negative reviews. Later, I found it discounted and didn't even realize it was the Cruise/Mayer collaboration I'd been looking at earlier. I should've known to just decide for myself and not listen to the reviews. I really enjoyed this book. It's funny how people's tastes differ. One reviewer found Pepper annoying. I found her delightful. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get into","review":"This is my 2nd Jennifer Crusie novel borrowed on digital audio from my library. It was definitely hard to get into and I ended up not finishing the book even though I was less than 1/4 of the way through. The audio for the male part was horrible, it sounded like he was in another room when this was recorded. It distracted entireley from the story.Perhaps I'll try it in book form at some other time. :0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusie + Mayer = BRILLIANT!!!","review":"This foray that Crusie and Mayer have taken into writing a novel together worked out really well. At the beginning I could tell the difference in the writing, but towards the end I didn't care, they both do a wonderful job folding in wit and emotion and action all into one novel. In the end I was very satisfied, I loved Lucy and I loved J.T., and I want to see more Pepper!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many names","review":"I love jennifer cruise so I thought well a new book to read. Wow I did not like this. The people go by there last names by some people and first by others and there are too many people to do that lol.I agree with what one perosn said about jt jumping into bed with the lead actress and I just could not get over that. It was like no please no.If you liked this book I am glad you found something you like about it.I will say again I normally and all about her books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggg---Could not get past first 50 pages","review":"The characters were shallow. The story dragged. I could not get engauged. I am usally easy to please. I have read over 2000 romance novels in past 10 years and I would give at least 90% 4-5*s. So this book must be really baaaadddd to get 1*. In fact, I would give it a 0* if I could. I have enjoyed Jennifer Crusis' books before, it was like the magic writing button was turned off when she was writing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Humor?","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie books, and have read all of her previous novels. However, this book seemed too much action novel/romance/back to action. It has a split personality, and lacks the wonderful humor of Crusie's other books. Even the one eyed alligator named Moot misses the opportunity to be funny, and the idea that a child speaks without contractions to show that she is a child is a bit strained. I think that the action author should stick to action, and that Ms. Crusie should go back to the sort of writing that has given her such a large fan base. The combination was not appealing, and I wouldn't recommend purchasing the hard cover. You could wait for the paperback on this one, and even then, borrow it from someone else if you don't want to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for everyone","review":"If you are not into the family bed and other theories of Dr. Sears, this is not the book for you. This book didn't do anything for me. There are other approaches that seem more interesting, for example the ones described by Dr. William A.H. Sammons. Dr. Sears and his wife views are certainly not for everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need REAL solutions!","review":"I am tired of buying books which don't give any sort of clear solutions to the problems they are addressing. This book basically tells me what every mother and father already know. We don't need to know it will go away with TIME. To write a book like this and basically tell us what we already know should be a crime. I should have looked at it's ranking number before I bought it, I think that says enough.I did take one more chance and also bought Dr. Marc Weissbluths, \\"Sweet Babies\\", now that's a book that is worth buying and really what all parent's of colicky infant can use. Thank God someone knows what he is talking about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a help!","review":"This book helped me more than anything which made me a better mom to my high needs baby. I was hearing all the same things from family that he was so needy because I was spoiling him and I was really doubting myself. This book turned it all around. I bought it when I was at witts end due to lack of sleep and excessive crying. Within a month, I started getting compliments on my son's wonderful personality and what a change everyone was noticing.The Sears' do not have any rocket science in their book. They have great wonderful common sense type of items that we sometimes need to hear when we are unsure if anything will work. They also have parenting systems. Every part of the book was not for me but the parts I chose to implement helped me love my son and give him what he needed.He is now a smart wonderful 22 month old that everyone wants around. He is not like other children but now in wonderful ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did not hang this conventionally...","review":"I bought this and two other posters specifically to add to the cafe-ambiance of my kitchen and dining room. I laid them out on stained and beveled boards, and polyurethaned them to the boards. The poster was very sturdy and did not discolor, weaken, or tear, even with three coats of poly-u. Turned out very nice and decidedly different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love! These Posters","review":"When they arrived the care the company took to package the posters was so Nice! The Posters are of good quality and the beautiful Caffe' screens are lovely. I am so glad I bought them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, 2006 has both","review":"For some reason, the description of the 2006 single-disc version of this is incorrect. It is not 114m but 230, just like the 2000 edition, containing both versions of the film on a double-sided disc and including the commentary which addresses the differences. Currently the 2006 edition is five bucks cheaper. So,save your money and go for the 2006. And you don't have to screw around with a snap case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Afterlife from the Hed Kandi label..","review":"I was profoundly disappointed when I received this disc and realized it was by the wrong band..

But hey, if this is the band you're looking for, maybe you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a rerelease","review":"This album was originally written and recorded in 1993 which is why it sounds so dated. It was an experimental album I made with a couple of friends while I was making house music professionally and has been rereleased by BMP with a load of dodgy video footage that was never approved by me and, most annoyingly, it is not described as a rerelease which is untruthful to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"I was surprised by this book. It was a great story and kept you wanting more the whole way! I love Iris Johansen anyway so I was excited to read this one! Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An imaginative coming-of-age/quest novel from the '60s","review":"I enjoyed this book. Let me quote from the review by the Wall Street Journal, blurbed on the paperback:\\"Mr. Sinclair's novel is wild, confusing, but fascinating. The author displays an explosive, overspilling talent...laughter, horror,violence, and lust are all facets of Gog's unconcluded quest-journey which may be long remembered.\\"I second."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I am a Pediatric Oncology Nurse that buys these books to give to the newly diagnosised families. All of them have told me that it is a wonderful tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource!","review":"This book is amazing. I keep it handy at home to help answer my questions or learn more about the disease. My daughter was diagnosed with retinoblastoma right before Christmas and this book was given to us by a social worker in the hospital. There is an entire chapter about retinoblastoma as well as chapters on many other solid tumor cancers. There are real stories from parents and it is written in language that is informative but easy to understand. It is especially helpful right after diagnosis when all of the jargon is still new. I would caution people to take the advice given in the book and only read sections that are relevant to your situation at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowstone on a simplified Geological Feature a day","review":"The title sums it all up. The book is indeed useful, you can find all sorts of neat features by using it, but it really is a bit simplified. Perhaps it's just me, but it was GREAT for my kids (8 and 11) who are both, well, they read. Anything. As long as they can catch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very kind to the hair.","review":"I have been dying my hair for years now, and the temporaries are the best for me, just giving that extra boost to my already red hair. This activator was very kind to my hair, didn't smell bad, and seemed to deposit the dye evenly through the hair. It mixed easily (you do need to get a bottle or bowl) and didn't burn my scalp. I even had a little tiny cut on my neck from having my hair cut (it's very short in the back and the stylist uses a razor to trim it at the nape of my neck) but the developer didn't even phase the cut.Seems to be a good product when used with the color gems product line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Very disorganized.

Be sure to read the dimensions, since it's pretty wide. I found it OK for a 17\\" CRT monitor, although it bounces a bit. I'm not certain it would work for a larger and heavier CRT. Great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative, captivating, diverse, and very original stories","review":"One of the best collection of short stories I've read in years. Each story is a completely unique gem, and there is a wealth of material within this book. The stories are almost \\"Twilight Zone\\" like in that there is usually a very good twist ending, and they are never predictible. Some are quite funny, some scary, and some rather dark and sinister. Shades of Salinger, Vonnegut, Serling, but really, just check it out for I.J. Schecter himself. It's his first book, and he's one to watch. The story about the kid trying to cure her parents of coffee addiction is worth the price alone. Other noteworthy stories include one about God as a precocious child attending summer camp, and a future in which you pay a fortune to be able to take a short nap during the work-week which is now weeks long without break. Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously twisted page-turner!","review":"I've never read a book so funny and so warped at the same time. Many of the stories had me laughing out loud, while a few also kept me chilled for days. I read a lot of different writers, and Schecter's voice is completely unique from anything else I've seen. His characters and plots are original. His style is fluid and clean. God as a camper! Sleepwalkers on jumbo jets! Two hundred pushups to prove one's love! I don't know where he gets his ideas, but they're wonderful! After finishing the last story, I was wishing for fifteen more. Buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to Lose End Caps!","review":"Difficult to find these replacements - glad you have them - for the ones that came with the Werner Ladder Stabilizer.

Readers beware! This is not a \\"whatever you want to believe\\" tome. Rather, it's a gleaning from his larger work \\"The Sermon on the Mount\\" as well as other writings, published and unpublished. Designed as a book of daily brief devotional thought, it delivers enough of a thought for the day that the spirit's thirst will be quenched, and its hunger satisfied, for a day.

The only good quality of both short stories is that they are short. Next, I read Heart Of Darkness, lets just say I dont want to go back down that memory road again. Both short stories are very complicated and are not for youg readers. Although I have read many great classics, Heart Of Darkness is by far the most complicated and aggravateing short story I have ever read. Some novels are worth the difficulty, because they are really good, but Heart of Darkness is not worth reading. Neither is The Secret Sharer. This is the most dissapointing piece of so called \\"classic literature\\" I have ever read. )-:"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Apocalypse Now","review":"Heart of Darkness was the most boring book I've ever read. I would have never finished the thing had it not been a requisite for my English class. English being his non-native language, Conrad lulls the reader to sleep. I could not extract any value from the plot due to his vagueries. I much prefer Martin Sheen in Vietnam. Now there's a guy who'll teach you a thing or two. Watch Apocalypse Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"Recently criticized by PC \\"academics\\" for its racism, Heart of Darkness remains one of the best books ever written. Yes, the book is racist, but it is no different than most of the prejudices held by Western Europeans of the period. That doesn't detract from the fact that this book is beautifully written (Conrad's long, twisting sentences, like the River Marlow travels up, have inspired my writing style to a great degree) and works as an amazing allegory for the dual nature of humanity: the battle between man and the inner beast. Before you let anybody turn you off of this book for its racism or its long sentence structure, just give it a read-through (its very short, though there's a lot underneath the surface). This is one trip upriver you won't regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality publishing","review":"Heart of Darkness has \\"public domain\\" status, which means anyone can type it up and distribute it, which is exactly what happened in this case. The Filiquarian Publishing version was clearly just typed up in Word, hardly edited, if at all, printed, and bound.

Reading this book made me want to stick a pencil in my ear and pull it out the other side. I did appreciate the attention to detail and I liked the plot, but the writing style is hideously attentive, he will go off on a tangent and write entire paragraphs to explain things that are both mundane and unrelated to the story as a whole. but if you feel like slugging through it, it's only 100 or so pages and for $4.00 you get to tell people that you read it and make yourslef look smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of Darkness","review":"Took a while to get to my house, but a book's a book so I can't complain.

This is one of the most challenging and best written books that I have ever read. Some of the quotes alone could be collected into a masterpiece. Attention should be paid to the dream-like narrative of Marlow's tale (if you must know - of a European man traveling into the heart of Africa). Conrad understood many things about human nature which are buried in the text. This is not just a colonial novel. The major accomplishment here is combining smart philosophy with a deft style, something rarely achieved by writers bent on espousing their views. This is an important book and should not be missed by anyone interested in superb writing and great literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I like to read this book, because it is mysterious.

That it wasn't engaging at all? Well, this is how this novel affected me. The only thing it had going for it was its length. Boring and dull.

The gist of the book is that white people who think they're civilized are actually far more savage than the \\"barbarians\\" they try to \\"civilize.\\" I could've got the same lesson by listening to a Midnight Oil song and gotten on with my life, rather than wading through this detail-drenched, pompously \\"symbolic\\" waste of time.I'm not one of those people who insists that a book contain a sex scene or violent act every few pages to keep my attention, but NOTHING HAPPENS in this whole book!

It starts as if in a Turner painting (the foggy Thames estuary) and ends in a Munchian cry (\\"The horror!The horror\\"). Apart from the classic parallel between the descent into the darkness of the jungle and the descent into the darkness of the human soul, what really hooked me was Conrad's prose: in no other book can you feel an atmosphere with such suffocating anguish, the hot and damp air of the surroundings, the pervading death, the total absence of light. I don't know if the book is a manifest against colonialism and some characterizations of the African natives as \\"savages\\" do appear dated in their archaic racism, but these are really minorand probaly irrelevant flaws in an otherwise major work of literature that ends in Kurtz's Nietzschean cry that seems to say that truth is lethal, which is why our lives are illusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conrad is brilliant","review":"This is the story that inspired apocalypse now yet it tells it in a far more diverse fashion. You really are plunged into Marlow's thoughts about the consiquences of colinization and the legacy of it.

So beautifully written with prose that leave you breathless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conrad's writing style (kindle copy)","review":"Conrad had to learn English and struggled mightily to get the right words. The result is superb. There is a rhythm and tone to his writing that creates an atmosphere which is an inspiration to me, as an author. It's a style worthy of emulation and carries the sweep and breadth of the vast ocean. Conrad was at sea only a couple of years, but they made a lifelong impression on him and he conveys an almost mystical effect in his story telling. One can just see the old seamen sitting around a table with drinks and cigars reminiscing about adventures and drama. I bought the ebook version because I had to dispose of my entire library when I sold my house in Michigan and moved into a small apartment for retirees. At least with the Kindle I can retrieve some of my old friends, even if not in hard copy format.--Harley L.

I laughed out loud at the observation of the afflicted European constitution, that \\"...white men should not be allowed to travel to the jungle unless they have no entrails\\".Unfamiliar with the plot, I kept expecting someone to say,\\"Dr Livingston I presume\\", but was shocked to realise this work was the loose inspiration for \\"Apocalypse Now!\\".

The wording may be little difficult for some to understand, but most will get it. Futility is a constant reoccurring theme. The main story is actually a man recounting his past. It may be confusing at times whether you are in the present or past. This and the lack of breaking the story in to chapters are the only draw backs. The rich plot line and dynamic characters are greatly portrayed by the author, Joseph Conrad.The movie Heart of darkness is was a disappointment after reading the book. Aside from being a horrendous piece of film work, it changed many key confrontations and plot points from the book. The events leading up to the ending were changed/erased.I would suggest to not even bothering contemplating whether or not to watch the film and save yourself some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phonies Love This Book","review":"Not so hot; phony intellectuals are told this is a great work so they make up all sorts of lies about layering and craftsmanship, when it's really just a so-so story and the ending with the guy Marlon Brandon played in the movie (Apocalypse Now) going crazy and Conrad never explaining why there should be such a fascination with him.

His attitude towards Africans was the attitude of the white world. His attitude towards the business of ivory was that of the \\"company\\".I don't believe the author intended any great statement of humanity. I think he just thought it was a good story.

Heart of Darkness is a short book - but not a fast read. The prose is thick and making your way through it is like going up the River itself. However, this is done on purpose - it is part of the journey. Every sentence has meaning and every word has a purpose. The story is about the Journey itself, so that by the time you (and it is you) reach Kurtz, you understand him.A lot of those who read this now are Apocalypse Now fans, and that is all well and good - but just don't expect any \\"Charlie don't surf\\" lines here.

Now, about 3 years later, I'm reading it in my critical thinking class in college.

Joseph Conrad's story of British imperialism in the Congo is eerily, brilliant, and thoughtful, to sum it up in a few words. Symbolism, imagery, and ambiguity in the novel allows readers to fathom what evil, darkness, and good really is. And most people don't really understand that. . .Although Heart of Darkness is a little over 100 pages, its a thick read if readers wish it to be. If not, people can whiz through it in a couple hours. Yet, its a masterpiece for it depth, not its length.I encourage anyone who wishes to read a deep novel to pick up a copy of Heart of Darkness. Its writing is amazing, the story is intriguing, and the afterthought will remain with you for a long time.

To that, I say \\"yeah, we noticed\\".This book is simply poorly written. No mystery about why many hate it. It is so difficult to read because his command of grammar and punctuation is so poor.

On cursory reading, the narrative appears naturalistic, almost normal, but below that surface lie many layers, each difficult to define, and each impossible to separate from the natural flow of the text. It is a metaphysical treatise on good and evil, a sharp damnation of the opportunism and speculation of colonialism, a brilliant rendering of impenetrable Africa, a picaresque, and a treasure map which points out the region of the heart, if not the exact spot, in which human compassion can be buried and hidden forever"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The horror!

My, isn't that inspiring and uplifting? The 'depth' of this book is discovered only as one looks for depth in a pond and mistakes the reflection as depth. This book is a thin veneer covering a lack of creativity due to Conrad using up all his good material in earlier writings. This book should not be combined with alcohol or other depressants.

It starts off very dry with long descriptive dialect that really put me asleep in the beginning, but later gets very interesting. Heart of Darkness is a story of an outer journey, which reflects an inner spiritual quest of our hero. There is much we don't know about our souls, which is what the story is about. Kurtz was a great man(my favorite character) who was some how corrupted by the power he gained during his trip into the Congo. But following the same river Kurtz took, Marlow is able to trace the experiences Kurtz has and had a completely different result. In other words, Marlow takes the same dangerous route but does not fall prey to the same temptations, which corrupted Kurtz. He managed to withdraw his step from being a savage.

After finally sitting down to read it, I couldn't help but ask \\"Why?\\" Heart of Darkness is supposed to be about a man confronted by the darkness of the human soul, yet the closest we get to this is the villain moaning \\"the horror\\" repeatedly. Speaking of villains, throughout the novel the reader is informed that Kurtz, the ivory poacher and main villain, might have finally slipped off the deep end and is committing atrocities against the natives. Whether this is true or not is left unanswered since once the main character finally confronts Kurtz the story pretty much ends.

There are also some people studies (the station manager who's longevity is owed to that he never gets sick and dies, the mysterious Mr. Kurtz dealing for ivory in the wilderness reaches . . . who dies by the way).Unfortunately, author Conrad's prose and process is so abstract that it was like trying to read something written by a drunk.

The number of adjectives thrown into a sentence tends to take the readers attention away from the story. However, the plot is somewhat interesting, if you can get around the style of language used throughout the rest of the story.

It is a painful look into the world in the 1900's as the powerful nations invaded and pillaged third world countries. It explores the exploitation of Africa and its people. This work must be taken into context in order to fully grasp what Conrad is attempting to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Storytelling","review":"I felt I was sitting across from Marlow, who is telling the story of his experience in the Congo. This novel is different from most in that it is written so that the reader is listening to someone's story related rather than the reader feeling s/he is there as the story happens. The style matches that of someone telling you his experience as you listen. This makes the style somewhat choppy and sometimes confusing as to who is speaking, the narrator or another character. Nonetheless, I found myself gripped by the tale. I read the book in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The alpha and omega of literature.","review":"Conrad says it ALL in less than 100 pages.This book gets better every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the essence, the heart, of brilliance and genius.","review":"By the end of this novel ( I can't even believe it's a novel ) I was breathless. The word \\" genius\\" has become mundane, but I find no other word that can describe a fraction of Conrad's writing in Heart of Darkness. I thought this novel would be boring and dense, and instead it turned out to be the most amazing book I have yet read. It endeavors so much and completes it so \\" eloquently.\\" Marlow is what everyman should become at some point, and Kurtz--what can describe Kurtz? He is the phantom, the divinity of some other world. Even if this novel was read on a superficial surface; the descriptions and narrative are explosive and paint a picture that one can almost touch. It's hard to think that this was all in words and is held by two covers..because it is like holding burning dynamite. I'm going to be reading this many more times and for many more years to come. Because how many more ways can I interpret \\" the horror, the horror\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is human?","review":"I read 'Heart of Darkness' late in life and remember thinking -'what a powerful story'- as I was turning the third page. As I turned the fourth page, I realized that 'Apocalype Now' was taken from it, if not word for word, then tought for thought. Nevertheless, the power of Conrads imagery is so overwhelming, that I found myself holding my hand over my beating heart, while imagining myself on that river steamer, making my way into the heart of Africa, into a world where men existed without knowledge of any life outside there own villages. I immediately went out and purchased his other titles before I'd finished 'Heart Of Darkness', just so that I would not be without them, should I suddenly finish the one that I was reading, and wish to go immediately to the next. If you wonder about the boundaries of human experience, this book will not disappoint!H"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just dull","review":"Many people find the writing style of those who are considered \\"classic\\" writers to be dull. I'm not one of those people and have enjoyed a large number of classics. However, in this case, I did find the book to be boring. The aim was to create a psychological exploration of Kurtz - a man on the \\"frontier\\" in Africa - an exploration that shows the extremes of horror and despair amongst varying circumstances, and one that unfolds alongside a physical exploration of Africa.This aim was not achieved as I found it just too dreary. It's not that the pacing was slow - plenty of great works have slower pacing. It's that it was slow and the actual writing didn't make up for it. Perhaps Conrad's other stuff is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep journey","review":"Marlowe must travel up the Congo river, find the mythical ivory trader Kurtz, and take him back to the coast. In each step of the journey, Marlowe lives in an opressive, dehumanizaed atmosphere, surrounded by cruel employees of an ivory-trading company, and by black slaves. After days of tense travel in the midst of the jungle, Kurtz is found. And oh!, he is found to be more than just a legend. An ill Kurtz reigns on a closed universe, with a total absence of any points of reference to the outside world. Kurtz has gone deep into the heart of darkness. Conrad's prose is dense, precise, accurate. The tale is elusive, nuanced. You have to guess what is going on and, especially, what has happened. In the end, it is Kurtz himself who summarizes the book: \\"The horror! the horror!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Harp?","review":"I enjoyed the premise of this book, but I never figured out what the \\"Harp\\" in the title means.

It will take you the whole school year to get through it. It is the most boring book. I am still tramatized from having to read it in high school. Read a George Orwell book, a Joseph Heller book, and Samuel Beckett book, any book just not this one. And if you are reading this for fun well it isn't fun. Basically what this book does in one sentence is: It uses the element of symbolism then forgets to write a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart of Darkness is Right","review":"As I began reading this book, I felt a little disturbed. The use of details that Conrad uses in the story are incredible. As Marlow talks to his shipmates in the story, the details he uses are intense. As he talks of his trip up the river, his friends on the ship tend not to be paying attention to him. This contributes to the difficulty of reading this book. Conrad had Marlow telling his story, and at the same time he switches back and forth from that to Marlow talking to his friends in the present. This makes the story very confusing. Conrad successfully showed how the colonization and imperialism was selfish and the colonizers were only tried to make a profit by obtaining ivory. The story itself wasnt too bad. It had a good plot and I liked the ending. It wrapped up a little fast I thought, but overall it was a good ending. If you liked the movie, Apocollapse Now, you will definitely enjoy this book, since the movie is based on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD THIS BOOK WAS BORING","review":"It seems that all of the previous reviews that gave bad ratings were from students whom were forced to read this horrible novel. The narration of Marlow was unrealistic and dreadfully boring. Seriously: it's a seaman telling a story off the top of his mind, yet he incorporates extreme detail and excessive figurative language that just bogs you down. Oh, so detail is great, but how great is it if you have to analyze each individual word just to find some point in this nonsense. I think young students would benefit from the theme of this story (not that I found one), but the style of presenting it just makes you want to burn this book (not a bad idea, it's only $1.00! ). A very well written novel? Well, Conrad surely knows how to make a student's learning experience miserable. Five stars for boredom. One star for everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something","review":"I really wanted to like this book - honestly. I finished it this morning on the train while riding into work and after I was done I closed it, put it in my bag, and it was almost immediately gone from my conscience. I can't quite pinpoint what it is about the book that bothered me. How something so densely written can be so bland is beyond me. Conrad started to get my attention a few times, he really did. For instance, I was quite happy when the natives started shooting arrows at the boat. Not that I'm some simpleton that needs action and gore to be happy - that's not it at all. There was another reader that implied Conrad didn't speak his mind entirely - I think that's part of what bothered me. He'd start to to get to a point, and then lose it. I wanted to like this book because I love classics, but this did absolutely nothing for me. And if I had seen the word \\"gloom\\" or a variation of it one more time, I would have died by spontaneous combustion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grueling - The horror! the horror!","review":"I can only thank God this novel was short. Reading it was a grueling process, not because of syntax errors or pretentious wording, but because it was so dull and dry. It seemed to drone on and on in the same monotone voice with no defined direction. I would not read this book for enjoyment, if you are to read it, do it because for some reason it is a classic and there are numerous allusions to the book in popular culture and modern literature. To pick the \\"best\\" part of the book, Conrad did do a good job on the themes of the unknown and the dark depths of human nature. The end was interesting, but it did not plunge me into an analysis of the book or any sort of emotional connection to my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written in a confusing manner","review":"Some people say that because this was and old book that we must forgive the way it was written. Truth is that I read many others classics from that era and they were all written less difulcult than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkening th Heart","review":"I think Heart of Darkness is a well developed novel. It's Congo River setting adds to the hardships that Marlow and his crew go through. Conrad's details to the characters and the setting give you a frim imagination of where they are, what they look like, and the activities they are going through.However, the book is told in frame tale or a story inside a story which makes this novel a little hard to read.I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who likes an adventure story. This novel has a lot of action and activity every page. It is a real attention grabber and is not so commonly know."},{"rating":"1","title":"liked The Secret Sharer more","review":"I really enjoyed the psychological aspects of the \\"Secret Sharer.\\" The inner-thoughts provoked by the Captain's doppleganger, Leggatt, serve to make the story a true masterpiece. Heart of Darkness is no light reading, yet can is interesting in that it is a quasi-mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less words, get to the point already","review":"I suppose Conrad is trying to paint a vivid picture with using all these fancy words in one sentence, but as for me, I like straightforward simple sentences. The excess use of adjectives detracts from the story, in my opinion, and makes the book less fun to read. Maybe it's cause this book was written 100 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh???","review":"I am glad to see others didn't care for this either.

As Marlow--a sea captain disgusted with the copious ignorance around him--recalls his experience of finding Kurtz--a brilliant prodigy turned mad by the wilderness--deep in the heart of Africa, Conrad presents dual plots in his story. The first plot, Marlow's search for Kurtz, wonderfully illustrates the surrender to madness in those around Marlow as they both travel further into the \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" Likewise, the second plot--Kurtz's life--delves the reader into the ingenious and penetrating mind of a man changed forever by the wild. As a result, the life of Marlow, Kurtz, and every other character changes greatly. After reading this book, one might question the civility of both man and his maker..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Captivating Tale","review":"The fiction, and the non-fiction. The prose are not for the unexperienced reader. Part of this great story explains of the ills of colonialism at the turn of the century.

I eagerly anticipate reading his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless comment on man's corruptability","review":"Joseph Conrad tells a story that is not forgotten easily. He spins a tale of the adventure into the untamed african jungle to recover an ivory trader that has gone insane and become a god to the natives.This story is a direct view of how easily man can be turned from good to evil in the steamy, dark jungle. Kurtz (the trader) was once a respected man, and he has dipped into his primitive Id. Completely insane, he begins to convince his pursuer, Marlow, to become as he is, but he is gripped by disease before Marlow fades into the same delerium.If you have not read Heart of Darkness, or you were assigned to read it and go the booknotes or such, I reccomend you pick a copy up and truly experiance insanity and the grip of the devil upon those who travel in untamed lands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great but get extra rollers","review":"This product worked great.

While some areas could be better explained (the full scoop on Zorndyke's war on humanity), most questions can be answered. For instance, the ships may have RADAR, they mat not. Who knows what state of repair they are in. RADAR is also no good for underwater targets, which is where the enemy comes from. Underwater. They have Sonar, but these are living things we are talking about. No moving parts. Quiet. Or, the it might be as simple as getting caught with our pants down. Anyway, in a city covered i water, I saw no place for a RADAR site. Any JDF radar sites would have been destroyed with the tide. It might be the future, my little friend, but that does not mean advancement. Look at the Mideval era compared to Rome.

Blue Submarine makes a good anime collection and it's about 30 minutes a tape and there are 4 tapes total (Blues, Pilot, Hearts, end)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anime with a different flavor","review":"Fans of anime in general will definitely dig Satoru Ozawa's 4-part, 'Blue Submarine No. 6,' series. For starters, being that the story is centered around futuristic submarines and naval warfare, viewers are treated to some terrific battle scenes taking place on and below water - a setting typically not utilized in anime. Vol. 1 of the series sets the stage nicely showcasing some of the offensive/defensive capabilities of Blue Sub No. 6 and the colorful assortment of characters within it.While much has already been commented on regarding the use of CG and traditional animation utilized in this series, in summary it looks just fine and at times absolutely breathtaking. But perhaps one of the best aspects of this disc is the really awesome Dolby 5.1 audio track for the Japanese-language track. This mix will have your system pumping out for sure - definitely one of the better audio mixes i've heard on an anime DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"state of the art","review":"This four volume series is exceptional--I like it as much as Macross Plus with the drama, the dialogue, and of course, the action and mechanical designs. Computer graphics and cell animation merge seamlessly. The characters are deep and diverse. The setting is similar to Voogies Angel and Agent Aika (or Waterworld) , while the theme of a scientist creating human-animal hybrids or mutants reminds me of The Island of Dr. Moreau. Even though each DVD is only about 30 minutes long (this last volume is longer), as long as I don't pay more than twenty dollars this collection is worth it. Cartoon Network is going to show this series Nov 6, but for best picture quality this is best enjoyed on DVD. The dubbing was done by Coastal Carolina--my favorite sound studio. This series gives not only beautiful graphics and glorious explosions, but asks the nature of humankind's tendency for conflict and violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Sleaze","review":"I absolutely loved this anime when I saw it, but I cannot and will not give my approval to a simple and sleazy marketing ploy. There are 4 episodes in all, each 30 minutes long. They took the path of the greedy and put 1 episode on each tape or dvd. Personally, I couldnt care less how they market tapes, but one of dvd's strongest points was media size. Even with all the whiz-bang animation and video quality (which is quite good), I dont doubt for a second they could fit all 4 episodes onto 1 disc. They coudlve made it a \\"flipper\\" or put it onto 2 discs if they felt image quality would be compromised. It just makes me sick that they would do this. Oh yeah, fyi, the music is some of the worst in the not-too-stellar history of anime music. Overall, cool story, great use of cell/cgi animation, horrible marketing, horrible music. A pass, unless its in the bargin bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then Neon Genisis Evangelion!","review":"Blue Submarine No. 6 episode three is a emotionally driven story of duty, honor, guilt, war and love. The animation is better then most anime theatrical releases. This is due to the blending of 2-d cell animation and 3-d computer animation. The quality of sound is excellent. The music in this volume is the best yet. My only regret is that there is only one episode on this tape, considering the entire series is only four episodes. This is a perfect series for anyone whom wants a powerful story and the best animation to date. Warning this volume contains some Graphic Violence, Language and Brief Nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great animation","review":"This anime has awesome animation.

I bought this VHS because its trailer on several Cowboy Bebop sessions had caught my interest.The artwork wasn't bad - in fact, the CG work was excellent, but the characters themselves were poorly drawn. The storyline was trite, the voices (particularly dubbed) were TERRIBLE, and the lead female character was nothing short of annoying.Whether or not you'll like this series depends on what you're looking for. If you like mecha, action and a story that moves quickly- then go for it.But, if you are looking for something with s better story and better direction, I suggest something more like Cowboy Bebop or Utena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue had the blues","review":"I saw the commercials for this on Cartoon Network, and I was hooked-I had my Tivo record all the episodes. The beginning was slow going, and I waited for it to get better. And waited, and waited... I don't think the characters were well-developed at all; the only characters that held my interest were the submarine itself and the fish-people, specifically the girl that saved our hero. The ending left much to be desired, since it explained even less than the \\"beginning\\" did. I have to admit, the graphics were excellent, which is the only redeeming thing about this series. I would recommend almost any other anime series for an \\"introduction\\" series, or I might bore the Newbie to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye candy...but nothing more.","review":"Perhaps the rest of the reviewers are used to the animation from Steamboat Willy, but as far as I'm concerned, the semi-decent animation doesn't make up for the lack of character and plot developement. I've seen much better CGI animation than this in many computer games. I had expected something far more impressive. Considering that only one episode is included on each DVD, it is a complete waste of money. Blue Submarine is not worth all of the hype that it is given by reviewers. If you want your money's worth of Anime, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show, Baaaad DVD","review":"The Blue Submarine DVDs are complete and utter rip-offs. Unlike other DVDs with anime episodes, they decided to put only one episode on each DVD....and sell it for almost the same price as other DVDs. They could have put all four of them on one DVD, but instead they opted for a devious marketing ploy to rip the consumer off.

Sure, there are some lapses into cliche and deadwood here and there, but mostly this is a solid, powerhouse read for Fleming fans. While John Gardner, acclaimed author though he was, merely cashed his annual check from Fleming's estate, churning out uninspired, routine stories, Benson obviously cares about having inherited the mantle from our dear boy Ian. There are some nice twists -- Bond using a dead rat as a weapon, laser surgery being used as a weapon -- and a couple of surprise guests from Bond's past. One can quite clearly hear the old voice of Bond in this, and it is due to Benson's increasingly tough and entertaining writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is 007's time up?","review":"A Bond book, like the films, is a journey where you know the destination but you want to enjoy the ride. Having read other reviews I am a little surprised to find my views are in conflict with many of them. I love Bond films and have enjoyed most of the books to date, however, this one felt...wrong.Bond only makes intermittent appearences for the first third of the book and when he does, it does not feel like Bond. I mean, he falls in love at first sight for goodness sake! The way Draco appears from the past and how their relationship evolves was clumsy and not how we want to see a character from the past dealt with.Okay there is action and a few gadgets but the real test is that if it was not a 007 branded book and was just a thriller it would be rather run of the mill. We fans deserve a little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The NERVE!!!","review":"OK, maybe that was a bit strong. But I'm a novelist too, and I personally would hate my characters being mucked about with after I was dead. Mathis and Marc-Ange Draco weren't his characters to begin with, and now he's made it so that if anyone else ever writes Bond novels, they cannot be used (unless Mathis became a pity figure, which would be horrible and not at all useful to the writer or fun to the reader). Benson's crime group and its leader are poor retreads of Blofeld and SPECTRE, too. All I see in this book is a writer cobbling together Fleming's old ideas to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Benson's worst effort yet","review":"This latest Bond offering didn't capture my imagination like the other. This book completes the Union trilogy, but the Union mystique kind of just fizzles out. The Union and le Gerant seemed much less evil in this offering. Bond spends the book chasing after the Union, but in the previous books, we had more of a sense of his impending doom. The bad guys are all from previous books. The only original bad guy is more of a pawn of the union. Aside from the story, Benson is not a very good writer. Maybe it was more prevalent in this novel that in others, But Benson uses the passive voice in writing sentences. Instead of describing scenes, he tells us with the verb \\"was\\". I know a lot of authors do this, but Benson does it so much that it sticks out and becomes destracting. A better writer would find a better way to describe things. Benson will never be a great writer, but as his worst effort, this book wasn't that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raymond Benson wears Florshiem shoes & shops at Pennys!","review":"As with Raymond Benson's previous Bond books, I really tried to read this book but had to quit in disgust! Benson's refers to a MPL submachine gun in his book. Any body with any type of tactical background knows that he should have referred to an H&K MPK! Very poor editing also. When Benson describes Bond wearing a sportcoat, that's all the detail we get. Fleming would tell us the tailor and the material. These things were important to Fleming and Bond and they are part of the allure of the orginal books. Ian Fleming cared about the things he wore, drove, ate, drank and made love to. Raymond Benson does not have the slightest clue about the finer things in life nor does he want to. He probably wears Florshiem shoes, a Casio watch and shops for clothing at Penny's and could care less about the rest. A terrible book along with his other Bond books. What a total waste of a charachter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mexico is more than tacos and tequila","review":"I knew very little about the real history of Mexico, or the country that became Mexico.

At one time the author, Adams, was very popular, seems to have fallen from favor when he took the position that Thomas Jefferson would have been against Roosevelt's New Deal.Seems to me the full flowering in this country of what Adams saw as the American dream is the Colorado caucus-assembly system, which has been under attack in recent years by the power elite.

When the light was low enough to maintain the 30 second exposure without this ND filter, I took it off and compared the difference. The difference was unbelievable.

If you're doing a trip to the beach or desert or to the middle of the Serengeti, you'll quickly realize how dirty your lenses can great. Also once those fine grained sand particles get into the small crevaces on in your lens... they are really hard to clean!2. Yes, you can achieve some of the same effects in post processing with Photoshop, but that's time consuming. Anything I can do up front on my camera, while taking the shot, the better.

Guess there is no point in spending postage money to send back a $12 wrong item to the US. Will have to live with it. The seller was Digital Darkroom & Photography Inc (K&M Camera). Be careful with the seller in the future. The packet says it is a 0.9 OD filter, while on the filter it says it is a 0.6 OD filter. I think you will agree that i should believe the filter reading.

I was hoping to make rough surf look like fog with, like, a 30 second exposure, but, even on an overcast day, iso 100, f/22, and this filter, I could only go a second or two.Consider buying a more powerful filter, especially if you want to take long exposures on sunny days.Oh, and it's really hard to look through the viewfinder with one of these on. You're almost blind when you're using one of these, so there will be a lot of guess-and check.I would really recommend some strong, stackable square filters instead. They're a lot more useful.

Near the end of the week I noticed a faint scratch/abrasion in the dead center of the filter as well as on the front element of the lens. Thus, I stopped using it (on the trip). When I returned to civilization and the land of the internet, I did some searching and found quite a few other folks (on dpreviewDOTcom) complaining about the same issue with the Tiffen filter and their 24-105/4L lens.All in all, I'd recommend this filter, but try it on all the lenses you intend to use to make sure there's some clearance between the filter and the front element."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid affordable filter","review":"The filter fits better than most of the other ones i've used.

There are several things I found inappropriate for children, the animation was horribly drawn, and Felix's bag was completely different from his cartoon shorts. I believe that the director of this film has never seen a Felix short.

There are two sides to any story, and while the Native side was woefully slighted in the nineteenth and early 20th century histories, the solution is not to whitewash the story in the other direction.

Earlier books on Cantor are too mathematical, hide truths about life, and hide God from the general public. The author brings life into Cantor. The problem is that mathematicians have removed life out of Cantor's work by rejecting God and God's determinate infinity.The author's discussion of mathematics on p.19 should be given lots of attention. There, he has words of Imre Lakatos and Morris Kline on the danger of logic. My recent book on 'The First Scientific Proof of God' shows that some opposing concepts can coexist, but only if God exists. By taking Cantor's work into the high schools, mathematicians might learn that their work can be unified with life and that God really exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shearing for those who like the obscure","review":"I love George Shearing.

Talk about a slow-ride to happiness.... I believe the bass player's name was Nick Jameson and he produced this album as well as playing some seriously incredible bass to compliment Lonesome Dave's and Rod's excellent guitar work.

Recently I heard this album from someone and all i liked was Slow Ride, and Fool For The City was OK but not really at all good, besides that every song on here is bad. The cover says it all, its some hobo fishing from the sewer, who the heck fishes from the sewer? Seriously, who makes that an album cover. Really your paying 7.99 for a 7 song CD that is nearly out of stock, and i doubt they are going to get any more copies, because no one buys copies.

It's sadly lacking in information all of which I later found on the Internet for free. For one, it doesn't offer a suggested protocol (series of steps) to follow for the diet. For another, it doesn't offer any recommendations on dosages for the nonprescription anti-fungals. And it doesn't really go into any depth about die-off and the need to take Molybdenum prior to starting an anti-Candida regimen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too technical!","review":"I bought this book since everyone was giving it 5 stars. The first part of the book was o.k., but then, it got into way too much detail. I found the descriptions of the cells, lymphs and technical names for every enzyme pretty boring.

If you are like me and need something more basic, look on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This book was so dry and so boring. It was very clinical.

Murray has researched candidiasis thoroughly, and written an easy to understand book. This book contains everything you have ever wanted to know (and more) that your doctor will most likely never tell you. Most doctors like to hand out pills as a fix to everything, but not Dr. Murray. He is truly concerned with health, well-being, and prevention. I know first-hand because I actually went to one of his educational seminars (which was free). He is so down to earth. This book has easy to follow plans that will help the body rid itself of candida and become healthy again. I trust what this book says because these are the same things my Holistic Physician has given me to treat my candida. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about candida/yeast/candidiasis or feels sick all the time and their doctor can't find a cause. The comprehensive inside will help you figure out what may be causing your ills and lead you to better health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorlly written","review":"Overall, the writing of this work is less than scholarly for a professed work of \\"research\\".

Her vocal talents haven't been matched by anyone asfar as I know. She had a true gift from God and knew this. It seemsany writer/composer she tackles brings out the best of each song. Justlistening to her voice makes me smile and thank God for blessing us withsuch a beautiful and talented first lady of song. She is \\"Lady Ella\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Lady Be Good is BETTER Than Good!","review":"For those who want to hear Ella weave her magic in crisp, sparkling STEREO this is one of the VERY best of her many CDs. On this one she performs a unique, slow-tempo \\"Oh Lady Be Good\\" (that's right, SLOW and MELLOW as you've never heard it before and as only she could do it - and this alone is worth the price of admission). All the other top Gershwin goodies (\\"A Foggy Day\\", \\"But not For Me\\", \\"The Man I Love\\", etc.) are enhanced by Nelson Riddle's incomparable arrangements recorded in magnificent wrap-around sound that puts you right in front row center. So buckle up. This is a thrill-ride you'll want to experience again and again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SONGS ARE THERE","review":"Only die hard fans of GERSHWIN should buy the massive songbook ELLA AND NELSON RIDDLE made in 1959 ,because the great songs are all included here.Back in those days ,GERSHWIN was still considered the best AMERICAN composer, probably because he was the only one who tried the classical experience and succeeded ,and also because of the fact that he died young.Nowadays we know that RICHARD RODGERS and JOHNNY MERCER are the deserving legends of AMERICAN popular music.Having said that let me say that this collection is perfect,it's really the best.Personal favorites of mine are SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME and BUT NOT FOR ME.Even the guy from TEXAS should enjoy that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action swamped by implausibilty","review":"I'm going to keep picking up Stewart's books because the pacing and style are becoming more polished.

Every time I thought I had read something incredible, there was something even more incredible in the very next chapter. The guys who were there are the only ones who know what it was like to be shot while flying a B17 bomber over Europe in WWII, then taken POW by the Germans, and endure the rigors of life as a prisoner. The events that took place are shocking to those of us who, thankfully, have never had to endure such trials.

Cage must've played this role--\\"the Mr Benevolent/trying to reform\\" crook--in several moovys. Duvall nearly recreates a character found in the Tom Cruise/Nicole Kidman race moovy also done by Bruckheimer, \\"Days of Thunder\\".

I was expecting big budget driving excitement and was left with two decent sequences at the head and tail, but a whole lot of nothing inbetween- with no decent character development or story to give this movie substance, it needed to at least stink up the theater with the smell of burning rubber... and for me it fell miserably short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three strikes and your out","review":"First off this movie is a remake of a chip's wannabe cheesy 70's action movie.2nd Nick Cage is playing the exact same charecter from Con AIR just with a less funny name.3rd since this movie is pg13 you know Angelina Jolie will be fully clothed the whole time"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"I've written some longer reviews lately and i'm tired. so i shall be brief in my attempt to summarize gone in sixty seconds the new one with Cage.

Now the man who hired him, Raymond Calitri (a Russian mobster and stolen car broker), wants his head.When Memphis learns of this, he comes back to town to see if he can help his brother. The only thing that will appease Calitri is if the order is fulfilled. Memphis must deliver the cars to Long Beach Harbor, Pier 14 by 8:00am, Friday morning, on the button, or watch Calitri kill Kip.So Memphis has to assemble his old crew, and do the job in a few days.

Will Kip finally realize that car boosting is dangerous? And can Memphis escape the cops?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Cold. Hot Wired.","review":"I've seen the trailer for this quite a few times. I don't know why I've never gone out and rented the film or something. Mind you, I know nothing about cars, so I was lost for most of this film. And I didn't learn anything either.What was disappointing about this film was that Angelina Jolie didn't exactly have a big role, or as much screen-time as Nicolas Cage or Giovanni Ribsi. She's one of my favourite actresses, and I suppose that was the only reason I wanted to see the film. Although seeing Giovanni Ribsi didn't hurt.It took a long time to start, and the storyline was supposed to be that Nicolas Cage's character (Memphis) had to steal 50 cars in 4 days. By the time the film dragged out, he only had one night to steal them all. And it was so predictable how one of the cars would be \\"late\\" being stolen, or would get held up.Possibly a film for car fans. Not for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make grand theft auto really, really boring","review":"You should know going in: this movie is not packed with car chases. I'm not giving anything away to tell you that many, many cars are stolen in this movie. The problem is that most of them are driven away as quietly as possible--Cage & Crew are trying to steal (I think) 50 cars in one night without getting caught. So they take it slow and easy.And that doesn't make much of a car-theft movie.I expected a LOT more action than this flick delivered. Without action, a movie needs plot and characters, and this one doesn't have either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Underrated","review":"Is the remake of \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" a masterpiece? No. Is it better than the original? Debatable, to say the least. One thing is for sure, this film has been unfairly sliced and diced by blood thirsty critics, and it did not deserve that. \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" is indeed a very witty, smart, sexy (Angelina Jolie is in it, isn't she?), Buckheimer film. One thing though, like other reviewers here have said, this is a devout car film, and viewers who don't really care much about cars might spend a lot of time during the movie rolling their eyes. But, for all the car lovers out there, at least try renting it, huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced action!!","review":"Before watching this movie I had heard many bad reviews about this film.

Nick Cage plays a retired car thief back in business after his young brother is threatened to be killed if Cage doesn't snatch up 50 cars within three days. So Nicolas Cage pulls together his crew of Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider: The Movie, The Bone Collector) and Robert Duvall (The 6th Day) with a few others.

The story alone is great whether on VHS, DVD, or HD. However, the transfer to HD isn't as good as I would have hoped. I'm actually not very demanding in regards to perfect HD quality, but lets face it, this transfer leaves a lot to be desired. I have this movie in DVD and Blu-ray. It does look better in blu-ray, however I don't feel that it was that much better that it was worth the extra cost. In some scenes, it felt like I was watching the DVD. This transfer was actually one of the more disappointing bluray transfer that I have seen. I did not notice any pixelation, but everything just wasn't sharp or defined as a true HD movie. I would recommend it if you don't already have this on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Promoting car chases and hijackings, there is barely any action in the movie.

The only cars really featured is a Porsche 911, a BMW 540i and the '67 Shelby Mustang. Awfully disappointed. I knew it got bad reviews by the professional critics so I wasn't expecting much in terms of character development. The cars are suppose to be the real stars anyways. But come on! There are only two real chase scenes and its at the beginning and at the end. The Ferrari 355s, Lamborghini Diablos, the 'Cudas, and the Jaguars only make cameo appearances. Its like the actors knew they had to returns them to the rental agency. For a movie that cost millions of dollars to make they could have thrown them in. For me, a real disppointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for the movie, 1 star for the trick","review":"This is a great movie and I'm happy to see it on Blu-Ray, it just sucks how the studio chose to not release the new unrated cut that you can get now on DVD.

I was hoping for a good plot, but the whole movie is implausible, however, top notch stars give it a small boost of energy. Nicholas Cage plays \\"Memphis\\" Range who comes out of retirement to save his misguided brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) from being killed by a sociopath black market car dealer. The movie is full of car chases, cat and mouse cops and robbers meet-ups, and lots of excitement as Memphis has to think quick and move fast to save his brother, Kip, and keep his hard-working waitress mother from losing both her sons.Angelina Jolie has a small part as a top-notch mechanic. The great Robert Duvall plays another criminal coming out of a retirement to do one last gig to save a life and keep his friend, Memphis, and family together.

It had it all, big stars, numerous exotic fast stars, but why did i tire of it so quickly? There could be numerous reasons, but the underlying factor is that there has to be more to a movie than a two hour car chase scene. It was from Bruckheimer, so it was stylish action sequences, but once you see them steal one car, you have seen it all. There was some sort of a plot about his brother who would die if they could not get all the cars, but there was not enough character development done so you would be able to care whether they could pull the whole thing off. And the villian was a carpenter whose weakness was seeing his wooden creations get destroyed.

Would have helped if they kept the brother as a hostage (perhaps right in the car crusher) during the movie, at least it would have had some more credibility.DVD extras are not worth a \\"nickel\\".

What he got was a trailer-park yarn about a broken man who has to ask his haggard mommy for permission to steal cars for the purpose of rescuing his boozing knucklehead brother from an evil foreigner. Given that all the over-rated action of the film is premised on the salvation of this little crook, the plot was stupid to the point of insult. Finally, just as the film doesn't like foreign people, it doesn't like foreign cars. For the most part, the only engine that tacks above idle is a pre-Pinto Ford Mustang. I guess it remains for someone else to bring the aestheticism of exotic sports cars to the screen. But that's Como!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look away from screen to avoid seizures(in a bad way)","review":"Im not sure who started this trend of directing movies so that they have the camera cut every 2-4 seconds. The movie SWAT and also watching Dr. Phil would be very good examples of this quick cut trend of editing. I dare anyone to watch any of the previous mentioned and be able to count to six before the camera cuts. It's impossible. Once you realize 4.9 seconds is the limit of a hold in a shot, (For me anyway) it becomes almost impossible to watch. Similar to watching a strobe light. Is it possible that it is cheaper to make productions this way or could it be a sinister plot to shorten viewer attention spans? In either case this movie is worse than watching a blank screen.

Today, we are left with nothing more than a host of idiotic car stunts slapped together without rhyme or reason -- thereby making the whole somehow less than the sum of the parts.The actors, virtually all of whom normally take great pride in their work, should have just taken Mr. Bruckheimer's money and beat it out of town in those fabulous hot rods."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a car nut and I think this movie STINKS!!","review":"Let me start off by saying I hate Bruckheimer movies.Given that, I was still willing to give it a go because I LOVE cars, and I LOVE action movies.

I watch them to have a good time.Well, I hated this movie. I was literally counting down the minutes, praying for it to end.There *are* lots of cool cars in this movie. Too bad each one is on screen for about 3 seconds as they are loaded into the back of trailers! Basically, you get to see one cool car, the Shelby, in one long chase.

It's obvious that Angelina Jolie made this before her Oscar win for Girl, Interrupted--her character was rather secondary and pointless. Cage again plays the wise-cracking semi-superhero we've seen before in Con Air, The Rock, etc.Gone in Sixty Seconds probably does appeal to its intended crowd--those who like speed, explosions, and never-ending chase scenes.

They even laugh at themselves by acknowledging that the young brother is like a \\"ghetto smurf.\\" Still, if this is what Hollywood is providing as parts for young Black men, no wonder there was so much for Spike Lee to criticize in \\"Bamboozled.\\" I wish they didn't have this stereotypical and undeveloped role in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad","review":"I thought this was such a boring film its hard to evaluate the DVD objectively so I won't even try.

Admittingly its hard to make a scene that everyone has probably seen a hundred times, but as much as they tried the chase scenes were fairly standard. You can watch the action highlight featurette and the time needed to watch the whole movie. Overall a very bad value.

It has black bars at the top and bottom of my screen its more like 1920 X 800 resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"a movie that lived up to its title","review":"1 star for nic cage-i guess he owed someone a favor.1 star for the beautifull ms jolie-had free time on her hands.i should give the cult 1 star for a pretty good song.the movie itself got what it deserved,1 minute lifespan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks!","review":"This movie is the Ultimate Bruickheimer guy crap movie, the kind that guys drag their girlfriends to that they don't like, and this is the king of them all. I was dragged by my friend and thank God he paid the ticket!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a fast paced fun film!","review":"I did like it, some people didn't like it, usually I dont like Nicolas Cage to much but I did like his performance in this film, the cars were hot and the other actors were fun. Last seen was fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"OK- Disappointment does not begin to convey the point. Even heavy duty star quality with a supporting cast of fine exotic cars cannot save this movie. The story is grated cheese: a cheesy plot that has been so shred-up for Hollywood consumption that it might as well be baby food. I will not provide an appropriately defaming metaphor for the acting, only out of respect for Cage, Lindo, Jolie, Duvall, and Ribisi. I love action flicks, I love talented actors, I love cars. There was not enough of any of the above to make this movie worth watching. Not even the FX, or the pretty car shots were that notable. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS ONE FOR ANY REASON."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome movie!","review":"Gone In Sixty Seconds is the best movie I have ever seen! It has a great cast, beautiful cars, and awesome car chases. It is also very comical at times. I recommend this movie to everyone, especially automobile lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The movie took a little longer than I was usual than expecting.

Good amount of stars in the film, but they are saddled with a ridiculous script, saying some of the dumbest lines this side of a Seagal movie. Prepare to turn off your brain before viewing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of last year's worst.","review":"Gone in 60 Seconds commits the cardinal sin of Hollywood: it actually bores. And I don't mean a slow start or anything. I actually had trouble trying to stay awake for the first-hour-and-a-half, simply because this movie features no good story, lousy and unfunny dialogue, and action scenes that look pathetic. Okay, Mission: Impossible 2 is about a thousand times better than this piece of dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CAR FILM!","review":"\\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" exists for one purpose: to show off some of the hottest cars in existence. The storyline is kind of hokey, but the cars more than make up for it, especially the GT 500. The car chase at the end is one of the best ever filmed! All the actors (Especially Robert Duvall, who can never give a bad performance) do fine in their roles. All in all, \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\" is a one @#*& of a ride!Also, don't miss Christopher Eccleston (plays the villain, Raymond Vincent Calitri, in this film) this January, when he resurrects one of the greatest characters of all time, the Doctor, in BBC's new \\"Doctor Who\\" series. BBC plans to send it to American TV stations as well.Movie Grade: B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Bruckheimer Drek","review":"I should have been gone from the theater in 60 seconds instead of sitting through this nonsense. Cage and his crew attempt to steal a number of cars over the course of an evening in order to keep Cage's brother from getting killed by this cheesy gangster with a terrible accent. From watching the previews, I had expected some neat car chases, but I forgot the first rule that movie previews, like your local recruiter, lie. Cage of course overacts, and the rest of the characters are just annoying. I've never seen the original Gone in 60 Seconds, but I'm sure that it's better than this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"If you're looking to buy this because it's \\"unrated\\" and you're expecting something edgier, sexier, or more violent than the original 2000 cut, don't bother -- the only reason it's \\"unrated\\" is that the studio didn't bother to submit it to the MPAA.In other words, it's a marketing ploy. Yes, this version is slightly different from the one previously released -- this one has all the deleted scenes re-inserted, so the film runs a few minutes longer. But there's nothing in it that wouldn't get another PG-13 if they re-submitted it.Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, and don't fall into this marketing ploy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's pretty good, but...","review":"...it remains pretty pale compared to the original from 1974 that was directed, produced and written by H.B. Halicki, who also starred as the main character Maindrian Pace. Oh, and he did his own stunts as well.Had not Halicki perished during filming of the sequel in 1989 (a water tower fell too early and crushed the car Halicki was driving), he would have been the obvious choice to direct a WORTHY remake of the best car-chasing movie of all times.Car-chase movies were a lot better in the 70's (the Driver ('78) and Cannonball ('76) (no, NOT the Burt Reynolds comedy) for example), with the rare exception of new movies like Ronin. Watch the original Gone in 60 Seconds, and I promise you will look at the 2000 remake in a totally new light."},{"rating":"1","title":"The (second) Most Gawdawful Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"After watching it three times (It was all they were showing on the China-US and US-Canada flights! Except for one flight where they showed Chicken Run!), I have to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Pretty much the entire point was to glorify car stealing and to show off a busty blonde with blowfish-lips. It was so stupid and boring I never got to the end, every single time I just took off my headphones about half-way through and continued to read Lord of the Rings. When a fourteen-year-old girl would rather read Lord of the Rings (looooong...) than watch a movie, you know that movie must be really really awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me yearn for the days of Mad Max.","review":"Gone in 60 Seconds shows what's wrong with Hollywood these days. Last summer, most of the pure action films were bombs. Yes, there were entertaining efforts like M:I-2, but we mostly got dreck like Gone in 60 Secs. The problem with the movie is, it doesn't have any idea how to deal with its pace or how to give its audience the much needed excitement of a great car chase.Take Mel Gibson/George Miller's Mad Max and its sequel, The Road Warrior. There's an inherent grittiness and realism to it that makes it all the more effective. Gone features one 10-minute long chase sequence that is so unbelieveable I couldn't help but laugh. The Road Warrior features a 15-minute chase that features some of the most spectacular stunts ever put onscreen and is at least a dozen times more intense than what director Dominic Sena has done with his whole film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Stupid","review":"Unless you are brain dead or just plain stupid, do not buy this movie! Save the money, buy a case of beer and watch some re-runs of The Dukes of Hazzard, it will be time better spent and much more intellectually rewarding. This movie would be a good candidate for Mystery Science Theatre 3000."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star fun movie. 1 star marketing abuse.","review":"It's not an Oscar winning anything, it's just a sexy, fast, fun movie, that looks good, and a good time killer. It's 5 stars for fun -- not for script or cinematic achievement.I give it a low rating as you are forced to watch several previews before getting to the menu. It's hard enough to click around on the PSP for movies, and yes, you can continue to attempt to skip them, but we should not have to deal with this annoyance. It should not even be an option. I bought the movie. Just put the damn feature film on the disc, along with relevant features, thats it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars because it doesn't work","review":"I bought the original DVD (not Dir. Cut). The disc won't play in my DVD player. It just keeps saying \\"reading\\" (aka searching for the disc that's in the player). All of my other DVDs work, though.Well, there's a waste of $7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Father on Earth","review":"\\"The Story of Dr. Wassell\\" is a moving account of the trials of a Navy field doctor, Corydon Wassell, during the outbreak of WWII on Java in the South Pacific. James Hilton brings his understated elegant crispness to the narrative which draws you into the complexities of command and responsibility in wartime theatre. Although not a religious man, Dr. Wassell exhibits all the refinements of a decent caring human being on earth, whose decision to serve the needs of his men at all times leads to his acceptance of the Navy Cross. All the dangers of war lurk at any time, yet, Dr. Wassell attends to his wounded wards with incredible zeal that inspires and invigorates those who come under his knowing, intelligent and self-less devotion. I found this to be a very moving and inspiring story, an example of doing what is right without calculation or hesitation. One could sense a larger Hand on his shoulder when he accepted the medal. He was surely an inspiration for Doctors without Borders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva Cuba","review":"Great performance for Cuba's, Carribs and Latin fans !!!

I was particularly interested in learning about the relationships and conflicts among the members of this expedition. Ridgeway did not \\"hold back\\" on his comments relating to the egos and personal objectives of these climbers. I thought that Wickwire was very fortunate that he did not die near the summit due, in large part, due to his carelessness that resulted from his anxiousness to reach the summit,"},{"rating":"2","title":"K2: an 8000 meter soap opera","review":"This is a good read, well written, and I agree with the 4-5 star reviews here so I'll keep it short. Too much time is spent on the personal conflicts between the climbers, it seems like that's half the book at times, and even though that got tiring, it's still a very hard to put down book. There are plenty of beautiful photographs which portray the difficulty of the mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"History buff","review":"Gave this gift to a history buff who really liked it because it covered more than one war.

It's a nice unit. I failed to read the dimensions though and it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It's great for a small rabbit or guinea pig sized animal, but my rabbit it BIG so I will be giving this to a friend.

It can comfortably fit two guinea pigs. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it does take up a lot of space in a cage and if you have a guinea pig like one of mine who clearly dominates the other you may find the more submissive guinea pig without a home at times. I had to buy another smaller igloo because Belle would poke Fifi out of the bigger one at times.

It seems like Hartle presents all the information in the wrong order. You are just constantly given equations without very much explanation or any derivation, and I think it presents the concepts poorly. You just have to try to memorize all the equations without really understanding them. I think a much better book to start out with is Introducing Einstein's Relativity by D'Inverno. Its good if you don't want to do any math and just want to be handed some equations, but if you actually want to understand General Relativity, I think it's a terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"good information","review":"I found this to be a tough read but the information is good to know, especially if you are working/researching in the work/family area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast lost amidst the flowing plot","review":"This book is another one of those random novels which I stumbled upon in a 2nd book shop and figured I'd give it a shot even before I researched it on Amazon. Being 389 pages or so, you'd think the book would read longer than it actually is. However, the print isn't so small, so the book reads more like 250 page book (that's my impression). I managed to finish this book in a mere 3 sitting mainly because the flow of the plot was quick: it was steady and engrossing! That doesn't happen very often in novels because of one main drawback: a fast plot leaves the cast struggling to gain private characterization in between all the action. And that is exactly where The Cloud fails- a quick plot envelopes the main characters and leaves them unrefined and fairly flat amidst all else that happens. BUT, when it comes to technology and speculation, The Cloud will not disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love 'em","review":"OK...I admit it.

This leads to trying to come up with some \\"plot\\" to carry each installment.In striving to come up with a storyline, most of the directors came up with the same one: a contemporary musician (blues guitarist Corey Harris, rapper Chuck D) travels someplace to find his musical roots in some form of the blues (Delta blues, Chicago blues).This repetitive storyline leaves no room for the history of the blues.Another problem is that not only are the storylines repeated, but so are many of the film clips and songs.I do have to single out the episode Clint Eastwood directed about piano players. It was excellent, and the concept (have piano player Eastwood interview and play with legendary pianists) sets it apart from the other episodes.My advice: buy the CDs from the series and skip the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really want to know something about the blues","review":"Scorcese is not your guy. This review covers disk one only. Scorcese is a great director no doubt. He's also presented some fantastic clips from the period. But his understanding of the blues is so warped by the search for authentic African origins that you have to wonder whether he's ever read anything about the subject. An unintentionally hilarious classic of clueless romanticism.

Hibbler has a much better book on Structural Analysis with helpful examples and diagrams. This book expects students to work extremely difficult problems at the end of the chapter without working any examples of similar difficulty.

But it is Chuck Berry's rocking rendition of Sweet Little Sixteen that steals the show.The cool jazz sounds of Gerry Mulligan, Thelonious Monk and Sonny Stitt are captivating, while Dinah Washington proves why she was \\"Queen of the Blues\\" on All of Me.Not just for summertime, the soundtrack is fantastic whenever smooth grooves are needed to warm up the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD","review":"i ORDERED THIS, ONLY TO FIND OUT A SHORT WHILE LATER THEY DO NOT HAVE IT. tHEY DIDN'T GIVE A Reason.

The story was ridiculous and don't understand what audience they were trying to appeal to, because they left nothing for anyone to relate or attach to. I rarely ever say a film was a bit of a waste of time, but in fact don't ever recall ever sayiing that, but this film was so disppointing. I like a good story with my movies, this story was just nothing short of lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a wide pass","review":"Despite actors and directors that have delivered before, this is a complete waste of time viewing. I hear the film is being referred to on the mainland as The Curse of the Golden Cleavage. Quite a disappointment to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial skin deep junk","review":"I used to have great respect for its director Zhang until he started to make big budget martial arts fantasy films. I am sorry to say this film is a superficial skin deep junk. Visually it is stunning but its story line is completely senseless. It is as if the plot is an after thought for the sake of the visual effects Zhang envisions. It claims to be in the Tang dynasty but the only thing which might has something to do with the era is the low-cut women dresses. Yet even that is way overdone. What a disgrace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warmed Over \\"Dynasty\\" Episode with delusions of Grandeur","review":"Although a few of the other review allude to the weak plot, I am surprised no one has noticed that the plot of this film has more in common with an episode of \\"Dynasty\\" with Chow Yun Fat in the \\"Blark Carrington\\" role and Gong Li as \\"Alexis Colby\\" - and it seems that every hack-kneed soap opera plot devise is used - the upstairs/downstair romance, the wide who resents her over baring husband and has an affair with her much sexier step-son, the first wife thought to be dead who shows as the star witness of the nurder trial (oops!, that last one was from \\"Dynasty\\"). The film is beautiful to look at but I became very \\"aware\\" of how much CGI effects were used to create the thousands of soliders.Then of course the plot borrows heavily from Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" and \\"Macbeth\\" as well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"Since I first saw this on TIME WARNER CABLE I have enjoyed this file.

The movie struck me as a failure. And the cast members have all done much better work elsewhere. Crouching Tiger, Hero, Flying Daggers this is not, not even close. Others seem to rate the movie highly, so maybe I'm not the one to listen to here."},{"rating":"2","title":"As dark and full of intrigue as a Shakespearean tragedy","review":"Set in the 10th century Tang dynasty, this film is as dark and full of intrigue as a Shakespearean tragedy. The Empress is a beautiful, strong willed woman who is held virtually captive by the Emperor. For ten years, every two hours she must drink a medicinal tea at the Emperor's insistence. When the Emperor discovers the liaison between the Empress and her stepson Prince Wan, he begins to add a poison to the tea. The Empress plots with her middle son to overthrow the Emperor. Director Yimou Zhang's elaborate and breathtaking setting and the ornate costumes are a thin veneer that covers the corruption of the imperial family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This film is visually astounding. It's full of rich color and unbelievable costumes and settings. The plot and characterization are alright but they are eclipsed many times over by the poetry of the cinematography. If you are passionate about(or even just enjoy) visual art of any kind then this film is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok.","review":"Emphasis on colorful scenery made this movie pretty dull. It doesn't come close to Crouching Tiger. Don't buy this movie. If you must see it you can get my copy.

I think the movie stands a chance as some kind of a surrealist curiosity; for now, I shall assign it to a place of honor in the basement, never to be heard of again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye Candy Facade","review":"The Curse of the Golden Flower stars great Chinese actors Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat. Psychedelic in its opulence, the setting of the Forbidden City during the Tang Dynasty (900 A.D.) and the costumes of the cast of thousands, are as decadent as eating wedding cake for a week.Yet the plot is as thin as an Oriental screen. Not intending to be a spoiler, like most modern Chinese movies, e.g. Raise the Red Lantern, also starring Li, the ending of \\"Flower\\" is depressing, everyone dies, and evil prevails.Set during the Chrysanthemum Festival, held the ninth day of the ninth month of every year, the emperor, empress, princes, and various courtiers poison each other and plot coups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, fantastic costumes","review":"This is a visually pleasing movie on many levels. Costumes are like nothing we have ever seen in asian movies, we see a glace of the Forbidden City (imperial palace) and interior decorating in the palace quarters is breathtaking. Gong Li is as a beautiful as ever in her role of an empress, while we get to see Chow Yun Fat play a bad guy (evil emperor) for a change from his standard roles of heroes and saviors. For any Westerner, the best way to describe a story plot would be to say that this is a cross over between Greek tragedy and Shakesperian storytelling. I have enjoyed every minute of it. I am sure you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"My sister has watched it and said it was a must see.","review":"She loves these types of movies and praises this one highly.No wire work except in one place she said which means I might watch it.

Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as zany as Zany.","review":"I always looked for Bruce McCall's brilliant work in the National Lampoon and loved the reprinted work in 'Zany Afternoons' (I bought two copies, just in case) and it confirmed that here was an unusual humorist, as good with a paint brush or typewriter.This latest book though I found a bit disappointing. The material does not really stretch to 128 pages, lots of these (especially the text ones) have far too much white space and the illustrations I found lacking in detail. In 'Zany Afternoons' there are three hilarious parodies of Detroit car brochures, 1934, 1946 and 1958 Bulgemobiles, all have paintings of fantasy cars with backgrounds full of detail, it is this detail that I found missing in so many of the paintings in 'Dream-O-Rama'Still, the text is very funny and if you are new to Mr McCall's work try and get 'Zany Afternoons' and 'Sit!', he wrote the wonderful words to accompany the dog paintings of Thierry Poncelet."},{"rating":"2","title":"real literature, but somewhat slow and depressing","review":"The setting and the people of rural Italy at the end of the last century is thoroughly and thoughfully depicted.

The covers of the Henley and Cobain tunes are the most moving pieces on the album. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is atrocious elevator fare. This was a well-conceived but very disappointing and highly underdeveloped effort. My guess is that he spent no more than a day or two on the project before he hit the studio. Also, Hancock is simply not the introspective and engaging pianist on this album (except on New York Minute) that he is capable of being. The freshness of his \\"Inventions and Dimensions,\\" over 30 years old, makes this album sound as stale and bland as it is. I don't think the limitations of the compositions are as much a problem (although, the pure melodic aspects of rock compositions could be a problem) as Hancock's lack of will to really stretch out and develop the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"why oh why?","review":"Why was this CD released?

And there may be no better way to understand how a verbal construction works or doesn't work than to take it apart and put each piece in its place in a diagram. Diagramming is also a great tool to use in arguing various points of construction. The book also includes general rules and approaches to building complete manuscripts.

There were some characters i wanted Turtledove to go more depth in and others i felt he could have elimintated. The ending of the novel was were the climax was for most characters.

Mr. Turtledove is clearly writing for the sake of quantity rather than quality.

In fact, if you've read both series you've recognized several of the same characters existing in each. The book is not a good piece of writing, but is an even poorer example of editing.

Feffer does a reasonable job but constantly offers very opinionated views against the Bush administration that aren't very well thought out. I found the book interesting and informative and enjoyed reading it but my mind wouldn't allow me to believe everything he said because of the obvious agenda to discredit the current administration. The author does show that the North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il's isn't completely crazy and that there may be a small amount of logic to his leadership.

Feffer's lack of objectivity is most obvious when discussing what he calls \\"mounting evidence\\" of US germ warfare against the North during the Korean War.

I have an old, now-discontinued Disney Sing along VHS that my daughter loves, so I bought this one. It is completely awful. The other video I have has scenes from the actual movies, which is really cool. This one might as well be an advertisement for Disney World.They should pay us to watch it! Not only that, but the fact that it is live-action with super cheesy kid actors and characters in costumes really dates it.

I had only read five of his other poems, and somehow after reading three poems from this volume I knew something was amiss. The translations were more confusing than the Spanish, and my spanish is poor. In many instances the translator chose words that were unnecessarily complex to convey something that could be expressed more simply and clearly in English and still remain true to the author's original words. The only reason I logged onto Amazon.com was to see if the reviews also cited poor translation as a problem with the volume, so I would know I was not just a poor reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Poetry; Execrable Translations","review":"One just doesn't get the chance to use a dandy word like \\"execrable\\" that often, but there's no better word for Ben Belitt's translations.

If you have enough Spanish to catch their rhythms you can appreciate them without letting the ghastly translations spoil your enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Poetry Poor Translation","review":"As someone who speaks several languages I understand the difficulty of translation. However, the degree to which the tone and voice of the poetry changes in this translation is alarming. If you speak spanish, I highly recommend this book. It is a very complete (relatively speaking) collection of Neruda's work. I read it and use it all the time. However, if you only speak English I warn that you won't really be experiencing the poetry of Neruda if you read this translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Godawful Translation","review":"The one thing I will say in favor of the English translation here is that it forced me to read the Spanish. Belitt absolutely mangles the Spanish. Until I read the Spanish, I thought Neruda wasn't that good a poet - now I know better. As with far too many Neruda translations, you're better off buying a Spanish-English dictionary and doing it yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abominable translation","review":"This was my first exposure to Neruda's poetry and it left an extremely bad taste in my mouth. It seemed nonsensical and adolescent, like a teenager who thinks he's smarter than he actually is, writing poetry to impress his 9th grade English teacher. I was ready to conclude that Neruda was not worth wasting my time on until I got on here and discovered all the other one-star reviews berating the quality of the translation. For now I will reserve judgment on Neruda until I read a decent translation. This is a dreadful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted promise...","review":"...is the most tragic thing I can think of.Seems to me that this guy just likes to hear himself talk (write?), continually attempting to impress with facile displays of what he probably thinks is \\"erudition,\\" but what is actually just dropping names.Perhaps he could have been a good, or even a great, writer, if only he had been able to focus on the act of writing rather than on his sophomoric, facile self--and on his overinvestment in his public persona as writer.A pity..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrasingly bad...","review":"...so much so, in fact, I can't believe these translations even made it past the editors at Grove. Bellitt lacks even the simplest feel for how Neruda words together, played ideas out to their conclusions, confronted the world, and changed again and again and again as a writer over those 5 decades from whence this book gets its title. Really a schlock job all round -- schoolboy translations, mediocre overall selection. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I have to agree with previous review.

It shames me to even share a language with this guy. He turns Neruda's beautiful concrete, surreal imagism into senseless abstractions, which are about as interesting to read in this context as an instruction booklet for a Vaccuum cleaner. This is a great collection, covering an immense spectrum of work, if you are familiar with the intricacies of the Spanish language, or are at least familiar with a lot of Pablo Neruda's writings, it definitely adds something as far as interpretation goes. If not I'd sincerely suggest looking at another translator. No one should experience Neruda this way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have an old copy of this book, which has one virtue - the original Spanish versions of Neruda's poems are included. I looked here on Amazon mainly to see if others had also concluded that the translations are terrible. I see I am not alone. I find it somewhat amusing to read the blurbs on the cover and find that when the book came out, the New Yorker praised Belitt as having done \\"A remarkably able job,\\" and the New York Times saw it fit to print that \\"Ben Belitt's translations are inspired.\\" They could not be more wrong. His translations overtake and ruin nearly every poem.The only reason to buy this book is to read Neruda in the original Spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"The poetry of Neruda in this book is amazing & worth buying the book for, however don't rely on Ben Belitt's translations because this guy is a moron. I cannot understand how he possibly got the translations that he did from this poetry. It's not even like others have said where he's trying to match the rhythm or trying to interpret what Neruda meant in Spanish, he full out adds in words and sentences that don't exist in the Spanish version and trying to read them in English is harder than reading them in Spanish because he obviously used google translate to publish this book making the English choppy. You're better off just buying this book all in Spanish and looking up translations online if needed. Whoever allowed Ben Belitt to translate anything & then continue to publish it should be fire, and Ben Belitt should never be allowed to go near another Neruda work for as long as he lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor translation from Spanish to English","review":"Compared to the two other books that were translated from the same text, \\"10 Love Poems\\", and \\"20 Love Poems\\", this was extremely poor.

And, the other two books are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal translation, Exquisite poetry","review":"A terrible, terrible translation ... butchery of the most base sort.

Huxley is convinced that we opted for the worst of both worlds -- East and West -- by failing to curb the capability of science with the wisdom and moderation of Eastern mysticism.

The movie industry employees seek out the writer only to find he has been dead for a few weeks. After this revelation, the book jumps into the actual script. The script reads like a cheap romance novel. In a strange savage land, a man from civilization falls in love with a primative woman. They face conflict, but there forbidden love endures. They run away together and live happily. And we never find out what happens to the ever so fortunate movie mogels who rescued the script from incineration.Was Aldous Huxley suffering from writer's block when he wrote this?

It sounded like maybe a comic recording until noticing that she was hitting all the notes exactly as she wanted. The wistful passion in her song is the kind you wish someone was singing to you. I bought the CD and have become a real fan. This CD seems like the best place to start. It was the beginning of her career and she had terrific backup - including Ray Brown on Bass. She makes fun of guys who hit on her in the Paris clubs where she was discovered, but in this selection of songs you can hear why they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like no-one else","review":"At first listen, you might think of Blossom Dearie as a coy and girlish.

She is incredibly honest in her delivery, not hiding behind any preconceptions of what a singer \\"should\\" sound like. Blossom is all Blossom, and no pretense. She's also a masterful pianist, making it sound as if she's not working at all. Jazz Masters 51 is an excellent introduction to Blossom Dearie.I've met Blossom Dearie in NYC.

I did not expect a book on sexuality to have such a deep impact on my spiritual walk but it makes sense for it to have this effect now - it's an area of my life I was trying to work on without the Lord and failing miserably.

Whether you're really struggling with sexual issues or just want to move on to a new level of intimacy with your husband, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"See Sex in a whole new light","review":"This book is INCREDIBLE! It is thorough and hits on many topics that may actually be the underlying problem in your physical relationship with your husband (examples are: abuse as a child, previous sexual relationships, your husband's involvement in pornography, etc.). You will be challenged to grow as a wife, and view your husband through God's eyes. You will find out what it means to be sensual (I think that was my favorite part).However, the best part is that you will be utterly bathed in scripture. Obviously, our Pastors cannot preach these issues in detail from the pulpit on Sundays! So, this book privately walks you through God's word and teaches you all that you've missed before. It is well researched, and gives you insight into the original text (for those of us who never took Greek or Hebrew!).Love your marriage enough to read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time...!","review":"This book is truly wonderful, for ANY married woman-whether you are a newlywed, or if you've been married for 30 years.

This book has unique and surprisingly refreshing ideas, facts and stories--with a totally biblical premise.

It does this while portraying a very realistic picture of the struggles faced by everone, including Christians, on a day to day basis.Although the author may not be quite as polished as Frank Peretti, he is very good and writes in a similar way.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone and particularly to Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eep.","review":"This is the only book I've ever hurled against a wall.

It's not often a book will hold up a mirror to your life and show you some things you'd rather not see in the world. On The Edge was that book for me.Every Christian needs to get a copy of this book and read it cover to cover. It's helped me gain a deep understanding of how the forces of darkness try to undermine joy, peace, and truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"space opera with a little extra","review":"Needing something light to read, I reached for this novel that I had good memories of. Initially I found it disappointing - a typical space opera with the obligatory violence, ugly aliens, beautiful women, and even a bit of implied sex. But I did find what appealed to me. This novel heads off into the extraordinary and even has a thoughtful message about the unseen harm we might be doing - even if it is inadvertent. There is also one startling moment of crisis and realisation in a dramatic moment for the lead character - even though it isn't key to the story, it is breath taking.other recommendations:'Counter Clock World' by Philip K Dick'Ramunujam' by Robert Kanigal"},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous book","review":"I would rate this a very dangerous book, as it contains a lot of incorrect information and also suggests - through pictures and the like - that antique clothing can be worn by modern people.

This was difficult to put down and a book that I was sorry to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsessive and never ending","review":"At about page two hundred, when the first part of the novel has a resolution, i was wondering how the author was going to fill the next 300 pages. well, she does it by using thousands and thousands of words having obsessive conversations with a number of people about what happened during the first two hundred pages. The first part of the book was very good. She should have wrapped it up shortly after that. instead, it just became ridiculous. [SEMI SPOILER FOLLOWS] maybe someone just should have told our high flyer that some of the other characters in the book are a bunch of lunatics. perhaps then she could have moved on. also, the author really needs to limit her use of words like \\"nutterguff\\" and \\"fluffette.\\" this became very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Flyer - grounded","review":"This book started out as an interesting story about strong people and social situations.

Ms. Howatch did a wonderful job of creating the characters and in keeping me glued to the story line.

On the whole I was quite disappointed. I had loved several of Susan Howatch's books including Penmarric and Cashelmara so I was looking forward to this one.

The product came via UPS via Bahgdad I am convinced, based on the condition of the box. I refused delivery and had Amazon try again. The second attempt met with similar results only this time the box was even more demolished and I wasn't home when it arrived [what a surprise]. Since the box was in no condition for return I took the ladder out of the box and checked its condition. Despite the outward appearance of the box the only problems seemed to be dented and chipped wood on the frame. It seemed to be still in square. I hope it will function when I get it installed. Two points: The box needs to be more robust to withstand shipment and the carrier needs to take a little, no, make that a lot better care in handling."},{"rating":"1","title":"exceedingly poor construction and assembly (uninstallable).","review":"I ordered the Werner A2508 folding attic ladder June 3rd so that I'd have it on hand when I needed to install it in the attic of my new house I'm constructing.

I opened it up for the first time yesterday only to discover that it was assembled completely out of square with the bolt holes drilled well over a half an inch off all along one of the 54\\" sides. Because of this when they stapled the frame together the main hinge across the end is wrenched making the ladder unable to be opened and/or installed. Even if it could be installed (it's not close to square so won't fit my square opening) it couldn't be trimmed out.

The painter will have to spend a lot of time sanding, putty-ing, and prepping; or we will have to re-skin with another piece of panel. I do not expect stain grade material on an attic access, but I would have difficulty finding a comparatively junky piece of material at the lumber yard.I won't purchase this ladder again."},{"rating":"2","title":"attic stair installation","review":"This is a very high quality stair set. Installation is as easy as it can be for an overhead install.

I don't think there is a better stair set on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, stable ladder","review":"I did not buy this item on Amazon, but I can attest to the quality of the ladder. I purchased it through special order at a local store that sells Werner ladders.The box arrived in pristine condition, and the frame was square. I ripped out the old ladder (45 minutes), a friend helped me pop it up into the attic, set it on the supports (per the instructions), and nailed and screwed it to the beams (45 minutes). We had to cut the legs because they were too long. That took about 45 minutes. Total time: about 2 hours. It was my first attic ladder.All in all, FANTASTIC product. It is ROCK solid.

Okay let me start by saying the DVD features a total of 5 different endings. The 1 that was chosen and 4 alternate ones. What does that tell you? It tells me that the director was at a loss with his movie. He is forced to cut his movie over and over trying to bring it together and realizing that an interesting idea isn't enough. I'm not suprised that there are so many alternate endings. The entire movie is very cut up, it's like maybe there's a better movie somewhere amongst everything that was filmed. \\"Godsend\\" is like a bad remix to a good song. I really dislike this feeling of lost opportunity. The 2 stars is for the cast who probably cried when they saw the final cut. Greg Kinnear, Robert DeNiro, Rebecca Romijn Stamos, and young Cameron Bright all deserved a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow this movie sucked!","review":"Okay, so i had heard bad things about this movie so I wasn't expecting much. This movie was sooo bad. One of the worst I have ever seen, and that's saying alot. The 'alternate endings' were better than the one that was used in the final cut. The acting is terrible and the camera shots got on my nerves. I couldn't understand what exactly was happening to the little kid that was so scary. I'm not usually this critical on films, but this one was just a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"UTTER GARBAGE","review":"Although moves way too fast in the beginning, GODSEND seems interesting in the beginning. However, it quickly goes pear-shaped and becomes too far-fetched for its own good. Totally ridiculous without any real explanation for things that occur.What a shame De Niro and even Kinnear would want to be part of such a poor film. Money talks, I guess. Reputation comes second?Not worth seeing at all. Garbage all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE'S NO ENDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is literally the most horrible move I have ever seen and I'm not even kidding... The movie is boring, the story is weak, and the ending doesn't give you any kind of satisfaction what so ever. I advise everyone to stay away from this horrid piece of crap and spend your money on something good!ANY MOVIE LOOKS GOOD NEXT TO THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" Its your standard piece of escapism and not much more then that.\\"","review":"Godsend's premise is somewhat interesting but its execution is far to predictable and mundane ultimately its your standard piece of escapism and not much more then that. The only real noteworthy scene in the film is when Robert De Niro goes crazy in the church at the end of the film granted its not terrible but its not good either I would say its a tolerable film but its not really worth investing time into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathertic little abortion....","review":"That should never have been made. You should know that when a movie had 5 different endings, there was something wrong with the script. Greg Kinnear and Robert Di Niro are excellent actors, but this script stunk.Everyone in this film is miscast and don't fit their parts. The story seemed to have been written as they filmed rather than following a script.Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANTICLIMACTIC","review":"What can I say about this movie? It could have been great. Such intriguing topics. The moral issues of cloning. Where do you draw the line between life and death? Should doctors play God, and what happen if they do? Too bad they were wasted on this movie. Godsend has a slow story line , is poorly expalined with a very unclear ending. This movie was like a rollercoaster ride with a very long climb and a very short drop. You keep thinking ok this will get better. I know it'll pick up if only I stick it out. I'm sad to say this movie never picked up and never really made any sense. It failed to hold my interest and will probably fail to hold yours too."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for acting and the movie's idea","review":"The acting of Kinnear and DeNiro was wasted on this poorly executed film. There was a lack of vision to the movie that I found frustrating. I found myself wondering how the actors felt having given very solid performances, only to see the finished product in preview? The story just dropped and left you feeling like you'd wasted two hours. The child's part was poorly developed, as were the clues or storyline leading up to the end. Perhaps that's why they couldn't find a fitting ending. The movie lacked good flow. The father and mother's roles should have somehow been opposite, until the end. It just didn't work.Where was the plot? Where was the screenwriter? Where was the editor? Someone needed to guide this film. No one did. As a result, it fell flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"What WAS this mess? After over an hour of sitting through this I had to get up and leave. It was horribly boring. Nothing but a series of long drawn-out scenes that don't go anywhere. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing did.

It probably will be out VERY soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"It wasn't THAT bad!","review":"I must admit that I love the scary, thriller types of movies, so I don't understand why such bad reviews. Maybe I'm a little naive, but I thought it had some very surprising twists, and it kept me guessing until near the end. I didn't know where they were going with this plot, but it at first reminded me a little of The Other, which I had viewed a couple of days previously to this one. I will say that I agree with a previous reviewer who liked #2 and #3 alternate endings better than the one in the movie. This is where I believe, a lot of people including myself, felt the ending was so...lame. As far as people complaining that this movie is not realistic, well, this is a science fiction, thriller type of movie! Just try to sit back and keep in the back of your mind that this isn't real!!

Greg Kinnear stars as a I-yell-all-the-time-because-it's-dramatic dad; Rebecca Romijm-Stamos stars as his I-yell-all-the-time-too wife, who decide to have their dead son cloned after a tragic accident. The cloneboy replacement turns out to be evil, for reasons that are stupid, contrived and nonsensical, as well as painfully obvious to anyone with half a brain, once the film is about a third of the way through. Robert DeNiro is the mad scientist who brews the baby up; he manages, to his credit, to chew a minimum of scenery, right up until the --gasp!-- scary surprise ending. This film is a total waste of time; it's amazing they even released it."},{"rating":"1","title":"*****Splendidly Horrendous*****","review":"This film is absolutely horrible. It is a cheap, thrown together attempt that had no thought put in to it, whatsoever. I agree with the previous that it had a good concept. The idea was great and had a lot of potential; Unfortunately, they ruined it. The plot is lacking, and the movie is very predictable. The first 30 minutes of the film just flies, with one thing happening after another, not allowing you to actually recieve any feeling from it. It is not in any way original; mainly getting its ideas from other such films as The Ring, or Sixth Sense. Poor Robert DeNiro must have been contracted to do this film, cause it must be one of the worst in his career. To me, anyone who enjoys this film must have a simple mind that is easily amused...........what a waste of life.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adam the genetically engineered psycho brat","review":"This movie is strangely anti-science.

When did this bubble up to the top of good ideas to spend millions of dollars on?Throughout the movie, the question of whether cloning is moral or not is asked. For some reason, the fact that the disturbed cloning man committed fraud is underplayed, and cloning gets all the focus as if it is was the root of all of the problems. That's like blaming 9/11 on air travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be afraid; be very afraid ...","review":"of waisting 101 minutes of your life watching this movie! Is it a horror film? No way.

The script and dialogue are truly bad - and I think they know it. Even at a high volume, I needed to turn on the subtitles to catch all of the dialogue: my mistake!

There were so many other directions the story could have gone which would have made it a great movie, in my opinion. The acting was weak on all sides, no big stars could have saved this plot. It wasn't scary, was not even 'creepy' and lacked suspense. To say it was boring and moved slow doesn't even cover it. It's not even qualified for \\"So bad it's good\\" status, it's just plain BAD!

Plot is too simple, and the story lines are so boring, and the characters are dull. The writer seems like he remembered that he has to write the script an hour before it's due. The editing job is not too bad, but, in all truth, the direction is off.I bought this film with a genuine \\"cheap\\" price, but I think I wasted my money regardless. The scientific and moral issues the film discussed were not in place as the film failed to prove and make a stand to convince the viewer. I must admit, however, that the film might have potential if more time spent on this picture. Unfortunately, this film fell short on everything. It did not provide any enjoyment at all.

A mind boggling boring thriller with Kinnear and De Niro giving off no juice to their parts. This could of been a hell of a lot better. This is based off of Dean Koontz book of the same name. Stamos is dried out just like she was in The Punisher. This may freak out people who have night terrors but to me its a waste of my time.

It seems like Lions Gate only releases movies that are so bad that no one else would. There may be a few exceptions, but Lions Gate movies suck and I have done my research.Same goes for this gumble of a movie. I can't believe that De Niro even got involved with this. Granted he's done some really bad movies, especially Analyze That (but its still clear why he'd want to do it). This movie is corny when it's supposed to be emotional and its boring when its supposed to be creepy. There is no resolution and it really should have since there the only thing that could have saved this movie would have been an interesting resolution.The idea of the movie is interesting, but appantently they got a C average seventh grader to write it and a group of monkeys to make it instead of competent film makers.

Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is a horrible actor - she hasn't been in a good movie yet, I decided to give this movie a chance since Robert De Niro is in it, but he couldn't save this movie.

If you absolutely feel compelled to read this book, check it out from the library - then skip to the last chapter. Everything Lewis Turco has worth saying is summed up there. My copy is 111 pages long - I highlighted 7 statements in the entire book, 4 of which only reinforced what I already knew. I wish I could get back the hours I forced myself to finish this piece of garbage.For the life of me, I can't understand why publishers keep printing this book. I've read better articles about dialogue by amateur writers online. Why'd they pick this guy to write this book? Most of what he has published is non-fiction or poetry. Many of the few fiction books he's published were co-authored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than worthless","review":"This book is probably the worst how-to writer's book I have ever read. Actually, I'll admit I didn't read much of it. I kept waiting for the author to break out of his ridiculous \\"Socratic method\\" style and get to the point, but as far as I could see he never did. The style alone sets up an impenetrable barrier between author and reader - if there is any useful content in the book, it's so far buried underneath the annoying chatter that you're unlikely to ever find it.The only good thing about the presentation is that it's so hard to follow, it's unlikely anyone will actually take its bad advice. It reminds me of a Nigerian email scam I received once where the instructions were so convoluted and poorly written that even if I had wanted to take part in the scheme, there was no way I would ever figure out what the steps were supposed to be.I can't imagine how anything like this actually could have been published. It's a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dialogue","review":"Unfortunately, real conversation usually makes for poor literary dialogue.

Again, they contain good information and cover the subject decently.\\"Voice & Style\\" \\"Dialogue\\"To me, the last two books need to be rewritten. They are by far the weakest of the series. Both suffer from an annoying style, particularly Dialogue, and both are very skimpy on real information. Neither one is very helpful.This is the order in which I'd recommend reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I read two other books in this series (Plot by Ansen Dibell and Beginnings, Middles, & Ends by Nancy Kress) and they were excellent, so I decided to try this one.Unfortunately, Mr. Turco suffers from twin delusions: one, that he is humorous, and two, that his device (teaching dialogue through the use of Socratic dialogue) is useful, amusing, or instructive. I barely limped into chapter three, and restrained myself from throwing the book at the wall only because I was in the employee kitchen, and not my own home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dialogue","review":"I was very disappointed in the book. The book was very hard to read because the dialogue was very boring. (He wrote the book as if he was having a conversation with himself.) This style made it useless as a reference manual.I would recommend the following books instead: Writing Dialogue by Tom Chiarella and Film Scriptwriting: A Practical Manual by Swain & Swain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically correct but somewhat lacking in substance.","review":"Slim volume. Too much info about obvious techniques: how to use quotations, quotations within quotations, how to properly format a script, etc. NOT enough explanation about the ways in which dialogue can establish desire, opposition, conflict, setting, and character. Overall, the book is well written (grammatically correct), well thought out (clearly defined concepts) but LACKING in any USEFUL substance (ie, ways the writer can USE the dialogue to MOVE the narrative forward). This book is OK for a high-school level introduction to the elements of dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over substance","review":"I tried reading this cover to cover and, as another reviewer noted, this \\"Socratic\\" style of the author in a conversation with a beginning writer is irritating and self-consciously unfunny. However it DOES unintentionally provide an example of what NOT to do in dialogue: draw it out endlessly, in a circle going nowhere. If brevity is the soul of wit, this book has neither brevity nor wit.

Even Ms. Colwin admitted that she bought cookbooks just to read them, but I'm sure she tried some of the recipes as well. She described, by name, several cookbooks she had on hand, most or all out of print, and it made me wish I could read them as well. To show how cleverly she turned a phrase, I was inspired to cook something and did! I tried a recipe for bread that, when she wrote it, had me almost tasting it. Alas, said bread did not turn out as hoped. I had someone else (an experienced cook) try it as well, and it was somewhat disappointing. No big deal. I'd rather read than cook, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful food writing by a wonderful writer","review":"Laurie Colwin wrote evocative, funny novels and short stories. Here, she shows that she was also a terrific cook. With a few words, she can conjure up images of splendid meals, as well as some spectacularly awful ones.

Her musings are interesting, inspiring, and down to earth. In many ways, she is the anti-Martha Stewart, as she openly admits short cuts she takes (cutting up canned tomatoes while they're still in the can!), and discourages purchasing lots of kitchen paraphenalia. Throughout all of her writing and her cooking, the biggest ingredient is love.

I just didn't get this book. Yeah lots of sex and all that but it was like something that happened to her and not with her in mind. I would not recommend this book without letting the potential reader know that if you like to be bossed around, and told you are nothing but a vessel for a husband, you will love this book.

Highest rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Although recognizably by the same author, this book is, unfortunately, like most sequels far inferior to the orginal (\\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\"). It works as readable crime fiction, but does not rise much above it. A critic once noted that Ripley is unconvincingly rescuscitated as a happily married man in the sequels and I'd have to agree. You still might like it if you're expectations aren't too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripley's Slow Slow Game","review":"This book was my first acquaintance with Patricia Highsmith's Ripley; so I cannot compare it to others in the series. I hope they are better. I found \\"Ripley's Game\\" long and boring.I thought it took forever to get the story moving. Then there were a few good action scenes. Then back again to page after page of nothing happening. Then a few more good action scenes. Etc. etc. etc.It is very rare that I do not finish a book once I start reading it. I did complete \\"Ripley's Game\\" but it was a near thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The others are right: it would help to read the first two novels in order to appreciate the character of Tom Ripley. This is important for this installment because this is the novel where Ripley almost has a soul -- he actually undertakes his usual nefarious activity in order to atone for his own malignant action (first a rumor, then a murder plot). The characters don't exactly deepen Highsmith's narrative, but she overcomes the problem of writing a creative mystery by bringing more and more characters into the mix -- the mysterious Reeves Minot, who appeared in Ripley Under Ground (an underrated novel, in my estimation), becomes a rather important character. And the unlucky pawn in Ripley's game, Trevanny, lends the story the closest thing to a moral center that one could hope for. Oh -- and the action scenes are relatively plentiful, and exhilirating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting as usual...","review":"Patricia Highsmith's character Tom Ripley is one of the most interesting to follow. His growth from one novel to the next is fascinating and every time you think he's going one way, he goes another.In this novel, Ripley tackles the Mafia, with intersting results. He crosses the Mafia through Jonathan, a man who had spited him, and Tom pays back as only Tom (psychopath that he is) can.The novel is intersting, full of detail and exquisitely crafted. It is also a novel for the patient, as the pace, and the setting, is completely European.Reccommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clown wig","review":"I bought this for a disco costume, it looks more like a clown wig, it is white and didn't glow in the dark =("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality","review":"This wig looks extremely matted and ragged.

We meet our protagonist, who edits the student newspaper and is apparently irristible to co-eds. His paper has uncovered a financial scandal involving the college president.So far so good. Then everything changes. Apparently the world is being taken over by mutant ninja turtles seeking to turn back creation and bring into existence a new universe in which we all have eternal life. Or something like that.To tell the truth, I couldn't make head or tale of the plot from that point on and quickly lost interest. Who are these turtles? Who cares. I felt like the army officer who used to appear in Monty Python sketches saying \\"too silly, too silly.\\"Oh and the book has some pretty nasty sex as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written Twaddle; Leaves Reader Curiously Dispirited.","review":"The plot is a gloss on a silly time travel/transcendence of Universe theme; a half-smart quasi-Buddhist shtick that leaves one feeling empty and cheated when the story finally unfolds. Along the way we get some generic and purposeless sex, and a story that is supposed to be mysterious and edgy. I give the book a second star because the author writes well, and phrases his silly plot in good style. Perhaps a good rule for science fiction that dips into quasi-crystal channeling mysticism might be to embrace some final meaning, either dark or light. This book leaves one muddled and unhappy, not thoughtful or uplifted.

My only thought was there was no way losing weight was worth never seeing my kids again. After about 2 hours the welts disappeared but I felt horrible for the rest of the day. Obviously there is something in it that doesn't get along with my body but after that reaction I had I have decided that no diet pill is worth the chance of what can happen to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work for me, useless","review":"I used this for 2 months, nothing happened I did exercise as well.

Try starting to lose weight with something else. I'll tell you why.I personally need to lose over 50 lbs, I started with this, and have lost NO WEIGHT!!! Maybe for some people it does work, but not for me. I didnt exercise with it so maybe thats why it didnt work, thats why I gave it two stars.But the REAL POINT of my review, is that they specifically say to take these and you dont need diet and exercise, well they are totally MISLEADING!! I guess I should have used COMMON SENSE to realize you always need diet and exercise to lose weight.But I might go try XENADRINE!! Cause I have used that in the past and lost over 35lbs, I will go with what I know works."},{"rating":"1","title":"These pills almost killed me!!!!!!","review":"These pills literally almost killed me.

With moderate exsercise and diet he lost 30 pounds in a month. 6 months later he is still carring a healthy life style and has reduced his taking if this pill to once a day and has managed to keep his weight off.

Within fifteen minutes I was nauseated, had the shakes, a headache, and a stomachache for the rest of the day. The next day I took only one pill before breakfast and still felt sick the entire day. There is hardcore caffeine in these that leaves you feeling dope sick even after you stop taking it. I had fitful sleep when I finally did fall asleep, even though I hadn't taken a pill in over ten hours. The prospect of losing fifteen pounds in two weeks does not outweigh how horrible you feel while you're taking the pill."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEIZURES!!! - BEWARE!!!","review":"My husband took this as directed for \\"1\\" day and at 1:00 am that night he had a very bad Grand Mal Seizure.He had never had any type of seizure before and was rushed via ambulance to the hospital. I thought he was dying in front of my eyes, after the seizure, he was choking for air unconsiously on foam and blood that was in his mouth. Several minutes afterwards he could not talk and did not know what was going on. His speech was like that of a stroke victim. Finally he was able to speak but then did not know where he was or what day it was. The paramedics and fire dept were there by then. All of his blood tests, ekg, blood pressure and blood sugar tests perfomed while in the ER were perfectly normal, we were told it was the Zantrex - 3..Please protect your loved ones and do not take a chance with your life over this product.

I started taking the recommended dosage a day and my heart was palpitating like CRAZY; To the point that while I was CASUALLY walking, I had to stop and hold my chest.--a HUGE red flag. I suddenly knew why she lost weight--it was because of the nausea. I felt nauseous almost all the time on Zantrex. I could not look at food without feeling like crap and whenever I did indeed eat, I felt even worse. Did I lose weight? YES!

Took 2 pills with tons of water before first meal, felt light headed and a little shaky. My day goes on. I decide to take one more capsule, the bottle says you can have up to six. I felt like my stomach was ripping apart inside. My entire body shook, andy husband was convinced I was on cocaine. After hours of the most uncomfortable nausea and shakes I finally managed to sleep. Worst of all I was not smart enoug to think those pills could possibly have had this much of an effect so I took them the next day. Same miserable side effects. Never again.

Big Mistake! I started these on the weekend and they made me ridiculously weak. I could not eat anything because I had no appetite whatsoever and had very intense stomach pain. Basically I spent those two days curled up on the couch because I was extremely weak. I almost passed out when I got up to go to the bathroom and my heart was pounding so hard I literally thought I was dieing. These also made me very paranoid and emotional. I lost 2 lbs from not eating but gained it back as soon as I got off the pill. Be smart and use diet, exercise and try drinking herbal teas. DO NOT buy these unless you enjoy throwing your money away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scare of a lifetime.","review":"I took this product after a friend of mine and I were talking about weight lose methods of the stars (article she read) She thought it was an ad.

I took some benedryl for the itch and redness and tylenol for the headache. I felt bad for 2 days. I do NOT recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many jitters","review":"I have found another product that I want to recommend. It's called Alert and is sold by consultants like Avon, but you can also go the Starlight website and order it. It's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters, and as a bonus I don't feel hungry when I'm using it. They also have a product specifically for weight loss. I have tried that as well. I did feel a bit jittery at first... but it settled after a week or so of taking it. I would recommend it also. I used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs. I did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss, but I credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings.I'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what I need ... energy and hunger control and it's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so I now use it. I've used this for years and have not had any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T WORK","review":"I've tried this product with diet and excercise and it didn't do nothing at all,as all the products from this manufacturer, doesn't work! don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"??","review":"Really didn't do anything for me.

But when I came down, I basically crashed.During the two weeks I took the pills I did not see any weight loss results, but around 7pm at night, I would feel jittery, like I wanted to crawl out of my skin.

It's not a miracle pill, it doesn't melt fat, it gives you the energy to do what's necessary to burn the calories quicker than if you had little or no energy. It's not for everyone, but for those who do not suffer side effects, its a great energy boost. The first night I had trouble sleeping, but after that, I worked out so hard at the gym, I had no choice but to fall into bed tired at the end of the day and sleep like a baby.I'm very happy with the weight lost results in the first week; 3 lbs.

I've only ever heard of Jan Cyrka before and I believe he's of Slavonic descent. Anyway, the music on this album is amazing. There's a certain spacey feel to it and the guitar playing is a little unusual, at least to my ears. Too bad this is the only instrumental CD Dave Sharman's released. He has released three other albums with vocals that I'm considering getting a hold of. The music is overall very atmospheric and a joy to the ear. The virtuosity is controlled and definitely not what many would consider shred. He's not Joe Satriani either despite the spacey feel of the album. He's an original in my book. Only the song Pandora's Box annoyed me a little due to the extreme repetitiveness of the simple tune. Otherwise all the songs connected with me, including the last song where he used a brass band in the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Ordered this as present for my boyfriend, its absolutely stunning.

Go read A CONTRACT WITH GOD, WATCHMEN, BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, MAUS, DAVID BORING, JIMMY CORRIGAN THE SMARTEST KID ON EARTH, and most importantly UNDERSTANDING COMICS.

The first system I got had a problem reading DVD's, I returned it to Target and exchanged it for another one. The base amplifier then started making noise. It is the fan in the amplifier at the base of the unit. Philips offered to fix it, but won't pay for shipping, which is roughly half of what the unit costs, so I lived with it. Now after owning it a year and a half the DVD player is acting up just as the first one did. It will spin a DVD and not recognize it, but it will play CD's. I don't think I'll be buying anymore Philips products. This is obviously an internal problem because it sounds like others have had this problem and there was no recall or notification to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reliability","review":"The system worked well for about a year but then developed an annoying noise from the cooling fan in the amplifier unit, similar to what other reviewers have described.

Alas, the second system lasted 7 months before it started making an amazingly loud grinding noise in the base unit (NOT the dvd player). Unfortunately my only recourse now is to send it back to Philips who 1)won't pay the shipping 2)can not guaratee that I will get a new product in return 3) will not extend the warranty on the 3rd replacement unit.

Mr. Mandel's love of the Big Sur coast is beautifuly realized here in his score for The Sandpiper. The colors of the music are so painterly in their layering and execution that they stay with the listener long after the CD has ended. Cool and rich, this jazz inspired music is as intoxicating as a slow drive down Highway One to the Nepenthe. Not to be overlooked are Jack Sheldon's romantic trumpet solos. His contribution is the soulful heart of this soundtrack. Many thanks to Verve for reissuing this wonderful 60's masterpiece. Finally, one cannot help but wonder if \\"The Shadow Of Your Smile\\" holds a special place in Elizabeth Taylor's heart. Memories of a beautiful place along the windswept California Coast and the begining of her married life with Richard Burton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Name Is............","review":"Great music that makes you want to dance.

Jon doesn't sing on this cd, he just screams. If I wanted to hear someone scream at me I'd stand in the middle of the street in NY somewhere. Every members solo stuff in now or out of Sav I have enjoyed from TSO, CTC, CC, and the new jazz sounding band formed with Middleton, Al, Al's wife but this is just awful stuff.

Oliva, \\"A Night At The Opera\\" kind of stuff. I don't like this direction at all. It's not Heavy Metal, and when I think of Savatage or J.

As wonderful and amusing it may be for some (they have a rigth to an opinion of course) this belongs to another league. Maybe a better one for some, but boring, slow and dull to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"An original","review":"A forerunner of the modern-day mystery novel, The Secret Agent is an important book and also a truly suspenseful story. Verloc is exceptionally well characterized, and Conrad's attempts to politicize a relatively unimportant event (the attempted bombing of the Greenwich observatory by a little-known anarchist) succeed exceedingly well. A good rainy-day book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another edition!","review":"Wanting to re-read this modern classic after some decades, in the course of a second visit to Conrad's writing, I made the mistake to buy this Signet edition.Don't do that! It sucks. The print is compact and the letters too small. It has no explanatory notes, which would be important for this kind of book. It is a punishment to read this.Stay away from this edition and buy the Oxford World Classics pocket book instead.I will review that shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politics is besides the point","review":"You know this isn't a political piece right on page one when Conrad nicely suggests (with tongue-in-cheek Victorian-era delicacy) that the key business of his seedy little \\"double agent\\" is really just selling diry postcards to pervy men in raincoats. Verloc is sucked into this bombing plot solely because it has been so long since he has gathered any useful information for the foreign embassy paying him off. Although Nabokov would have sneered at being compared to another writer, this novel (by another master prose stylist who came to English as a second language) surely anticipates Nabokov's ouevre with its mounting pattern of bitter ironies. The Secret Agent is a very funny book, and really Conrad's only work I admire unhesitatingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joesph Conrad's Secret Agent","review":"The Secret Agent has a narrative form with richly described and very intriguing characters. For instance the very first few pages describe Mr. Verloc and his shop. Conrad uses well placed words to accurately paint images in the reader's mind of the indifferent Mr. Verloc, his lovely and buxom wife Winnie and her \\"slow\\" brother. Conrad also raises suspicion within the readers minds with his references to the men in the trench coats who walk in and out of the shop in the evenings when the shop door is suspiciously left ajar. Conrad's themes in this book were the alienation of the citizens from the city and the breakdown of communication between the charcters. Each theme was very well communicated and clearly stated. This book provides an interesting read for almost anyone who decides to pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Lovers of Characterisation, Dickens, and Dostoyevsky","review":"The Secret Agent will appeal to anyone who likes Dickens' satire of Victorian society and its members, and to those who like the revolutionaries scattered throughout the works of Dostoyevsky. Only that Conrad is far more biting in his portrait of Victorian England than Dickens ever was, and even his characterisation is comparable if not superior at points. No one could ever forget, for example, Sir Ethelred, who 'opened a wide mouth, like a cavern, into which the hooked nose seemed anxious to peer'. But Conrad's revolutionaries do not quite topple those of Dostoyevsky (an obvious influence on Conrad despite Conrad's apparent dislike of the Russian). The novel is (thus) primarily character driven; the central idea of the story (the bombing attempt) is so amazingly simple that one almost misses it. The prose is dense and I would not recommend it either as light reading or to Samuel Johnson's 'common reader'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! The book is so slow, and it drags on and on.","review":"I was taught not to judge a book that has been a top literature for the last century. There must be something everybody else find that I don't. But I read this book as a group for a literature class. The book was so descriptive, everything juss drags on and on. I fell asleep a couple times. I totally don't recommend this! None of my group member would either. Save yourself sometimes reading better books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you like your books long and exhausting....","review":"....skip this one. Conrad takes perverse pleasure in his chapter-long descriptions and flowery phrases. The plot makes some guest appearances, but not many. Trust me, there's better use for your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain confusing","review":"Have you ever listened to a conversation and had no idea who or what the people are talking about? This is the feeling i got from this book. The complete frustration of not QUITE understanding who was who, or what was going on. Conrad's style of language really doens't help matters. Some classic books get better with time (Great Expectations, for example) but this just seems dated and from another, rather confusing period of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stylist","review":"Conrad has an absolutely marvelous prose style (although sometimes dense) and his narrative skills are of the highest order. Technically this novel is brilliant; not a single line in it is muddled. Every character was sharply crafted and London has never been more vividly described. I have often heard Hemingway labeled as the century's first great prose stylist, but how could anyone forget Conrad? The only flaw with this book to me was the overuse of foreshadowing; too much was given away too early in the story only to be revealed much later when the reader's patience may have already been exhausted and leading to a winded effect; but the flaws are inconsequential considering Conrad's accomplishment. Many reviewers here claim this book was boring but I think they only need read Conrad's prose slowly, savor and visualize it, and realize it is one of the great works of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will not dissapoint you.","review":"Its important to remember, that the novel is written at a time when democracy is not exactly well spread through Europe, and most of the continental countries are having a hard time trying to understand why the English shelter anarchists and Marxists and even allow them to publish their works.No doubt that Conrad met a few of them in literary or social circles and found them amusing in their contradictions. That is why the \\"criminal mastermind\\" Mr. Verloc is portrayed more as a very lazy bourgeois than someone whose mind is set upon creating the conditions to change society.On the other hand, Conrad is faithful to its belief on the perennial existence if not preeminence, of a dark side of the soul in everyone. So the atmosphere in which every character dwells is gloomy, sad and purposefully shows that no motivation is really beyond a person's self interest, even if you claim that you are doing it for God and country, to save the planet or your mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent novel; but not for everyone","review":"Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent, is one of my favorite books because it has a great plot, a fascinating ending, and skillful characterization. However, the vocabulary is advanced, which may make the plotline seem tangled and obscure. I would advise that you keep a dictionary by your side, both to understand all the details and subtleties of the story and to learn a lot of new words. That being said, a lot of people will find this novel too slow and boring. Unfortunately, many people today are too lazy to know their language to the full extent that Conrad did. And just think--English was his second language! But anyway, if you're up for a challenging but richly rewarding read, check out The Secret Agent. Unless you get bored by good writing, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of its time","review":"Joseph Conrad's \\"The Secret Agent\\" is a very different type of novel from most everything else Conrad wrote. It's a spy novel and set in England, not at sea, like so many other Conrad works, or in a tropical climate. I have read that Conrad says the novel is about Winnie Verloc, the wife of the secret agent, Mr. Verloc. I have to agree. She's the most interesting character in the novel in my opinion and probably the only one that people can sympathize with, other than her brother Stevie. The story is interesting, but you have to be patient because it jumps around alot, and as with many other Conrad novels, there's so much description between the dialogue and action. Overall, it's a very good spy/action novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"At first I thought this was a serious book about Anarchist revolutionaries, and Verloc's duties as a secret agent. Then it all goes wrong and you realize that the whole book, about 200 pages of reading was all kind of a big joke on Mr.Verloc, and anarchists in general. Its worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So slow! It's so descriptive that I fell asleep","review":"This book is so descriptive that you would fall asleep reading. Everything drags on and on. As a high school student, I wouldn't recommend it. Even though my teacher taught me not to judge a book that has been admired by people for more than a century, Im gonna say it; It's so boring!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book. Conrad fails in this genre.","review":"Who would have thought the author of Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim could write such a weak novel? Unless you have to read all of Conrad's work stick to his better known and far better works"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit pants really","review":"Most Victorian novels seem to maintain a certain charm, even if they do not retain any real relevence to today's society. This book, written with the intention of shocking early 20th century Britain, has no charm whatsoever. It does not make up for it in relevence either. In fact I do not believe this story has ever held any relevence to anyone, anywhere.It is a short, clumsy attempt of a story about anarchists and their attempts to upset the establishment. The bomb attack goes wrong and everyone thinks twice about the use of force. Nothing else really happens.It is simply terrible. Thank God it is little more than a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Book","review":"I love to read sonnets, and this is a book of sonnets.

Actually they're all bogus. The editor expanded this book into the 'Archko' volume, but was caught because he created some of his 'ancient' documents by copying verbatim from the novel 'Ben Hur'.The motive appears to have been money, and the intended victims rural Christians with no way to check his claims.Full details are available in E.J.Goodspeed's \\"Strange New Gospels\\", which is online. In the late 19th century a fair few people had a go at making money this way, targetting different groups. Mahan's effort is the only one still circulating, but Goodspeed details a collection of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Reference Book","review":"I originally bought this book as a reference when I was taking my FEA graduate school course to supplement some of the concepts, namely tensors.

Or an Algonquin Round table fan. Or an \\"Old Hollywood\\" fan. Anecdotes abound. But woven into the story is that of a diehard Groucho Marx buff who inhabits the tight, peculiar, often sad world of his last few years. Stoliar comes off as a decent guy with his heart in the right place, a relief since Groucho was surrounded by more than a couple of people with selfish ulterior motives towards him in the end. Erin Fleming, Groucho's companion in his last years, is intriguingly revealed as a complex, disturbing madwoman. Painfully sad read, but with the saving graces of humor & insight. Much of this was actually covered in Arthur Marx's book, but check out the different slant! I'm glad I read & own this book. I'll be back at it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improves upon repeated readings","review":"I just re-read this book again recently and it is always compelling, amusing, disturbing, and fascinating. You get to know other aspects of not only Groucho, but Zeppo, Gummo, and various members of Groucho's inner circle, especially the controversial Erin Fleming. Even friends of the author become interesting characters. One of my favorite books about a show business figure, and written with style, wit, clarity, and honesty. I would passionately recommend this to any Marx Brothers fan, especially those of us who recall their resurgence in the late sixties and early seventies, and who celebrated when Steve Stoliar managed to convince Universal to release the elusive Animal Crackers. An absolute must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Stoliar presents a facinating look at Groucho's world","review":"I loved this book! I am a fan , but not fanatic, of the Marx Bros. More so I am a fan of \\"classic\\" Hollywood and comedians in particular. I remember very well seeing old Groucho on a few talk shows in the mid 70's and was greatly saddend by his death in 1977. I was cognicent of what went on in the media before and after his demise, but was unaware of what was really going on within that household. This book lovingly and accuratly details what Groucho's world was like in his waning years. It is sometimes hard to take, but, as in life, there are so many wonderful moments that Steve Stoliar was able to put down on paper. I recommend this book to all who are interested in comediens, The Marx Bros., Groucho or just old Hollywood. You won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House","review":"Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House.Not the best book about Groucho by a long chalk.

His research sheds new light on Nazi Policy in Poland during and after the invasion on 1 September 1939. He clearly shows that the \\"Final Solution\\" was not a systematic plan from the beginning of the war. Although the Nazis carried out operations of murder and oppression, they did not exclusively focus on Jewish citizens of that nation, but rather on all Poles in general. Anyone who is a student of World War II must have this book in order to understand the war in Poland and how Hitler began his conquest of Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to Poles who fought back","review":"I found the book extremely disappointing and insulting to the Poles. The author states that Polish civilians might have brought the German retaliation on themselves because they essentially tried to fight back. What a ridiculous conclusion! Thanks to their British and French allies who did not honor their comments to assist, the Poles had to fight back any way they could. Hitler made no secret of his desire to wipe out the Poles. The Poles had no intention of rolling over and capitulating to the Germans (as the French subsequently did). The author's portrayal of ethnic Germans in Poland also leaves a lot to be desired. Their treatment of their Polish nieghbors was also horrific. Better accounts can be found in Lucas' \\"Forgotten Holocaust\\" and Piotrowski's \\"Poland's Holocaust\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality picture","review":"This cable produces a very poor quality picture.

Then I used this cable to run the video and audio from the DVR to a monitor conveniently located on my desk.

Sean Young plays a chef (who doesn't know how to cut vegetables) who is trying to \\"find herself\\" by experimenting with sex and relationships. She is torn between her older boss (John Heard) and a young politically active photographer (the very likeable Richard Hillman). This situation is not very compelling and the movie has nothing new to say.Sean does a pretty good job with the role; however, she is clearly at least ten years too old for such a role and tries to look younger by wearing pigtails and overalls, which is laughable at times. Unfortunately, much of the dialogue and several of the scenes are also unintentionally funny. The only positive aspect of the movie is the use of some great old jazz songs - too bad the soundtrack isn't available.

For starters - it just uses the bread machine as a mixer - it is not anywhere near as easy as using your bread machine to make bread. So the title can be misleading. And as another reviewer said - it isn't for dogs with allergies. That was the whole point of me baking my own - to provide my dog with treats that he can't have otherwise because of his allergies. And the book is just too scatchy on the details. It doesn't tell you for each recipe how dark the treats should be when done - so you don't know if they are raw or burnt.

I have to say that this book would definitely win my award for the 'dumbest recipe titles ever' going way beyond 'cute' and moving into truly 'stupid'. However, the recipes themselves are excellent! I always use my bread machine for mixing even when I bake bread so using it to mix the dog biscuits is very easy. The recipes are very creative.

A Romance of Two Worlds was her first novel, written in 1886, and one of her best. A strange mix of Victorian romanticism, science, spirituality, and feminism, the book details a turning point in the life of a female piano improviser (!) as she discovers occult knowledge from a Chaldean mystic and his beautiful, innocent sister. Though the book is thoroughly dated by now, it gains rather than looses charm from the cultural distance it evokes. This book may have also been an inspiration for the legendary Jazz artist, Sun Ra, who named a composition \\"Romance of Two Planets\\", and who would have found much to like about Corelli."},{"rating":"1","title":"a romance of tow world","review":"i had a hard time getting interested in this store. not sure if it was the writting or story. it was slow start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance?","review":"I gave this book only one star, because not giving a star was not an option.

Two long wood screws are furnished to mount the hanger on studs 16\\" apart. This is an easy installation process which would be even simpler if you were to bore a small pilot hole before driving the screws.I took away one star because the screw holes in the hanger are very small and there are only two of them. This limits the amount of weight that this hanger could accomodate. A second set of holes could easily have been provided to increase the weight capability and to provide more firmness to the mount. However, for hanging reasonably light items such as a six foot ladder, for example, this will sufffice.This product was made in China.

Having heard a great deal about \\"The Lover,\\" also by Duras, I decided that at a mere 60+ pages and at a ridiculously low price, there was little to lose. I found myself reading it and re-reading it. There isn't much to the story, nor is it much of one. However, this is not so much a case of what is written as much as how it is written. Duras language is extremely poetic with an ever present sense of longing and sorrow. The lyrical quality in her writing is absolutely magical. The simple story of someone paying for companionship, intimacy and, ultimately, sex because of his inability to love is hardly a groundbreaking premise, but, again, its worth and beauty lie in how it is communicated and the sensation you experience in its wake. Very beautiful, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Significantly Not as Described","review":"This item requires four coin cell batteries LR44, and not just one standard AAA battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This woman acts and thinks like a child. Understandably, her upbringing was not \\"normal\\" in the everyday sense, but being of Japanese ancestry, I was annoyed by her large ego and her cease-less bragging about herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing, entertaining, enlightening","review":"Enjoyable and interesting, this book is far better than the fictionalized MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and puts to rest the false notion that geisha are high-class call girls. (They're not.) Anyone with an interest in Japan, Japanese culture, geisha, or the arts would appreciate this work. Ms. Iwasaki was privileged to live an extraordinary (if demanding) life, meeting the likes of Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth among other dignitaries (whom she fails to honor, however) and she tells her story with good explanations throughout. One gets the feeling that she never quite understands how privileged she was; especially when, at the height of her popularity, she closes the okiya that was put into her care. Nevertheless, it's a detailed account of her experiences, especially the demanding nature of the profession, and on that account is a valuable contribution to \\"geisha-related\\" literature. My copy included pictures, some in color, which are very enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Memior","review":"I found much joy in reading this book, if you love history and art, this is a easy read and very educational, a wonderful story lined biography. What a life to have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego, ego and more ego...","review":"While true, this book is at a distinct disadvantage if you've come to it by way of reading Memoirs of a Geisha (as I had), in of itself it is a still a poorly written book by an author who is so completed enamored with herself that it makes for a pretty nauseating read. The warning lights went off when she describes her environment in great detail when she is simply a toddler. From that point forward, she paints herself in the best light possible, while taking cheap shots at most members of her family. If this woman could think of more ways to say \\"I'm wonderful, incredibly talented, insightful and amazing\\", I'm sure she would have. She must have very long arms to continually pat herself on the back as much as she does. Save yourself the time. This book did not offer the insights into the world of maiko and geisha as promised. Frankly, after a few pages into it, I simply didn't believe a great deal of what she wrote. It felt like contrived propoganda from a former diva."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a 0 if possible","review":"I waited so long to read this book, and hated it after the first page.

Well sadly, I was very dissapointed. It was a very easy read but so boring that it ccould not hold my attention. I actaully read a few books inbetween. As far as writing styles goes, it felt like it was written by a child. Although she was an adult at the time of writing this book ,it still seems to be told through thte eyes of a 5 year old.

If you are under the age of 12 you may enjoy it. i think I will take the fictious verion over this one any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking and skewed","review":"To be honest, I was expecting more of this book. When I first picked it up at the library, it was out of curiosity (as I noticed that it had been connected to both Arthur Golden's fictional book as well as Liza Dalby's book).Overall...this book is dry and quite, quite horrible. The story telling is lacking, Mineko's portrayal of herself is bad and unbelievable, and she refutes certain things that several other authors, who researched more than one geisha life, had cited as true. It all but admits to exaggeration, bias, and inaccuracy.Then again, it is a biography, and nobody should expect it to be as accurate throughout as researched, historical material."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ ME URGENTLY","review":"I ordered this book, but I did not notice that the shipping and handeling was $35.99. I sent them a cancellation e-mail BEFORE it shipped (about 2 days before it shipped) hoping that they would cancel it. So two days passed, and they finally replied WHEN IT SHIPPED indicating that it could not be cancelled due to the fact that it shipped, it's like they wated until it shipped to reply to me.

The 1st hand experience of someone that had lived the Geisha life style. I really appreciateded it. I would read it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Rated","review":"Although an interesting read, the autobiography lacks any real flow. The author jumps so often from one time period or story to another that you always wonder where you are in the time line.Also the author seems in such a rush to put down any suggestion of sexual undertones in the society, that it becomes over done. On the other hand she admits to an affair with a married man as normal.All through the author uses a snobbish tone and that is rather off putting. Also I think that claiming to remember in perfact clairity events from the age of two and three a bit crazy.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Read","review":"This is the ultimate book you should consider when trying to get a first hand account the details of a life of a Geisha.Mineko Iwasaki is highly respected and is referred as one of the best Geisha to ever come along in her generation.This book was interesting and exciting to read.If you have read Memiors of a Geisha, you will know that Mineko's story greatly contributed to Golden's novel. Now see what it is really like to be a Geisha by reading Mineko's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious","review":"In the beginning, this book appeared promising. I had never understood the geisha concept and was eager to find out more. Even after reading the entire book, I'm not sure that I am any further enlightened. Also, Mineko, the geisha, was and is shallow and selfish and self-aggrandizing. Her \\"character\\" (in a book that is touted as non-fiction) rang quite false. I had the sense that the story was crafted by a poor fiction writer. I rated the book 2 stars (instead of one) because I was able to tolerate it until the end, but my advise to you is DON'T BOTHER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geisha - An account of the life of a Geisha","review":"A very interesting account of the life of a Geisha in Japan in the late 1900's . Very interesting and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"Not even in the same league as 'Memoirs of a Geisha'. In fact I was shocked that she was a source of information for 'Memoirs'. This book was mechanical, uninteresting. It did not hold my attention. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself!","review":"Ugh! This book is only worthwhile if you worship Ms. Iwasaki as much as she does. The woman is so taken with herself that she becomes angered when Prince Charles dares to deface (her word) her fan with his autograph.Much of her portrayal of daily life seems hardly believable in its fairy tale like contrasts between the good Ms. Iwasaki and the evil geiko who apparently couldn't tolerate her perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragedy that so many readers are so lost","review":"It's funny and sad how many reviewers are comparing this book to Golden's trite example, claiming it to be less beautifully written and not as exciting. I hate to break it to you, but Golden is a middle-aged man from New England writing about a teenaged Geisha during WWII. The only thing he's got going for him is his flowery language seeing as his accounts of the Geisha are completely INNACCURATE! His fluffy book offended me. \\"Geisha: A Life\\" is at least a first hand account, and it is not necessary to pump it up due to historical accuracy. These books are in two completely different categories. To compare them would be like measuring Danielle Steele against Stephen Hawking.\\"Geisha: A Life\\" is appropriate retribution for the damage that Golden did with his mid-century soap opera trash. I enjoyed this book because the author tells it like it is, and apologizes for nothing. Now that is courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down","review":"Geisha have always been fascinating, mostly I believe, because they are so mysterious to us Westerners. Prepare to be demystified. Golden's 'Memoirs' was like another reviewer wrote, an excellent book, but still a fairytale - a bittersweet Japanese Cinderella. This book, by contrast, was written by an actual Geisha living her own real life rags to riches story. Though we might envy her glamorous lifestyle and beautiful clothes, we sympathize with her heartbreak, rejoice in her victories, and otherwise come to care about Mineko. She is simultaneously innocent and worldly, childlike and alluring. She was the top Geiko of her era and extremely privileged. While not as dramatic as Memoirs, I enjoyed this book much more - mainly because I felt it was more accuracy and less artistic license."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Delivers With a Fascinating Life Story","review":"As many people seem to have done, I found this book after reading Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden (which I loved, by the way.) I was hoping for an interesting, true look inside the world of the Kyoto geishas and got exactly that. Iwasaki provides a great deal of insight onto certain traditions as well as personal commentary and thoughts about the way the society works. She also includes many entertaining anecdotes, made all the better by virtue of being true. This is really a fabulous book, and one of the best autobiographies I've had the pleasure of reading in a long time.I noticed someone else mentioned some surprisingly blatant editing errors, and I saw them too. They seem to be mistakes made in translation that were overlooked in the editing process. I wouldn't let them stop me from reading though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I read this book a few months ago and was very disappointed. I had read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" several years ago, while living in Japan and really enjoyed it - I thought this book might be similar. Not only is it very poorly written, the author comes across as arrogant and ignorant at the same time. Arrogance isn't a compelling characteristic in any culture, but it's particularly undesirable in Japanese culture. I kept reading though, expecting the book to get better - it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the magic...","review":"I read Memoirs of a Geisha like so many reviewers here and wanted to know more about Geihsa. This book feels more like a history book, the narration is dry and choppy no much feeling into it. The story of a little spoiled girl who was able to make her own decision when she was 5 years old. Not my favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive book on Geisha life!","review":"I read this book and thoroughly loved it! What a life! I deliberately took my time reading it because I did not want it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. no No no NO","review":"Boring is the word to describe this book. After reading Arthur Golden's Memoir of a Geisha, this book does not even begin to compare with it.

I was led to this particular book through reading the author's daily webcolumn.Some martial arts books have a lot of rambling or clicheed \\"filler\\" in them. On the contrary, these essays are generally very clear and focused, and betray the author's wealth of knowledge and experience. For example, it is very fashionable to speak about zen in martial arts texts, and throw around terms like \\"mushin\\". But unlike most of those texts, this book is actually written by someone who is expert in both zen and budo. As a result, the comparisons he makes are far more lucid, interesting, and (in my experience) applicable.I encourage you to read this book. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book by a great martial artist","review":"This book provides a terrific source of information to those who have taken the time to study the martial arts thoroughly. Finally a book that looks at the traditional martial arts from a traditional view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primer on being truly human","review":"Of all the hundreds of martial arts books I own, I keep coming back to this one. There is so much depth that several readings just won't do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kodo Ancient Ways","review":"This is a superb book written with great insight and a must read as an aid to training, regardless of style, for the serious martial artist. I have purchased about thirty copies over the years, to give away to friends who are mostly non-martial artists. It is one of two books which I think can offer profound influence on one's life and art, the other is Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke. If you train seriously in martial arts, buy two copies of Kodo, because you will probably wear one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happens after mastery? Now we know!","review":"It is uncommon to meet a true martial arts master, and even more uncommon to meet a Zen master. To encounter someone who is arguably qualified to be both is truly to be in rarefied company. To ask a rhetorical question, if Kensho Furuya is not such a master, then who is? If one takes seriously the ideas in this book, then it might change your life. For martial artists in training and for aspirants to the Zen mind, KODO is a blessing twice received. I, too, am grateful for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"I am surprised by all pevious happy customers giving away 5 stars for Mr. Furuya's brain child. Apart for numerous historic anecdotes, the prevailing theme of Mr. Furuya's writings is how good students were 300 years ago in Zen monasteries and how stinking bad his own students are. Aparently his dojo is filled with lazy people who are not too well versed in Zen lore and norms of behaviour expected from monastery acolyte. So, Mr. Furuya loses no time complaining about their insolent behaviour and their total failure to live up to his expectations.Also, keep in mind that this book is essentially the compilations of articles that appeared in different magazines at different times, but since Mr. Furuya's mood has not improved, expect the repetition of the same stories and the same complains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodo Ancient Ways ?","review":"I am sorry but this is one load of contrived baloney.No, its not 300 years ago and if Mr. Furuya was in search of the way, it cant be found writing books about yourself. This is modern society and when you stoop to accept money from a student, then you are in business. When you spend your time buying and selling stuff on Ebay you lose your credibility of a lone monk, practicing martial arts in search of some lost meaning.I refuse to listen to someone who takes money and then complains that he is treated like a shopkeeper.I also refuse to believe most ordained shinto priests spend their time on Ebay ?

Other reviews (elsewhere) indicate that it won't play on all CD players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for some","review":"I loved this soundtrack, mostly because I love the movie. Fred Astaire gives Gershwin's songs his usual warm style and Hepburn delights with her soft unique vocals; however, this cd may not be the best choice for everyone seeking songs from Funny Face. The clips of dialogue, which do display the experience of the film, also take away from the cd's music listening aspect. It helps tell the story, but takes away from the listening enjoyment of the common listener. If you don't mind dialogue in your music, like me, then this is for you. If not try getting a cd with Funny Face's wonderful songs on it. There are many cds with such songs sung by Fred Astaire and his sister Adele from the production of Funny Face they were in on Broadway during the 1920's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally enjoyable","review":"I got this record in 1963 and wore the thing out.

Good Sunday music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gershwin and Astaire","review":"Gershwin and Astaire. What's not to like about that? If you've seen the movie, then you'll appreciate this soundtrack more. Is it the best ST ever? No, but far from the worst. Like the movie, good, not great. Just to hear Fred Astaire is always a treat. Astaire was always the composer's favorite. He was described as signing the songs the way the composer wanted them sung. Audrey Hepburn does her own singing and it seems to be an effort for her, but she somehow manages. For me this ST, like the movie, doesn't quite measure up. Sound quality is so, so. Still, Gershwin, Astaire. Well, it gets a four from me just for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"AC78 Review","review":"Well made,rugged,Breaks down for storage,installs in seconds but can jam on the ladder if you put any weight directly on the stabilizer (which they tell you not to do ) I would recomend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prefer the U-bolt type (smaller and lighter)","review":"The two disadvantages are (1) it's heavier than the traditional U-bolt type and (2) it takes two rungs instead of only one, forcing the ladder to be longer when fully compressed. So when you're trying to place the ladder upright, it's top heavy and longer.For my heavy Type I 32 foot extension ladder, I cannot handle it alone with this quick-click stabilizer. I got the U-bolt type instead. That works better for me, and it costs less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SAFE AS ADVERTISED","review":"Werner AC78 Quickclick StabilizerThis product was delivered promptly and in good condition. When I opened the outer cartoon and started reading the instructions, the first thing I saw was this is to be used on Werner Ladders only and be used on top step only. My plan was to put it on the roof in order to clean my gutters as advertised on Amazon. When I tried to do this the attachment touched the gutter. I called Werner Co. and they told me that the Werner AC78 CANNOT be used on the roof. It has no OSHA and ANSI certification like the other stand off. I will return this and order the other one before someone borrows it and kills them selves. This product may be good on a wall but due to space limitations in my garage I will only keep one tool that works for everything I need it to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to go on & Easy to fall off too!","review":"I bought this product several years ago from Sears and was using it on a 32-ft 2-piece fiberglass ladder that I had also installed the Werner leveler to it. As I was struggling with the monster that I had created, the Quick Click Stabilizer fell off from high up on me and deeply cut my arm. I still have the scar after maybe 4 or 5 years. I am lucky that it did not hit me in the head. Again the idea is good but don't over do it like I did. Use it on shorter ladders that you can handle easily and be careful, wear hard hat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickclick Stabilizer - can be dangerous","review":"The quickclick stabilizer is not as handy as one would think. Yes, it is easy to take off and put on, but when you have a variety of extension ladder heights that you are adjusting your ladder to, it is easy to forget that the quickclick stabilizer limits the ability of the extension ladder to be placed at its shortest length. If you are not careful, when the extension ladder is placed at its quickclick impaired shortest length the quickclick stabilizer safety pin is what the ladder is supported on. If the pin should break (and it is a only a 1/8th inch diameter pin), the ladder will drop down to its true shortest length and the quickclick stabilizer will come off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the savings","review":"This ad claims you will save 58.00 but when you look it up at most hardware stores like lowes for instance they are only 42.00 there so where are they sold for 100.00 at?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stabilizes but Doesn't Avoid Gutter","review":"This is a good product for stabilization but it dosn't set youout far enough from the house to avoid the gutter as I had hoped. I was trying to keep from crushing gutters but this didn't help that. You almost have to have a ladder leveler on the bottom whem using this too, there's no cheating a small angle, but, its not really safe to do that anyway. It goes on and comes off very fast and easy, I work alone and have no problem, much easier than I expected. I was very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"works on 20 year-old Werner ladder","review":"My 20 foot extension ladder (200lb rating red tips) works fine with this stabilizer. The two standoff \\"arms\\" can also be easily removed although the only purpose seems to be to allow a smaller shipping box. It would be nice if the \\"arms\\" were reversible for a deeper but narrower configuration but that is not possible. A commercial stabilizer I rented earlier had longer standoff sections that allowed me to place a small platform on them to do some roof repairs. This Werner stabilizer is too small and it has warnings to not add any work platform on top of the standoffs. I also ordered the Level-Ett feet stabilizers and togther with the top end stabilizer the ladder is now a lot safer to use for tree triming and home repairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to remove top section for it to work on MT-22","review":"I have an MT-22 and in order to attach the stabilizer, I have to remove the top (extendable) section of the ladder. Kinda sucks because you loose like 5 feet of ladder height. Werner could have come up with a much better design; like add a bend to the design of the stabilizer arms so they can clear the thicker upper-section of the MT-22."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Werner Ladder","review":"I bought this as a bundle with a Werner ladder. The Werner ladder has the extension on top. So that reduces the standoff to 6 inches. But the worst part is the lower bracket jams against the highest rung of the lower extension and was very hard to un-jam. This jammed so hard it bent the lower bracket. I'm going to return it.I do not recommend this product with this type of ladder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying my second one.","review":"I already had one of these and since I'm now getting a whole ladder jack setup along with a second ladder, I definitely wanted one of these to go along with it. I'm sure they wouldn't recommend what I'm about to say for safety reasons, but I would point out that this item can make an aluminum extension ladder a lot more stable on slightly uneven ground. Because of the broad spread, the ladder will twist slightly to make up the difference and it's really solid!This thing goes on or off in 5 seconds. No way would I ever get one of those bolt on kind. The cam action that holds it to the ladder looked a little iffy when I first saw it, but if you examine it you'll see that it's very well designed and I don't think you'll ever have a problem with it. I haven't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company Says Can't Be Used on a Roof","review":"The Amazon review advertises that the feet of the stabilizer can be placed on the roof. However, when I tried to do exactly that, the stabilizer was tilted at the wrong angle. I called the Werner company this morning, thinking that I was doing something wrong. I was told by the technical service representative that the stabilizer was not meant to be placed on a rooftop! Who the heck wrote the product description?This may be a good product--I wouldn't know, because I cannot use it for the application for which I bought it--and for which it was advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladder stabilizer","review":"A fine product, well constructed, meets the manufacturer's description and works as it was intended to.The only suggestion I have to improve its usefulness is to provide two hangers instead of one. While painting, for instance, you could swap your pail to the other side while up on the ladder. It also could be advantageous to have two hangers and have a tool or tools on one side and paint or other necessities on the opposite side of the stabilizer. At present, the stabilizer must be partially disassembled on the ground to swap the hanger from one side to the other.Pop"},{"rating":"2","title":"Limits the ladder's minimum hight","review":"Great product but a major pain in a way.... If your extension ladder is closed up to its shortest lenth, you wont be able to use this stand-off. You will have to take it up at least two rungs higher so you can put it on. That's seldom an option for many jobs. It would be perfect if this thing was thin enough so that it would allow it to be used when in the ladder's closed position."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT DESIGN","review":"Very easy to install and remove and holds very well against walls.

The Oxford course also focuses strictly on classical latin, without any reference to ecclesiastical latin-- a major, major drawback, IMO.I wasted over $40 on parts I and II of this Oxford course, good money for mere superficial pamphlets! If your goal is to really learn latin, go with the four volume Henle course (each volume is around 400 pages!-- 300% more pages and 30% cheaper than Oxford! ). There is also an additional _Latin Grammar_ volume that is to be used in conjunction with the four volumes. Henle is a Jesuit philosopher and latinist, and his presentation is solid.

It is very well made, sturdy yet lightweight, buckles easily under the seat, has a reflector and a slotted strap to which I attached a portable tail light. If I had it to do over again, I might have ordered the larger size since the cable lock takes up most of the room, but this one fits really well under the seat and I'm happy with it. An excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Zipper Placement","review":"This product is well constructed, however, I am not impressed with the zipper location. In order for me to open the compartment, I have to loosen the straps on the side because the zipper is pressed against the underside of the seat when the straps are tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good connection...","review":"I like the buckle connection better than the new design. I guess the new design is a bit less prone to theft but any criminal in a rush would just empty the contents. It is not to much effort to take the entire pack with you. I like this product so much that I bought a second one for my other bike. I keep a spare tube, tire levels, 3 CO2's, a mini bike tool, and a inflator. It also has a nice place for some id, first aid, and my insurance card. Just the essientials. The sewn on reflector is a nice detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"the plastic buckle broke when I attached it","review":"the plastic buckles are low quality. one broke when I tried to attach the bag (I wasn't pulling hard!).

Granted, it's usually behind me, but the few times I've noticed, it hadn't been very reflective. And if you get any mud on it, what reflectiveness you had is gone quickly (and this will happen frequently if you don't have guards over your tire).There was some issue with unzipping it since the zipper runs over the top and due to space that sits right under my seat. This is why it's 4 and not 5 stars.All in all, I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect size..","review":"I had a much smaller bag that could barely fit a lever, tube and my CO2 in case I got a flat. I could squeeze my cell phone in in case of emergency but had to really jam it in. This bag is perfect size. Not so big that it that you can tell its there but big enough to hold all of the above and still have room for cell phone and extra pair of socks for rainy rides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the right size!","review":"I love this pack so much I ordered a second for my wife. I keep my tools, CO2, patch kit, spare tube, and have room to spare for my billfold and cell phone. If I zip out the expansion, I have more than enough.

I used it once for about an hour on a rough trail ride with a friend and my cell phone fell out. I realized when my bike tools fell out and made enough noise on the dirt trail to hear. Found the zipper had come opened up. Strangest thing! Back-tracked and found the cell phone and rode out 1/2 mile and the zipper started coming open again! Possibly the design needs a velcro spot to secure the zipper shut. I bought a different design and have had no trouble on several rides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seat bag","review":"I like this bag, for three of our four bikes this bag is perfect.

I needed a pack that would be able to hold the essentials without being huge. The Topeak was the perfect solution.Here's what is in my pack (with the pack expanded):1 - Inflator nozzle2 - CO2 cartridges2 - Tire sticks1 - Spare tube (700x25) in its box1 - Large cellphone (Blackberry Storm)1 - DL & Credit Card1 - Set of car keys1 - Powerbar Gel PackIf I do not bring my cellphone, I can easily close the expansion zipper.This pack holds everything quite nicely and the it is firmly held to the bike. My only concern is that the zipper touches the underside of the seat, making it rather difficult to zip/unzip the pack. Other than that, it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Design flaw for durability","review":"I've been riding with this wedge for less than a year, with about 1,700 miles of use. I researched extensively and was willing to pay a few extra $ for a higher quality product. At first was very happy with the wedge and its size, quality, and feel. I was very disappointed when I noticed a seam coming apart after about 7 months. There is a thin plastic(?) insert in the bag keeping the wedge stiff from the opening along its top that aligns perfectly with the top seam by the opening. The swinging of the wedge that comes from normal riding and hill climbing will cause this stiff insert to rub against this seam breaking it down. Its just a matter of time. 7 months is not what I would consider acceptable product durability. This is my second bad experience with a Topeak product. There won't be any more opportunities for a third."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big medium bag","review":"I got the medium bag, and it is a big medium. And that's without expanding it. I can easly fit a spare tube, patch kit, large multi-tool, tire levers, old sock for emergency chain handling, and still have some room left over for keys and snacks. I really like the way it hugs the contour of the seat post and seat. The strap system snugs it up nicely so it's not bouncing or swaying around when I'm out of the saddle. Typical Topeak high quality construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"good wedge pack","review":"It fits tire changing tools, spare tube, CO2 pump, small allen wrench set and when expanded can also hold my keys and wallet. functions well, easy to adjust and attach, and easy to access while attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topeak Aero Wedge Pack","review":"I got this wedge pack for my husband for his birthday and he loves it.

Had previous experience with Transit and Cannondale branded bags on my mtb, but saw this Topeak bag got great reviews here. I ordered the medium and have it on my CAAD8. I like the expandability feature of the bag for longer trips, but find I use it in the smaller configuration most of the time. I am able to fit a tire lever, patch kit, blinky light, multi-tool, tube, keys, and phone in the bag on the small configuration. With the bag expanded I can add in a first aid kit, sun screen, lube, and some other small items that would be needed on a century ride.Have used this bag for a year now and it still looks brand new. No discernible wear and zippers work great."},{"rating":"2","title":"low profile, fits nice, easy zipper","review":"Needed something low profile for a seat with lots of other stuff hanging off the stem.

I especially like the small belt on the back that allows a red flasher to be attached since I do lots of rides before sunrise. I bought this for my Hybrid bike, but find that the medium is a little too small to fit much other than one tube, a very small patch kit, and tire levers. The heavy duty slime tubes will not fit and allow other things to be stored. I use the old thinner, non slime tube that I replaced as the spare since they deflate well and can be folded more compactly and allow other items in the pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!","review":"MY HUSBAND GOT ME THIS WATCH SINCE I HAVE MVP AND I LIKE TO EXERCISE AND I NEED TO KEEP MY HEART RATE IN CHECK.

She has only had about 3 diaper rashes in the past 7 months!! We put it on her after almost all diaper changes (sometimes we forget or get lazy) as a layer of protection between her and the diaper. We do use Earth's Best diapers which are chlorine free and I am not sure what role they play in keeping her bottom rash free.We have tried the Desitin Max Strength and found it to be too thick. The tube does last longer because you only need a small amount each time but it is harder to spread and which usually means she doesn't get as much coverage. We also have the Mustela diaper cream that we did use for the few times she got a diaper rash and it was great and making it quickly go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Es un buen producto y permite ahorrar dinero.

I thought: This girl has a serious case, she needs maximum strength! I found out such thinking was a mistake. Desitin Maximum is difficult to wipe off, so after a bowel movement, I rubbed harder as it was the only way to get her clean. Desitin rapid relief, however, is much easier to come off after a dirty diaper occurrence, and it does its thing of healing the diaper rash. Also this version of Desitin has a mild smell, while Desitim Maximum smells like grandma's medicine cabinet.I have also used Butt Paste, and it is a fine product with better moisterizers than Desitin. But Desitin is half the cost, and it has about the same level of active ingredients as Butt Paste.

The problem is very limited range on the linking.The wireless range of the alarm is much less than Z-Wave, Bluetooth or wireless alarm devices, wifi, 900mhz, 2.4, 5.8 or DECT phones. It is comparable to a 1970s kids walkie talkie. Pretty dismal. I had to move the alarms several times in order to get a solid link between two bedrooms separated by a bathroom, the same problem between floors even when the alarms were nearly on top of one another. This is in a stick frame house without foil insulation. The linking feature is not very useful if they have to be within 10 feet of each other.You must test each alarm in the exact installation location with the other alarms in their locations, not just close in the room.

I tried moving them within 15'. They still didn't work. Moral to the story - they don't like solid apartment walls and the linking technology is to weak. First Alert says up to 50'. That would probably mean line of sight, out in an open parking lot with no RF nearby!I'm returning these after spending a couple hours. First Alert had a nice idea with weak signal strength.

I purchased a replacement because it made the right amount of rice, and it was generally good. Just last week, the heating element on this one went too. It only lasted 6 months.To note: we never got the base wet or immersed in water. Rice batches varied from a single serving of white shortgrain to family-sized wild brown rice dinners.

Plus, it doesn't give cleavage as the picture suggests, in fact, I feel as through it seperates the breasts & moves them towards the arms rather than towards the center - so much so that I'm getting creases in my shirt between my breasts & when I go home for lunch, I will be changing bras as it's a terrible look.

Harvey Cheyne,Junior, is a spoiled,rich, kid who likes talking people into playing poker. One day, he asked for a cigar from a German on ship, and he started feeling seasick and the people laughed as he said he was going outside for air. A sailor bumped into him and that knocked him over board. He was picked up by a portuegese called Manuel. As he was cleaned up and taken care of, later he met Captain Disko Troop and his son Dan. Read this book on a rainy day and trust me,you couldn't possibley put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic lives up to the name","review":"I know more than i did about fishing the Grand Banks; more about the interactions of men in a small space; more about what makes a boy a man than before i read the book. Kipling may be a little clichéd (or people may feel that way about him), but he knew people and what makes them who they are. Every one of the characters on the boat is a real, singular person; though you may not understand all they say, you know what they mean and why. An excellent adventure story; more than just a sea yarn, though a fine one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is over by page 20","review":"I was disappointed by the simplistic plot. The kid falls off the ship at the very beginning of the book. He's rescued, acts like a jerk for a few pages, and then straightens up.There's not much notable to the rest of the book, most of which is spent by Harvey doing chores aboard the boat, waiting until they reach port. No conflict, not much interest.Harvey gets to gloat at the end when it's proven that he really is rich as he claimed. This part of the story is rather embarrassing, with the author unabashedly worshipping success and wealth.(Not that I have anything against success and wealth, but thisdegree of worship is unseemly.)Not one of Kipling's finer works"},{"rating":"2","title":"good classical literature","review":"This book about a wealthy, spoiled and pampered adolescent, who discovers his true self when because of fate, is induced to the not-so-easy life aboard a fishing schooner in the 19th century Grand Banks.Falling overboard from a passenger steamer, the main character is rescued from drowning by a fishing vessel trawling the Atlantic off Newfoundland. During the ship's long, arduous look for it's catch, the boy is unwittingly, but luckily, netted by the fishermen. The captain, not believing the boy's claims of vast wealth, refuses to bring the ship immediately back to land, but expects him to work just like the rest of the crew, until the schooner returns home with its full catch of fish.I enjoyed this book because of the main character's complete transformation from a bratty, arrogant rich child, to a self-disciplined, wiser and likeable young man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware! This book is in comic format.","review":"Altho the links to preview this book take you to the prose version of Captains Courageous, the book I received with this cover is actually a comic book adaptation similar to the Illustrated Classics of the '50s and '60s.It's not badly done, but certainly was a disappointment when I looked at it: I thought I was getting the classic prose that Kipling wrote.If the prose version what you want, I'd look at another listing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific social history","review":"While the plot may be a bit outdated (we don't go in so much for moral improvement stories these days), the real star of Captains Courageous for me was the documentation of life aboard a cod trawler at the end of the last century. All-night gutting and salting sessions, life among the fleet, the risks and lifestyle -- all fascinating. I read it in conjunction with Cod: Biography of the Fish that Changed the World, and the two together were a terrific education in how exactly fish gets onto our plates, and the risks that people take to get it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captains Boring","review":"This is one Kipling opus that didn't age well at all. It depends far too much on an assumed interest by its readership in seafaring and the culture of the fishermen of old New England. Page after page after page. Then after that there's a lot of gee-whiz-ain't-he-rich stuff that gets old fast. And all the while these two teenage boys are having this great time working their butts off in the sheer drudgery of manual labor. With all that, it's very hard not to fall into an abject slumber and then to wake up fervently wishing this particular read was all over. Hey, you want a good book about a guy who gets picked up at sea and gets forced to work for his keep? \\"The Sea Wolf,\\" of course! It's a 10!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plotless","review":"A lot of the people that gave this book a low rating are lucky that they were not forced to read it for summer homework like I was. I am at the second to last chapter and so far there has been no suspense, or plot, it is just a kid doing chores and catching fish. The way the sailors talk is anoying but easy to get over, the overal story however is hard to understand, many of the terms used are words that not many people know, and when the virgin comes out of the water, well what the !@#$ is the virgin what dose it look like? The author dose not say. There are some exiting moments but the book is overall boring. Mabey it's just the school's fault for making kids going into 7th grade read this type of book. I think an Adult would enjoy this book much more than I did. If you are a kid then you should probably not get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is very boring. The characters (except for Harvey) speak very poorly which makes them very hard to understand. There are a lot of ain'ts which drives me crazy. This book seems to jump from one thing to the next. They might be talking about cod and the next minute they talk about cattle. It is one of those classics which was appealing back then but not now.

This is a boring book and I would never hope that a poor soul has to ever read this book again in the history of mankind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrogance Overboard","review":"The main character of this book,15-year-old Harvey, is one year older than I am, so I am in a unique position to know that he was very fortunate to be taught the life lesson he learned. I know some people who would benefit from this lesson. This book tells of a story where arrogance must be tossed overboard to survive the challenges of life. Harvey learned about that the hard way. It paid off tremendously. He finally appreciated his parents instead of torturing them emotionally. He learned how to fish and to earn his keep. Harvey became a genuine person to his father, to his mother, to the crew on the We're Here, and to himself.

It would be more accurate to simply call them \\"pepper flavored beef sticks\\". As 'pepper flavored beef sticks', I give them a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.

It seriously feels like a low budget movie filmed on a home video camera. Every single scene showing the characters getting into mischief feels like it was recorded using the crappiest recording equipment available.The storyline completely ruins the movie because of how uninteresting and generic it is. Teens find themselves in sticky situations.One group of teens (a boy and a girl) can't escape from a liquor store backroom because the door is locked. Eventually they develop, not only a friendship, but a little something more. Meanwhile a different set of teens are constantly running for their lives as they get into trouble at a house party with the pranks they pull.It's boring though. Both situations are boring. The whole movie is just lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improving on Longer Acquaintance :-)","review":"I'm sorry, I gave up after p. 72.

Then I read the review from someone who said she nearly gave up but kept on going and the book does get better. Something about what that reader said made me pick up the book again.

The author's choice of words gives the reader vivid descriptions of life at the time of the Civil War. We come to understand the feelings of Abraham, a former slave now living in the North, and Lamar, a young, simple-hearted Confederate soldier. This book gave my 3rd-grade daughter the \\"human\\" side of the Civil War, while reinforcing the facts she had learned from her textbook. Although it is a short book, you really gain an appreciation of the suffering endured by both sides of the war as well as for the noble heart of Robert E. Lee and Abraham Lincoln.

It has tiny speakers with almost no bass. FM reception is terrible and there is no antenna or any way to hook one up. It does not have any kind of line in or aux input, so the only thing you can listen to are cd's. It won't even play mp3 files on CD, so it is really very limited.

I use mostly FM, but the AM seems to work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too functional","review":"I bought this to replace a 15 year GE that had a dying CD player. Overall the GE was much better. The Sony has 15 stations but split in groups of five and by band. On my GE I could program my two favorite AM stations and four FM,s and just scroll through them, now I have to change band and station to get back and forth. Looses clock and station memory when unplugged. no battery back up. No light.

Not much of a clock or radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"underwhelming","review":"Having been loyal to Sony products in the past I decided to take the plunge and spend a bit more than I intended to on a radio for my kitchen. However, when I installed the device I realized that the lack of an antena and the inability to move the radio in order to get better reception basically made it useless...it was like a white noise generator. No dice. I think that this would have been far more successful if the radio was installed closer to a window (I'm not sure).

Surprisingly, there is only one reference in the index to risk, a subject at the heart of predictability. References to Nikita Khrushchev, Richard Nixon, Bob Dole and the Rolling Stones add limited substantive value to the book. Chapter One did wet my appetite, but the rest was disappointing.

The graphics are a major step backwards from SSX 3 which was beautiful. You simply cannot create a character that doesn't look like a grungy teenager from 1992. The inability to play our favorite characters in tour mode is unfortunate. But the single most unpleasant aspect of this game and the reason why I dislike it with such passion is that in multiplayer mode if one racer gets too far ahead of another, the player who is behind automatically gets brought forward, catching him up to the player in the lead. This entirely invalidates the very essence of multiplayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreamly cool full time.","review":"This SSX game is cool like having Mario charaters on it,Making your own charater.

The author is very protective of religion in general and does not really hold them responsible for the evil that they inflicted on the world when they misuse their power.

That's too bad, because I consider myself mostly sympathetic.Thus is illustrated a classic case of alienating your own kind by being overly preachy.

Then \\"Chocolate Supa Highway\\". Then listen to the first two songs and the last track on \\"Everyone\\", and put it away.Hopefully, Franti will do the same thing.\\"The harder you hit us, the louder we become - just like the skin on a drum\\".

Since I got this cd it has become the most played album of my collection. Never have I hear a musician draw from so many genres of music so effortlessly. The album has such an array of different sounds, and each song is diverse in of itself. When you add that to some of the finest contemporary protest poetry, you're left with an irresistable cd that is perfect for any situation... chillin' out by yourself at home, or cranking up the positive vibrations at a party. If you like any forms of hip-hop, soul, r&b, reggae, folk music, or really any good music in general, this is a must have for your collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational","review":"Michael Franti has some of the most inspirational lyrics that I've ever heard.

Franti is a wonderful lyricist who knows how to write a song that is good and gets a message across without sounding like he is preaching. His style of rapping is very cool and a different feel for anybody who is tired of the same old same old style that seems to be all over MTV and mainstream radio today. You find yourself bobbing your head to the whole album just because it is that good. He can sing as well and play the guitar throwing in some nice little riffs in the songs to make them his own. As you listen you can't help but feel like if Bob Marley and Public Enemy had a child Michael Franti & Spearhead would be it, and everyone deserves that music for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual","review":"This guy is GOOD.

This is the second time I have stumbled across a book that has been re-released with a different title and no revisions. Watch out for this problem with other titles by favorite authors. It may be related to changes in the tax laws for publishers.The second thing you need to know is that this is a collection of scholarly articles by scholars for scholars.

Unfortunately, Kurlansky's writing and story-telling skills are so lacking that the book reads like a middle school history text: this happened, then that happened, etc. In the hands of John McPhee, this would have been a fascinating read, illuminated with big characters and portentous actions.

Celine transcends his time and place by writing in simple, dynamic prose that does does more to bare the human condition than anything ever writen. The book can be summed (although you should read it, repeatedly) by one line from its riveting conclusion... It isn't (an obvious reading) a broadside against love; rather it a crystalization of Celine's hatred for the lies and eception that have come to constitue modern (post 1890s) life. In a nutshell, it is Celine's opening salvo against the comfort of illusion. This novel, if you give it a chance, will absolutely change your life. It is the most compassionate black comedy ever written (a genre occupied (untill \\"Journey\\") only by the Bible!!!) Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book exposes literature to life","review":"I wish I would have been alive and living in France when this book was released in 1932. What a shock it must have been! Of course, the fact that it was a best-seller is entirely ironic; there is nothing about this book that is conventional.What the book consists of is a personal, semi-autobiographical journey into the life of a Paris doctor for the poor and his adventures in WWI, in Africa, working for General Motors in America, and finally for a sanitorium in France. In each instance, the culture de jour is analyzed, reconfigured, and often trashed. Celine says what he means... And if these dots mean anything to you... You'll know you're hooked, too!... Easily one of the five most important books published this century. Everything after it would take SOMETHING..."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can anyone with a brain pan this novel?","review":"This is in response to all the people who bashed \\"Journey\\". Celine is the greatest writer of the past 2000 years and if you can't appreciate him you obviously have no taste or feeling for great writing. If you want something safe and predictable (ie \\"uplifting\\") then go read John Updike or Toni Morrison. \\"Journey\\" deserves its reputation and for anyone to rehash Celine's \\"collaboration\\" is incredibly lame.

Get this book under your belt. The laugh out loud gallows humor provides a potent kick as the novel starts, propelling you almost giddily into Celine's world where you are left to ferment and writhe as the humor turns to acid and there are no more smiles to be had. By the end of the book all you are left with is a filthy reflection of what awaits you outside your door but, like in any battle, the guy who suffers with you becomes a friend for life.

This book is the diary of your friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here is where you use the word \\"best\\".","review":"I first read the journey when serving the army back in Yugoslavia.

Only Fante, Hamsun, Kafka and sometimes Buk can reach up to Celine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey to Bed","review":"Celine seems like the attempt here was to write 'the' great coming of age/teen angst novel, but instead, published the stuff from his wastebasket. This is as poor of a storyline as this 'book' ever develops. It's impulsive and boring at the same time, timid and defiant against only the reader.

In most cases they don't start on a very high plane.I don't believe for a minute that the scenarios pulled screaming from Celines mind are something the reader will carry with him / her after having have thrown the book down in disgust. The general feeling, yes, anything else, no.The writing style, at least as translated, is a slow go.As to why I finished it, the first sentence is my confession and excuse.

In short, another 'confessions of a self-described coward who wants to amuse the reader, and yet is disgusted with himself for wanting to....' type of book. Not that this would spoil it for anyone interested in what has the feel, frankly, of David Sedaris/Kurt Vonnegut if either was German: it's all about the laffs, the laffs that bring up a little bile...if you are angry enough to read this book, why not go all the way and read Nietzsche's Zarathustra?

(And in Ralph Manheim's translation.) Like Miller, Celine writes about Paris and his relations with women. However Celine was a soldier and a doctor and saw much more of life and Paris than Miller ever did.

This is just the movie, except without video. I have great respect for Bonfa and Jobim's work on this music, but they do not get glorified truly since the tracks change so quickly and the movie sounds play such a large role in the soundtrack cd. Listen to Trio da Paz and their Black Orpheus album and see how it compares, and even though it is not the original Jobim or Bonfa, it pays more homage to them than this original soundtrack.

As we follow Charly, the well-bred perfect English gentlemen, through his week long vacation in Paris, we become ensnared in the life story of the prostitute he befriends and her web of friends and acquaintances. The story itself is interesting in its own right, but what really makes the narrative flow is how Maugham lets us peer into the psyches of various characters, all from different social strata. My personal favorite was Berger, Lydia's husband who despite his rogue behavior was one of the more memorable (and even likable) characters. Simon, Charly's friend was drawn perhaps a bit too extremely, but Maugham does use that to some effect.

I love watching Fred Astaire dance, and I really love watching him play the piano! If I remember correctly, Roberta was the first picture we saw that really showcased the piano-playing of Fred Astaire, others that followed are Follow the Fleet, Broadway Melody of 1940, and Let's Dance.

Much of the 90s black-metal, death-metal and swedish melodic death is firmly rooted in Celtic Frost's legacy.While this is not the most pleasant or impressive music, it has earned it's place in metal history, and was a brave attempt at sounding new and fresh back in 1985.

Yet, there are some that really have exceled very well in the image, but there are some that overexpose themselves to where the music is cheap, and the image outweighs the feeling to the songs. For Britney Spears, she has done that actually very well this year with her 2 fastlove marriages, and she still can't carry a tune with covers either. Her remake of Bobby Brown's My Perogative, the recent track from her Greatest Hits record is one of the worst covers I've ever heard. The song itself is very dark and doesn't really have that upbeat new jack swing feeling that Bobby originated in the 80's. As for Britney, I honestly suggest you don't listen to this one, and listen to Bobby's version instead. Not since Britney Spears 2000 remake of the Rolling Stones Satisfaction have I ever heard such a very poor cover song ever.Overall: F-"},{"rating":"1","title":"I doubt she even knows what \\"prerogative\\" means","review":"This naive redneck has no clue what this song is about. She is a high-school drop-out after all. This was Bobby Brown's anthem and his version is much better, so I suggest you check that out.

This record moved me tremendously upon the first listenings. The playing is so beautiful and so effortless sounding. Bill's soloing is amazing. It took me 3 or 4 months to begin to cop all the intricate rythymical movement, the unique approach to comp, the tight chord voicings, the collective improv of the group... this record made me listen to music in a new way. One of my very favorite jazz records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Built","review":"Good value, nice product.

And, many song lyrics are pedestrian at worse to simple at best. A few songs were hits in England and will inspire feet tapping or shuffling.Cliff fans will enjoy this album but it is not reason to spend money, except of course if you are a Cliffette. In my opinion, although he was one of the early British rockers and rock stars, this album demonstrates why he never achieved icon or superstar status. Other than aging Cliffie fans, I doubt that many people even remember him or this album. It is not going to make the list of the top 1000 or 500 albums. End of story.

Its almost as good as House Attreides. Book 9 expands upon the Emporer's plans to manufacture synthetic spice, and House Attreides attempts to restore Prince Rhombur back to power on Ix. When House Corrino's rulers are executed and Ix invaded and occupied by Harkonnens, House Attreides makes an effort to put Prince Rhombur, the only surviving heir to House Corrino, back into power. Meanwhile, the Emporer has plans to destroy Dune so that he can corner the spice market with his synthetic melange, 'amal.' The story climaxes when Gurney Halleck runs a Harkonnen blockade setup around planet Ix to get 'medical supplies' to House Corrino. All in all, a well told story and I would certainly recommend this book to all who love Dune."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big bore","review":"I am really sorry for Frank Herbert's legacy.This book was by far the worst of the three prequels, which were all mediocre at best.Now that I am reading Dune 5 \\"Heretics\\", wow! What a fresh change!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dune--MTV Style","review":"The downfall of this book--as with the other Herbert/Anderson Dune prequels--is the ridiculously short chapter length. By failing to focus on individual characters or plotlines for more than a few moments at a time, they fail to provide depth of character, emotion or story.The average chapter length is three pages, which is hardly enough to give readers a taste of their characters. And instead of this style giving their work a sense of tension, the \\"quick cut\\" chapters only left this eager reader deeply unsatisfied.One of the many strengths of Frank Herbert's writing was the depth with which he explored his characters and settings, giving even his most imaginative creations a strong sense of reality.By contrast, the Dune prequels including House Corrino, spend too little time on any one character or plot for anything to \\"stick\\" in a reader's mind. This vapid style might work for MTV, but fans of the original Dune novels will be disappointed by the lack of substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great!","review":"Amazing that the old boring Dune series served as inspiration for these splendid prequels.Witness the introduction of a [quote] Bene Gesserit makeup specialist [unquote] !Comic relieve at House Harkonnen featuring an etiquette instructor and a young Feyd Rautha !Over 300 chapters per volume !There's so much innovation and addition here that it is hard to believe it's all crammed into 3 volumes.Whereas the original Dune was difficult to comprehend and really rather bookish this great joint effort reads like a dream. Everything is patiently explained in full detail and there are helpful reminders in every chapter on who, why and what to avoid confusion.Still, given the overall complexity I can't really recommend this trilogy to anyone under the age of seven.A solid 6 stars.

It was only out of curiosity to see how this shameless son of Frank Herbert would further defile the great Dune legacy. It's truely amazing how little original thought went into this book. The only story lines are filling in details that Frank Herbert intentionally left vague or following one-dimensional characters down one-dimensional plots. I'm drawing the line here. I'm not going to buy the Butlerian series and give more money to these sick so-called authors.There are only 6 Dune books, however much we might wish for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was sad, really.","review":"I did not feel that i was reading a Dune novel as i read this. like its predecesors, it was poor writing.

They read like one of Anderson's utterly awful \\"Young Jedi Knights\\" books, with TV-style pacing, two- (or sometimes one-) dimensional characters, and lots of filler.This one is the worst of the bunch, trying to resolve a situation that couldn't possibly have come from Frank's notes (where the hell did this friendship and bond of honor between House Atreides and Ixians go to in the 16 years between _Dune: House Corrino_ and _Dune_?) in a ridiculous climax and a de rigueur happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for the Herberts!","review":"I loved it!I read the first series 25 years ago and thought it was amazing,but a little complicated and convoluted.Reading them was almost like doing homework.This prequel was much easier while still maintaining the richness and power of the original series.

Dune fans, if you want to spend some more time in the Dune universe - or something like it -, get ready to \\"ignore\\" the screw-ups.As a better alternative, however, make up your own stories and write them down.

The original Dune universe was set in a cold and desperate universe where mankind had reverted to a dark ages of religeous fundamentalism and anti-technology suspicions.

Bah, Humbug!"},{"rating":"2","title":"House Corrino","review":"I can see a parallelism between this book and chapterhouse: dune, especially with the way it ended, it's just a shame that Rhombur never played a significant part (nor any part at all in the original series) ... maybe someone will write about the exploits of IX.

Phrases such as 'wheel-within-wheels' and many others, which have been used to describe or review Frank Herbert's work, are actually used here as part of the story!The opening text at the beginning of each chapter in the Dune series served to enhance that chapter and create a sense of depth but in the prequels, it seemed forced and at times laughable.It seems to this reader that even Dune Revenant, the fan fiction posted on various sites, despite being a first draft, captured the complexity, politics, theology and the heart of Frank Herbert's creation more successfully than the authors of the prequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dune Fan!","review":"This book provides a good back story that fills in many of the unknows from the previous books.

It's almost as though they kept the downward spiral going as each book progressively gets worse. I liked Atredies and enjoyed Harkonnen but this edition was pitiful. The first half is boring and simple. Never really gets to anything especially since I thought the second book set it up to be exciting. Then the second half, while picking up the pace, it seems as though the authors were bored and couldn't wait to start the butlerian Jihad trilogy. They just kind of hurry things along and wrap up the story with no real compelling conclusions. The last few chapters are so simple I felt cheated. If you have started the series you have to pick this book up to finish it off but don't expect to have an real compelling ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story shame about the prose","review":"I don't know if its because I re-read the original series while waiting for this book, or if it really is so much worse than the previous 2 books in the series, but I am very disappointed.The writing in this book is pedestrian at best and space opera at worst. the plot flow is linear, sudden abilities helpfully appear (like the Bene Gesserit capability to alter memory), the dialog is written like a poor screenplay, and everything is spelled out in painful clarity rather than by inferrence. The only bits that appealed to me were the litte quotes in the chapter headings :-)If like me you HAVE to read the book to see what happens in the series... and hopefully allow for a finale to \\"Chapter House\\" to be written then buy the paperback, borrow a copy, or visit a library.I'm just hoping the next Dune book is worthy of the series because, for me, this one wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making childhood connections with Eric Carle's autobiography","review":"When I taught an autobiographies unit for my fifth grade writers, they were particularly drawn to this collection of autobiographical stories by Eric Carle.

Perhaps there has been some improvement in the keyboards that are currently shipping.Typing on the Apple keyboard definitely has a different feel than most PC keyboards, but I find that I prefer the touch and it is much quiter than the Microsoft Ergo Keyboard I had been using.

But after having freelanced at several places that use this keyboard, I noticed that they do not age well. For starters, certain keys become slightly misaligned with repeated use, and cannot be depressed swiftly. This problem is particularly apparent with the left Command key. Anyone who uses key shortcuts will be frustrated when the Command fails to work (e.g. instead of selecting all the copy in a text box, an 'a' will have been inserted).There is also no covering over the areas between the sets of keys so any dust or debris that falls over the keyboard is 100% guaranteed to fall to the bottom, where it will collect and display clearly through the transparent edges. After a few months, what you get is a keyboard that causes inadvertant typos, while looking like it needs a bath.Fortunately, these have been discontinued.

It fortunately came with a USB extension cord. It is quite stylish but this inadvertently makes my Logitech mouse and Viewsonic monitor look sadly ancient. My only real complaint would be that it isn't equipped with a pair of feet to increase the keyboard angle.Compared with a decent Microsoft PC keyboard, I noticed that on the Apple keyboard (1) the distance between the surfaces of two adjacent keys is shorter, (2) the surface of each key is flatter, and (3) the height difference between an unpressed and pressed key seems smaller. This gives the keyboard a softer/fuzzier feel that some people might not like or might need a little time to adjust to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other than that water \\"allergy\\", nice keyboard.","review":"The water damage remark is spot on, these recent Apple keyboards are really hard to salvage if they get wet. They're also hard to clean, a problem that is exacerbated by the pure white on clear materials. There are covers like iSkin that should rectify that, but the material feels weird.A pretty decent second choice for a basic compact Mac keyboard is the Kensington Keyboard in a Box. It lacks the dedicated volume and eject keys found on the Apple units, and it has a slightly mushier feel. The enclosure is somewhat larger front to back (it's about the same width as the Apple board), but it comes in a more dust tolerant gray/black color scheme and takes spills a little more gracefully.Despite the flaws, I'm buying yet another Apple keyboard because the size and port placement are just right for my needs, and I am spoiled by those volume and eject keys."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EXAGGERATING! - Apple USB Keyboard ( DIRTY )","review":"This is suppose to be a CLEAN, LIKE NEW?????

No more typos.It's just not anywhere near the quality of the iMac it came with.Another gotcha - Apple messed up the arrangement of the keys surrounding the number pad.

They are good looking watches and initially you think they are great--titanium cases, very legible, keep good time. Unfortunately, the screw down crown just does not work well--on both of mine they initially would pop up every little while, now they will not stay screwed down at all. I think the threads are so tiny and fragile that after you set the time a couple of times for daylight savings or change the date, they just strip or something, and I was VERY gentle with mine. Would love to recommend them, but this is a glaring design problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding information on all aspects of childhood leukemia","review":"This book should be handed to every family with a newly diagnosed child.

For the rest of us, pass these by. The \\"subtly sweet\\" advertisement was way too subtle for me to detect.El Sabroso Pumpkin Seeds (also on Amazon)are definitely tastier, although still a bit light in the salt department (and no, I do NOT like the frequent store bought seeds that have 3 pounds of salt on each shell). At least they are crunchier, tastier, and don't feel like you're chewing on a tire. El Sabroso's are, however, much smaller seeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"great but omitted two tracks...","review":"I really good album, with cathcy tracks such as 'never be anyone else but you' and 'la gonave', to name but a couple. With all the reissues are some b-sides that did not make the albums. When I got this, I was really disappointed, as two brilliant self penned Cliff Richard ballads are not here, but were b-sides to 'heart user' and 'shooting from the world'. 'Small world' and the simply sublime 'I will follow you'. These are tracks that are not easy to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"Generally I am a big fan of Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer. This one was not worth buying. I found that the first half of the material was recycled from previous tapes. The second half had a few new tidbits and restatements of concepts already presented in other books, tapes and videos. At the outset Dr. Dyer talked about this being a project that both of them had wanted to do for a long time.

The total length is less than 300 minutes, on 6 cassettes. To get it over 300 minutes, Wayne has to add a 9+ minute introduction to the book.

Though the score is admirable, this show will be best known for the stellar performances. There are, however, a few standout songs.

I can't wait until the musical rolls into town!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Score","review":"You don't need to have seen the show to appreciate the brilliance of this music, of the lyrics, and of the superior caliber of all the cast.

It makes this whole thing real."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to take my ears off now","review":"Grey Gardens got good reviews? I honestly don't know why everyone is raving. I have listened to it a few times now and I don't get it. Well I get it, what it's about and what is going on but I don't get why people like it. The music kind of reminds me of Annie, but worse. Don't get me wrong, I like Annie, but it's...Annie.You might tell me its one of those shows you have to see on stage, but if I don't even like the music why would I even want to sit through it? Please. I can't stand this cast recording the only good thing about it is Christine Ebersole.They could have done SO much better. I get what they tried to do and I see where they could have improved. I've turned off the music now and have left it for another day, maybe on a day when I can't hear properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary Performance","review":"Christine Ebersole gives a performance that will go down in theatrical history. It's right up there with the likes of Yul Bryner in The King and I, Streisand in Funny Girl, Merman in Gypsy, Lansbury in Mame and Zero Mostel in Fiddler.I agree with other reviewers, while this is a nice representation of the original production, wait for the new broadway cast recording, the score is improved, with stronger performances by the ensemble. Still, this is a sublime recording of Ebersole's and Mary Louise Wilson's performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey Gardens- ..............BUT the MUSIC........................","review":"Though my husband and I loved the play and found the story fascinating and tremendously sad, the music was in our opinions just awful.

The grey even matches my Bose Companion II speakers, and the hard plastic feels very durable. The space provided under the monitor is great as well, I can fit my TV remotes / PS3 Controller / cable modem with ease; would definitely fit a keyboard if you wanted to put it there. All in all great purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"biased RFK bio from Right Wing columnist","review":"This bio is extremely biased against RFK and the Kennedy family. The author Victor Lasky is a right wing columnist. Lasky's most controversial book was It Didn't Start With Watergate published in 1977. He argued that the scandal that drove Richard Nixon from office was little more than a media event.In this book he presents every event in the most negative light possible from the Kennedy point of view. For example, the effort by the Kennedy's to confront Catholic bigotry, he completely discounts as manufactured by the Kennedy's to get votes. The funny thing is that the book is still fairly readable and if you know enough about RFK from other sources you can discount the negative spin and there are lots of entertaining anecdotes and the author is a decent writer. But definitely don't buy this if its your first bio of RFK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that will Move You","review":"Agree with previous reviewers' 'excellent' ratings. This is truly excellent small group swing.Despite feeling slightly 'shorted' by having alternate takes, resulting in only 7 real songs, the performances are superb throughout. Recording quality is much better than expected for a 1943 issue (beware: you can hear some of the scratches as this was obviously copied from a disc and the dynamic range isn't the best. Still, when you hear the performances, the imperfections in recording seem to melt away.)Highly recommended for some deeply moving swing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for teaching ESL","review":"The text is written in a pattern of a number followed by a plural noun.

They actaully watched the movie blue citrus hearts and enjoyed it because I think it wasn't the same ole thing and it had a more human feel to it. In some ways, i think that this movie has helped my entire life. I reccommend it for anyone who would want someone to see what's it's like to be gay, to help open their minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only reason I don't give this movie one star is, I didn't care enough to hate it.","review":"Just because you have a computer and a digital camera, and just because a few people are willing to give you the spare change out of their pockets to create your production \\"budget\\", please don't believe the universe is encouraging you to make a movie. The only reason I don't give this movie one star is, I didn't care enough to hate it. The film just isn't strong enough to inspire enough emotion to create love or hate for the effort. It's bad. Really, really bad in that lighting is too dim to see the so-called scenes, acting is too weak to support the so-called dialog, and writing is too poor to create characters and situations that make the audience care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and Confused","review":"I tried, I really tried but I just could not make it through this movie.

A bit slow at times but still engaging to the touching end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh","review":"I just finished watching this film and well it was baddd. I understand what they were trying to do but the writing was just horrible. It didnt help that the acting made it hard to watch. It looks like a high school student film and the writing was soo forced. They swore way too much making it seem so unnatural, so forced. The best part of this movie was the poetry that was shown. The very ending credits were nice and i hate to knock the film because I think the message was important but man this movie was horrible. Bad acting, Bad script, and Bad filming. There are way better movies with the same important message of understanding and love...I say go watch some of them instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea+poor execution=bad entertainment!!","review":"I really wanted to like this film -- the concept is great and the actors are very likable. But I found the plot pacing, characterization, and overall thematic development to be so slow that I was really wishing the movie would just end. After 25 minutes I \\"got\\" everything the movie was trying to tell me -- but the movie kept plodding on, with one agonizingly long, shaky camera shot of a sad, tortured teen's face after another. We get it - the kids are sad cause they're gay and no one understands! What else? Anything? No, that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I applaud the attempt. It might strike a chord with somebody who is ripe for the message, but as entertainment, it's mostly a failure.The cinematography is glaringly and distractingly amateur. It's as if you are on a roller coaster ride. The sound is amateur too, and the story is almost nothing. The acting is laughable.I've seen better production, editing, dialog, acting, and story in porn. Really. This isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen","review":"Ok I know it was low budget but the acting was terrible, almost laughable and the most annoying was the music which is loud and obnoxious. If there was a plot I failed to comprehend what it was. Since it had gotten such good reviews I bought it and am now stuck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Warning","review":"I can't be the only person that didn't like this movie. I rented this movie because I thought it might be a harrowing, sweet love story set in the Midwest. What I got was two blocks of wood crouching and brooding throughout most of the film with lots of jittery camera movement. If you're figuring out whether to rent or buy this movie, I give the helpful advice that if the word \\"angst\\" doesn't make you run off screaming, covered in a film of panic sweat, then maybe you will enjoy this movie. As for me, I am still in the process of repenting the sin of bringing this monstrosity home and making my roommate watch it with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please...","review":"Who in their tiny, little minds could even THINK about giving this thing a positive review? I have seen directors and crews work on a shoe string and come up with magic. This is just woefully bad. Inconcievably horrendous direction, non-actors, a seemingly improvised script, god awful sound, TERRIBLE music,(did I mention the bad acting from the non actors?)inept camera work (honestly, could no one afford a tripod?), painful \\"story\\" and the most awkward unpassionate same sex kiss (only one)this side of Dawson's creek..This cliche-ridden piece of drek would not be considered a competent effort by community college standards let alone one to sell to the masses. If you want a low budget gay \\"Coming of Age\\" story try \\"The Journey of Jared Price\\" or anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh come on","review":"Ok. i think the producers knew it was gonna suck if all they had to work with was a canon gL2 and final cut pro. They werent going for some really powerful film with great effects. If they were, they wouldnt have bothered. We all know that it sucked. really bad. But you have to look beyond all that. If you cant, thats ok, i found that part hard myself. it has a message. dont get me wrong. But they expressed it differently. The credits were of better quality than the film and they needed to get sum more 'beautiful' people. More people would enjoy it if they had a piece of eyecandy to stare at the whole time to help them keep track of the plot. Which wasnt very in depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Display of a movie","review":"This was about the most pathetic movie I have seen about gay issues as a teenager. Besides the fact that the camera quality was poor, it made me dizzy with all the camera movements. I would not recommend this be watched by anyone, because this movie shows that parents do not understand. In today's society, parents are becoming more exposed to the gay/lesbian situation and are more in tune with it. I personally have never seen such a poor display of a movie and would not recommend anyone waste their money on such a movie. I think there should be a \\"000\\" star category, in which, this movie earned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"this is a really fun look who's talking toy, but not one of the more durable, so buy more than one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant read from Catherine Cookson","review":"I love Catherine Cookson books.

Could a young girl raise a family of nine children on her own with no resources? Could a woman, forgive and even come to love a man that raped her and ruined her life, who's family took her illegitimate child away from her? Would a man sacrifice himself in a loveless marriage to provide for a fallen woman? Many of the characters changed their basic natures: the wife, who went from being kind and generous to being insanely jealous, the hero who was cruel and abusive to his mother and wife, and finally, the cowardly rapist becoming the savior. I just couldn't buy into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fan of Catherine Cookson since the 1960's.","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and decided to read it again. It is still my favorite book by Cookson. I've always saidthe charaters in her books are never happy until they are a hundred and one, but Cookson makes you feel the sadness and the happiness, and her books always make me glad that I did not live at that time, with all the poverty, when it was only the rich and the poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for Dell Inspiron 9300","review":"I just bought this notebook case for my Dell Inspiron 9300, and I'm very pleased with it.

There's some decent dialogue and one character in particular is funny, but mostly it's not believable - at all - and dull. None of the characters are particularly likable.

It's always interesting to think about how a normal-appearing person who is dealing with having \\"super-powers\\" handles things & her/his thoughts. This has some light moments and some heavy ones, but is well written. Not just dealing with and learning super powers, but trying to be ethical in their application is a thoughtful and difficult process, I'm sure. This would be appropriate for teens as well as holding the interests of adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is 0 stars not possible?","review":"If it was possible, I would give this book 0 stars. Yes it is THAT bad. The first chapter starts out pretty interesting with this girl who can't indulge in too much or she will go off the chart and get an orgasm. Sounds interesting right? well it's not. She finds a guy who is super hot and you think the story line is going to go somewhere with that but it really doesn't. She plays hard to get and then she has this battle and they all live happily ever after. That basically just sums up the whole book. It is full of fluff and is not well written at all. I found myself skipping through most parts just because the author's description of many things were just so boring, I was falling asleep. I highly recommend that you do not spend one cent on this book and if you really want to read it, go to a library. Even then...I still think, you have spent too much effort in to getting this awful fluff book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very much lacking","review":"Seeing the reviews I was really excited to read this book but was very much disappointed. I sensed that the author just sat time and typed a book as opposed to developing the story and the characters. There were some many contradictions and the story dragged and lulled in many place.Stories are in the details. For instance the characters found themselves at a backyard party at a supposedly fancy house. There was champagne, the owners of the house were wealthy and there was even valet parking but the guest ate off paper plates??I know that might sounds picky but those are the little mistakes that add up to a bad story, and there was a lot of those little mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could get my money back","review":"Blech!

It is about a world inhabited by people with superpowers. The heroine has to take some tests in order to become a full blown superheroine, while trying not to fall in love with a mere mortal. It reminded me of the old Supergirl comics, except that the heroine was a very silly woman, the hero was uninspiring, and the only interesting person was the villainous cousin. The ending was a cop-out....

No history of the tanks preformance in battle,no outlines on paint schemes and little more than a few rather poor pictures. Why this book was ever put out is a wonder as there have been since 1945 about a dozen top running tanks of this kind avaliable for study and for color photowork and even in 2012 there are a few operators in Germany alive who rode this vechile into battle- why all this was tossed aside leads one to scratch ones head as the book looks more like something thrown together from a copy machine used to copy off material off the sides of model boxes and old news paper clipping. This is a real tragedy as the Hetzer is probably one of the more fameous unique tanks of the second world war-it is almost comical to think one can learn more about the Hetzer reading a article in wikipedia than reading through this cheap and disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect tool for your kitchen","review":"this is great.

At some points (\\"Lenny\\" comes to mind) it seems as if Stevie is in the room with you--you can hear his fingers run across the strings and his amp hum. I agree with a previous reviewer that the premature fade in \\"Tin Pan Alley\\" is horrible, but what can you do.

At times it would seem like no one existed around him while playing. He had the ability to draw you in with his music and not let go. His emotions , real emotions , were played to everyone. Sometimes it was joy , other time it was complete agony. Each time he played , it would not be different. Some of the things he did boggeled my mind.

Some of Stevie Ray's playing is blistering and drop-dead amazing. The album does herald the arrival of a new blues guitar master. However, this album does not feature SRV's best songwriting, nor does Double Trouble seem confident to keep up with their main man. As a band and album effort, Texas Flood has its limitations. Sometimes, the album seems like a showcase for Stevie Ray's playing prowess with everything else as just background. \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\" is an example of SRV's young songwriting abilities. Still, Stevie Ray lets it all out and tells it from the heart. The remastering sounds full and SRV's guitar never sounded better.

Instead I bought Beyerdynamic's DT 235 (http://www.amazon.com/beyerdynamic-DT-235-Headphone-White/dp/B001BAKTFO) which are not circumaural, but my ears are small enough so that they basically are.Sound:I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality was excellent to me; even without an amp.Craftsmanship:Fairly well built, it is made of plastic. The biggest cause of concern for me was the thin cord, but the connector was covered in a metal spring contraption, which made it seem very solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, but one thing--","review":"I've only had ear bud head phones before purchasing these. Listening to music through these instead of ear buds or the computer is such an amazing experience. The sound is superb. Especially for the price.However, when I was deciding which headphones to buy and reading through various reviews, I saw some that mentioned the long length of the cord. I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. However, it is incredibly inconvenient and I wish I would have heeded their warnings. I'm a student at university so I wear them walking between classes, and the cord is a huge hassle to deal with. Yes, I was aware they're for studio, but I thought it wouldn't be too big of a deal. Everything else about them is great. It usually takes hours before my ears start feeling slightly uncomfortable. I just wish I took the cord length more seriously. If I could redo my purchase, I would. But if you're looking for a long cord length, then these are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound,buuuut,...","review":"Ya know,..I didnt think I'd ever have to write one of these negative type reviews.I have never had a problem with things I bought on Amazon.However,..these earphones,while sounding incredible,..dont work well,after just a few weeks.They're a pain,really. When I got them,they were fine,but after only two weeks of use(not hard use either) they go out at the point where the cord meets the plugin.I mean,I dont move them around much,just to put them on and take them off at my PC desk. I have to manipulate the cord until the sound comes back on.I tried to duct tape it so that the cord would stay in the right place,but that isnt working either.So,I have to keep trying and moving the plugin and cord round so that I can find a place that I can hear them.I do love the total depth of sound though.So,I guess I'll have to look for another set soon,and keep these until then.Damn it.I've only had these for about 2 1/2 months is all. They really do sound great too.

The M3Os I bought for myself arrivedlast month.. I plugged them into my laptop and listened to them. I was really impressed. The bass is a huge improvement over the Hesh, going for a sharp, full sound instead of just making your cans thump. The sound quality is great. With my old Hesh, I was missing half the song! The headphones are pretty comfortable, after wearing them for 2 hours straight, I've experienced no discomfort, despite having a ring in my ear cartilage.After a month of GENTLE use, they stopped working. The wire was intact, everything. These are a scam, do not buy!I'm so mad because I feel like I've been scammed!

They need to at least have the volume you get on an iTunes iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're OK","review":"I got them, they're OK. Too funny I ordered them after reading reviews...Tight fitting worried me but I said OK I'll try them. TRUST ME they are NOT tight fitting at all. Sounds great!!!

You want a good pair of phones under $50 order these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!","review":"These headphones are amazing. It has HD sound and they are very comfortable. I'm an amateur beat maker and I can tell you that making beats with these headphones is a very fun activity. The samples sound clean, specially the drum kicks. The only drawback is the cord: it is as big as an adult Anaconda.You will have to coil it if you want to go outside with them. That's the only reason I gave it 4/5.Stop searching Buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value, Great Quality","review":"Been using them for 12 hours in a row now (very comfortable). By far the most crisp and clear sounding headphones I've heard for under $50. Last pair of headphones I bought were green and black from walmart and I thought for $50 I would get something decent. Couldn't stand them and after 3 months I decided I needed something new. Had my eye on the M50s but I don't have that much cash, and after I heard these I wouldn't have bought them anyway. Tested out the monsters, beats and bose head phones through friends and family. I think the others charge you mostly for advertising, these sound the same as those (biggest difference for me seemed to be the source, a lot of difference between a crappy computer and a nice audio card).They also work fine in noisy environments, but they aren't noise canceling. Just simple and great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headphones","review":"Ordered online, due to many positive customer reviews. I was not disappointed.

I am not so much into that style of product but the headphones themselves are amazing. The sound quality is excellent and you hear everything well. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because after wearing them drafting for 2 hours they started to hurt my ears. it felt like a \\"pressure\\" feeling. But I was also wearing them for an extended period of time. The cord is too long for my taste i had to bunch it up and zip-tie the bad boy but if the cord was cut down by about a good 5 ft they would be perfect. I love audio technica products"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and requires too much \\"tuning\\"","review":"Unfortunately I was only able to wear these for about an hour before they became painfully uncomfortable. I adjusted and re-adjusted them with no luck over several days. I've since ordered another pair that sit around the ear and I've already worn them for several hours at a time.These also took quite a bit of \\"fine-tuning\\" to get a decent to moderate sound out of. I say that because I was very unhappy with the level of distortion, especially if listening to any music with heavy bass.The only reason for 2 stars is that even though they are extremely uncomfortable for me, you can tell that they are well made, and they are very comfortable to wear around your neck due to the foldable cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase for the value","review":"It does not cancel out the outside sounds over all performance is satisfactory. It is comfortable around the years easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfort, clarity, and cut - just like a diamond!","review":"Sound cutting action was not actually advertised but I find these to reduce ambient noise almost to nil. Not able to hear people calling me, etc. Very comfortable set, hi-fidelity (does anyone use that term any more?) sound with good bass but not too much. I hate a pair of earphones pre-set to knock your fillings loose with bumping bass. These are great all around, without distortion or distraction of equalization set for a particular listener (like the \\"jazz\\" or \\"classical\\" setting on my car stereo. Right-left panning is centered, but there is some, and it's enough for me for the way I use them, basically background tunes from Windows Media Player while I work on my computer. I didn't want to spend much, but was willing to drop $40 on these and I'm happy I did. HIGHLY satisfying sound for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"ATH-M30","review":"I must say de EQ of these headphones is amazing, lots of bass and low-mids. They are really comfortable and light. Thumbs up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best set I have bought, but I'm a little cheap.","review":"Very pleased with this set. I have never splurged on a true high end set of head phone and these are at the high end among my previous purchases. They sound really good to me, not too bassy but very rich. I am noticing small details in songs that I have not noticed before. I can understand why some people might consider these uncomfortable, I do notice my ears feel like I have been wearing headphones when I take these off after a long session but I would not say it hurts, and the feeling passes quickly. The other important consideration for me was how loud these would be to my co workers, so far no complaints even after I invited comments when listening to Leftfield at enjoyable volume. So here is me hoping I don't sit on them like I usually do :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound quality at a solid price","review":"I bought these headphones about 2-3 months ago. They have been fantastic for when I travel (usually from Arizona to New York or Boston, so long trips), and also everyday use. The only little downside is that they do get slightly uncomfortable after you use them for an extended period of time... say over an hour. But, once you give your ears a few minutes to breath, you can put the headphones back on for another hour or so. Another downside is that the cord is absurdly long. It doesn't really bother me, but I can see how it would annoy some people. and when I say long I mean around ten feet long."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 2+ years","review":"I have not had a single problem with these.

Perfect for mixing and audio production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of headphones for the price with a few minor complaints","review":"The sound on these headphones is superb, as is the fit. I can wear these for extended periods with no discomfort. I only have two minor gripes. The padding on the ears feels pretty flimsy, like it's going to flake off or tear eventually. Also the cord is way too long. Still, you can't beat these for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING HEADPHONES!!","review":"All I can say is WOW! These headphones are great for any use starting from listening to music or home studio recording headphones (as I use them). I really love the spring on the cable that is right before the 1/8 or 1/4 inch headphone jack. It really helps it not to get damaged at the most sensitive area or the headphone cable. I also love the length of the headphone cable. I can run it straight from my audio interface or computer to my drum kit (in which I record) without a hassle. The Headphones Barely leak and have a good sounding bass when I'm listening to music or playing back the recording. The headphones are all right at noise reducing but when you play something, even on the lowest of volumes, you can't hear a thing besides the sound being played back. The design is great and very comfortable, and not to mention very classy. Overall great headphones especially for the price. Definitely the best headphones for the price. Recommended for and use."},{"rating":"2","title":"closest to studio phones for the $$$","review":"These have great sound and do cancel noise pretty well. They are not actual studio noise isolating.

I just got them a couple weeks ago and they're impressive. The cord is ridiculously long and it's not the most bass I've heard in headphones but it still \\"bumps\\". If you're using these with an iPod be sure to go to your playback settings and set the eq on something like Rock or Loudness. It makes a world of difference. These were a major step up from my $20 Sony standard monitor headphones. (UPDATE) I realize the fact that these headphones lack so much bass, I've asked for Beats by Dre studio hd headphones for Christmas. I hear the bass rocks on those. These are great for an overall sound. About a 3 of 5 rating for bass, that's with the \\"rock\\" setting on your iPod too. Kinda weak without that added EQ booster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great!","review":"I had more than one experience with this headphone before buying.So I was sure of what I was buying ...I was looking for a very comfortable with a good audio quality and that's exactly what I got.I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"Great sound quality, and it fits over my ears very welll.

They certainly outperform all the headphones that I've owned, and my decent desktop speakers as well. Very comfortable as well, I wear them practically all day.

I would say, however, that they are more suitable for rock than classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound and value","review":"I'm picking up sounds with these that I never knew existed with other headphones.

I think these are an amazing value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I've been using these headphones about a week now and I like them a lot. I'm not an audiophile or a music producer; I simply want some good-quality headphones to listen to my iPod without feeling like my head's being squeezed in a vice. These headphones do the job nicely. They're snug but have a lot of give. They do tend to make my right ear sore after a while but that's more because of my glasses. The headphones do exert pressure on the glasses, but much less than I thought they would. The earpieces do get warm (and I wish they were more cushion-y), but not unusually so; and since I'm simply sitting at a desk (vs. jogging or being outside) it doesn't bother me. I like the long, thick, heavy-duty cord; and the fact that it's only connected to one side of the headphones is fabulous. Sound isolation is okay--not as good as some other earphones, but decent. Once the music cranks up it blocks out a lot of outside noise. So overall, nothing negative to say about these guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Audio Quality","review":"Couldn't be happier with these headphones. The audio quality is great.

I use them for listening to an array of music, from rock to hip hop. The bass is a little weak when I'm playing rap beats but overall the sound is phenomenal.

They possess absolutely amazing sound quality, which is a must for me being an audiophile on a budget. However, I have noticed that they could be a little louder. My iphone and computer don't have the ability to get these bad boys up to their high volume range. I think this problem lies solely with modern day mp3 equipment and computer monitor outputs.

I saw that one reviewer seemed to be of the opinion that these headphones were built TOO heavily -- while that reviewer may have given it a lower rating because of its heavy construction, the build quality is one of the main reasons I got myself a pair. I expect these headphones to last a good long time!I had a pair of cheap Sennheiser headphones (HD 202 ii or something like that) for a while, but eventually one of the wires/connections broke and the sound no longer worked properly in one ear. However, these Audio-Technica headphones feature a heavy-gauge wire which ought to stand up to the daily abuse of a clumsy, klutzy, wire-jerking person like me. Also, my old Sennheisers didn't fully fit over my ear, so they were painful to wear after 2-3 hours. These Audio-Technicas cover my ears and are quite comfortable.The sound is great. I'm no golden-eared expert, but it seems pretty well-balanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great budget headphones","review":"I bought these headphones to help me study (I'm one of those people that like to listen to music when I'm doing homework, house music for math).

I loop these around my backpack top strap and it gets beaten up pretty good on commutes and moving around, but it's still works fine. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it hurts my ears after a while, but that might be due to my big ears (like Will Smith)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for money","review":"These phones have exceeded my expectations.

If the other reviewers had had to pay double the price, would their reviews still be as good as they are? Probably not. I was looking for quality sound, period. Not quality sound in relation to the pricetag. I compared the sound against my other much simpler and cheaper headphones, and there was hardly a difference.The lack of quality in this item is simply forgiven by the other reviewers because they were not that demanding, because they hadn't paid much for it.

Not only is the headphone irreparably broken, now the tip of the plug is stuck in my computer, the sound does not work, and my techies at the university where I work tell me that I will have to change the motherboard if I want my sound back.

Accurate sound, nice bass response. Really really comfortable. I record with these as my monitor headphones. Not sure if I would mix with them, but I'm not a mix engineer. But as a singer who has to wear these for hours on end, they never disappoint. I also use them for personal use, walking around with my iPod, they just provide excellent sound. Only downside is after years of wear, the fabric starts to come off the headphones a little, sometimes leaving pieces behind on your ear. Not a big deal, but after 5 years, I decided to buy a new pair for this reason.

Note: I don't have a big head.Audio Technica ath-m30The sound on these was just okay, and they sit on the ear (not around the ear), so they don't isolate well at all. They are more comfortable than the 280s and much lighter, but they also feel a little weird (being on the ear), and I don't know why anyone would buy closed headphones that don't isolate.Shure SRH440I think these sound the best. Maybe not quite as clear as the Senns, but they are more dynamic. They feel less like the sound is in a tin can. The sound feels closer. They are very well made. Probably the best made of the bunch.

Just listen to \\"Bound\\" and \\"Floor\\" and you'll feel like shouting along. The vocals are excellent-gruff, passionate, loud, and raw. Most of the songs are just pure energy, but the slower songs are awesome too. \\"Arms Can't Stretch\\" and \\"Eating the Filler\\" are quite anthematic. With this CD, Hot Water Music took emocore into a new league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be better...","review":"The DVD has a lot of cool things about it.

ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Behind Jaws as a Great Shark Movie","review":"Upon the recommendation of a friend who's also a shark-lover, I bought this DVD, hoping for the best. I was not disappointed. It's the based-on-a-true-story movie of a group of people who encounter boat trouble while out in the middle of nowhere. The nearest island is 12 miles away and they have to decide whether to attempt to swim to the island or remain on the boat and hope help arrives. The ones who decide to \\"swim for it\\" encounter (of course) sharks. What makes this film better than most shark movies is there are no fake sharks but footage of real sharks incorporated into the movie. The storyline is a good one and the actors, while primarily unknown, are believable in their roles. Anyone who likes a really good shark movie with on-the-edge-of-your-seat moments will thoroughly enjoy this film. Although Jaws is the best shark movie out there, this film, along with 12 Days of Terror, is an exceptional shark movie and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you might expect","review":"Intense.

I saw it as being rather critical of the female sex -- and rightly so. I myself am not very fond of women. I much prefer the company and companionship of men. This novel shows women at their worst--overly emotional, indecisive, manipulative, jealous of each other, irrational, concerned with the petty things in life, etc. The men of the novel are constantly being wounded by their women, and constantly complain that women are nothing but trouble and have a knack for creating problems, often over petty issues. SInce I am really not generally fond of women, my sympathies throughout this novel were on the side of the poor men who were attempting to cope with their women.Despite this, I enjoyed the book. I read it as I watched the film. The film was quite true to the book, and added a great ending ... beautifully done.

For about 300 pages I was thinking this is really good but at about page 385 nothing seemed to be jelling so I put it down for a few days only to start again at the end to find that the author died before she had finished. There was enough to go on however so that wasn't a big problem. The problem is that the really sad husband/wife relationship was never developed (did I miss it?)I would really advise anyone to read Wives and Daughters:In Half the Time instead of this. Normally I would not want to read a condensed book. For Instance, Thackeray's Vanity Fair must be read in all of its 743 page glory.But see the movie Vanity Fair (first?)

The CritterTrail is a nice combo of wire and plastic and it's smaller which is perfect for our single tiny hamster, Skipperdee. It was really easy to put together and looks like it'll be easy to clean. I gave this cage 4 stars because, as other reviewers have noted, the water bottle is terrible--extremely leaky. It has to stay in the habitat because it's a plug but I emptied it right away and attached the old water bottle to the side of the new cage. What I'll probably do is get a cage attachment to connect where the water bottle is now so the empty bottle won't take up space. The wheel isn't silent, but not too bad - it's quieter than the old metal squeaky wheel. The handle is nice so my kids can take Skipperdee to school on Pet day and not have a gigantic cage to haul around. All in all, it fits our needs well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attach With Another Cage","review":"This cage is very great for hamsters as long as you attach it to another cage with a tube. Even for a dwarf hamster, it's small! I bought this cage for my first hamster, she was a dwarf hamster, and she was always bitting on the wires. I researched it alittle and I found that they do that when they're bored and when they need more room. So, I bought another cage and some tubes and put them together. Now, my hamster never bits on the wire. Instead, she plays in the tubes and the houses I'd bought for her. Another bad thing I didn't like was how small the wheel was, her back must have been hurting her because the middle of the wheel hit her back.But for a baby dwarf hamster, this cage was great. Just make sure to get another real some!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mice can chew to freedom!","review":"It is very cute but has a couple of design flaws, and the same goes for all crittertrail products. a determined mouse such as mine can chew off any bits of plastic that are jutting out, such as the pieces that the metal bars slot into. thinking it was the small size upsetting her, i bought a tunnel and a burrowing cage, but she chews the hinges off the top of the burrow. as a result, i have covered the inside of the bars with cardboard and duct tape, and sealed off the parts of the cage she can escape from at night, such as the top compartment of the burrow. also i haven't seen her drink from the bottle once, so i have to put jar lids on the floor for her to drink from. she seems happier since I boarded things up, but we'll see what tonight brings. if you have a contented mouse, these are great fun, and a good purchase since you can expand on it as much as you like. but if you have a chewer, spend your money on a simpler tougher cage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my sons dwarf hamsters.","review":"I had bought this cage at the store where we purchased his hamsters. When I saw this was less than $15, I ordered a second one from amazon. I figured it would be easier for my 8 year old to just transfer them from cage to cage and then cleaning the empty one and having it ready for when the other needs changed. My son likes that it has the portable handle so he can take them from room to room. My only complaint is that his hamsters seem to want to party at 4am every morning and I end up hearing the wheel going around like crazy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Budgerigar magazine","review":"this magazine is one of the greatest there is.

This book along with Haunted Stars written around the same time, have a darker psychological tone than many comparable sf books of the era.

The second day, he started diving out the windows. The third day, he had reduced it to a pile of rubble. Granted, he is much harder on toys than other children might be and he doesn't understand how to restrain his impulses, but unless your child is quite docile, the house probably won't hold up.

The bias begins on the dust cover (insinuating that Truman knew this would be the start of the Cold War). The book goes downhill from that point. selecting the low estimates of US losses and providing a revisionist view of the bombing (guess what--the Japanese approach to existance where the country supercedes self was real hence kill the 'Round Eye' who are invading our country) and would have resulted in horrible US losses. As is often true about revisionist history, no real attempt is made to project what would have happened if the war draged on and the Soviets participated in the proposed invasion of Japan. It is hard to comprehend how such a poorly written book made it past any editorial staff."},{"rating":"2","title":"reasons why we bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki","review":"Book details the reasons why the U.S.A. used the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Generally the main reason given was that an American invasion of Japan would have cost half a million American casualties. The author also states several other reasons. Among them: the American belief in unconditional surrender, impressing the Soviets, and Truman's racism. There might be some truth in these areas, however the Japanese military would never have debated using a weapon like this. They waged total war, are we as Americans not supposed to wage total war when the other side is? Ron, if the bombs saved U.S. lives, I think it was worthwhile using these devices. Truman did the right thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not This Time, Ron","review":"Dr. Takaki has earned a reputation as America's most prolific (and generally accurate) historian of Asian America over the past three decades. It saddens me, though, to see such an otherwise careful historian tarnish his reputation with a work whose accessibility will find it being read by secondary students who may not balance his account of the bombing with other viewpoints. I certainly hope the history teacher who reviewed and used this book demonstrated such objectivity in his lessons over this issue. I dread to think what will be thought of our involvement if students are left to Takaki's impressions. Aside from the historical inaccuracies in the book, I find it interesting that so little attention is given to the Japanese (military and civilian) culpability. Ron, you're usually on target, but not this time. If one wants a real read on this issue, I recommend \\"Truman and the Hiroshima Cult.\\" Here's hoping you drop out of that cult, Ron!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To much American mind set, not enough japanese mind set.","review":"The author seams to have predetermined that useing the bomb on Japan was a bad thing. Try reading \\"Japans Longest Day\\". It was writen by a group of Japanese historians about Aug. 13, 1945. It describes how untill the bomb was droped on Hiroshima the Japanese Government and Military leadership was planing to contest the war to the last Japanese life rather than suffer the indignity of surrender. This would have been at a much higher cost of human life than the 73,000 who died at Hiroshima and 45,000 that died at Nagasaki. the cost w/o the bomb could have quite possibly have been tens of millions of Japanese and the total destruction of Japanese culture, which did survive the bomb. Altho it was changed forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need for A-bomb?","review":"This is a typical revisionist account attempting to prove that Dropping the A-bomb was not militarily necessary. I had to read this book for my WW2 class, with no counter-argument offered by my professor. This book will have you believe that US only dropped the A-bomb to stop the Russians from spreading to Asia, as indicative by Truman's hate of communism. The author gives a little bio of Truman to further his point. He asserts that the estimates of probable US dead in a mainland storming was execrated. This book is in essay form, putting out this type of argument. I think anyone who has any background in the Pacific campaign would not buy Takaki's argument. If one looks at the number of Japans dead at Okinawa and those dying in US fire bombings, the numbers killed by A-bombs don't seem as staggering."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Fence","review":"I wasn't very impressed by this book.

Just listen to the polished and multicromatic playing by Queyras, his cello sound is powerfull, brilliant but also mild and sweet. Tharaud understands perfectly the sometimes concertante role of the piano in this work and did an excellent job with wise decisions and good taste. There's no other version as good as this, only the recordings by Wispelwey and Bylsma with period cellos and pianoforte are competition but I think this piece sounds better in modern cello and piano but with historically informed performance. Queyras is one of the best cellists of our time, in great shape always, with baroque and modern cello. The rest of the pieces by Schubert in this recording are great as the brief works of XXth century by Webern and Berg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music from the past","review":"I'm 78 yr's old, I used to dance to this music.

This game also has somewhat of an RPG element, as each member of the team gains new skills. This game isn't as intense as X-Com, but it's very hard because the player has to plan very carefully. You're not commanding a battalion of soldiers. You're leading a group of specialists. Each character specializes in a very important skill, and you're going to need every single character alive. To do that, you have to strategize, avoid detection, cover, figure lines of sight, keep track of movement points, and watch accuracy ratings. And if a character gets hit, you can kiss him or her goodbye because he or she's not getting up unless another character nails the attacker.

The first day I had it I measured some of the corners in my house - 90.0 - 90.4 degrees- no problem. I then measured the angle of my table saw blade to the table - which must be exactly 90 to get a straight cut.

The pieces range from middle eastern influenced tunes such as Nebuchadnezzar to the bopesque The Governor. However, the most imaginative and illustratrive composition is the Album's title track.

The originality, creativity, and talent seen in this TV show is surpassed by none. The comic genius of the writers and of, in particular, Leslie Grossman, blows me away every time.

They remind one of a younger, more innocent time, and there is a sweetness about them. I can't say enough about this man's voice-it's awesome. The phrasing is so relaxed and beautiful, the lyrics simple and somewhat cliched, but that's ok, and again, there is such a sweet quality to it all, and very romantic.

And Burg's witty, clean writing and meticulous attention to detail make him real -- and relavent. This book chronicles a fascinating time in history, and exposes an interesting bit-player, warts and all.

It has faithfully served me for normal use, but after 9/11 I purchased an American Flag and wanted to mount it on our brick facade. I quickly discovered that I needed a hammer drill and after looking at all the major brands, I settled on the Milwaukee 14.4V cordless hammer drill. First, I am not a contractor and I do not need any more power than 14.4V. Second, after handling similar products from Porter Cable and Dewalt, the Milwaukee handle was more slim and fit my hand much better. In addition the Milwaukee weighed less and had a metal chuck and reversible battery. I took it home charged up the battery in one hour and was able to easily drill in hammer mode four holes and then drive the screws in the brick to hold the flag bracket.

Good ergonomics and handling with the following exception: Narrow blade opening in the table and the ample blade guard makes it a bit difficult to get a good view of the blade and your cut line while cutting. I thought a saw with the blade on the left would minimize this problem, yet with some adjustment from my usual cutting position, it still works pretty good.... its just in those situations when you don't have the 'ideal' position to make your cut that you really notice it.

It is very durable. Much more so than the yellow ones I've owned. It will do anything you ask of it. It cuts pretty fast compared to some other cordless saws.

Released after he had cleaned up his life, it's some of his most powerful guitar playing and lyrics. As an instrumental, Riviera Paradise is fantastic. However, the addition of the live tracks make this a must have. Personally, I would buy a CD of the live version of \\"Life Without You\\" alone. I was fortunate enough to have driven Stevie and his band to a 1988 show in Santa Barbara, CA, and was priveledged to watch the show from backstage. The most memorable part was his spoken interlude during \\"Life Without You\\" about where he had been in his life, and how much he cherished it at that point. When he tragically died, the first song KLOS in Los Angeles played, was \\"Life Without You.\\" This version with the interlude was never available until now, and it only serves as a reminder of what we truly lost when Stevie died."},{"rating":"2","title":"SVR Was The Midas Of the Blues Here He Is Platinum & Beyond","review":"Of course there will never be another, Stevie ain't coming back.

If these scenes of torment and danger had some creative wit to them then at least the movie might have achieved a semblance of social satire, but ultimately it is just a silly gorefest that exploits the illegal immigrant issue.I watched this because I'm a Scott Mechlowicz fan.

For better Nina listening, try Collectable Record's Nina Simone At Town Hall/The Amazing Nina Simone, Nina At Carnegie Hall/Nina With Strings, or Nina Simone Forbidden Fruit/Sings Duke Ellington....or any of the Phillips or RCA releases...at this stage in her career, Nina Simone proves in this pathetic recording that she has lost the ability to sing...her honey & vinegar sound that we all know and love is missing; what was so well loved in her recordings during the Colpix/Phillips/RCA years doesn't manifest itself...no studio machinery could mask the fact that Nina Simone should now stick to playing the piano or retire..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mighty Good, but something's missin'","review":"This DVD collection is mighty good w/ sound, picture & visual innovation.

Not all of there are slow sentimental love songs, like \\"Just One of Those Things\\" and \\"How About Me?\\", so it's not really something to cuddle to.

I was ready to fall in love from the flat \\"Sout-Side\\" Chicago intonations of Earl Pionke introducing Steve. However, I am a mite disappointed with the sound quality. It is hard to hear what Steve says between songs, although the singing and music are quite clear. The song choices were interesting. So many of my favorites are missing, but there are also songs I had never heard before. Steve Goodman was an amazing guy. We were so lucky to have him with us, even for so brief a time.Also recommended: the DVD Steve Goodman, Live from Austin City Limits, and More.

I am one of the biggest fans of David Gemmell, and it disappoints me to state that this book is by far, the worst David Gemmell book, I have ever read.It is almost as if he ran out of ideas and gave up half way and tried to end the book as quickly as possible.Avoid this book, don't even borrow it from the library.However, I gave it 2 stars as I cannot bear the thought of david gemmell receiving the lowest rating available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book, but not breaking any new ground","review":"This is the last (4th) book in Gemmel's Rigante series.

Kennedy. A true and bizarre story told by a reporter covering the daily happenings of the trial. Although the author's bias is evident due to his personal liking for the defendant, nonetheless, his insightfulness into the legal wranglings is incredibly interesting.

As a citizen of California, a history major and a fan of ghost stories, I feel like this book did not provide enough information. The author gives the bare minimum of information. For example, she writes about a haunted record store in Sacramento. I live in Sacramento and I cannot figure out from her vague description what record store she's talking about. It would have been nice to have addresses of these haunted locations so we could go check them out for our selves if we wanted to.

You should probably take into account my bias: I'm a flat-out proponent of organizational democracy which has informed my work for years. But even if you disagree with the authors' premise - that the tide of history is running against hierarchy, bureaucracy, and autocracy in our organizations - you will want to hear their case.

The various plots within the book seem disconnected, as though one has had to read previous Loretta Lawson mysteries to know what is going on. An odd tie-in at the end to a previous love affair left me confused. Intellectual snobbism seems to run through the book. References to obscure authors and their work have little to do with the plot, and come across as an excuse to self-aggrandize, rather than adding to the reader's interest. I was very disappointed with this book, as the plot description seemed intriguing, but the characterizations bordered on actively unpleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I loved the heroine of the book, and I loved the references to art and culture.

Up until this latest release I had always been a satisfied reader. I will admit that not all of her books have been on a scale of 10 (true 10's) but I've liked her humour and style of writing. This latest book was unnecessarily violent and at times crude which did not bring much to the story. Being a true fan I have not yet abandoned my favorite writer, but please note Sandra, that I don't care to purchase and read an other type of book like \\"Unspeakable\\" soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a keeper","review":"Authors don't need to write the same books over and over again and that is exactly why I am pleased to add Unspeakable to my Brown collection. This is a more mainstream book, true, than her previous romantic suspense; and perhaps, in one part, especially, too graphically violent (hey, okay I hate the bad guys Sandra, let's leave the \\"kidnapping\\" and its results out next time). The characters were intriguing, and I didn't solve the murder (I usually do). Though the book was unexpectedly complex I believe it to be one of Brown's best. So much so that after buying the hardback, I am now enjoying the unabridged tape during ride time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reaching for male readers","review":"I have been a fan of Ms Brown forever. I should have known her latest, Unspeakable, was a departure, when my father-in-law asked to borrow it after reading the flap. Ms. Brown has become more \\"mainstream\\" over the years but she now seems to be actively seeking male readers with more hardcore sadomasochism and violence. There are so few authors who really do romantic suspense well - Sandra Brown is one of them. Let's hope that Nora Roberts doesn't decide to take a turn writing in this hardcore genre, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Why are some of the top authors changing to suspense/romance instead of sticking to the kind of writing that got them where they are now? Sandra Brown's \\"Unspeakable \\" seems just that kind of book. I was glad to see she came out with a new one, it's been awhile. But I was very disappointed after reading it. At the end, it seems she couldn't make up her mind on how to end it so she came up with a lot of different senarios and lets the reader decide if they like it . Are they all trying to keep up with Mary Higgens Clark or Danielle Steel who crank out these kind of books once or twice a year.. Maybe money talks, which is a shame, since she should have put more thought into this one before she sent this to the publisher. Sorry Sandra, better luck next time. Stick to books like Adam's Fall and Texas Sage/Lucky/Chase, and Tidings of Great Joy which your readers have come to love and leave the suspense novels to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"unspeakable\\" is not worth talking about","review":"Sandra Brown's previous 3 novels (\\"The Witness,\\" \\"Exclusive\\" and \\"Fat Tuesday\\") have all been intelligent, well-crafted stories of suspense while also employing a sophisticated usuage of prose. It is with great shock that Ms. Brown has come up with this new novel which is, quite frankly, an embarrassment both to the author and reader. The writing here, immature at best, is appalling. To reduce one's intelligence by using adjetives such as \\"doofus\\" to describe a character is inexcusable. Added to poor prose is a worse story - one that holds as much interest as a leaky faucet. Everything combined makes \\"Unspeakable\\" virtually unreadable. We are all allowed to make mistakes and to learn from them. Let's hope Ms. Brown has learned from this unfortunate endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"unspeakable cruel","review":"I almost read all books of Sandra Brown so being a best seller I bought this book.

I had to force myself to pick it up; finally I gave up. This is a demented \\"Of Mice and Men\\" on a drug trip gone bad. I am not squeamish when it comes to graphic descriptions in a murder novel, but there is something about the descriptions in this book that turned my stomach, starting in the first pages with the description of a disembowling of a mouse.

It honestly, truly disturbs me that this sadistic trash is what's being peddled to the reading public.

I wanted to quit reading it many times, but I kept thinking it would get better. It was so choppy...changing characters way too often. If this is Sandra's new trend in writing she has made a big mistake! Or, she needs to just call herself a mystery writer now. I agree with others that I would like to toss this book in the trash and never see it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"The best Sandra Brown novel since Witness. The story was riveting and characters were very well written. It was a pleasure reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"S-L-O-W","review":"I purhased the audio version of this book & could not even finish the first CD. It was so slow & uninteresting. I just could not get into it. I am going to re-sell it on eBay & hopefully make some of my money back on this stinker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending was a let down","review":"Although I am a fan of Sandra Brown, I must admit I was disappointed with this book. The middle seemed too slow and when I got to the end I was extremely disappointed. It seemed as though the deadline was coming up fast and she needed to finish it quickly. I invested time in reading it and felt let down by the last chapter and Jack's speech at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude and disgusting","review":"I have read nearly all of Sandra Brown's books but this is the worst one she has written as far as being too graphic. The love story was good but the killing and preverted sex were not anything I care to read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super page turner.","review":"I admit that this is my first time to read a book by Sandra Brown, and I can promise that it won't be my last. It takes real skill to make each and every character on the printed page so unique that you can practically visualize him/her each time that character's name is mentioned, but Brown does it here. And the plots and sub-plots mingle and flow together in truly believable and artistic fashion.Romance and violence are meshed together in a story that works well. Carl and Myron made me cringe. However, there were scenes in which my heart broke for Myron who seemed, when all was said and done, to be exactly what you would expect from a profoundly retarded adult whose only role models and friends (?) had been violent, hateful psychopaths.Somebody is going to do a screenplay with this book one day. I plan to attend the movie when it happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"UNSPEAKABLE is a story filled with mystery, murder, violence, and tragedy revolving around a man with a troubled past seeking redemption, a widowed mother who is deaf and mute and afraid to love again, an aging sheriff determined to solve a mystery from long ago and about the two vicious killers who are hunting them as prey killing anyone in their way.UNSPEAKABLE is definitely not a story for the weak at heart or stomach. The violence is realistically detailed. The truthfullness- the reality check instilled this story makes this book quite unique among Brown's previous works. It is suspenseful yet passionate keeping you on the alert ready to hide under the covers or so hot you're aching for a shower. I definitely recommend it. You'll love it. Trust me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder, mystery, romance and more!","review":"This is the first book of Sandra Brown's that I have read--and it made a great impact! I read this book in only four days (every spare minute I had was spent reading)! This book hooks you in the first chapter and keeps you wanting more. I love how descriptive Brown makes her characters and how she puts you right into each scene. Some scenes are a little gory, but well written all-around. Welcome to my library collection!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unspeakable just never \\"got off the ground\\"","review":"As a newcomer to Sandra Brown (having read Fat Tuesday and Exclusive) I had high hopes for this new release. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. It took forever to \\"set the stage\\" and the thrill and excitement I had seen in her previous books was lacking here. Character development could have been better or at least more pointed.If this had been my first Sandra Brown I probably would not have gone back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Edgy Novel","review":"After reading the reviews, I thaught I would give it a shot, and I just finished it and most of the reviews didn't even compare to the book. A lot say its disgusting and boring, its definetly not boring, theres all sorts of surprises exspecially at the ending, the ending is great, its where most of the book comes to gether. I'll admit the biggening is a little slow, but after 100 pages your into the book, its like you got to keep reading to see what happens, and it worth it. So if your worried its to gory, I'll say this much, you probably see worse stuff on TV. As for the rape and murder, that stuffs notr even detailed, its just like some one died and thats that. No details about it. Thats what I was curiuse about from the beginng, I was expecting more details after reading the reviews, but there weren't hardly any. So if you think this is gory, I dont suggest Breath Of Scadel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Her Best...But Worth It Anyway !","review":"While I remain a devoted fan of Sandra Brown's, I was hoping for 'UNSPEAKABLE' to concentrate more on Anna and Jack, than I was about the twisted, and perverse highjinks of the Herbold brothers. Still, the story was a deep and powerful one, and Ms. Brown painted for her readers, very clear and concise pictures of her characters. Her villianous siblings were two low-life's you just could'nt help wishing evil things on! And of course she has us rooting all the while , that true love will conquer all. While it may not be her best or most romantic book, it's well worth the read ; as are all Sandra Brown novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Sandra Brown","review":"Having read all of Sandra Brown's books and enjoying them, I was total disappointed with Unspeakable. I can't believe Sandra Brown wrote this trash. After reading the first twenty pages I knew this book was not for me. I forced myself to read 75 pages thinking it would get better. . .WRONG! I gave the book away just to get it out of my house, that's how bad it was. It was on the edge of being porno material. Don't waste your time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Sandra Brown story I ever read","review":"I love Sandra Brown. I can't wait until her next book comes out. This story was boring. Hardly any romance. I was more interested in the bad guys than the good guys. I hated the way she had the retired sherriff in the story. He could have been left out. It could have been a great story if she wrote it different. I didn't like how the story ended. Very disapointed . It won't stop me from reading another book from her. She is one of the best romance writers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed and disgusted with this book.","review":"I have never thrown a book out before, but with this one, I felt the only thing to do it justice was the garbage can. I have read every one of Sandra Brown's books and was very disappointed in the subject matter and disgusted with the darkness in this novel. I thought better of her. I may not ever read another book by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing something...","review":"This was my first Sandra Brown novel. The first few chapters were s-l-o-w. This book did not hold my interest and I found myself reading this book only when I was using the bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion...","review":"This is my first book by Sandra Brown, I picked it up after reading the synopsis on the back cover. I became immediately enthralled in the book and enjoyed it until the very end, wondering who the killer was. I'll admit though, about 3/4ths of the way through I had a guess, and it was correct. That's kind of cool though.Ok, I've read several reviews on this book that I am very disappointed with. I don't know if they are coming from people who have weak stomach's or what, but their comments are a little off base to me. I did not feel that this book was too gory or that it was overboard in the scenes. Sure the descriptions were down the tee, but isn't that what you want when you're reading a book? Do you honestly think that when you pick up a murder mystery book that some blood and gore are out of place? Isn't that what murder is? I just think it's unfair for those comments to deter people from reading this book that I thought was a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickeningly Violent","review":"I gave it 2 stars because it kept my interest right up to the end. However, I'm starting to think the people who write these thrillers have a contest going to see who can come up with the most nauseatingly sadistic killers. I'm not exactly a wimp, but I had to skip over large chunks of the book to avoid reading the hidiously detailed rape and murder scenes. I cannot believe a woman could write about a 14-year old girl getting raped and sodomized just to \\"jazz up\\" her book. That's really low. It made me think, \\"Anything for a buck, I guess.\\" Anyhow, it did keep me reading to the end but the disgusting language and violence made me wonder what kind of person Sandra Brown is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gory, strange","review":"Good because it's Sandra Brown, but gory, vulgar and it vaguely reminded me of the movie starring Jane Wyman: \\"Johnny Belinda\\".Sandra's written some really great books, but this one was too violent and descriptive of the rape scenes for me. As a woman author, she could've toned it down a little. We get the idea; no need to elaborate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I have been a Sandra Brown fan and have read quite a few of her books. But I have to say \\"Unspeakable\\" really is not good and not worth the time to read it. The first 1/3 of the book developed slowly and lacked the building of suspense to keep me engaged. The whole plot in general was boring and disjointed. I really liked that she created a main character that was deaf but strong, caring, and intelligent. However, the whole book was just not an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting","review":"This book is exciting, relaxing and full of suspision. Other readers who are used to reading S.Brown and disappointed should relax a little in their life and let her explore. Gosh, do you eat the same food everyday?

I usually can't put her books down until I have read every word. This one was a struggle to finish. I felt she was so focused on trying to develop the plot that she forgot to develop the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I've never read Sandra Brown before this book and never will again. The thing that really disturbed me was the relish with which she seemed to write about sadistic violence. The impression that she was having a good time depicting pain and gore completely disgusted me, to the point I literally threw the book out to get it away from me. Sick stuff. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I too Love Sandra Brown. A close friend of mine gave me two of her books one day- I read them and was HOOKED. I own about 40, I've read about 10 thus far, and I have to say that this one was the HARDEST. I too found it VERY HARD to stick with and finish \\"Unspeakable,\\" even though I had already made it half way through. I did finally force myself to finish, but did I mention how hard it was? There are so many stories to follow and so many characters to keep straight. It was very dry and very bla. I did not enjoy it AT ALL. The end is meant to throw you off, but it only left me flat. PLEASE SKIP THIS ONE. Read Two Alone (my personal favorite) or Exclusive instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely boring","review":"Usually I like Sandra Brown's books,but this was disappointing!

I was really disappointed in Sandra Brown, I have read most of books, especially her earlier romance novels. She was a witty sensual writer and I enjoyed her earlier work, but this book could not capture my attention. The characters were not interesting enough to keep reading. I'm glad I bought the paperback version. And I will have to agree with the reader from Rochester Minnesota, this book goes in the garbage. I wish Sandra Brown would go back to her original style and write romance. She wrote well and it was enjoyable. Her current style of writing is not enjoyable, and I don't think I will be buying any of her new books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had heard so much about Sandra Brown and her writings ~ that I was thrilled when a friend loaned this book to me. Finally, I can see what everyone raves about whenever they talk about this author.I was very disappointed. This book is way too brutal and graphic for my taste ~~ it is nothing but raw sex and violence and graphic murder scenes. I kept reading to see what would happen and never did finish this book. It is one of the very few books I have never finished reading. I was really disgusted ~~ and gave it back to my friend without too much comment.I have no desire now to read any of her books ~~ which is sad because I am always up for new authors to discover.

This might not be what other Prine fans want to hear, but just because I am glad he's seemingly beaten cancer, I am not going to praise this weaker piece of work. I would have liked to have heard something from John Prine which didn't sound like a song he'd previously released. I've already got his old music and to be asked to pay for a slightly re-worked version under the guise of new music doesn't cut it with me. On the other hand, if you're new to John Prine, you can buy either this or his older music and you'll probably be happy.

Unfortunately the lyrics lack creativity and the music is just a case of John taking his older songs and putting new words to them... I listened to the CD one time.... and sadly put it away... I am not sure why he did this. Maybe he needed money.... Still, I can seperate this CD from the others and excuse it... nothing John could do could now will change or tarnish his previous body of work.... but I will be extremely cautious before I buy a new CD from John if he makes another one.If you want to discover John... any of his earlier CDs will do..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, Creative, Honest, Prine","review":"This CD is classic John Prine.

Enjoy!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sweet","review":"This CD is interesting. It's a far cry from his last album nearly ten years ago, and thats just fine. Where Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings was bright and bouncy...Fair and Square is as the title suggests. It feels much more akin to his early work and aside his deeper voice (Which suits the songs better) fit in with his classics likeHello In There, Sam Stone and Christmas in Prison. This is not so much evolution but refinement. Each and every song has it's glory and failures...but thats whats always made John a paragon of modern folk. Some Songs will bring the sting of nearly consimated tears while others leave the tingle of memory. He bits...as he always has at what he sees as injustice and can simply leave thoughts behind, even once his raspy voice has stoped humming.

That's not a knock, just a fact. The albums following the great \\"Bruised Orange\\" have been spotty but not completely without merit. Glimpses of the greatness of Mr. Prine were still there to hear. I think this one succeeds better than most of those did. What I've always loved about JP was his ability to give me a grin while making me think about something serious and relevant. The last two songs do exactly that. They show him in his best light, just being who he is. No pretension. And the musicianship throughout this cd rivals all of his recordings put together. As far as humans not being human, I'll just skip over it and hope that JP remembers the lyrics he wrote to Aimless Love's \\"People putting people down.\\" And, for those who share his politics I can only say that the incredible anti-war song \\"Sam Stone\\" says so much more without the rhetoric."},{"rating":"2","title":"good birds","review":"This item is an over my desire and worth listening.

Unlike the other reviewer, I actually found these to be a bit better then the 210 pack of the short shots, but I still must given them four stars.

I searched everywhere for a decent price and thought this was the winning set (little did I know it wasnt)I waited a good 3 weeks in anticipation for them to arrive. When the day finally came, I unwrapped the box and to my surprise was two cheap looking shakers. In the pictures they looked cermamic and not plastic (they are plastic).

This was a very nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your eyes wider","review":"The previous reader seems to be wearing blinders that allow a look only at this ethnic aspect of Gillan's poems. Too bad. There is much more here about motherhood, heritage, city life, growing up and yes, about all those things in a frame of Italian- American Culture. Read \\"Arturo\\" & \\"Public School #18\\" and see if you don't agree. Gillan has worked hard, in her anthologies, poems and work as an editor and teacher to promote the cause of poetry and the dropping of ethnic & racial barriers. Take a closer look."},{"rating":"1","title":"The contents are uninspiring and the craft dull","review":"This book of poetry contains too much of the same complaint and does not lift our spirits. Generally I enjoy \\"ethnic poetry,\\" but not this. This author whom I've never read before, seems to be faking sincerity in order to join in the chorus. Felix Stefanile, Daniela Gioseffi and Diane DiPrima do a much better job on these themes. They have the craft to lift our spirits and tell their stories, too. Check them out on Amazon.com. They are better writers from the Italian American culture. Much finer crafters of poetic art. I wanted to like this book, but couldn't. Too stale and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimentality and Pedestrian Prose","review":"Gillan who fiercely took back her Italian name only when multiculturalism became fashionable, is bascially a sentamentalist. Her poetry does not rise to the truly poetic. She needs to go back to square one and study the really good Italian American poets like Felix Stefanile, Diane DiPrima, John Ciardi, Daniela Gioseffi, Donna Masini, Joseph Parisi, Dana Gioia, Maria Fama, so many others, who can write with more than old-fashioned violin strings. I had a real desire to like the book, but I was disappointed. These other authors are highly recommended reading, evenif this Italian American poet falls rather flat. There are really norisks here. The language is pedestrian. Nothing original. Que piccata!

Perhaps at the time it sounded much more progressive than it does now, but that doesn't evade the fact that nowadays it sounds fairly tired.And it's absolutely painful to hear Masekela obviously missing notes on the trumpet and playing, well, not to be too blunt, very poorly indeed. His tone is blaring and his pitch is none too sure. And in spite of the alleged \\"African\\" nature of the record, I hear a ton of western influences, not least John Coltrane and Miles Davis compositionally.Overall, I was somewhat less than impressed with this, and I can't recommend it. Perhaps Masekela's other records are better, but based on this one I would have to say you'd have to prove it to me first before I plunked down any more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, satisfying and healthy!","review":"Rooibos is a healthy alternative to black teas.

He isn't even so much worried about hearing her talk, she is just so soft and he has to have her for bed time, naps, and just sitting on the couch playing. I can't imagine what we would do if we lost her. She's as important to him as his blankie is! He used to watch the show a lot around the time he turned 2. He doesn't watch it much anymore as he is hooked on Clifford these days, but he still has Blue in hand.:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bit","review":"I run rodeo and this bit works out great.

But when I moved on to Emily, I truly fell in love. In fact, I spent my entire 10 year old savings on LM Montgomery books after reading Emily of New Moon.The Emily books are darker, more grown up, than the Anne books, and a year never goes by that I don't reread Emily. The heartbreaks (losing her dad, having to choose which cat to leave behind), the fears, and the triumphs that Emily goes through felt true when I was a young girl, and still feel true nearly two decades later.It breaks my heart that LM Montgomery books periodically go out of print. I encourage anyone who wants to own her books to get them when they see them, or they may have to wait a long time for them to come back into print."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of LMM's best!","review":"This is a delightful book! In some ways, it is like Anne of Green Gables--Emily is a orphan who goes to live with strict guardian--but it has its own special charm. The characters are more developed, though I LOVED Marilla, Matthew, and the rest of Avonlea, Cousin Jimmy, Aunt Nancy, Aunt Elizabeth, Dr.Burnley, and Mrs.Kent(Teddy's mother) is even more interesting. The Murray clan is absolutely hilarious! And Emily's friends are pretty special too. They are all unique--hot-tempered Ilse, crude but lovable Perry, and Teddy(my favorite!) Each episode is a work of art--and the adventures are even more delightful looking through Emily's eyes in her letters to her Father. Emily gives a special tang to everything--she isn't as sweet as Anne or as lovable as Pat, but there is something about her--mysterious, passionate, ambitious--which makes her just as delightful, or even more so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading","review":"Although Emily has a lot of things in common with Anne--both eleven-year-old orphans who live on Prince Edward Island in the nineteenth century--she is a different kind of girl, and hers is a different kind of story. It's great from beginning to end, and the mystery of Ilse's mother had me on the edge of my seat--great suspense. The only thing I didn't like about the story was that it said mean, untrue things about atheists. But I suppose it was a product of its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similar to Anne of Green Gables for 11-12 yrs. and up","review":"Written by the same author who wrote \\"Anne of Green Gables\\", the story of Emily who comes to live at New Moon on Prince Edward Island is just as good. Emily, like Anne, is an orphan and is taken in by her mother's wealthy relatives. Being 11 yrs. old when the story begins, she has many things to learn about life and her place in the world. Not only is the book entertaining, but Emily solves an old mystery which affects the lives of some of her best friends. I would recommend it for ages 11-12 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, makes me want to write!","review":"Reading Emily of New Moon always makes me start picking up my pen and trying to write poems. I've learned I'll probably not succeed, but I still love the book and the urge to write that stays afterward. Emily is wonderful.Only, I personally liked Dean better. Better than Teddy, that is. He was an interesting character. Maybe it's just I'm sorry for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABRIDGED EDITION -- don't be fooled!","review":"First, I would like to state that Emily of New Moon is one of my all time favorite books (and series). However, this particular edition has been abridged -- great stuff has been edited to make it shorter for younger readers. While this edition will give you an idea of Emily, please read the full unshortened version! I read the original when I was about 11, and I certainly would have enjoyed it read aloud to me years earlier. If you want to introduce your child to to L.M. Montgomery, go for the real thing, not the shortened version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed from beginning to end and read it in a day.","review":"In Emily of New Moon I thought the first three chapters weren't as good as the rest of the book but it makes up for it. I think most everyone would enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author, Great series!","review":"Emily of New Moon, and the rest of the Emily series in general should not be missed. I first got addicted while watching the Emily of New Moon series on Canadian TV (I live in Detroit, MI - so I get a couple Canadian TV stations on cable). It really is a shame that the US does not support excellent shows like the Emily TV series. Anyhow, getting back on point, I picked up the Emily books and was equally (if not more) hooked. I would only add that I think the series will appeal to both men and women of all ages alike. It is just one of those types of series that is a good read for the whole family (not just girls). I loved the Anne of Green Gables series very much, but I think Emily of New Moon is even better than those classics. I rate all three books in the series must reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"After having read and enjoyed the Anne of Green Gables series as well as a few of L.M. Montgomery's other books, I was eager to start this book. It's hard for me to say who I like better - Anne, or Emily. But Emily is closer to my heart in the fact that we both love writing and cats.Emily's different - not as spunky as Anne, but she is a lovable character nonetheless. I found myself enjoying Emily's spirit and defiance, and loved the rest of the Emily series as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic book which gives a breathtaking view of life!","review":"Emily of New Moon is a book that starts a whole new adventure for me! I would say that Emily is my favorite character, for she is the one you get to know the best. She is in many ways like Anne of Green Gables. But she has a different personality. The setting in which this story takes place is realistic and you get a taste of what life was like around the turn of the century living in a town like the one Emily lives in. The way in which each character speaks lets you know what their personality is like. Emily has her hopes, ambitions and dreams for the future. She copes with her new life after losing both of her beloved parents, finds understanding from her new family and happiness from three new close friends. Above all, Emily discovers a wonderful hidden talent within her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book...","review":"I first read this book about four years ago, and I fell in love with it! Now, I read it about once a year, just to re-live it all. I read the \\"Anne\\" series first, and I think that the \\"Emily\\" series is just as good, if not better.

For all of its efforts, it does not convey a sense of the man who lived, but rather the man who haunts the imaginations of those who understand him the least.Unfortunately this documentary--so lauded as an excellent portrayal of Brown in biographical terms--is weighted down too heavily by the opinions of novelists and lacks a respect and balance in portraying Brown's religious orientation. The film omits key themes with respect to his working with blacks, and overall conveys the ivory tower biases that are so hard to challenge due to the politics of media and academia, despite the facts of history.

I had never really read anything before and I began this book out of boredom.50 years later...I am astounded to find out it is still in print!! Ive never forgotten the book, or Joe. It is the foundation for my love...my voracious need to read.Thank you Amazon, for having it in print and available. Now, not only my grandchildren..but my Great Granddaughter will have the chance to meet Joe and the family who nursed him back to health with love.Childrens book? maybe...but a book for ALL ages.

This book was read to me as a very young child, I believe I was probably seven. I was horrified and of course fell in love with Joe but it showed me that I could also do what the loving people in the book did and help poor creatures without a voice.I have now volunteered for many rescue agencies as well as rescued many animals myself. I think this book gave me as an animal lover, an outlet and a direction to go in to help aid animals in distress.As an adult I purchased my own copy of this book and plan on reading it to my own children.

I wish I had looked at the preview and read the \\"disclaimer\\" on the first page. This is basically an unedited scan of the book, so the text is full of typographical errors (problems with text recognition and punctuation). I have not yet read the entire book, but in looking at the first few pages, I can already tell that it will be irritating to read this version. It will be similar to reading email from people that use no punctuation, capitalization, or spell-checking. I just hope that it does not detract too much from the story, which I am sure is good. If I find that reading this version gets to be too challenging, I will purchase another (regular) copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful vehicle for teaching humane treatment of animals","review":"Why are all the great books out of print?

There were a few slow, repetitive spots in the book but for the most part I liked it. Great character development. Truly creepy serial killer (I don't want him wearing MY body).

I'm one of those people who can't quit in the middle...If I were, I would have. He can take many pages to describe in the dryest manner some of the most uninteresting things...even things like describing exactly how the person's fingers wrap around an object in order to pick it up. So many times I simply wanted to scream \\"Get on with it man!!!\\" The two stars are for his imagination. The idea of a person dying while of on an OBE was fascinating in itself.

Then ... why wasn't it more entertaining?Jeff Daniels was barely there.

The actress is 11, but she looks like 7. I do enjoy movies with dogs, like Air Bud. Those are much better. I'm not really interested in seeing this movie. After all, right now I'm more into comedy and this just seems like a boring little kid's movie.

The story is about how individuals in a small town deal with loneliness. I will agree with what other reviewers have said about the dog. A lot of really heart-warming and good moments happen in this movie, but I was turned off by the way that they claimed that it was because of the influence of the girl's \\"friendly\\" dog, when really it was about a girl being a good neighbor. Hollywood also decided to throw in a lot of their inane \\"slapstick\\" moments which you've seen in every other movie with a dog in it, such as the dog's head-butting of the preacher's crotch."},{"rating":"2","title":"good adaptation","review":"A good adaptaion of the book Anna Shopia does a great job in her first live action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have in everylibrary","review":"LOVE LOVE LOVE This movie.

Along with \\"Four,\\" this recording sat in the vaults for close to 30 years before being issued on CD by Verve. Normally, I would say this is a four-star disc, as the material is mostly standards and not as adventurous as the Blue Note albums.

Some of the information doesn't exactly \\"prove\\" anything, rather it is more an account of possible correlation. It doesn't take hold of some of the information available on the subject, nor does it take into account some of the cypher that Bacon used to claim differences, which if true would contradict some of the statements made in the book, though I won't get into it.A good website to suplement the subject matter is sirbacon.orgThis is a great book by the way, and excellent to have in any investigation of the authorship. The book plates look great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Details of movie theater trade most intriguing","review":"Thompson's tale of fraud, murder, and adultery isunremarkable (compared to Thompson's other works) except in it's presentation of the politics of a small town.

I looked forward to this book to re-experience that on the page, but it dragged and just missed the mark for me. I guess I'm spoiled by the movies.The story developed with an alluring hook of a magical notion from the ancient past. Once this was fleshed out, the story just hit the mud. All I remember is the tedium of this mundane character trying every avenue of government he could think of to get someone else to take it off his hands. Boring!Every child dreams of having that kind of power at their disposal.It ends up in the anti-climax of water drifting into the gulf after a thousand mile journey down the Mississippi - diffuse and anonymous."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best little book you've never read","review":"I first heard of Zotz when I saw the awful film based on it made back in the '60s. There was something that made me curious about it and I began to search for it. It wasn't till just a little while ago I was able to acquire a copy. Considering it was written in the late 1940s I think it is quite good. I'm surprised someone hasn't tried to update it and make a new film based on it. It is the story of a man given a great power and his attempts to help his country during WWII with his power and it lampoons the government bureaucracy, politicians and general attitudes of the times. Some claim the book has something to do with the atomic bomb and the great power it gave to our country and our inability to use it wisely. I won't go there and someone else can intellectualize about this all they want. I will say that \\"Zotz\\" while a little dated is still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"By engish, for english","review":"The author is British plain and simple, and it show with whimsical sayings like 'monkey motion' and the like. Outstanding historical documentation, but the author overwhelms with minutiae like bore and stroke for every engine, and which cylinder bank is staggered forward.Also the author completely disregards the 180 degree V-12s (not boxing, boxing has 180 Vee angle with a 180 degree split crank journal) and spends too much time on VV12s (three banks of four cylinders).There are some errors in the coverage of modern engines, notably VW VR6 and W12 information. and the author fails to explain the inherrent balance of an inline six, and how any vee angle V12 is balanced, but not necessarily even firing.A good value, and the color photos are icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"kids love them","review":"They got them last Christmas and they still play with them.

Supporting cast has some recognizable regulars from other Monogram low budget productions, with the addition of Tom Neal, who's talent stood out. I'm giving this title a low rating not for the movie but for the terrible print. Much of the print has lines \\"dancing\\" across the middle of the picture...very distracting! A shame because the audio is fine, as is the remainder of the image. I hate to bad-mouth a distributor interested in selling Lugosi, but why bother with a print like this? This was selling at a dollar store, and was barely worth even that much.Oh, and I give the rest of the film about two and a half stars because it holds the viewers interest and is fairly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone's got to have a hobby.","review":"I can't believe people gave this movie 5 stars. 5 stars?

He also employs a mad scientist who in turn employs a bunch of dead guys to wander around in the soup kitchen basement.I know this sounds intriguing. However, Bela seems unaware of the zombie workers he has at his disposal. Bela does not dispatch zombies to commit crimes. Bela does not use zombies to work in his sugar mill (White Zombie reference). Bela is simply a kindly professor by day, and ruthless gangster by night.I don't know when the guy fit in sleep, keeping his marriage together,and maintaining his dual professions.

It's embarrasing to watch. None of the guys is as ugly as they look on the cover of the DVD, but that doesn't mean they are hot. It had very good ideas, but it was all spoiled with low budget settings, effects and truly poor acting from most of the actors. Watching it was like watching a movie made about an Alternate Universe fanfic of whatever book or series or movies out there written by a thirteen yearl-old girly who has no idea of actual life, real writing skills or love and relationships for that matter.The ending is good though, and really those two stars are only because this darker guy does a remarkable job to keep it out of the wastebasket. However, no matter what are you looking at, better go looking for another movie. Have you seen Shelter or Boyculture yet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh. Painfully Bad Independent Film","review":"Matthew Montgomery and Windham Beacham are the only two capable actors in this cringe-inducing, badly written film. There was an interesting film somewhere in the depths of this mess, but it was buried beneath unbearable dialogue and generally unbearable acting. Moreover, minimum professional film making demands that one keep the boom mic out of the frame. You can see it bobbing in an out of the top of the frame at the beginning of the film: 4:18 - 4:25. Just because an independent film-maker is working on the cheap doesn't mean a film can't be carefully made. Why didn't Rob Williams' co-producers sit him down and force him to edit his script? Why didn't someone tell him it would be better to cut badly acted dialogue by peripheral characters rather than leave it in the film. Why didn't someone tell him that some attempt at a consistent tone helps a movie achieve the goal of telling a story.

His work and book seem to be sound and support the view that dominated psychology and homosexuality a few decades ago. Recent research has made many claims in support of homosexuality which has been unscientific. Nicolosi rationally and thoroughly discusses homosexual behavior as a symptom of a disorder rather than a genetically inherited lifestyle. His work is sound and his research hard to dispute.

It was annoying. But at the end around the kids, she was back to the tough tomboy. Besides the whole multiple personality thing going on, the plot wasn't even that good.

The second one is about what I expected out of an unnecessary sequel. There are some funny scenes, especially by William Shatner returning as the pageant director, but not enough of them. And I thought for too much of the movie they lost who Gracie Hart was.She has become so famous that she can't do field work so they make her the 'face' of the FBI and she's given a staff of stylists and sent out to do publicity for the bureau. Wanting to do anything she can for her belovd FBI, Gracie dives in and loses herself. She becomes arrogant and irritating. This isn't the person everyone was rooting for in the first movie.

The screen play is weak and the characters are either flat and boring or depressing. On a relative scale if we rate the original Miss Congeniality as a ten then the sequel doesn't deserve better than a four.The class that Michael Caine brought to the original is completely missing in the sequel. Neither Enrique Murciano or William Shatner come close to Michael Caine.The box office results are also revealing.

This movie is horribly uninspired, unfunny and even ugly. I wasn't expecting \\"Schindler's List\\", but this was so bad I couldn't stand to watch all of it.Here is an example of a \\"funny\\" scene from the movie: Sandra Bullock learns that a Dolly Parton impersonator might be involved in the crime. Accidentally, while in a hotel lobby in Las Vegas, Sandra Bullock spots her, chases and finally apprehends her with a jump. And then - suprise !!! To FBI's embarrasment this turns out to be the _real_ Dolly Parton. Unbelievably funny, isn't it?The other equally \\"good\\" parts are when Sandra Bullock's black female FBI partner hits her in the face, or kicks her in the back without any provocation. I suppose later in the movie they become best friends, but I didn't get that far myself.If you like jokes like these, by all means buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"Wow!

You don't realize Ms. Carter isn't singing words, until she utters the song's only phrases at the end--\\"We haven't met since then. Gee but its nice to see you again.\\"I wish all could have seen her that night. Her presence on stage, and her movement, were as regal as the performance on this album.

The actual glass itself is kind of mottled, if you will. It's not smooth, it has a slight texture, but it's really pretty.I'm so glad I got these.

They were blown away that I'd send them something this marvelous out of the blue, but these are priced so that you can give freely. After those two sets, I finally bought some for myself, and I find this is the glass I reach for every morning. I love them. Be aware this isn't dainty stuff.

Super cozy.With them in their nest, the pod was easy to detach for cleaning time.With 2 levels, they had a lot of room, and they liked the set-up.Cons: The wheel was the worst part. They would always turn it into a nest, and then make a huge mess, running around in it.Everything is made out of the cheapest inflexible plastic.I broke a part cleaning it within one week. Hard to clean, lots of parts.One hammie really liked chewing the neon green paint on the bars.The wheel is NOISY and i felt it was too big for the dwarf hamster, they had a hard time turning it fast enough.We had this cage for 3 months, and now its back to their old cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!","review":"It's a big mess, very hard to clean.

So through email I tell the seller how disappointed the children are and how I paid enough for the item there was no reason for it to have not been shipped. The seller was nasty and unprofessional. Told me, \\"Look lady, go to petsmart and get it.\\" and other nasty things. I was very angry and disturbed by the treatment of the seller, as well as the unprofessionalism of the entire event.

It looks really cool and fun, but the hamster immediately started nesting in the wheel, which means when he runs, he flings poo everywhere. It's very unsanitary. I just purchased the expansion lookout to replace the current wheel and a new wheel that will fit inside the cage. If I were doing this over, I would buy the Super Pet CritterTrail Primary Habitat available on Amazon for about $23.

Agent R) has to exercise}."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before you buy","review":"Our hamster chose to use the wheel as his den. He spends his time filling the wheel with bedding and food. He sleeps most of the day there, and does his bathroom business. Then, some time in the middle of the night, he wakes up and decides to go for a run in his wheel. What goes in, must come out, and out it comes, all over the place.... bedding, food, feces and urine. I'm constantly cleaning up around the cage. Plus, the urine collects in the wheel housing, that plastic purple thing the wheel sits in, and creates a rather solid, dried urine, feces and bedding mess. It's really quite disgusting, and unsanitary. Plus, it's impossible to open to clean and put back together. The idea was to allow my 6 year old to take on the responsibility of caring for an animal, but she can't clean the cage by herself becuase she can't open and close it by herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible DO NOT BUY","review":"At first, when my daughter had this for her hamster, it seemed like a great product.

Even though I had it attached to another CritterTrail cage, I later learned it wasn't enough space for both of them. They had plenty of toys to chew, but they would constantly chew on the bars (one of them broke a tooth that way), and they chewed up the Xtreme Spiral Slide in about five minutes, leaving no access to the Xtreme Wheel. The wheel got stuck after a while and wouldn't spin properly. Also, this thing is an absolute pain to clean, and the gerbils always kicked bedding out onto the floor, so I had to clean that up too.This cage might be big enough for a single mouse or dwarf hamster, but your best bet is to get a glass or plastic tank instead. It's not as Xtreme, but it's cleaner, quieter, safer, and more fun for little pets to dig around in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!!","review":"My hamster only had a few days in this cage before her paw got caught in the wheel.

They run up and down, playing with each other. This is the first time I've owned hamsters and asked a lot of questions before buying two. First off we bought two cages, to give them plenty of room to roam. Also, we made sure we had huts for them to rest and hide in, soft cotton to use for bedding and plenty of chew toys........ I will admit it is a pain to have to disassemble the whole cage for cleaning, BUT I want the whole cage to be cleaned! Luckily, our hamsters have decided to do their pooping in the box on the top of the cage, making it very easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Durability and Design","review":"My daughter bought this cage for her pet hamster in July. It is now December, and already five pieces on it have broken -- tiny pieces related to connecting sections together. She is a pretty careful 10 year old and handles the cage cautiously; nevertheless, it is covered with duck tape to fix the broken areas. It is very disappointing since she was so excited to buy this cage on her birthday. As well, her hamster is almost too fat to fit through the tubes. So, I would recommend this cage for a smaller rodent. Her hamster does enjoy the variety of the tunneling areas, but I think we will go for a bigger size cage next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"super pet crittertrail turd tosser","review":"Hamsters love it but the wheel on top of the cage allows poop and seeds to shoot out over the entire room.

For the most part it's working out okay, except for one very important thing: her hamsters like to spend most of their time in the wheel. Which means, yes, they do lots of pooping up there.

The water bottle that comes with this has some sort of spring inside that prevented the hamster from being able to drink. It was my first hamster, and very small, so I didn't notice that the water level wasn't moving at all.Fortunately, the cage does have some redeeming qualities. The wheel is pretty neat, as it spins around, and the removable \\"look out\\" is a good idea. If you oil the wheel when you clean it, it stays pretty quiet.All in all, it's ok, I'm just pretty pissed that now I have to explain to my 6 year old that an engineer killer her hamster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If I didn't only pay 16.99 for this on Amazon I would probably be pretty pissed (actually I'm still a little ticked). It arrived from Petco damaged so I had to drive to town to take it back. I have the expansion option that has a secondary wheel on the side and that broke the first time removing it, the sides broke the first time trying to clean it. Call me crazy but I expect something to be a little more substantial when it retails for over $50 bucks.My hamster escaped the second week she was in it and now after only 4 weeks the top wheel is creating plastic dust because she uses it so much...apparently she has worn groove on the supporting rail so it no longer spins, it just sticks.This might be fine in a house that the hamster or rodent is the only pet, however I have three cats, three dogs and a snake that would love to snack on her.She now resides in the guest room until I find something better, lucky for us we have a seven bedroom house.If you don't, I would suggest something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy, hard to clean...","review":"Bought 2 hamsters for 2 children for Christmas..with two of these cages.

The hamster will run around a lot and it will slowly move out of its secure spot. Then the whole top wheel attachment will fall off with the hamster in it. I lost my 1st hamster because of this. Still used the cage for my 2nd hamster and its done it twice even though we keep securing it into place. Luckily I still have her because I caught her the 1st time and she landed in a laundry basket the second time ... so we trashed this one and ordered a cage with a wheel inside ... that way she can't run away if it falls off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right Habitat for us/ More wheel woes","review":"My daughter saved up her money to buy this Habitat for her hamster. Our hamster loved the wheel. At first when she ran in the wheel it was noisy. Then our hamster began to use it as a bathroom and food storage. If this wasn't gross enough she would also run in it. Little droppings and seeds would fly out of it and it was incredibly noisy. No matter how many times we cleaned it out the hamster would immediately fill it up again and make a tremendous racket. I would have to clean up around the habitat several times a day. The little observation area on the top is difficult for children to latch, so we had several adventures searching the house for our hamster. Save your money and buy a different Habitat. We're happy with the new 3 level one we bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bars Broke, Wheel a horror","review":"Worst design and cage ever! A bar popped out from where the bars are supposed to be welded together and now my little hamster is dead from it stabbing her! Before that happening, Goldilocks would bring food and bedding into her wheel and then when she would run, it would throw the food, bedding, and droppings everywhere. The urine catch didn't help at all. Also, if you decide to get a different wheel and close the hole where the old one went, there is no room in the cage for a different one because the petting area goes down too far to allow room for the wheel. Save your money and get a better cage! If I could, I wouldn't even give this one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy to escape from!","review":"Usually don't review items, but this one was a problem. The kids liked the cage, but the wheel was loud and stuck. It required some tape to move better, not a big deal. The cage is harder to clean than other brands (we like easy latch dish versions), with lots of areas that really need to get scrubbed down routinely so they don't smell. But the biggest issue was the ease of escape for a hamster! Ours broke out several times a month until we finally replaced the cage! Had a friend with the same cage, at the same time, and the same escape problem. The hatch on top is not secure enough if you like to keep the little pet in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Pet CritterTrail Extreme Challenge habitat","review":"I choose this rating as the wheel at the top is useless.

Within a month we had the following problems:1. Hamster stuffed all her food in the top wheel, had to take it all apart and clean it out. The plastic pieces are hard to work with (getting them to snap out for cleaning)2. One night, the hamster forced the plastic tubing apart (two pieces made a tube) and escaped.3. Another night, the entire top wheel fell off, the hamster escaped and is still missing in our home. The design of the wheel looks cool, but the plastic pieces holding it all together are not durable.It's all eye candy with this product--definitely an example of form over function.

A few days after taking him home he badly cut his hind leg. He died two days later (possibly from infection). While I didn't see him injure his foot, I do know that it happened inside the cage. I found a lot of blood right around one of the air holes in the wheel- just the perfect size for him to get his little foot stuck in while exercising. I considered taping up this hole (for our next dwarf hamster) but I really don't like how the spiral slide interfaces with the top portion which includes the wheel. The plastic does not fit together securely and there are gaps that might cause injury to the animal. Now, I use the cage with the slide and wheel removed and the hole plugged up. I purchased a separate hamster wheel to go inside. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very hard to keep clean","review":"I've been using this cage for 6 months, and I dread cleaning it. The wheel design is terrible, mice go to the bathroom as they run and it just accumulates in there, with some spraying out into the room. You have to take it completely apart to clean properly (the whole cage I mean), and after doing this for months I doubt the plastic clips will last much longer. The layout is cool, but unfortunately it is just way too hard to clean.

There is lots for your little furry friend to do. Our hamster loves the wheel on the top and he climbs through the tube on the side, too. It is a little tricky to put together, but not too difficult. In fact, it was easier than the last cage i purchased. Follow the directions, and you should have no problem at all. My 6 yr. old son has a little difficulty opening the latch, but I just showed him how to take the removable carrier off of the top and it gives him more room to get his hands in there and play.

The wheel and its mount are also very hard to clean, and you have to disassemble the entire cage to clean it properly. My mouse also found a way to chew the wires and a few of them ended breaking off and she could escape. I used this for a few months before I got too frustrated with it. If you have a pet that likes to use their wheel as a bathroom, as my mouse did, definitely do not buy this, because I had to take the entire wheel mount off to clean it(besides it's a closed wheel so you can't just wipe it down while still attached), and it's not easy to disassemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"CritterTrail Extreme","review":"I already had a cage but i bought this one to connect to the other so my two robo hamsters (Lulu and Dawn) would have more to do. they didn't really like this cage. i like the wheel on the track, my hammies look so cute when they're fighting over who gets to run on it :) i've only seen them in the tray once when i cleaned the whole thing for the first time and they were confused.the clean up is easy, everything snaps back into place. although my hamsters don't really like this cage, it was a good buy. i can always buy more hammies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for a simpler option","review":"I agree with A.

The wheel was used as a nest, and the track underneath became a type of sewer, catching all the urine and dirt.

Like some others have mentioned, he decided to make his nest in the wheel instead of using it as an actual exercise wheel. So, you need to buy a different wheel to attach (about $10).However, the wheel comes apart very easily and is extremely easy to clean -- yes, maybe a small child would need help taking it apart, but that is the case for this entire cage, not just the wheel. It is relatively simple to take apart otherwise. Any parent who wants their child to be able to clean a cage completely on their own should look into buying a more simple, easy to assemble cage (like a one-piece clear cage).Overall, this is a great, fun cage for hamsters and other small pets.

Love the actual cage, however, the \\"Space\\" wheel on the top of the cage is HORRIBLE. Since most hamsters are nocturnal, and choose to play at NIGHT, our hamster loves to get in the wheel while we are sleeping and even though the cage is downstairs, when the house is quiet, the wheel makes alot of noise. When I say ALOT, I mean ALOT. It rattles and squeaks. We have had to resort to putting the cage in a closed room while we sleep now.

I was in charge of this cage, another plastic tab broke off right away, and another spot on the pin for the wheel. I was aware of how fragile it was so used extra caution, but it broke anyway.Plus when the hamster pees in the wheel, which you know they will, it leaks out and all over, it's really gross.I would never buy this product again, nor would I even want to accept a free one.

No matter how many times I emptied the bedding, she went right back to storing food and bedding in the wheel. Every time she went for a run, shavings, seeds, and poop went everywhere! I swapped her out fof the basic Critter Trail without the wheel on top, but that one has a very small wheel and it is not big enough for our sirian. Now I have to buy more stuff... sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lookout!","review":"Have had this for a few months now. Very Cute and the hamster loves it. Problem is that it is pretty fragile, a few broken parts. Found that it is too Fragile for a 10 year-old to take apart and put together to clean, and put back together. If you are buying this for a small child, look out because you'll be cleaning it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hurt our hamster","review":"I am very sad to say, that although we liked the product initially, it brought sadness to our home. The wheel has holes in it and our hamster's foot got caught in one of them. As soon as we noticed, we worked to get her out. Unfortunately, her foot has fallen off now. My kids are very sad and we hate to think how long she was caught in there...all night? i honestly think this product should be recalled before any other families have the same problem. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe the reviews and skip this cage","review":"We ended up with this particular cage because it was the only one in stock when we got our hamsters. Everything is fine except the wheel as mentioned by everyone else. Our hamsters didn't nest in the wheel but did occasionally eat up there and the poop and food particles fly everywhere when they go for a run. The track beneath the wheel doesn't really do much as the mess sprays out and covers about a 2ft radius around the cage. So I thought I would just get another metal type wheel to put in the cage and cap off or add a different accessory where the crazy wheel was. So I spent another $20 on all of that. However, none of crittertrail's accessories fit in the hole and now I am stuck with the mess forever. Believe the reviews and get a different cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for teddy bear hamster. Will break after a year.","review":"This cage just breaks so easily and falls apart.Hamster poop and pee come out through the wheel and your hamster can get hurt if they horde all of their food in the wheel and then decide to run in it.Paint chips off bars when hamsters chew them.Plastic breaks so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Cage","review":"First of all - it's hard to clean - it doesn't stay together very well - not as if you lift the top and dump the shavings.Second of all... \\"Biggy Smalls\\" climbs up in the wheel thingy, poops in there, and then when he walks, it falls thru the vent-holes. Might as well be a chimp flinging his doodoo everywhere.It's a MESS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"escapes are possible","review":"My hamster, Goldie, loved it. But, escapes may happen. One day I looked at her cage, and she was not there. Apparently, she bent the top bars, and the clips had broken,so she lifted the lid and squeezed out. Hours later we found her under my bed. Also, the cracks in the wheel are big, so pee and poop comes out. Note too, the wheel's position sends sawdust bedding onto the surrounding surfaces. This is the worst cage in hamster history!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks neat but didn't work for our Robos","review":"We got this for our Robo hamsters but had to return it a few days later because the veritcal tube on the side did not fit flush into the cage (no matter how I tried) and there were spaces left on the side that the robos (who can fit through any space the size of a nickle) could wriggle through. The harder I tried to fit the pieces together the more risk I ran of cracking the cheap plastic. Then every time you clean the cage you have to take it apart, and since these are my son's pets I wanted him to be able to clean it easily. There's very little space inside the cage for other accessories, and I didn't like having poop flung hither and yon every time a hamster ran in the wheel at the top. We went to using an aquarium style cage for our robos, which is much easier to clean, more spacious, and I don't worry about the hamsters escaping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please DO NOT BUY this CAGE!","review":"After looking at this cage, we thought are hamster would love a break from her other cage, so we purchased it for her. Upon arrival-there are a lot of pieces to put together (not a good sign) after securing all pieces we put our hamster inside and sure enough, all the reviews from others about HARD TO CLEAN, MESSY WHEEL,NOT REALLY ROOMY (in my opinion) but worst of all it is made cheaply and after a little chewing by your hamster on the clips, they come apart allowing your hamster to escape. PLEASE DO NOT BY THIS CAGE, FOR THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF YOUR HAMSTER AND CHILDREN! OUR HAMSTER DID ESCAPE AND AFTER SEARCHING TO 2 DAYS MY DAUGHTER FOUND HER DEAD AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR SUMP PUMP IN BASEMENT! Remember, once they get out--there is no place they won't go!

Then after a few weeks of trying to take it apart, Put it back together agian and get the smell out of it....I understand why everyone is giving bad reviews. The wheel kept my husband awake at night because of the sound. The hamsters hung out most time in the wheel, Which is the most hardest to clean.Get a large plastic storage tote ( one with high walls) from Walmart or Target, Leave the lid off and put it up high enough other animals cant get it. The perfect cage. Easy to clean easy to see through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!","review":"I purchased a dwarf hamster for my daughter and she loved this cage. I thought what a great way to have more room in the cage by having the wheel on top. That was the biggest mistake I made. He nests, poops, pees, eats and runs in the wheel every day. I remove the bedding, he brings it back up. He even sometimes removes it himself. I have tried to coax him down with his favorite snacks but he takes them right back up. I have to take apart the wheel every couple of days and scrub it. The wheel squeaks horribly. I oiled it, oil didn't even touch the squeak. I have to move him into the bathroom at night so I can get some sleep. The cage easily comes apart and Buddy has escaped. I don't have a vacuum with a hose so that suggestion doesn't fly.This hamsters was bought as a pet, not a mate. This was supposed to be my 6 yr old daughter's responsibility. I wouldn't dare let her touch this cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, it's crappy","review":"I even hesitate to give this product one star. The wheel is so loud, you can hear it in the lower level of our home. That being said, anyone sleeping in the same room will never sleep soundly again.Also, while the wheel spins around, it flings poop out of the cage in a three foot radius. The employees of CritterTrail that work in Research and Design should be fired immediately. How can you let a product be sold that doesn't hold critter crap?Other designs by CritterTrail are much better, just don't be fooled by the cool look of this Wheel of Misfortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"Well I would not recommend this cage to people that have cats. My hamsters name is Chloe she was in her cage one night. My bedroom door was open, so my cat jumped on the table and knocked down this cage and this cage broke. So my cat took my hamster. Then I took my hamster out of my cats mouth. Luckily she did not die or get hurt too bad she got two cuts. so if you have cats I would not recommend this cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it....","review":"We haven't had good luck with this cage at all. We have a dwarf hamster in it. The cage doesn't stay together well at all, I have it taped in places. We still lost her for a day when she climbed the wall, pushed up the top, and got out. When I try to take pieces off to wash them, everything falls apart. Like other people have said, she pees and poos in the wheel, but we have found the tray underneath doesn't catch it all so we end up with a bigger mess. We DO love the petting zone though, it's a great way to catch her.The hamster gives the cage 5 stars, we don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"This is a good product for a little bit but for long term use it stinks. Poop and pee comes through the cracks in the wheel and the cage is very flimsy. It falls apart very easly. If you don't plan on moving the cage it is great but if you plan on moving the cage around or even cleaning it than it stinks. Every time I move the cage it falls apart and than I have to put it back together again. Spend your money a different cage because you will be wasting it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy cage","review":"After cleaning this cage once a week for a month, the plastic parts wouldn't fit together properly anymore and the whole cage began falling apart. I was really unhappy given how much the cage was (about $35 at the time) that it didn't hold up at all. While the wheel at the top looks cool, it was one of the first parts to have to be removed because the need for constant cleaning wore it down. Might be good as a supplementary home for your critters, but not a primary residence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Adventures of Ociee Nash","review":"Excellent movie!!

I love it and one thing I like a lot about it is that in Counter-strike if you had a Bot addon so you could play with computer players and you wanted to play a custom map, you'd have to download waypoints for the map but in CZ it automatically waypoints the map for you once you play the map. The Bots are extremely realistic with only a few minor flaws. An EXTREME improvement to ALL other bot addons that you could download for CS. The missions are nice, maps are better looking, and all models (characters, weapons, objects) are upgraded and look atleast 3x nicer than in CS. Many people I've talked to were disappointed because they say, \\"It's just like the 1st one.\\" But I'm a CS Veteran and I'm extremely glad Vallve didn't change the gameplay or anything and mess it up. I LOVE THE NEW COUNTER-STRIKE: CONSITION ZERO AND RECOMMEND IT TO ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's True... World's #1 Online Action Game!","review":"Condition Zero is so great... I can play this for hours and never get tired of it. The new single-player mode, Deleted Scenes, is much better than the original's single-player, which was just beating requirements in a regular multi-player game. And the online experience is better. The graphics have greatly improved, and I find that there aren't as many problems with the servers. A great improvement from original Counter-Strike, and I say it's the best first-person shooter game on the PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Condition Zero","review":"I have been a CS fan since the beta's were first out. I am a huge fan of CS, so I figured CZ would be a great game. Waiting 2yrs from the original release date to play it and what did I get. The same game I already had, sure it has some new textures but thats not good enough. The bots are better but its not worth the $40 that you have to pay. The deleted scenes are ok but still not worth the money. Plus, its full of bugs, mine crashes about every 15 min and locks my comp up until I restart it. Wait until Half-Life 2 and/or Doom 3 comes out to get a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Business","review":"Many of us are very upset that the December 30th release did not hold true. The truth is, Sierra/Valuesoft never had any intention of release CS:CZ on that date. Once they missed the Sept. and Nov. release dates, they new it would take until March to get everything complete. The only reason they named Dec. 30th was so that they could maximize pre-orders for Christmas. If they had designated March 30th as the release date a few months ago, they would have had far fewer pre-orders leading up to the end of the year. This helps them pad their 2003 financials. Such practices should be a crime. I urge everyone to cancel their pre-orders and, if you decide you still want to purchase, wait until March 25th approaches to pre-order it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Off","review":"Don't bother buying this game if you have the original CS.

My parents have been talking about taking away my internet (because I have been spending too much time playing CS on steam), so this would work out for both of us. I bought it, and regretted it. The single player engine is ALRIGHT. It was a good idea for the objectives (kill 3 enemies with deagle, and things like that) but the bots are idiots. They run in front of your shots, they DONT shoot at enemies, they kill hostages. It is not worth the money. If anyone has heard of Counter-Strike:Source, they will be saving up like me to buy. A beta version of Source was released today for all owners of CS:CZ, and this is AMAZING. Graphics are amazing, and all the other problems have been fixed. Smoke grenades work very well. The physics engine is excellent (this means if you stand on a barrel, it can break or shoot away), and when you kill someone, they realisticly die (not like in CS and CZ when they just tip over).

Steam is now going to be able to update the game seamlessly and unannounced, much to the dismay of CS cheaters. And why reinvent the wheel? The newest FPS games like Castle Wolf and Global Ops may have better graphics, but CS stills reigns as king of the multiplayer FPS games? Try to find 20,000 servers running at any given time in any other game. Why? It's better gameplay. Period. At least now new players will be able to get used to the game before jumping into multiplayer games. The result? More players than we have now. Nothing new has come close to the original CS. Only a new, improved CS can do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laaaaaaame","review":"In hindsight, I don't know why I was so amped about this coming out. The deleted scenes component is buggy and not very challenging or exciting. I could have beaten the game in a day if it hadn't crashed on me every hour and a half. As for the single player CS mode where you team up with bots, that is somewhat fun and interesting and the only reason why this review gets two stars... but after a couple of rounds you realize you'd rather play with real people instead of bots who do the same thing over and over again. I'd rather play regular CS or perhaps work on Day of Defeat somemore.

Very few new additions to the game, the new textures look worse than the old textures! Most of the levels are reused levels from the original multiplayer game. The only significant addition to the game is bots, which are actually pretty good(hmm, 3 years to add some good bots to an already great game??).

If the server is far away, or has a bad connection, or is just run on a outa date machine. Its not as much the download time that this game depends on, but more on the upload side of the server. If the server is running less than 512kbps, then you might as well not play on it.Point being, that even if you are using 56k connection, this game will still suite your needs.

Nate Dogg just goes with what works and takes no real artistic risks on this album. The album covers the usual topic material and features guest spots from Snoop and the Eastsidaz, Fabolous, Monch, XZIBIT, Ludacris, Lil Mo, Kurupt, and more. Every song on the album is good to great but there is nothing amazing and the lack of tracks is kind of disappointing as well. Also, I would've enjoyed a Warren G appearance on the album.

Why didnt he keep his jazzy and soulfull side? theres only two songs that i really like (Music and Me and Antoher Short Story) And the rest is fillers.. anoying ;(. I recommend people to buy this one for those 2 songs.

This, however, is not what distinguishes the Insight Guide from books with a similar mission, such as Frommers or Fodors. What marks Insight Guide apart is its wonderful photographs, which provide the would-be tourist with a rich taste of what it must be like to spend time in this vibrant, world class, but still comfortably Midwestern city.The other thing that sets this Insight Guide apart - even from others in the series - is the darkness of its text. If you read this book like a book, rather than a reference work (its stylish writing invites such use) you are regaled at every turn with tales of poverty, crime, corruption and racial division. That Chicago suffers from these problems is no doubt true but reading about them in a guidebook doesn't make me want to go there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?????","review":"Walmart charged 1.33 a bag and you are charging 4.17 a bag?

Most aggravating of all, not a single mention of the Navy's Ace, Randy Cunningham. Where are the stories of the Navy pilots who flew 300 and 400 missions? Every pilot who flew up North has some hilarious stories and some heartbreaking stories. You missed almost all of them, Sherwood. Also, before one puts Official Naval Historian under one's name he really should know something about the US Navy and Naval Aviation.

The one that it is replacing boiled everything at low so by the time I got home from work, the food was limp and tasteless. I lived with it until I finally broke the insert and had to replace it. The insert would have cost more to replace than I paid for the original unit. I was hesitant about this one at first because of reviews that I read about the insert breaking on it's own but so far this one is doing great.

Then I was clumsy and broke the original insert while washing it. The replacement KitchenAid crock arrived a week ago. This insert has NOT been banged around and it has NOT been exposed to extreme temperature swings. That means I waited until it was at room temp before washing it for use and did not place frozen food in it. It was not filled with food, placed into the fridge, then put into the cooker base. Even though it was handled with much care, it cracked within 15 minutes of being used for the first time. Until today, I would have only said good things about the cooker. Obviously I cannot recommend it now. I don't know why I had no issues with the first insert, but the replacement one broke immediately. Not worth the money for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable","review":"After 2 years ( I used it 4 or 5 times per year) the insert crack while using it and made a mess in the main heater part of the slowcooker, almost caught on firedo not buy that crookpot only 1 year warranty on it it's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crock continues to Crack","review":"This would be a great crock pot if the crock didn't continue to crack. My first one cracked after a year. When I ordered a replacement they told me be sure to thaw the meat first, etc. I followed instructions exactly and the 2nd one cracked after about 6 uses, so money wasted and I need to find another brand to purchase. There are many, many complaints about this so obviously there's something wrong, they just won't acknowledge it. Buy a Cuisinart instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"After three broken inserts, we threw it away...","review":"At first we thought it broke because we cooked a small chicken in it that wasn't completely thawed. We called and paid $35 for a new liner. We were careful not to put anything that wasn't completely thawed in it and it popped and sizzled again. We spent another $35 for a new insert and the same thing happened shortly after. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice same on me. We should have given up after two broken inserts, but the third indicates it must be an engineering or manufacturing flaw. We probably got 8 good meals from it and lost 3, spending way too much. It's too bad, because it's a nice large slow cooker with many settings. We replaced it with a cheap and simple Hamilton Beach cooker that's smaller but has been completely reliable and hasn't broken yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"My crock cracked, too","review":"Agree with all comments. 1) Overall, the crock pot seems to function well. I have the stainless pot and beware, the outside gets incredibly hot. I make sure to keep it away from everything on the counter when I am cooking something; 2) The lid does not seat properly with the crock. This hasn't caused much of a problem and may even be the way it's designed. I have never had the liquid boil away even if the pot is on high all day; 3) My crock cracked after a year of use. To those who have observed that KitchenAid should stand behind it's product and replace the crock no questions asked, I agree. They should also redesign the darn crock so it doesn't crack and provide a free replacement since this is a well-documented issue. Some writers are on their third replacement for cryin' out loud!! KitchenAid is a big corporation that has enjoyed a stellar reputation. Since Whirlpool took over, doesn't seem that they have the same commitment to quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked Pot","review":"We purchased this slow cooker and were looking forward to meals that were no longer dried out and mushy from overcooking. After ONE use, the ceramic cracked and liquid leaked underneath to provide us with a sticky mess. So far, Amazon has made returning this product easy, but I should have been more aware of others who reviewed this for the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I bought this slow cooker for my wife, she makes the best crockpot meals and we needed a new crockpot, and thought we'd purchase this \\"higher-end\\" slow cooker. Well, our pot has cracked 3 times - that's right 3 times. One of the pots that KitchenAid sent us was so warped that it rocked like a seesaw, thankfully they replaced it. Each time we thought, maybe the pot was defective - well after this 3rd time, I want my money back. What a major disappointment, and we ruined 3 meals. We must have bad luck because a lot of you out there are not having problems. We do not put frozen meat in the pot and we do not cook on high. We sooo much wanted to love this thing. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk","review":"Original and 2 replacements had problems. Cheap manufacturing - two had warped lids, all three had defects in the ceramic pots glazing -- bad news b/c a hole in the glazing is a harbor for bacteria. Tested one of them for temps and there was no difference between low/simmer and buffet -- both were ~207 degrees. Third unit didn't come with a lid. KitchenAid's policy that the misfiting lids are due to something other than poor quality manufacturing is a bunch of malarchy. I can buy a cheap 7qt slow cooker if I want this sloppy quality. Wiling to pay more for quality products but the KitchenAid products I have bought over the past 5 yrs are cheap junk. The MBA's are maximizing short-term profits by riding the KA brand and selling this crud at our expense.Sorry to offend the dedicated KA fans but this is my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not be on the market","review":"I purchased this crock pot for some of its features and for its size. The second time I used it the ceramic insert cracked. I contacted kitchen aide and they sent me a new insert but this time the crock pot would not heat. They sent me a second crock pot and this one will not heat either. This has been very frustrating especially due to the cost, I have a cheap $20 crock pot I have had for 15 years and it works consistently so I guess I will give up the bells and whistles and stick with that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"The heating element is defective. This is my second one. Don't know how to return it. Threw away box. Help!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK - But not worth the money","review":"This slow cooker works OK, but not worth the money compared to other similar products.The worse part is the clean up of the inside aluminum cooking area. After cooking the first roast beef a little juice got on the aluminum. After cooking the roast and using normal cleaning methods and then using Ajax, steel-wool and several other items to remove the stains it was impossible. The engineers who designed this product must never have cooked in their life and never expected anything to dirty the pot, otherwise they would have selected another material. No one wants to spend nearly one half hour on trying to remove a small stain and then not be able to accomplish such a small task. KithchenAid dropped the ball with this item. :-(Plus, there are other slow cookers on the market that work as good and a lot less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"3nd Crock Cracked","review":"I purchased my first Crock Pot and the crock cracked after just a few uses, thought I must have banged it up and I did like the unit so I purchased another full unit to replace the crock since I couldn't find a replacement in stock online. The second crock cracked as well so I called Kitchen Aid and they said the pots were defective and they had changed manufacturers. They sent me out a replacement for the second unit but refused to send me out one for the first one since it was out of warranty, even though the same thing happened. I now have a 3rd cracked crock so I have 2 crock pot units with no pot to use them... I am so disappointed in Kitchen Aid. Now I am trying to find replacement crocks so I don't have to buy another crock pot. If I dont find replacements at a cheap enough price, I am tossing both units and getting something that Kitchen Aid doesn't manufacture. Sheesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY! DEFECTIVE!!!!","review":"i am a great fan of KitchenAid products: they tend to be really well made, they work well and look good. HOWEVER, the insert for their slow cooker is defective. Today was the third and last time that an insert has cracked in the middle of cooking. It's not as if the machine was cheap, either...the first time an insert cracked, I thought it was my fault, although I always handled it with kit gloves. From reading others' reviews, I realize that this is a huge problem that the company doesn't want to address. I called them and they sent a new insert THREE TIMES, but now I give up. I can't afford to have the thing catch on fire when I'm not at home. Very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flow in the pot","review":"The inner ceramic pot keeps cracking. I went through three of them before Kitchen Aide offered our money back. Alas, I didn't take them up on their offer because I was just too freaking tired of dealing with all the fuss over this cookware. I have better things to do. It's in the garage. I may use it again if I can find an inner pot that fits at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. The replacements they kept sending keep cracking around the bottom, in the same exact place everytime. Do not buy this pot. It's from China. You can get better for half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Cracked Up!","review":"Please listen to the reviews on this product. I had mine for about a year. I was using it one day and heard a loud \\"POP\\" and my liner had cracked. After looking for replacement liners, I found that others had the same problem I did with the liner cracking. Kitchenaid obviously has an engineering problem with the liner and I'm not even going to bother trying to get another liner. I'm sure I can get a much better product for the price as a new liner. Beware! This product is not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed as it cracked","review":"I looked forward to receiving this and was so disappointed after it cracked on about the fourth time I used it. I continued to use it this way until it leaked through and made it impossible. It seems to me that for a slow cooker it gets much too hot on the low setting (which is what I use most frequently) I have been unsuccessfully trying to locate a new insert, hoping I would not have this problem again. I loved the size, the appearance and the convenience of using the crockpot. This was the second one I have had that did this. The first one literally exploded. It had been a gift and I didn't know if there had been something wrong already and so bought another one from the CHEF'S catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great til it breaks.","review":"This is the second one of these crock pots I've had. The first one had a crack in the ceramic pot after just a couple of uses so I went to the store and replaced it (it was still new). I hadn't used it for about a year until today. When I pulled the ceramic out after the meal to clean it there was the dreaded glob o' crispy goo on the inside of the cooker. Sure enough, I found a hairline crack in the ceramic pot. Twice is enough for me. The crock pot goes in the trash and I go looking for a different brand tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Glass Lid Shattered while Cooking","review":"I like a well made and good looking product which is why we registered for this slow cooker (Kitchen Aid KSC700SS) when we got married in 2007. We just started using it and after 3 uses, the glass lid shattered while cooking. VERY DANGEROUS!!! We made beef stew and after 7 hours of cooking, we were almost ready to eat. I lifted the to check the meat for doneness and then returned to the cooker 15 min later and the lid had shattered around the edge (about 1/2 in from the rubber gasket). Wow! It looked like a broken car windshield. We gingerly removed it by sliding it off on a cookie sheet and had to dispose of the entire meal. What a disappointment!!!! Now we're waiting for a response from the Kitchen Aid \\"Safety\\" department. Isn't the glass supposed to be tempered? It's over 3 years old so I'm certain out of warranty. With this issue and the potential for cracks to the ceramic pot, I would STAY AWAY from this slow cooker!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife loves it","review":"Fantastic product. My wife loved it. Expensive for a slow-cooker but worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I had a Rival slow cooker and it always had \\"hot spots\\" that would burn the food.

The timer is also excellent, talk about the ease of cooking, doesn't get any easier than this. The quality is great, very well built and looks good on my counter also.

This is our 2nd replacement and now we are out of warranty, so we would have to pay for the part ourselves. A new ceramic crock insert is $79! Outrageous!

Despite some of the experiences from other customers, I ordered one anyway hoping Kitchen Aid had maybe address this problem. My first one cracked on the third time, the second on the first time, all within 20-45 mins of starting. As per the reviews, I was very careful not to put in anything that was too hot/cold. Kitchen Aid was happy to replace the crock liner the first time but the second time they denied this was a problem and rather begrudgingly will send another one. I was surprised at the poor quality of not only their product (we have many of their appliances), but their customer service. I will try the third crock but feel it can't be left alone for long because of the potential fire hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have bought a Crock Pot","review":"Love the timer, love the size: hate the temperamental stoneware. I bought a new ceramic insert after the first one cracked. I thought that I had done something wrong. For the second one we made sure that the cold meat never touched the the insert. We used the vegetables to separate them. It didn't help. Hopefully, KitchenAid has fired the ceramic engineers that designed the insert and hired some better ones for their newer models. Because of this, and KitchenAid's attitude, I won't buy a KitchenAid slow cooker again. We have a small Crock Pot that has lasted 30 years and we use it frequently. Should have stuck with Rival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two times, two bad experiences","review":"Ok folks, I bought my wife this slow cooker for a gift. She was very excited to use it for the first time. However, after our first meal was cooked we realized the ceramic dish that the meal cooks in had cracked. We returned this particular one and had a new one shipped to us. However, after turning this one on (the replacement) for the first time with a nice meal in it to be cooked, we realized it was cool to the touch. The cooker LED lights were on like it was cooking, but it was not! Our meal was not even remotely warm and nowhere cooked. I took out the ceramic container that the raw roast was in and felt the inside of this slow cooker to see if it was warm/hot, and of course it was cold. This was was not even cooking even though the lights said otherwise. All this happened after about two hours of being supposedly on and cooking.Needless to say, I will never buy another kind of this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid does not seal completely; poor design and manufacturing","review":"I see I am the only 2 (or 3) star reviewer for the cooker. Here's the deal: if you are going to serve warmed swedish meatballs at a potluck this unit will work fine. However, If you want to cook an outstanding meal and seal in all the flavors, add just the right amount of moisture, etc... look elsewhere.Quite simply, either the pot or the lid (I'm almost positive it's the former) is warped, so there is not a complete seal. Apparently, the cheapy rubber hose that goes around the lid's edge is supposed to take care of this -- but it doesn't. There is a large gap and steam escapes freely. By a couple of hours into the cooking cycle, my entire apartment smells like a pot roast factory. Compare this design to that of the similary priced All-Clad slow cooker and you will see that it does not need to put a black garden hose around the glass lid because it fits properly.This is a subpar product. KitchenAid should be ashamed to put their name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cracked crockpot","review":"even though I read other's reviews and knew the pot could crack, I knew this wouldn't happen to me.

I guess it's true when they say you don't hear from most people unless they're unhappy - although I do contact management when we feel that an individual has done an exceptional job. This tea kettle has got to be the worst consumer product I have ever purchased - especially at this price. It makes all kinds of gurgling sounds as the water heats up, spits water out of the spout as it boils and the whistle is very sporadic. After only a few uses, rust marks already started appearing. I thought I would be getting something special at this price, but any tea kettle I've owned at less than $30 is far superior to this. This thing is so bad, I couldn't even give it away - it's gone straight into the garbage and has turned me off from ever buying a Chantal product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"A wretched design. The lid doesn't fit well, so most of the steam escapes through it, leaving only enough pressure for an weak whistle. (If you push down on the lid it'll give a nice harmonica sound.)The non-insulated handle is ugly as well as inconvenient. The attachment point has visible lockwashers sticking out. There are lots of little places where it looks like the designers didn't know what they were doing.Tou can get a much better kettle for $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"A church laughs at itself","review":"The Disciples of Christ are one of the smaller \\"mainline\\" denominations in America.

I tried two watches and neither one worked. The first one had no display and the second one you couldn't change it to feet. I sent bought of them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality; not very efficient","review":"I took a chance on this watch from a close-out retailer who agreed to put a new battery in it prior to shipping. Cost was under $20.The watch has a lot of wasted space on the face of it, devoting the bottom line of the three line display to telling you which mode it is in. For example, when the day/date is displayed on the top line and the time is in the center, the bottom third of the watch reads \\"CLOCK.\\" All modes display like that.Calibrating is a bit of a chore but works if you follow the directions very closely. It's easy to miss something and have to start over again.The second day I had the watch, set and ready to go, I headed out to a local hilly park for a workout. By the end of my warmup mile the START/STOP button was missing from the watch, rendering it worthless.My opinion? If you see one of these for any price, avoid it. Even if it worked as the manufacturer designed it it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good western, beautiful cinematography, Leo Gordon","review":"This is as good as any solid western of the '50's. Leo Gordon, one of the scariest bad guys from many westerns, plays Quantrill who wants revenge on Lawrence, Kansas for kicking him out of town years ago. Steve Cochran, a Confederate spy, comes to town to help him but develops second thoughts along with affection for the girl, a boy, and the townspeople. It may not be historically accurate but the ending satisfies. Cochran is good; he should have had more starring roles.The cinematography is excellent. There aren't really any vast western vistas and it looks like many westerns were filmed around these parts. On the other hand, the placement of the camera and composition of the shots makes it look totally fresh and exciting. A job well done. And there are lots of scenes outside of town, enough to even satisfy me.And it has Leo Gordon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantrill's Raiders","review":"Not very factural but most folks who don't know the true history would still enjoy it.

I was watching Amazon's video interview of Michael Chabon, on the page for Telegraph Avenue , the marvelous book which I just started a couple of days ago. One of the questions asked was what music he listens to when working, and he said this. I had never heard it before, but have been looking for something to listen to while grading this enormous stack of Hamlet essays sitting on my desk (I am a high school English teacher). I said, \\"why not?, downloaded this CD and am utterly thrilled by it. Just incredible. Chabon says he's listened to this thousands of times. I just finished my first.

Incorporating syncopations and rhythms/counterrhythms, it's overwhelming to hear those first few bars of the piece.That is what makes the album a classic. He challenges the listener to think and almost move beyond music itself. While I like his other works, none of them strike me as much as this one. So if you do yourself one favor this year or any other, get this album. It is as close as anyone will ever get to melding beauty with theory at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"This is really my favourite minimalist recording. I never warmed up to Philip Glass' stuff but this is really one exceptional piece of work. It completely blew my mind when i bought this twenty years ago and I was in a new wave and punk phase.

This is a completely indispensable CD to any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After my disappointment with Seve Reich's recording called \\"Drumming\\" I looked forward to this CD to justify the money I spent on both CDs. No such luck. This one sounded so much like the other one that we had to check to be sure which one was on. If therer are 18 musicians playing this music, they must have a very strong union because the other 13 or more must have been in another room taking a prolonged break. We istened to the \\"Music for 18 Musicians\\" again by mistake, and then put it both CDs in a place where we would never do it again. My wife, two sons who are a freshman and a senior in college, and I enjoy music and have a wide range of tastes in music. None of us could tolerate either of Steve Reich's CDs, must less like it.

The reason we didn't like this one the shelves would not stay in place. We had two hamsters in it and when they were playing they could knock it down. The litter also gets everywhere. You can't use it without the shelves because the water bottle is to high for them to reach without being on a shelf. It also is not very easy to put together or stay together and hard to clean without taking it all apart. Since cages should only be cleaned when the hamsters are awake that means in the evenings and it took much to long for a night task. The colors are pretty but the cage is not user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks! Hard to clean too!","review":"I have one Syrian hamster in this cage right now. He loves the cage but it's virtually impossibly to clean and assemble. The long tube that connects to the \\" petting zone\\" is extremely hard to get off the cage. You have to take a screw driver and try to pry it apart. The latches don't always close, which could allow a hamster to escape. Also small pieces break off! The water bottle is blue, so you can't see the water level. The red shelves aren't sturdy enough for Syrian hamsters, my hamster knocked it down. The wheel is way too tiny for a Syrian hamster! He never uses it either because of it's size. The whole cage itself is a bit to small for Syrian hamsters. We will get a new cage soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critter trail 2","review":"This is the best home my hamster rafikiHas had.

It works perfectly with this cage. For the teddy bear hamsters the wheel that comes with it is a little small, in fact mine used it more for a bridge than a wheel which is SO Funny to watch. We have really enjoyed this cage and would recommend it to anyone. One thing the man at the pet store recommended was when you fill the water bottle squeeze it, fill it while squeezing put lid on, turn over and release the squeeze to make a vacuum effect so it doesn't leak, which has worked wonderfully for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely not for mice","review":"Despite the description saying this cage can be used for mice, there are a few huge flaws in that. First, the water bottle that comes with the cage has a spring behind the ball that is too strong for a mouse to move. My mice were getting no water from it. Second, there are holes near the door latches that are big enough for mice to squeeze right through. If I hadn't noticed either of these before it was too late my mice would likely be either dead of dehydration or lost. They can also move the petting zone up from the bottom enough to squeeze through the hole, but thankfully you can fix that by making sure you have the tube connected from the petting zone to the bottom tray.For bigger rodents the cage would probably work just fine if you don't mind ill-fitting shelves and noisy wheel, but I would suggest anyone with mice to stay away and save themselves the headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk!","review":"The cage fell apart within days.

If you getting this product for a child and expecting the child to be able to put it back together. Think again even I as an adult had problems with it. The water bottle sits too low, The top part of the petting zone gets stinky really quick. If you do end up getting a knocked up hamster from the pet store, they will most likely have the babies in the petting zone which makes it even harder to clean the cage and harder to peek in to check on the babies. The tab part for the petting zone breaks off easily and needs to be ducktaped down. You have the water bottle whole then theirs another whole with a plug type of end. Hamsters will chew on that very easily. If I had to buy another one all over again, I wouldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst cage yet","review":"got this for my hampster.

My hamster loves the cages. he's a lil fat though so watching him squeeze through the tubes is kinda funny. His last cage had a sky deck wheel and instead of using it to exercise he would sleep and store food in it. Too messy for my liking. This cage is perfect. Putting it together was a little difficult. Connecting the wire parts together proved to be a challenge but at the end the cage is very sturdy and pretty.**** VERY DIFFICULT to unattach bottom to clean it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very time consuming to clean","review":"I have to agree with the others regarding the cleaning. You can't just \\"remove the bottom\\" -> in doing so the entire cage falls apart. You then clean each part separately then enjoy putting the puzzle back together.

This habitat was a pain to put together, even my husband struggled with assembling it. No way am I taking it apart to clean it! I just vacuum out the bottom bedding and the petting zoo comes out to clean that. The wheel is already too small for my syrian and we just got it! She never runs on it. She's already broken out twice! She managed to twist the petting zoo cap 'til it unlocked and slither out. We've had to duck tape the top which means we can't plug the petting zoo with that cap anymore. Also, I am afraid the latches on the petting zoo will break because I frequently get her out up there to get to her. I'm already looking for a better, more sturdy cage. Wouldn't recommend this although my sister isn't having any problem with the exact same cage for her panda bear hamster.

Apparently they really love the taste of the two red \\"second floor platforms\\". Woke up one day to each of them being partially eaten. It is more difficult to clean this cage than the other one that we have.

You can attach a separate water bottle if you want. It is open for Fluffy to get exercise and easy for us to see him eating. The doors are secure to prevent escape.What we don't like: The placement of the water bottle included is not ideal, I don't think Fluffy could drink out of it, so we use a separate one. The plastic is too fragile for small children to help much with caring for Fluffy, the top lid cracked during assembly, but it is still useable. Fluffy likes close dark spaces, so he doesn't like that the cage is completely see-through. I put a small peice of cloth on top over the bed he makes and this keeps him happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Engineering","review":"This cage LOOKS awesome. The gerbils enjoy it. These are the good qualities. The bad are: the plastic bottom and the clips break very easily. When you buy the cage, you have to put it together and the pieces don't exactly fit very well. There are gaps and junctions where you have to just accept that metal and hard plastic pieces just aren't going to snap tightly together. It's fragile and easily falls apart as a consequence. The plastic should be a sturdier more pliable plastic--the kind that is not see-through--at least for the base which has to hold all the other pieces in place. I don't look forward to cleaning it.

The second half I struggled through. I mean once you can adapt to the idea that the dead are really \\"living\\" on the other side, the way these spirits roam around doing essentially nothing....was just too too far for me to get into.

No novel about the afterlife can fail to make large obvious ideological statements about the living. Still, that doesn't take away from the pleasure of this book.

Nothing quite like it had been written before. It stands alone in its bleak background rendering of a Europe on the brink of war and, in its characterizations, of the juxtaposition of innocence and evil. Published in 1939 in England as The Mask of Dimitrios, here as A Coffin for Dimitrios, this book set the bar for those -- like le Carre, Deighton, and Furst -- who would follow. It has no hero; it is not a police procedural, an adventure or detective story, or a spy novel: it defies characterization, and therein lies its uniqueness. And its literacy will come as a shock to many of today's readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"This is my first Ambler novel and I am definitely hooked. The writing style is crisp, the plot development stylish, the characters real, and the novel itself is nicely complex! I liken Ambler to Patricia Highsmith in certain ways, except that I find Ambler's plot lines and characters to be much richer and real-life, without the obvious ethical/moral ambivalence that marks Highsmith's writing.As others have written before me, it is indeed difficult to believe that Ambler wrote this so long ago. At times, the reader feels the era of the 1930s but mostly the story could as easily be set in the modern era, too.This is a great read and one that can go quickly if you have several days to spend with one book. I highly recommend A Coffin for Dimitrios and am looking forward to my next Ambler novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read, hard to find in book stores","review":"It took a long time to find this book. It's never in used book stores. I finally broke down and bought it online. Good story. Mr. Ambler does fine character development and builds suspense without unnecessary violence or profanity. Following Latimer across Europe in search of Dimitrios was unnerving at times. I don't, however, see how Latimer being the person who runs down Dimitrios' story is 'absurd'. Latimer's interactions with the various people who knew Dimitrios were interesting and moved quite logically. Overall, I'm glad I finally read this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine early spy novel","review":"A writer of detective fiction becomes fascinated by the sketchy details surrounding the life of a real criminal and decides to learn the truth for himself as a professional, intellectual exercise.

Most reviewers here hail the book as a \\"classic\\" and magnificent thriller, and many seem to feel that since Ambler is the \\"father of the modern spy thriller\\" they are duty-bound to beatify this work. I'll take a modern spy author any day. True, the plot moves steadily forward, the characters are fascinating and well-drawn, and the descriptions of pre-war Central Europe are delicious. But the book seems to move like a train -- you get on, you look out the window at the passing landscape, and then you get off. There was little if any excitement; the suspense was tepid; the plot turned on convenient contrivances aimed only at enabling the author to keep the book moving. The ending, to me, was naive and left me saying: \\"Is that all there is???\\" Like I say, in the face of all the rave reviews, I must be missing something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read in a piece on Ian Fleming, Eric Ambler's claim that \\"Ian Fleming should be read as literature.\\" The writer of the piece then added that this was high praise since, \\"Eric Ambler may be the greatest thriller novelist of them all, with A COFFIN....his finest.\\" So I had to check COFFIN out. And it was not even close to the finest thriller I've ever read. The plot is thin, and strung together. Granted, the writing itself is good, but it didn't accumulate into a satisfying whole. Not nearly.

As another reviewer mentioned, once this story left the states to China, the book got very slow, to the point I just stopped reading and moved on to the 3rd Neal Cary book. I should say that China and Chinese history do not interest me, and that was not at all what I expected from a Don Winslow book after reading the first Neal Cary book, and others like Savages, Bobby Z, Frank the Machine, Dawn Patrol, Kings of Cool etc..(All of these books I would highly recommend).

Add a Microphone stand and a XLR cable and you are good to go. This microphone has very clear, rich and accurate sound reproduction. The shock mount does a wonderful job keeping any minor vibrations out of the sound. Just like any Condenser Microphone, It picks up everything including sound reflections off walls.I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who is creating a home recording studio and wants an inexpensive microphone to start out with. I also encourage anyone considering purchasing this item to look on youtube for some videos with examples of this microphone in action. As I was, I think you will also be amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I gave this product a 2 star because the product did not work. I returned this product.

Saying that all pregnancies are different and that juggling two (or more) kids is a challenge isn't exactly earth shattering news. Very few of the subjects in this book are really explored in depth. I agree with the reviewer who said this book is like something you'd expect from a magazine. It hits on several good topics but doesn't really say a lot about any of them. I got more out of re-reading the books I had with my first pregnancy. This book felt like a waste of time. I don't really think it's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"I was not happy with this book. I did not think this book gave a very positive view of parenting two children. It seemed to be very pessimistic - instead of giving helpful hints on how to juggle everything, it talked about how difficult it was.

I basically says that pregnant nursing and tandem nursing is a bad idea. At one point 4 of the 5 nursing \\"personal accounts\\" are very negative. In the breastfeeding vs. formula section she completely fails to mention that breastmilk is full of nutrients that cannot be duplicated by formula. I'm not a breastfeeding fanatic but the book was in no way even handed with the way that it was treated.The entire book is very passive aggressive and at one point made me feel like I was being a bad mom, until I snapped out of it. This is what she says about choosing a nurse-midwife. \\"If you think not using all the technology available would represent poor care of your unborn child, then choosing a midwife is probably not advised.\\" pg. 25I will be returning it for something a little more fairly presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"I decided to give this book the benefit of the doubt anyways even though the reviews weren't great. The testimonials were interesting but not much else. And I don't usually write reviews but I had to chime in because: CAREFUL with the medical info in this book! It seemed outdated and erroneous in more than one section. I have gestational diabetes and the information she gives in that section was flat out wrong. You don't have to give yourself insulin shots anymore (there are pills) and sometimes it can't be controlled with a very strict diet (because of genetic predisposiiton). Also it made it seem like epidurals are some sort of amazing new technology...uhh welcome the future, lady?! It really made me question the validity of the other information in the book.All in all it felt like a bunch of anecdotal information threaded together and not backed up by much recent fact or research. And hey, I can get that kind of info on the internet for free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a window on life in the 1990s","review":"Massage immerses the reader in a tortured world of sex, drugs, and the fantasies of the night.

Flesh stresses detail where it is not needed and omits it from verse that needs it most. His characters are lifeless, selfless and boring (perhaps that's the way they should be) but his dialogue is dreadful. If another character was quoted saying \\"I...I...I don't...It's just...,\\" I think I would have died. Characters did things so uncharacteristic it was comical. Main character Randy was \\"shocked\\" at nearly everything said or done to him and was, in fact, so shocked that he needed to pull out a cigarette at every turn. Yawn. Granted, I couldn't put the book down because I had grown to hate the people in it so, wishing they'd all die so I could forget about them and the time I wasted reading this book.

First of all it doesnt really have that much to do about Starship Troopers. It is definetly more of a horror movie than a sci-fi action movie like the first one was. I loved the first Starship Troopers but this one was a real let down. The acting isn't anything great but that is to be expected in these low budget horror movies. It really reminds me of one of those sci-fi channel original horror movies. I think they should have made thise movie without the Starship Troopers license because this one really taints the series. Starship Troopers 2 should have been a multi-million dollar extravaganza on par with the first one. Not this watered down cliched tv movie. The storyline is very cliched and the ending is really awkward and strange. Not even the naked girl could save this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Once you accept the improbable Starship Troopers military concept of fighting an unending horde of fast and horrible monster spiders with foot troops armed only with rifles and pistols, the rest should be easy, but it isn't. Mobile infantry is okay, but there also should be mobile armor, mobile tactical air power, mobile tactical nukes, mobile artillery, etc. But there isn't so it's no wonder they get chopped up. The writer of SST seems to be totally naive and ignorant of modern military organization, tactics and firepower so the setting is woefully unrealistic from that standpoint.Cheap budget notwithstanding, I think the director and producers could have done much more with the script, plot and acting. I was put off with the inane idea of humans hosting little monsters internally, ala Aliens.

The ideas of films are to depict events true or fiction, in any genre of films. To accept the mediocre films is to propagate the idea that viewers will take anything - this is not and must not become the basis for the production of films. Only a good attempt with beginners must be tolerated in any film genre, most especially that genre that is your captivating interest. The message that must be sent to these experienced film makers is that mediocre films will not be tolerated. And our money hard earned money returned.

You don't get to know any of the characters, and therefore when they die, you don't care.I know it was a \\"low budget\\" film, but low budget doesn't have to mean \\"stupid story\\".

Overall, the production values are about what you'd expect from an episode of Star Trek: the next generation, or deep space nine, perhaps not even that good.That said, the plot was not completely awful, although not the slightest bit original.

And also one of the characters in the 2nd film was really the flight commander in the first who got cut in two by the sliding door but i dont think your suppose to know that.As for the dvd, they are barely any extra features worth looking at. All in all SST 2 sucks really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn it off - PLEASE TURN IT OFF!","review":"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? HOW CAN YOU PEOPLE BE POOR EXCUSE FOR A MONEY GRABBING SEQUEL MORE THAN 1 STAR??!!I think we should start a petition to bring back the original cast (excluding dead members such as Dizzy, Zander and the captain of Carmens ship in SST1...who somehow came back to life as mobile infantry in this attrocious sequel - and then died again) and make a 'proper' sequel to a film which provided hours of pure brilliance.I dare you to watch every minute of this decrepid film.WHAT A TRAVESTY"},{"rating":"1","title":"What... A piece... Of crap.","review":"Oh my God, I've never seen a worse movie. Pointless, stupid, idiotic, worthless, boring. I mean, the original wasn't great anyway, but it was still -good-. This was just.... Disgustingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read on and be advised.","review":"I will keep this short to save your time. Do not see this movie. Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. It has no redeeming qualities. At all. The direction is horrible. The acting embarrased me and I'm not in it. The plot is... wait, there isn't one. The characters are flat and unbelievable. Poor filmmaking at its finest. Shame on you Hollywood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"Didn't think it would be THIS bad. I'm a big fan of the original and thought I could sit through it. I couldn't... I fell asleep.It's very much like a sci-fi horror flick from the 80's. The special effects had nothing special about them. One thing I didn't like from the original was when they were shooting the bugs up close and seemed to aim a bit high because of obvious reasons, the CG was filled in later. Part 2 was like watching a movie editted by a high school film class. Figured Tri-Star entertainment would've given them a bigger budget.I was so very disappointed. I've seen porn with better special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost wish I could give zero stars","review":"I am a fan of science fiction movies, and will watch even really lame ones with some enjoyment. However, I almost didn't make it all the way through this movie. The acting was decent and I wasn't bothered by the not-so-great special effects, but the story was just awful. It was basically Alien without the suspense and with much more gore. I don't have a weak stomach, but after a while it seemed that the close-ups of gore got a bit sadistic. On the other hand, close-ups of actors faces occasionally had the pixilated look of cheap video, which was distracting.Even if you loved the first movie, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, is this movie ever bad","review":"If only Amazon.com allowed a rating of zero stars.I laughed for the first five minutes; after that it was an endurance test. Don't believe me? Rent it and see. I dare you.For purposes of comparison, I should mention that I loved the first movie. Thought it was a subtly sarcastic thrill ride. This movie, on the other hand, is basically a bad script that ties together pieces of extra footage (and some that was already used) from the first one, with some shots of an old warehouse thrown in to mix things up. Like a no-talent garage band got together to make a movie.Whoever produced this travesty deserves some kind of prize for having been able to pull together enough funds to get it done, but they also deserve to be tarred and feathered for having actually done it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Watch This","review":"This movie did not meet the expectations that I had hoped for. While the first movie was terrific, this one was not. There is no Johnny Rico leading the Federation Infantry, which in my opinion doomed the movie from the start. I was disappointed in one aspect. In the first movie, when the guns were fired we saw bullet casings flying out. In this movie, they replace that with lights that flashed in the front, simulating it being fired. Were the bugs being taken down with invisible bullets?? The only good portion of the movie was the idea of the bigger, badder bug. Whereas the bug in the first movie was a brain sucker, these bugs invade the body and take over. This movie is not worth watching nor renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad...","review":"quite honestly this is the worst movie have ever seen, 2 likeable people in the movie, (...) nothing redeeming about the movie, bad plot, bad special effects, they didn't have the money to produce a quality movie, plaster molded(and not even retouched!) bug parts all over, the acting was terrible and the storyline was HIGHLY unbelievable, i give this movie 0 starsi am not a little kid, i just didn't want to take the time to register"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Watchable","review":"This is barely watchable. The original \\"Starship Troopers\\" was creative, quirky, and graphically enticing. This is none of those. It is a poorly done sequel that just wants to empty the pockets of its viewers. The acting itself is not bad, but it is like being directed in a desperate fashion. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie","review":"thought it was a cmplaite waist of time. compaires to battlefeald STINKS like last week trashhad to give it a single star but this web sight will not accept any thing lower this movie is a ( - 3 stars )"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shoddy \\"Starship Troopers\\" Sequel","review":"It must have cost the filmmakers ten whole dollars to make this movie. I was blown away by the magnificent special effects and the peculiar acting, but, not really. \\"Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation\\" is a ripoff of many sci-fi films that John Carpenter domineered early in his career. A group of Federation soldiers are isolated in a command post surrounded by Arachnids (really big bugs) and an arrival of infected soldiers ruins their chances of survival. I am truly disappointed that this fine film did not get a theatrical release, but, not really. It's annoying, lousy, and ultimately boring. The gruesome spilling of beans from people tried to make up for the absence of the creatures, the true enemies. But, with a budget of ten dollars, they tried to act. Big mistake. A still motion home video of action figures fighting each other would have been more entertaining. Kelly Carlson should stick to \\"Nip/Tuck\\" and now, I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"RE Every bit as bad as we say! Fans of the original beware!","review":"Well, aside from everything James A Bell said about this movie. I would just like to add that there is one thing he left out. Bad actors none of the original cast from the first Starship Troopers was in the second one. And the actors in this film sucked, I highly doubt any of them got to be in many other films at all. However, on august 8th of 2008 I look for the third Starship Troopers to be better cause at least it will have the actor of the main character from the first one.And on my final note, now that I have seen this movie I totally under stand why it is in the $5 dollar box at Walmart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Those few people who rated this above 2 stars must have been on some kind of hallucinogen. They rehashed the Ships captain from the original movie ( The one that gets crushed under a door) and hoped we wouldn't notice. The First movie was excellent, but this was boring, poorly shot and poorly written. Fortunately Starship Troopers 3 is coming out soon and it seems promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what I expected. Don't waste your $$","review":"I was a big fan of the ST1. The plot and characters were excellent, it rated up there with the best of them I would give ST1 5 stars. I saw this was on sale for a great price so I got it expecting great things. Usually sequels aren't to par with the originals so I at least expeted a 3-star movie. When i flipped on the movie i said \\"WOW....right where they left off\\" at a pretty good battle seen with the BUGS. Well, that was it I was waiting for more action. I waited....I waited...I waited and I waited...they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still wasn't worth it. I don't know who's idea it was for the sequel but I hope this was their last one. I'll stick with the new Battlestar Galactic and Star Trek reruns."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did you guys ruin my favorite movie?","review":"Doesn't even deserve the name. If you think the first was a masterpiece as I do, your in for a real dissappointment. C-class movie doesn't even fare NEAR a B-movie. So bad, so so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there could be no star","review":"I was shocked to see this on cable last night, and I have to say it was awful. The plot was as boring as bodysnatchers. Except for the bugs, which were nothing but the same rendered spiders from the first movie, it had almost nothing to do with starship troopers. No personality to any of the characters. It seemed that they were nothing but boot grads that were out on their first mission of death. The plot was so simple that you could see the whole movie roll out in front of you. The visual effects were horrible. Rendered bugs, sandstorms, and night, are all you can see. I'm gald I didn't buy or rent this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point in making this turkey?","review":"This movie would have been better titled \\"Aliens Revisited.\\" The first movie was at least recognizable as an adaptation of the book, though not a great one. I have trouble believing that the author of this thing (same guy that wrote the first movie) ever read anything by Robert Heinlein, let alone Starship Troopers. It is a complete travesty of his values and his writing style. This was an average Sci-Fi/Horror movie at best-if you like that kind of movie. But if you're a fan of Robert Heinlein this gross piece of garbage will turn your stomach. If I could give it a lower rating I definitely would.On the other hand I have to add that the acting in this movie is better than average and the special effects are impressive. Nor can I find fault with the direction. It's a pity that it was released as a sequel to Starship Troopers.When judged as a stand-alone sci-fi/horror movie it's worth 3-4 stars. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets talk rip-offs.","review":"Scenes: clips taken both in its entirety and other scenes that were just superimposed onto new backgrounds.Special effects: Guns require no reloading, (apparently because of advanced technology), and have no moving parts and no recoil. This compounded with a unoriginal story line, poor acting and reused sound effects attributes to a rip-off of my time.And another thing, isn't the main theme of this movie a rip-off of the 'Iron Chef' theme on the food channel?...I think it is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative 92 stars","review":"If I could I would give this movie -92 stars, for each minute of my life I wasted on it. Such a disappointment for fans of the original Starship Troopers. It pretty much comes down to being a bad slasher movie. The only decent special effects scene was RECYCLED from the first Starship Troopers. The first scene in the movie is comical it is so bad. For fans of the first Starship Troopers who are curious about this movie I'm saving you the suspense and valuable hour and a half of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've seen in years...","review":"Let me get to point straight away; don't waste your time on this movie. Even if you had it as a gift, you will miss the 90 minutes of your life wasted watching this piece of junk. I donno where to start, it is so bad.- Cheesy acting,- Very bad directing,- Has a horrible script (any regular Star Trek episode would be beter than this one),- CGI is not too bad but they don't save the day,- Almost no lightning at all. The whole movie can be summarized as people/action in total darkness. This was the first movie I had to play with the brightness settings of my TV set.Bottom line, don't even consider it. It's that bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste-of-time sequel...","review":"I'm a pretty hardcore fan of \\"Starship Troopers.\\" I've read the book twice, seen the first film a dozen times, and watched the cartoon series. Now I've seen \\"Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation\\" and I must say that I was more than disappointed. The film stinks for many reasons, the biggest being its horrendously low budget. Had the filmmakers had more money, they definitely would've made a better film. But instead we're stuck with this lame, \\"trapped in an abandoned building\\" monster fest instead of the senseless killing and violence the original Paul Verhoeven film displayed. It's very obvious this film was very low-budgeted, which sounds like a mistake on the studio's part. They had their chance to make a great sequel to a very enjoyable movie and they blew it. Don't see \\"Starship Troopers 2.\\" It'll be a huge let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starship troopers 2","review":"How can I say this, HMM, Bad, bad, suckie bad... What a waste of time to watch it, let alone the time spent to get it. This is the first movie I have ever purchases that I will trash. Even \\"Battel field earth\\" was better then this. Way bad. And not the good bad the really bad bad. It sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"DO NOT WASTER YOUR MONEY! This is perhaps the worst movie I have seen, low budget (and it shows), poor acting, stupid plot, how someone could read this script and say lets spend millions on this is unknown to me. Clearly the greed to capitalize on the original film is evident from the moment it starts playing, and folks that is the only reason this film was made because someone was greedy, they could of had a nother hit with some creativity and effort but alas this is a big fat flop, run away..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever","review":"If you are expecting a terrific following to the first Starship Troopers movie then you are going to be disappointed. This is one of the worst low budget, bad acting movies I have seen in quite a while. Gone are the great special effects that filled the first movie and they are replaced by very bad looking CGI effects. There is hardly any blood and gore and what little there is left me feeling unsatisfied. This movie was a complete waste of an hour and a half of my time that I could have used for something more constructive like cleaning my underwear by hand with a toothbrush. Yeah that would have been better than this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed \\"Starship Troopers 2\\", but it IS low-budget.","review":"If you are the type of person who demands theatre-level special effects and a budget above $100 million, give this one a pass - you'll only aggravate yourself.But if you are a ST or science-fiction fan who doesn't mind watching a low-budget sequel, sit down and slip this DVD into the player.It's got all the gore of the first movie, some new equipment, and some new bugs!It makes some philosophical points, and gets you deeper into the heads of the people who run the Federation.Does the film have shortcomings? Sure. But it's enjoyable and worthy of the name \\"Starship Troopers\\".And no matter what it's shortcomings compared to the first film, it's STILL much truer in tone and execution to the original than, say, \\"Alien 3\\" was to its original."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"it looks like tripe no money a they breought an actor that died in the last movie back as a different person with no relation what the heck is wit that"},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute abomination i didnt watch more than the first 10 min","review":"No special effects, horrible acting i actually only watched the first 15 min then started watching my kittens play with a ball for about 10 min then i just stopped watching it altogether.
