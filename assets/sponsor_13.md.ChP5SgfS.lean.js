It is filled with gramatical errors and sentence fragments. Several of the facts are wrong. Doesn't the editor make corrections like this before he publishes the book? Like the police in Boulder, I do not agree that Burke was responsible for the death of JonBenet. She was made up, dressed up, and aged up. But in spite of all of the things that were done to her to make her \\"look\\" pretty, she was the prettiest child that I have ever seen in my life. Her beauty was given to her by God.

Especially if she was getting all the attention and him not? The pageant director and JonBenet have alot in common, the only difference is that one lived, the other didn't. I wonder if JonBenet ever told her mother. I feel this child has been sexually abused for a long time. I have always wanted to enter my little girl in a pageant, now I'm not so sure. If a little girl is pretty, why can't she just win in a simple little party dress? It sounds to me that you have to have the Ramsey money to participate in these so called events!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lotsa spelling and some factual goofs!","review":"I was basically disappointed with this book.

Anyone that has done any research into fibromyalgia knows that we have TENDER points, not TRIGGER points, the author mentions several times TENDER points injections as a pain remedy. I could go on and on about this book but I wont. Instead I suggest you read \\"The Fibromyalgia Advocate\\" by Dr. Devin Starlanyl before you read this book.

The book is relentlessly internal, giving it a strongly claustrophobic feel, but it remains a truly disturbing work. Something Happened is the polar opposite of the more famous Catch-22, but comically, Something Happened is perhaps Heller's best, most sophisticated novel, Heller achieving a superior subtlety through implication, understatement, and irony (as opposed to the brash parody and satire of Catch-22). The book also remains Heller's most ambitious and experimental, and for this reason will turn many readers away. Still, I loved it: I found the narrative voice genuinely compelling and oddly hypnotic. The book lacks a conventional plot, but makes up for it with a fascinating narrator who at first may seem horrible and alien to us, but in fact is much closer to us than we would care to admit.

There are so many useless -- and misused -- parentheticals in this novel that it is hard to stay focused. One minute you're starting a sentence, Heller goes off on a 15 sentence sidethought that has nothing to do with the sentence he started writing, and then 3 minutes later you're back in the middle of the sentence he started... but you have to go back and see just how that sentence began! It's completely absurd. And frustrating. I was beginning to scream obscenities out loud.The first part of the book is brilliant. Funny. Refreshing, really. I thought I was about to read the best thing I've read since... well, Catch-22. But halfway through the chapter on the unhappy daughter the novel becomes tiringly tedious. A task. When was reading supposed to feel like such a job?I couldn't finish it. Others who actually have gotten through it say nothing happens anyway!

Well, \\"Catch-22\\" was a popular novel, but a dud with any sane critic. Now he has produced unquestionably one of the top two or three novels of the 20th century. \\"Something Happened\\" details the illusary American Dream. Something happened to us. We bought into the dream. It doesn't exist, and Heller ably points this out. If you ever wish to enter coporate America, then please heed the message of this book. You cannot take your 1950's values and mindset to the workplace and expect results. Just ask Heller. This book is one the 15 best that I have ever read, and it is probably better than \\"Catch-22.\\"Something happened, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful Look At Our World","review":"Harshly cynical and brutally insightful, this book directs the sharp wit of Catch-22 towards the mundane existence of modern America and it's corporate society.

For if I didn't, I wouldn't have bothered to once reading Something Happened. After getting lost in the wacky but wonderful story captured by Catch 22, I couldn't wait to dive into another work by Heller. However, I found myself greatly disappointed this time around. Although an interesting approach to writting the novel (the majority of it is simply an inner monologue dealing with the conflict of the main character), I just wasn't captured by it. This may be due to its depressing nature. Hint: if you are trapped in a job you dislike with a family that you're not sure you belong in, don't read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"As others before me noted, a more accurate title for this 500 page novel would be \\"Nothing Happened.\\" I read the first 480 pages, then could stand the torture no more and skipped to the last two pages. The language and style are superb but the entire book could really be shortened to play out on a couple of pages. Clearly, Joseph Heller was a master of repetition as the book says the same thing over and over again in thousands of different ways. It seems that everyone who has reviewed this book admits there was no plot of which to speak, however, what they fail to admit is that this a major flaw of the book, probably because they want to believe that they didn't waste the 5 hours it took to read this incredibly long and uneventful novel. Well, read and see for yourself but I think your time could be better spent reading something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish something HAD happened!","review":"Although Heller offers a familiar, intelligent and amusing insight into the routine boredom of the modern workplace, the story itself becomes stale and repetitive without the aid of plot or direction.

Boredom set in as the first part of the story was told over and over again. The only thing that kept me going was to find out what this \\"something\\" was. Then I was treated to a couple lousy paragraphs of what could have been a pivotal moment but instead nothing came of it. Life continued as before- nothing changed when everything should have due to the fact that the central character kept telling us how on the edge he was. A good editor could trim this book down to 100 well written pages and push the author for another 400 to let us know what really happened. Too late now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that truly opens doors....","review":"This book begins with Bob Slocum telling the reader that he fears closed doors. That the unkowny behind closed doors frightens him. He then spends the next 600 pages opening doors by laying his entire mind onto the pages of that book. Every thought, every desire, every fear, every impure want is lain in all it's humantity on these pages. At first I was horrified by what I saw Bob Slocum to be, but as I read on I realized how utterly normal he is. How utterly like me and every other man. And as I read on, I began to understand him and as a result, forgive myself and understand myself a little better. This is the best book I have ever read. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly fantastic","review":"This is my favorite book ever. It will be very hard to stomach and get all the way through, but no book give a better and more vivid view from the perspective of the main character. It is like living a new life just by reading it, and although it is a messed up life, the reflections you have while reading it help shape your own life. Furthermore, there is a sentence on every page that needs to be quoted every now and again. This is literature at its finest, life at its middle, and outlook at its worst. Just like there is a Holden Caulfield in all of us, there is a Bob Slocum, and he is life-changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Tour de Force","review":"This is the real deal!

Jordon Mink, the Angel who accidentally sent an e-mail to Bart, creates an intriguing picture of Heaven. He also answers all of Bart's questions with skill and honesty.

Downfall is an excellent film that is done with much care and accuracy. The acting & cinematography is top notch! and subtitles are clear and not distracting at all. I recommend this movie for any history buff, especially if youre interested in the WWII era or the Nazi regime.

A MUST HAVE for any movie or history lover !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Performance!","review":"While we will probably never know for sure just what transpired in the final days in the bunker, this film gives as acurrate a portrayal as possible.Based on the memories of his secretary, this film delves into the nuances of the panic ridden final days of the Reich.The betrayal of some of his generals, the suicides of those who fervently believed to the end, and the chaos of Berlin. Bruno Ganz is outstanding in his portrayal of the Furher.Even down to the shaking hand due to Parkinson's disease, he is faithful to the behavior and character of one of the most evil men of the 20th century. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful depiction of the end days in the bunker","review":"DownfallA very powerful movie showing the end days of Nazi Germany. It is well acted and shows the different types of people around Hitler apart from Hitler himself. One gets a real sense of what it must have been like in the bunker in the dying days of the war, as it became clearer and clearer for the characters portrayed that the Nazis had lost the war. Some of characters were clearly pathological deviants without question. Others were true believers and followers, who allowed evil to happen as they so much wanted to believe the illusion they were fed, while ignoring the reality and the brutality that was all too obvious for those with eyes to see.Lessons to be learnt in today's world, where a new rise of fascism is evident. Time to watch out and pay attention to what is really happened and done and not just to what the leaders say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"Brilliantly acted (especially the main character) by all. As a history buff and one who remembers WWII, it would have been appreciated to see more of what the \\"general\\" German population was about during this time. However, this film should be seen by those too young to remember and those indifferent to the subject matter, as well as us \\"older folks\\". It will be an education."},{"rating":"1","title":"hitler in the bunker...again","review":"It was an okay movie. I'm just an average guy, not a Nazi history buff or anything. I've seen a few Hitler documentaries about Hiter's last days in the bunker, and this movie just seems like a rather blah dramatization of a documentary. I liked that it was spoken in German. I liked the look of the movie. But it's forgettable once it's over and you move on with the rest of your day. I'm sure it's a much more moving story for Hitler fantatics."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho-hum","review":"This is just a movie, a piece of invention-so why not give it a motive force? Nothing propels this film forward; we can watch Ganz twitch his fingers behind his back only so much, so what? A piece of schmaltz like this needs at least a bit of a story line, a strong dynamic continuity between these oversize personalities.Why always all the focus on one man, Hitler? Hitler didn't do it alone. One fanatic doesn't make a Reich.It took a complaisant,comfort-zone seeking multitude for backing. Joseph Kennedy who lusted to be President was an arch anti-semite and was ready to back Hitler. So much regurgitated maundering about one little man.Where is the movie about the 12 million native Americans genocided out of existence, or the movie about the wholly genocided Tasmanians? And who today would be the one in a thousand to resist fascism when it crushes and lures?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good foreign film","review":"Downfall is a foreign film that anyone with any previous knowledge of the events of WWII can enjoy. It is a brutally realistic film that does not hesitate to show every detail (pleasant or not) to the audience. If you enjoy a historical or war featured film this is definitely the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitler's Last Days","review":"Many films have been produced regarding Hitler, but in the case of DER UNTERGANG (The Downfall)none have been better. The first time I saw the film in Berlin was with an audience that was confronted with a part of German history that they would like to forget. No matter what, the film is superb. It not only shows the madness of the man, but a supposedly softer side. Bruno Ganz performance the best of his career has the character down pad. Historically speaking, film is based on one of Hitler's secretaries Traudl Junge's Diary. She opens the film with a statement from an interview which has been aired on tv. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - Obnoxious DvD ads on the Blu Ray Disc","review":"Since I loaned my regular DvD copy out (and of course forgot who had it) I ordered the Blue Ray version.All I can say is if you want to watch this move, plan ahead - like a good driver - look way down the road - put it on the DvD player an hour or so ahead while it runs through all the obnoxious ads, (and as the years go by ads for which they are irrelevant) then after dinner hopefully the Downfall's menu will be ready for you.So far it has had 5-10 minutes of ads, with no ability to skip to the movie menuHonestly if I had known they were this obnoxious I wouldn't have bought it.They should be paying ME by the minute for every minute their odorous crap is on, preventing me from watching what I thought I was paying for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Saw most of this movie on Showtime and I like WW II movies.

Some echoes for our time. \\"They gave us a mandate... \\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY GOOD MOVIE","review":"Dealing with the last days of the Third Reich, including Adolf Hitler, DOWNFALL resurrects a time most of us living today never knew personally. But through this movie the horrors of war, and the ramifications of decisions taken by men in power, make it all painfully real again. Some excellent performances and haunting scenes make this a very powerful, unforgettable movie. EXTRAS include \\"making of..\\" featurette (in German with subtitles)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Follow-up to World at War","review":"Having recently viewed the magnificent documentary: The World at War, I was intrigued by the subplot of Traudl Junge, Hitler's personal secretary from 1942-45. Also being a fan of Bruno Ganz (Wings of Desire), I purchased Downfall (Untergang). The film clocks in at a hefty 156 minutes, but one never feels like the film drags. Marvelous atmospheric feelings of claustrophobia permeate the scene. The re-creation of the \\"Bunker\\" is well done, as is the nearly-destroyed city of Berlin. Bruno Ganz' Hitler is extraordinary and the secondary roles are well-acted, especially Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge. The fanaticism of Hitler's supporters and opponents is well told. Brutal and heart wrenching to the end.Excellent addition to a cinephile's library. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downfall","review":"Excellent!

Its need to portray every suicidal shot to the head and crushed poison capsule in conscientious detail smacks of the German need for efficiency and one is minded with some irony that it is precisely this type of industrialized slaughter that got them into trouble in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out the Reviews on amazon.co.uk and amazon.de!","review":"I was curious when I got this recommendation from amazon.com, since I was interested in finally watching this movie, of which I heard a lot of great things.Then, due to the lack of reviews here, I checked out some on the british and german amazon sites. It appears the the Blu-Ray has severe shortcomings: Dark picture, bad Dolby soundtrack (compared with the DTS soundtrack of the region 2 DVD), and fixed english subtitles in the picture over the german soundtrack (which is listed as \\"english\\" on all amazon sites).I'll wait until there is a good Blu-Ray release in the US or germany before I order this."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH! So CONTROVERSIAL!","review":"This movie would be a revelation if it had humanized Hitler. But it didn't. Bruno Ganz' performance was uninspired. He's a great actor, but he doesn't do anything that strays far from cliche. A lot of yelling and sweating and twitching. The only thing revelatory about the movie was the character of Goebbels and his wife; or rather, the performances of said characters by their actors. The movie was disappointing and almost pointless because the moviemakers created the movie on the assumption that the making of it would justify its existance. It didn't. There is no idea in this movie. It is just props. Try it again, Germany."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heroic Portrait of a Group of Cowards","review":"The movie is made too independent of the events that led up to the bunker; consequently, the viewer feels sorry for the \\"benevolent\\" F��hrer by the time he is shaking hands with his immediate staff for his and hers farewell suicides. The woman that portrays Eva Braun did a nice job; as far as women actors go, I was glad that strong personalities were given to women (Eva Braun & Frau Goebbel)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PERFORMANCE FOR THE AGES","review":"Jamie Foxx did an incredible job as Ray Charles, but it doesn't compare to Bruno Ganz' portrayal of Hitler in this film. I have done extensive study on Hitler. It's obvious Ganz has done his homework as well. From his posture, his mannerisms and even his speech, it's almost like watching Hitler in the flesh. This portrayal is up there with Scott's \\"Patton\\" Brando's \\"Don Corleone\\" as a watershed moment in acting.Another performance worthy of note is the lady that plays Magda Goebbels. She is the most coldly monstrous female villian onscreen since Louis Fletcher's \\"Nurse Ratched\\" in Cuckoo's NEst."},{"rating":"2","title":"OSCAR CALIBER","review":"Why did this movie not win an Oscar?

Perhaps the greatest part of it was the ambience, tension and human conflicts the director created in Hitler's bunker. Sitting in the cinema made the audience one of the characters as if you are with Hitler, Speer, Goebbels etc. This movie is one of the few that described the last days of Hitler and his associates. It deserves a rating of 5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate Hitler","review":"I cannot imagine a better portrayal of Adolf Hitler will ever cross our screens. As far as will ever be known the events shown here are totally accurate. These people were not monsters, they were human beings who perpetrated monstrous acts, a fact this film personifies. Even if WW2 doesn't appeal to you watch this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, Fantastic Story of Hitler's Fall","review":"I never knew Hitler was a vegetarian, but that is just the tip of the iceberg of information this film delivers in a finely acted and superb screenplay of Hilter's last days in his bunker.I wouldn't say this is on the top tier of war films(Das Boot, Schindler's List), but it does deliver a riveting account from one of Hitler's secretaries, as one of histories worst war criminals sinks into his own madness of hell.Recommended for more maturer audiences(subtitles, and a little long in some spots), but it is important to truly understand the mind of a mass murderer, as he takes himself and his followers into their deaths."},{"rating":"2","title":"great film","review":"The person that played Hitler was outstanding.It is missing the fifth star because the ending was weak.One thing for sure if you have studied Hitler you know Eva Braun would have never been up on a table dancing.Also he never kissed her in public except on the cheek and that was not often."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few DVD's I own","review":"This is one of the few DVDs I own. I know it is not one that I will put on all the time for a feel good experience but I didn't buy it for that reason. I own it because it is the highest of art. It is like having your own Matisse or Picasso. This is about as good as modern film making gets. I am not a fan of WWII films and the genre has been flooded with so many poor ones why watch another one right? That is what I thought...see this one it is one of the best ever made on the subject or any other subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downfall","review":"Intense and intimate portrayal of Hitler's demise has the crazy, nightmarish feel of a Bosch painting, with a pervading sense of unreality, the last barrier to death and destruction. This is an astounding film experience for those with the stomach for it. Ganz renders Hitler so expertly that the effect is spooky, as if the dead had been brought back to life. Other searing performances come from Juliane Kohler as a curiously cheery, detached Eva Braun, and both Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch make your blood run cold playing the twisted, ever loyal Josef and Magda Goebbels. Finally, the delicate, wide-eyed Lara beguiles as Traudl, a mostly innocent lamb placed by fate right in the center of the wolf's lair. Nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, with good reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate Historical Portrayal","review":"I got this movie because I wanted to get a sense of what it was like in the bunker when Adolf Hitler committed suicide. The director and producer take great pains to research the events of those final days. The bunker is recreated from architectural plans of Hitler's original bunker. The uniforms are authentically re-created. This is a good movie in that respect.However, it is not a particularly moving movie and it's not meant to be. It's meant to give a historical account and to make us think about how destructive an ideology can be. I was moved a bit during the moments when Goebbels's wife poisons her six children. It made me contemplate to what extent someone will go to be true to their beliefs.I watch Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, Schindler's List, The Sound of Music and a few other movies over and over again. I wouldn't watch this film again as frequently, perhaps a few years later.I'm still contemplating buying the Blu Ray version if it is not too expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downfall","review":"This by far one of the all time great films of our time.

Having read Albert Speer's account of the Third Reich, \\"The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl\\", Stephen Ambrose, John Keegan, Eisenhower, Churchill, Lidell-Hart, and many others, it is readily apparent that \\"Downfall\\" is the product of meticulous research.

This doesn't play like a movie \\"about\\" something, or even a documentary. It's almost something like 'living history.' Appears to be well researched historically and I didn't get the sense that the makers made too many assumptions or took many liberties for the sake of drama. The acting was spot on and not the least bit self indulgent. The result is a stark and disturbing slice of history. If you watch this and \\"The White Ribbon\\", I think you can get a pretty accurate glimpse of the mentality that gave rise to Nazi Germany. And 75 or so years later, a few generations removed, it's still bloody frightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"Downfall is an honest look at Hitler and his final 10 days in his bunker.

The book's premise (the whole population of the United States flees to Europe in the 2030s, then the whole continent is turned to desert when the Bering Strait is dammed) and characters (nutcases all) were totally implausible.

Manson appears in the story everything turns to the bad, worse, worst direction. The whole adventure becomes \\"forced\\" like the author had to make an end to the story (time pressure ?).

I even used a wash cloth to try and get the residue off. No luck. The scent isn't sweet at all, which is all right. I didn't expect it to have a strong scent. It just isn't the soap for me. Also I read the side label and its ingredients. I did not see \\"olive oil\\" in its list. So who knows what those chemicals are that I am putting on my face.

I also love that the cloth strips are reusable--that means one less product to buy! I will recommend heating up this gel slightly before using so you can spread a thinner layer on your skin.

The cleaning pads are so thin, they act like wet tissue and wad up when used - useless. There are only 5 cloth strips enclosed, so that is enough to do almost half of one leg. What a waste! Pass on this one. There has to be something better out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but a little messy...","review":"I've used this product sparingly over the years since I don't have much hair, and I use it mostly on my legs. It works ok for the most part, but it can be a little messy since the product often leaves some residue.

The truth is, it just sticks to your skin and not to your hair. I was waxing the same part over and over again, pulling out two hairs at a time. I tried different temperatures, different thickness layers of the wax, read and re-read the instructions.I swiped a very thin layer over one small area and when I removed the wax I had a small hickey like bruise, so ugly, I was shocked.

It's a little tough to use straight out of the package so I just warm it up for 30 secs in the microwave and put it in a bowl of warm water and stir it up until its soft and pasty. It gets a little messy so keeping a towel nearby will come in handy. I typically keep up with my Brazillian waxing and for me it hurts less when I do it versus going into a salon and having some stranger do it and not giving you time to brace yourself (pus I'm saving a butt-load of money doing it at home). The nay-sayers of this product are obviously doing something wrong or just don't get the fact that waxing will hurt regardless of what your pain tolerance.Plus it's super convenient to just toss the cloth strips into the washer with the rest of my laundry.

While the instructions say you can reuse the cloth strips, I really found that advice rather dubious and some what gross.

It used a ton of wax and all of the strips just to do my legs and it didn't get anything off my knees. The only place it really worked well was where there were just a few relatively fine hairs like the thighs. Gave me some nasty looking red bumps for about 2 days, but that wouldn't have been a big deal IF it actually removed all the hair I applied the gel to.The only reason it's 2 stars instead of 1 is that it didn't hurt that much and it was very easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst decision EVER,","review":"I used this product on my chest and stomach, which was a HUGE mistake.

He dresses it up in naughty, lacy, hilariously funny and exotic costume, but he is speaking the clear, unvarnished truth nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Mesmerizing!","review":"Mr. Swift has painted a brilliant picture with this magnificent novel.

When I received it, I was a little confused since the plastic wrapping had a sticker on it that read: \\"For use only with Blu-Ray players and drives\\" but sure enough, the box cover inside read \\"HD-DVD\\" right across the top so I opened it up. You bet I was surprised when I found three Blu-Ray discs inside. I guess I can't really complain much since the Blu-Ray version of this set retails for $50 where the HD-DVD set was $37.

It is hard to see a big difference in this regular DVD and the Blu-ray.The movies are great. the quality is a real let down. This review is based on the HD quality, not the review of the movie, as it should be on the Blue ray box set listing. Don't waste your money until they do a better job with the quality of the conversion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same story, more detail.","review":"I'm sure everyone has seen this series so my rating is not based on the plot or acting quality. Everything looks great in HD, of course. The problem is that because they are crooks (lovable crooks, but crooks nonetheless) their operations usually happen at night or in the dark. That means tons of film noise, which is gloriously captured in 1080p. I find that some of the night/dark shots are grainy to a point of being obvious, though not enough to annoy me. It's like two guys sitting next to you in the theater, constantly chatting away in low volumes. It doesn't distract from the movie, but you'd enjoy things a little more if it weren't there. That's the only minor imperfection I could find. Everything else is marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solely To Counter The Guy/Gal Below Me","review":"Ocean's Eleven is a fantastic film and the two follow on are still a good time, although not the same quality as the first. The second is by far the weakest and takes the most liberties with being ridiculous. You do have to suspend disbelief in these films but it is totally insane to say they are a bad trilogy especially when the first is genius. Not to mention that the original is actually pretty crappy if you go back and watch it. Just because it is a classic doesn't make it good. If you look at the original Thomas Crown it is actually quite bad. The remake was a fun, very well done film. Clearly the previous reviewer has an axe to grind and that is making it into their review. If the extras are anything like extras on the non-HD versions, you'll be pleased.

Perhaps the worst trilogy around, you have to have rocks in your head to want to pay over $50 for the \\"privilege\\" of owning all three.

It had a nice 'heft' for a small rasp, looked tough and capable, and I liked the integrated chisel tip. I purchased the 1/2\\" to try on a decoy I am making. Although smaller and shorter than a normal rasp, it is extremely rugged -- the end of the handle is capped with a metal striking surface for use with a mallet when used as a chisel. The rasp is less aggressive than other rasps, but for more delicate wood removal when modeling or carving, it is ideal. The WoodChuck is an innovative design, very well made and reasonably priced -- I was so impressed I purchased the entire set!

The maps are light on detail and rather plain, the travel information is superficial, and about half the book is index pages for the low-detail maps. So it turns out to be both a poor atlas, and a not very good travel guide.It's not terrible either, but not worth the money.

What seemed weird was how the heavy duty cord would become so easily twisted. Last week the twisting became too much for the wiring to bear and the iron shorted out. The cord actually popped (mini explosion if you will) with a slow flame coming out of where the rupture occurred. It was sort of like a burning fuse.Anyway, a check of the warranty shows that it was only good against defects for six months. My wife wanted to try taking it back to Target where we bought it, but I suspect she will have little luck.

I detached the rear panel and discovered the rubber cord covering burned through aprox 1.5 inches before the 3 internal wires (1 white, 1 green, and 1 black)split off. I pulled back the outer covering and discovered the black wire had completely burned through. The white and green wires seem undamaged.

It certainly did not make me want to take up Aikido and I didn't feel much in common with the author. Twigger is , I guess, a very clever guy but at the same time I feel that he is a bit of a thug and rather a wastrel. He may have learned Aikido but he didn't learn much Japanese or much about Japan - in fact I found the book curious: every other book on Japan which I have read written by a foreigner betrays the author's love for the country (even if that is laced with some fairly strong criticisms). Twigger betrays no such emotion - I got the impression that he took virtually nothing away from his time in the country. I thought that his descriptions of Japanese food, which he dismisses as horrible, reminiscent of the caricature of the English xenophobe and his other insights on Japanese society were not very insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read, with forgivable factual errors","review":"This is a very good read, and a good look at the mentality towards Budo training in Japan.

Even though the course is supposed to be for the benefit of the Tokyo Riot Police, they usually accept a few foreigners every year to take part and spread the art.From the get go you'll notice that is more a memoir than anything else. Mr. Twigger's writing goes from being a puny english teacher in a strange land, to a tough accomplished martial artist who knows about pain and patience.All in all a very funny, insightful read. I would recommend this to anybody interested in travel or the martial arts. I would in particular recommend this to anybody practicing Aikido, (I do Yoshinkan as well) because of the books focus on his training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive, but not good quality","review":"Probably the least expensive 10-30 zoom binoculars you can find. However, the quality is lacking. The problem with these is they are very hard to focus, and the focus wheel is very sensitive. A little nudge sets them out of focus, and you need to re-focus again. That means that if you adjust the distance between view lenses to set for distance between your eyes, the focus is lost. And focusing them is hard - it has to be just right. A little bitt off, and focus is lost. I do not recommend this pair. I am returning mine, and using a Celestron UpClose zoom binoculars instead.

No matter where the steam setting is set, it still tends to \\"drip\\". Quite annoying. The plastic guard on the cord is way to high and makes ironing uncomfortable on the wrist. I'd go back to my Black and Decker, but they discontinued the model. Darn it. In Europe, they make tons of brands (Tefal, Moulinex, Krups) but not for the American market. Come on manufacturers, lots of us love natural fabrics and we still iron! Give us some choices. But if you iron on a regular basis, you MUST use a steam generator iron. It will truly cut your ironing time in half. The reservoir holds three times as much water as a regular iron and the steam gets three times as hot so the sole plate doesn't have to be as hot...hence, no scorching. Your clothes end up looking like they were pressed by a dry cleaner. Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Iron!","review":"This iron is worth its weight in gold.

Right now I have a mixture of tap and bottle water (not distilled water). The real problem for me is that it doesn't turn itself off when inactive for a while. If that is not a problem for you, it is a good product.SInce my first review I had to send the iron in for repair a first time sometimes in the middle of 2011. It was under warranty so it cost me only the shipping to California.Now it is broken again. This time it is NOT under warranty and I have to send it to California, then wait for an estimate and see if it is worth repairing it. The problem now is major.

This iron is a huge disappointment, my previous iron is a Rowenta still works, just very old. This was a gift to myself, thought it would ease the drudge of ironing, I am upset to say the least.Tried to contact Rowenta...very difficult, if not impossible.

I took the first one back and exchanged it for a new one, thinking it was just a defect on the single one I'd purchased. But the EXACT same thing happened. I just returned it with great sadness. When this is working, it performs beautifully. It's the right price. But I think because the tank is under pressure (part of what makes it a great streamer) is puts pressure on the seams, which are not well made. Ultimately it is the demise of the unit. Sad.

No problem. I like this iron A LOT.Two things - the O ring was torn on the tank valve (out of the box)-- the valve you screw into the water tank. It takes a 11 x 2.5 mm O ring.Also, the unit has to completely cool down before adding more water to it.I waited an hour after unplugging it -- when I poured water into the tank I got a nasty surprise.

I iron most of our clothes and it does what it promises, cutting my ironing down to half. I was amazed at the ease of use and the amount of steam this iron creates. Not to mention the length of time I can iron before I have to fill up the tank. It does take a little getting used to as it does take around 7 minutes to warm up and ready to iron, but comparing that to the time you save over-all is not an inconvenience at all. It is a quality product and the iron; because it is not filled with water, is not heavy and is not burden to iron over a long period of time. I would recommend this iron for anyone who wants a professional, time saving, quality product. I look forward to ironing now......well at least I don't dread it like I used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"trigger brakes easily","review":"The iron works fine, but the plastic steam trigger breaks easily, you'll find many reports on the web.

The cord is plenty long and it produced a lot of steam.That's about all the nice things I can say about it.It takes a long time to heat up, so if you tend to iron just the things you need for the day, this probably isn't your best choice. Filling it up with water was a pain, they give you a fancy-looking funnel with a float built into it. It would indicate it was full about .2 seconds before water was running out of the filler hole when it was working at all. It spit water even after it was good and warmed up. Apparently, it was leaking water as evidenced by our wood floor. Finally, the power switch went out of it. It was still under warranty, so if I was willing to pay for shipping it to a repair center, they would have fixed it.

Not just a little but so loud that I'm afraid it will blow the cap completely off. I wrote Rowenta and their solution was to buy a new iron! I couldn't believe what I was reading.

I'm a very experienced seamstress who has used a Sussman gravity-feed iron for the last 20 years. It finally gave out and I decided to replace it with this Rowneta. When it's working, it adequate, but not outstanding. There's no way to tell how much water is in the reservoir - the funnel indicator quit working and when it's overfilled, it's a major problem. Of course you can't fill it while the system is hot, which is another pain.The Sussman showed you exactly how much water you have and you can refill any time. It's also much quieter than the Rowenta and produced more consistent steam.This iron is a complete waste of money.

It does a great job on even the gentlest of fabrics!Though, I do iron in large quantities and the lack of a water level is the product's downfall. I followed the instructions on how to refill the chamber while in use, but it still was dangerous and not worth it. I used up whatever steam was left in the unit, then let it cool and unplugged it too. According to the rather simple directions, this should have sufficed. Though, when slowly unscrewing the cap, a loud shriek came out of the unit and nearly burned me. Now, I've worked with professional models as a tailor over the years, but this was the worst near accident that I've ever had.

The personal growth that Frieda undergoes as a result of meeting Min is superbly developed by Pamela Jooste.

The soprano soloist is a delight, with two beautiful high notes, and much better than the soloist on Rutter's own first recording.The companion pieces are all of great interest, revealing a musically more complex Rutter than is often heard, with none of the ocassionally cloying sweetness of his Christmas carols or music for children. They, like the Requiem, are well performed by the ideally sized ensemble and choir, with excellent diction, beautiful phrasing and some impressive singing. A highly recommended disc, perfect for some contemplative moments alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Collection Item","review":"I purchased the Requiem CD after hearing one of the selections on NPR and enjoy every selection on the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless as text or reference","review":"I am taking a graduate course in Statistics.

Author Prados outlines why we were never able to interdict the flow of troops and supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos into South Vietnam. As a veteran of C-130 flare missions searching for trucks over the Trail, I now understand why our task was often so fruitless.Sam McGowanVietnam Veteran, author of \\"The Cave\\", a novel of the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a tough read.","review":"Hard to follow along on this one. It's full of information about the Ho Chi Minh Trail but it is basically information, not anything to really get involved in. It was a chore to work through this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinatown inside a liberal arts college!!!!!","review":"Prose manages in The Blue Angel to turn gender politics into a speculation on human nature and the inability of any of us to really understand anyone else. Our hero Professor Swenson is an eminently reasonable and understandable guy, introspective as hell, if perhaps more naive than he ought to be (especially at his age). His path through this book is similar to many noir detective mysteries, since while he is quite clever about many, many things that happen to and around him, the end proves that he never had a clue about anyone else's motives. Prose cleverly argues from the other side of political correctness via her mysterious \\"conspiracy theory\\" view of campus life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Careful What You Wish For","review":"Francine Prose does a masterful job of depicting the inner workings of the mind of a middle-aged, frustrated writer/teacher. Swenson is so stunned and possibly jealous of Angela's novel in progress that he is irresistably drawn to the pierced, dark young girl. I was impressed by how much Swenson's thoughts and reactions to his obsession reflected how middle aged men (like me) think and fret, yearn and fear. I'm a teacher, and I know how the protagonist could feel himself slipping closer to the forbidden despite being aware of the snares that awited him and the taboos against his desire. The characters were funny, pathetic, intriguing, and infuriating. While presenting these wonderful characters, Prose also takes insightful swipes at the vageries of the U.S. college world. I highly recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"unintentionally entertaining","review":"In this novel, about a professor of creative writing, the author exhibits every example of bad writing that she is trying to satire. Her characters are comprise a cardboard collection of cliched details. They are unsympathetic and the reader could care less about their fates. She uses \\"yeasty smell\\" twice in 15 pages. The plot is predictable. What else? The funniest part is when Prose attempts to show us the \\"brilliant writing\\" of Anglea Argo. If you want to read a REALLY funny and beautifully written send-up of the academic world, read Nabokov's Pnin. If you want to see a wonderful example of writings within a novel, read Byatt's Possession."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm.","review":"Wow, I really did not like this book. The writer is very talented, but the main character, Swenson, is just so pathetic that I couldn't stand it. His lack of brain power is similar to that of a main character in a horror flick who goes into the basement when they know the monster is still in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urghhhhhhhhh...","review":"This book was an annoying novel about an over-obsessive, sex-hungry professor who was easily munipulated by a student. The character 'Ted' was one that did not have any control over his emotions whatsoever, and ended up having much hell to pay in the meantime. I usually like to try to keep a generally positive attitude towards new books, but this one was simply just a blowout, and there is little more to be said. The one positive thing that I can think to say about this book (and there are few) was that the author sucessfully pursuaded me to like Ted and take his side throught the writing: the book could also have worked the other way with a lot more ease: have Angela as the victim, Ted as the evil perpitrator with a messed-up mind... The whole book just seemed to be a way for the author to get all of her sex emotions out onto paper, and I sincerely think that this book was one that should never be published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"I'm sorry. I thought the premise of this novel would be entertaining, satirical, and worth the price of the book. It was anything but. This is NOT a \\"smart bomb attack on academic hypocrisy and cant\\" as the book jacket endorsement states. This is a B-52 cluster bomb drop on the usual attitides about men from those who wish to portray them as befuddled, confused creatures who could perhaps survive in this world if they weren't being constantly outsmarted and dominated by the superior sex. I was more than disappointed by the book after being drawn in to purchasing it buy the commercial hype that we find on this site. I think the reader's comments here, for the most part, are a more accurate portrayal of what awaits."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the #$%^!","review":"Why on earth did Ms. Prose bother to publish a book obviously ghost-written at the end? Did she hand it over to a student? Arg. Read endings BEFORE you read beginnings to know if they are worthy of your time to get there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Angel","review":"I agreed with Laura Clawson who also rated this book with 2 stars. I did NOT find this book \\"blisteringly funny\\" or \\"deliciously risque\\" as purported on the back cover. In the end, this book leaves you with a dismal feeling about most of the characters and an unexplained, unfinished plot. In addition, the subject matter, I must say, is not pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"manipulative characters, manipulative author","review":"The book is extremely readable and descriptive, which serves to make this manipulative novel all the more infuriating. It is obvious that Prose has issues towards academia and, more precisely, men in positions of power within. I have never encountered a central character so deliberately and antagonizingly destroyed. The manipulation with which the young girl employs to tear down this professor is topped only by the author herself, in setting up and then pulling the rug from under the reader. Francine Prose IS Angela Argo, an alter-ego to slay her dragon. I regret being taken along as a witness."},{"rating":"1","title":"mundane and sloppy","review":"This novel is just too ordinary. Political correctness is an old topic and the author doesn't do anything new or special with it. The writing is very careless, and the characters are easy and seem to get easier as the storyline progresses. The storyline isn't much---young girl manipulates poor helpless middle-aged married professor---and by the end of the book the whole plot has collapsed into tedious nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even a satire must have depth","review":"Even a satire needs characters with whom the reader can become involved and sympathize. Unfortunately, no realistic, or sympathetic characters exist in Blue Angel. Even Sherrie, the main character's wife, is so loosely drawn that you don't care if her husband cheats on her. Also, there is no moment in the book where you \\"get\\" that she has suspected him all along. And frankly, the subject of sexual harassment is too important and too sensitive to be satirized in such a pathetic fashion. I didn't even finish this book. I just put it down, thankfully, in a dusty and far removed corner of my at-home library."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unsatisfying read","review":"I expected much better from Ms. Prose. This novel was a tour de force of poorly executed characters, unbelievable relationships, and lame dialogue. And while the plot had some potential - indeed, it was that potential that carried me through the lumpy, redundant prose - it failed to bear fruit of any real literary interest. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Student teacher crush gone bad.","review":"And I mean bad. I wanted to like it, but there were too many problems with the story and too many unanswered questions -- there were even a few typos in the book! While there were some good parts, they were far and few between. This story does not make the grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes on the Shallow Politically Correct Atmosphere of Academia","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is an interesting and fun satire on the 'politically correct' atmosphere that exists in academia, especially in English Departments.The novel is told from the point of view of a male English professor who has followed all the rules 'till now'. He finds himself getting royally screwed by a pathologic personality disordered colleague, what is known in the therapy world as a 'borderline personality'.I appreciated the comic aspect of the professor's own perceptions and rationalizations for his behaviors as he decides he no longer wants to follow the rules he'd always adhered to, the unspoken behaviors that a good professor must incorporate into his life. I also laughed out loud at the rhetoric of all the 'politically correct' mandates of academia. Ms. Prose makes academia sound like the Gulag. I agree with her 100%."},{"rating":"1","title":"The humor escaped us!","review":"I hated this book and was bit relieved when my book club gave it a thumbs down. The main character was a despicable human being, basically an ego-centric, second rate writer who lets himself be totally manipulated by a student. The portrait of political correctness on campus was funny indeed--but his totally asinine behavior robbed the \\"trial\\" scenes of any impact. This may sound far-fetched, but this book replicated the beginning of \\"Disgrace\\" by Coetzee--but of course that was a book that had something to say, and the academic angle was merely a springboard to a very different story. You can pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Physically ill to the bitter end","review":"I will hate this wonderfully well written book. The whole thing was depressing from the author's description of parents walking with their sons and daughters across the quad on Parents' Day to the horribly twisted relationship between Swanson and his wife, Swanson and his daughter and, oh Lord, Swanson and that...sophomore, Angela. She sounds like a disgusting person and yet Swanson is so amazed by her writing talent that he actually developes a crush on her! This horribly gross girl who dyes her hair ugly colors and paints her face with make up. She's got metal all over her pierced face and somehow he finds that attractive. I wanted to vomit more than once.Despite the fact that I was disgusted through this whole book, I had to give it two stars because the satire and the writing is just so good. If you're reading it for writing style, then by all means enjoy. If you're reading it just for liesure..., put it back on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"addictive","review":"there's no need to get longwinded here; suffice to say, for me, this was a consistently, deeply absorbing and gratifying read; funny, constantly, without sacrificing its building, exciting suspense at all. That's hard to pull off, but Francine Prose has done it. This was the first of her books I've read. I'm off to her latest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself","review":"This book sounded interesting from its premise, but turned out to be absolute garbage. The characters are stereotypical and thoroughly unlikable. The story also becomes fairly outlandish after the first few chapters. Prose doesn't take the time to establish a plausible story and that is what ultimately leads to this book's downfall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"Having worked at a small liberal arts college for 15 years, I appreciated Prose's portrayal of academic politics & the witch hunt to reinvent sexual harrassment on campuses. However, I found her characters flat, weak, & a snore. Basically, I just couldn't muster any \\"care\\" about them one way or the other. Overall, there is little substance within these pages. If your time (not to mention, your money) is valuable, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Satire Of Workplace Politics","review":"I loved this book on several levels. Many will cheer on the passive-aggressive resistance the protagonist feels toward the politics inherent in the university world. He's definitely not written as a hero. From the beginning you wonder if he sees his downfall before him, or if indeed he can come through smelling like a rose. Being a silent observer to his releckness was somewhat thrilling. If you don't understand or enjoy satire, don't understand or chose to ignore the politics of hierchical structures, take a pass on this book. If you have ever attended or taught at a university, this book is a must-read. Anyone who appreciates the social politics all around us, and follows hot-potato topics in the workplace, will enjoy not only the content of this book, but it's satiric writing style as well. Even as the main character appears to spiral toward his own undoing, you'll laugh out loud at the characters that help grease his fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, David.","review":"In June, I attended a David Sedaris reading, part of his latest book tour. At the end, he held up Francine Prose's \\"Blue Angel\\" and said it was the funniest book he's read in a long time. So, knowing his work, I went into this novel expecting laugh out loud hilariousness. This novel is so much more though. Prose writes with such a clever hand that you don't often laugh out loud, but chuckle inside at her deft use of language and humor and wordplay. I loved the characters, especially Swenson, his wife Sherrie, and of course, the Angela, the Blue Angel herself. If you've ever taken a college creative writing class, you'll appreciate the numerous scenes where student stories are workshopped. Francine Prose captures college life and student attitudes perfectly. This novel made me want to read other Prose books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compulsively readable!","review":"Here is the rare literary novel I simply couldn't put down. Why? Was it the sordid little story with the sexy details? Probably didn't hurt, but I don't think so. I think it's Prose's sense of humor, her insights into common human foibles, her keen analysis of the complexities of political correctness, and above all, her superb storytelling ability and easy-to-read style.I laughed out loud reading the faculty dinner party scene. And even though I could see how the characters would evolve and where the story would have to go sooner or later, I was never less than captivated. Only the very end was unsatisfying. Unfortunately, I'm forced to confess my desire for a more complete ending that ties up all the loose ends. But, please, don't let that dissuade you. (I only wanted to know what would happen to all the characters. Perhaps a sequel will come some day, though I doubt it.) Ultimately, you'll just love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treachery that frees","review":"This book is wise, sly, witty, and enormously entertaining. It is both a cautionary tale and a satire, both a tragedy and a comedy. The ending, which another reviewer did not like, is left to the reader's imagination and I thought it was boffo. The stage was set for the antagonists each to be redeemed, which is why I liked it so much. The author's writing skills are enviable, her turns of phrase are most amusing, that is, except for the bits which make your hair stand on end! Highly recommended to sophisticated readers interested in how people deal with messy life events of their own making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people?","review":"This book is a good read. It has forbiden sex and suspense. But it has it's flaws. The protagonist, Ted Swenson is a creative writing professor at a small New England college. One of his criteria for good writing is that the characters have to be believable. It is interesting to apply his principles to the novel itself. Swenson comes off as quite believable, but his nemisis, Angela Argo is not. Her destructive actions have no conceivable motive. She is too clever and her timing is too acurate to suppose that she is psychotic. Likewise, the campus atmosphere is not like anything I have ever seen(for example, the English Department party), and while sex between faculty and students has become no-no, the description of the faculty meeting on this subject is an unbelievable exageration of the PC attitudes that prevail. What saves the book is the portrayal of Swenson. I have met him - many of him. And there are parts of himin every middleaged man."},{"rating":"2","title":"First half GREAT!","review":"The flawless writing style that let the reader know each character to the extent that the story needed them impressed and delighted me. Not being told how to feel while reading various points of view and reactions is rare, and here it's done succinctly as well. When I realized that I no longer cared what came next I saw that the plot wasn't strong enough for the cast to carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"reading and writhing","review":"A good book. To be more precise, it's a well-crafted novel that's squirmily uncomfortable to read. The situation is not particularly new; it's even been the basis for a couple of recent movies: a writing professor who was hired because of one sucessful novel and has been blocked ever since. What she does with the familiar material, though, is sharp and original -- and far too perceptive to be a fun read for a writing professor! Her self-deluding anti-hero is bombastic and manipulative and careless, in both senses of the word, and I can see myself doing a tamer version of almost every self-destructive gaffe he commits on his way to academic self-immolation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Ending","review":"Up until the last two chapters, I experienced the book as a slyly hysterical, mocking story under the sure hand of a woman of exceptional wit and observation. Then the story suddenly turned into a grimly obvious tale fatalistically propounding some blandly literal but morally obscure stance. The ending was tonally false. What a turn-around! I feel like a writing teacher seduced into thinking the author had some real talent only to have my judgment completely bashed at final exam time. Weird feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Angel","review":"I agreed with Lauren C. who also rated this book with 2 stars.

I thought I would like this novel --but I didn't. And it wasn't the author's way with characters, which is very good --it was the plot, which didn't make sense. (Maybe I am too old), which is a failing in a reviewer. And it isn't that this novel is truly bad, a la Danielle Steele, etc. But it is very disappointing. The story just didn't hang together.

The components, processor, and the fact that all of the peripherals and connection are located in the screen adds to the aesthetic, but it is not as innovative as the iMac with the floating screen.

The tone of the book is defensive and unscientific. The author argues that God must exist because most people through the ages have believed in God.

The author erects tightly defined strawmen that should blow over in a spiritual wind, but even then the author has trouble constructing a coherent argument and widely misses the mark several times.

I brought this book when I was aged, 14/I'm now aged, 36. I go back and refer to this book, at least, once, for every single fortnight of my entire life! The book introduced me to the art of Aikido; it is, truly, the Aikido bible! Explaining Aikido on every possible level, techniques/history/philosophy. It, immediately, got me hooked on Aikido, forevermore. I used the think all martial arts were like beat em up/but, this book taught me, otherwise/martial arts is not about offence/but, self-defence, phsyical skill based on clear scientific principles/ furthermore, wisdom, deep spirituality; and, finally, enlightenment.

However, like all books, videos etc. I only reccomend this material to someone with a strong Martial Arts background."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Aikido book I have ever read.","review":"I first read this book in 1989 when I started studying Aikido. It was more than useful as a beginning student and continued to be useful through my progression into teaching over the years to come. I recently moved across country and wasn't able to pack much. This book was one item I left behind. I am returning to Aikido after a three year recovery from an auto accident and even though I have my original copy in story I am happy to be shopping for a second.One of the most important aspects of Aikido is transcending the techniques and grapsing the underlying theory. This book certainly helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better buy than the original Swing When You're Winning","review":"The lady is a tramp and That's Life are excellent and Robbie's versions of them are even better.

The numbers on the cars are very nice, but the cars are not in number order, which is confusing for 2 year olds. A downfall to the structure of this puzzle is that the paper pictures eventually rip at the edges.

I believe the series storyline started off as a sequel that was to be called Blood Kin (though don't quote me on that). I do know that Jimmy O Burril was using the web series to show investors the viability of the character so he could get the budget he wanted to make an amazing sequel. They were short webisodes that were high energy with lots of gore averaging bout 7 to 10 minutes long (I used to watch them just before leaving for work in the morning so my frame of mind was just in the right place). I bought the original DVD release right off the Forbidden Pictures website. A great fun time for horror and gore fans with the right blend of humor mixed in.

Well, actually, anything is better than speakers with the thickness and consistency of a sheet of paper, but you get what I'm saying. They aren't Bose or anything, but for $30 it's by far a great value for most folks. I'm a musician and am fairly critical about music quality (but not critical enough to spend $200 on a pair of speakers lol) and I think these are quite above par. Add a small amplifier (I usually use a small 100 watt x 4, also Boss Audio) and a small subwoofer to the mix and you got the recipe for some great sounding tunes. By adding a small amp, even if you don't listen to it loud, you are going to get more clarity and better bass response even at lower levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and even greater service!!","review":"i was amazed at how well the speaker performs. it took less than a week to arrive and they were able to bundle it in one box with all my other items! i just wish it would have been more specific on whether it came in a pair, or just one.. i bought two just to be sure. but now i have an extra set... so a little disappointed at that but everything else is 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can i say more bass?","review":"I tried it on my home entertainment system and it sounded ok but when I placed it in the car, it stunk.

(Or is it that there are so few casual readers of poetry? I note that there are very few customer reviews of books of poems...) It seems to me that most readers enjoy having their emotions stimulated by use of poetic language and form, and are less interested in edginess, or newness, or technical fireworks. On that basis, I recommend reading the poem You, referred to by one reviewer as a trite generalization directed at a distant you. Doesn't feel trite or generalized to me--in fact, as it transports me into the experience of someone yearning for his dead mother (pretty specific, huh?) it makes me cry. I don't feel manipulated, just moved. I'm not lost in admiration of Davison's technical achievement, just moved.

For me, the book gets too bogged down in the minutae of some of the battles and doesn't put the military strategy in overall perspective. It also hasn't clearly shown the evolution of tank tactics resulting from the lessons learned from those battles, but merely describes key battles in chronological order and lets the reader draw their own inferences, rightly or wrongly. I really think the biggest flaw of the book is the lack of an overarching tactical focus/framework that helps integrate the battle descriptions and links the evolution of armored warfare. Also, although the book includes some maps, there aren't enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I read a Clash of Chariots thinking I would get some understanding of the evolution in tank warfare from its inception until the 1991 Gulf War. The authors mention that they will cover this at both the tactical and operational levels.Instead, I found the book to be a boring blow-by-blow description of each battle with hardly any thought given to integrating the battle descriptions into a coherent discussion of tank tactics or operations. The battle descriptions are impossible to follow. The maps used in the book are of little use in helping to understand the battle narratives.In short, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this his heart?","review":"STOP!

It'll make you crave every supervisor/manager you've ever had take at least ONE formal management course.I got A's across the board in this class (took the class online at a local college).With all that, YOU will quickly get a formal foundation for being a better manager than your worst one and for being as good as, or better than, your best ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.","review":"This is NOT the full text, but a study-guide for retards who can't read thirty-pages.

Regrettably, it only serves to degrade, diminish, and ultimately destroys the value and joy in reading this book. In retrospect, it's better to take a pass and go to another book.The author's political and social views that are so arrogant, corrosive, and over-bearing that they all but wash out the other values of this book, which come from his observations of people and places while sailing around the British Isles. The former are unfortunately painted in primary colors, while the latter are done in pastels.The balance in this book between the interesting, nuanced observations and the ham-handed political critiques is so skewed as to make this work not worth the effort to sort through.

So, after a week of taking it, I am done.

Consider Getting Hooked. Usefully divided into genre and decade, the book shows fascinating changes over time. For example, length. In the 50s, most romance openings ran three full lines, with some running to four. By the 90s, most were less than a single line, at the most just beginning a third line. You can also sense a difference of tone. The openings of the 50s seem confessional, those from the 60s seem at the extremes of being either lighthearted or filled with angst, the 70s ushered in dark and brooding gothic openings, the openings of the 80s are filled with references to Palm Beach, Bel Air, and Manhattan, and the openings of the 90s have nailed the concept of a \\"hook\\" to a tee.

But the story of two women who built rival business empires and lived their quirky lives just a few blocks from each other (without ever meeting face to face) was irresistable. We all need to know more about women who have \\"made it\\" in a man's world. And this video was so masterfully done that by the end I felt I actually knew Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden. I loved the transitional visual, showing a gorgeous face as a blank canvas that changed over the decades as makeup styles changed. The occasional animated sequences were witty and amusing - like little \\"Betty Boop\\" interludes. And I learned a lot - a whole lot - about makeup and the whole mystique surrounding it.

Not only do they tell a complex story about the birth of an industry and the driven divas who were its midwives, but they do so through clever animation, passionate witnesses, and well-chosen clips, stills, and music that provide subtlety as well as narrative.

There is some ambiguity, but certainly the obvious meaning is as rendered in this book: the vision the panther sees enters his heart and there ceases to be (not the vision stopping in his heart and there continuing to be or exist). Otherwise the line should have a comma (\\"...und hoert im Herzen auf, zu sein\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rilke","review":"This is a good compelation of his works.

I purchased several bottles from the front desk to carry home with us, but worried where I would find replacements when they were empty.

For someone who has never played the original Marvel Superheroes RPG, this game may seem adequate, but its greatest strength which is its tremendous detail, is also its greatest weakness. The card based system is a joke and characters tend to die way to easy. I am happy to see that marvel took a lesson from the old Mayfair DC system and allowed a way for even weaker characters to stand a chance, but they over did it and anyone can kill anyone else if they want to bad enough without any thought to the plausibilty of the confrontation what so ever. EX: In the first game we ran, just to bug out the system, a player playing Electra beat the Juggernaut. I have talked with several others who have purchased this game and they had similar ideas.

Like the rest of the lobotomized Generation X, I saw this film over its 1997 Memorial Day weekend debut with naive high-hopes. In hindsight, all I can say is that I'm thankful that my folks coughed-up for the tickets and not my hard-earned money! \\"Lost World\\" ranks as low as \\"1941\\" and \\"Twilight Zone: The Movie\\" as among Spielberg's few forgettable worst. With the international success that the original film found in 1993, I'm reminded of the popular adage \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" when it comes down to \\"Lost World\\". You definitely aren't missing much (unless you are teenage girl who lusts for Vince Vaughn) and probably won't when \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" comes out if you are one of the fortunate few who hasn't seen this avaricious Spielberg sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest movie out there, but should be on DVD already.","review":"Greatest movie out there, but should be on DVD already"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious, Contemptible, Contemptuous","review":"The most pathetic waste of film ever to come out of Hollywood. Spielberg owes me my $8 for this load of junk. No script, no characters, just a lot of running and yelling and computer generated special effects, and a surreal message that dinosaurs are better parents than humans. And to think that Spielberg actually released this, thinking that it was fit for audience consumption! This shows the absolute contempt Spielberg has for the movie-going public. Boycott it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Letdown!","review":"I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ THE BOOK!!!","review":"I remember how disappointed I was when I first saw the movie (in the theaters). I recently read the book (I've been on a Michael Crichton kick). Anyway...the book gets a 4 or 4.5 star rating!I can't believe Michael Crichton actually allowed this farce to have the name \\"The Lost World\\" when they are nothing alike. There are over 30 people in the movie, only 3 of which are in the book. From this, you should easily guess that the plots are totally different. I won't tell you more, because I want you all to read the book!Three cheers to Crichton -- a Bronx cheer to Spielberg.BTW -- I did the book on tape while in the car.

They seem to be all that matters in films today. To heck with originality, character development, constructive plotting and innovation. Just give 'em lots of dinosaurs running around.Actually the first twenty minutes or so of this are okay and you think you're going to see a decent film. But then the dinosaurs take over and all you're left with are special effects, chase scenes, more special effects, more chase scenes, more special effects, and then a few more special effects thrown into the bargain.Oh yes, and there's quite possibly one of the tamest, most predictable rampaging-through-city sequences since time began.Maybe it's just as well dinosaurs have died out.

Boring characters and a decidedly unoriginal plot, which includes the King Kong rip-off sequence in which a T-Rex is running amock through the city, makes this one of Spielberg's worst films.

The film is about a league of scientists that are sent on another expedition through Jurrasic Park to only confront more dangerous dinosaurs and poachers hunting the prehistoric reptiles. This film is just drenched in cliches and bad character development. However, the film does cover another aspect that wasn't covered that well in the last film. It covers the possibility of how mankind's greed, over the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, can ultimately lead to doom and death for the human race."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of film.","review":"Someone should take the writers of this movie and feed them to a T-Rex. This movie ranks as one of the worst movies I can remember. There are so many things wrong with it I don't know where to start. I suppose the most annoying thing about it is the way the characters in the movie practically throw themselves into the jaws of the dinosaurs. You have all these mercenaries loaded with weapons and not one of them can even hit one dinosaur. They all flee in panic every time one shows up. Gee whiz, didn't they think they were going to see any dinosaurs on Jurassic Park??? These people rarely act like someone who is on an island filled with man eating creaturs.

However, to this reader, it is blatently obvious that Michael Crichton's novel, The Lost World, lays ground work for Spielberg's version of Jurassic Park. The contrived novel attempts to repair Spielberg's mistelling of the original novel with a few threads relating to the real terror in the original novel: human greed -- there is a humorous demise in store for the mastermind of the original story's industrial epionage.

I did not want to buy it but it wasn't available at the local movie rental store either.It was double discouraging when I went to connect the ipad to the tv and learned that Amazon Instant Video doesn't support this function.

Not real happy about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Stephen Speilburg film that I have seen","review":"This is by far the worst adaption and I don't even think that you could even call it an adaption of a Michael Critchon novel. The only thing in the movie that comes close to resembling a scene from the book lasts two seconds and even that isn't close to the book. But the thing that annoys me most about this movie is if the only dinosaur on an oil tanker is a T-rex and it's locked away in the tank compartment, is how did the crew get eaten in spaces on the ship where the dino couldn't fit into. Even worse the city scenes where a rip off of another bad movie, Carnosaur."},{"rating":"2","title":"What?!","review":"For those people out there; THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. The original didn't have anything much to it except for the fact that they had 30 minutes of the T-rex pen attack.

And at least this movie has an ending to it, not just flying off in a helicopter and leaves you to wonder what happens next. This is one of the best sequels I've seen.--P.S.: I've read the book and I agree the movie is not even close to the book. But does it matter?

Having watched the movie 3 times I quickly fell in love with the book. The movie I cannot rate that well because it is nothing like the book. The characters are different, the animals are different, and they even added a part which wasn't in the book. Yes, that is why the ending is so horrible, it was never in the book. No dinasours go to the main islands, and even if they did, why was it that the main island was some major city like LA or San Fransisco, I thought they were in Porta Rico? Watch the movie, enjoy it if you want. But you won't get the full thrill, excitement, adventure, and emotions as the book will. In Jurassic Park John Hammond and Ian Malcolm die. What are they doing alive again. John Hammond is also a mean old man who swears a lot. Why isn't he like that in the movie? To make it a kids movie. Even the way it is it still doesn't classify as a kids movie.

I stood up and pumped my fist in the theatre when the T-Rex first appeared on the outskirts of the big city and let out a deafening roar -- serving notice to the populace that total mayhem was about to ensue. Spielberg takes us on a fun-loving, even nostalgic trip back through the Monster/Sci-Fi films of the '50s and '60s by \\"freshening up\\" the whole genre.

Unfortunately, in an apparent effort to target a teenage audience, the movie's creators have made a film with an absurd plot line and adult characters who act and speak like children. Consider, as just one example, the scene where the main group decides to bed down for the night in the jungle right after having been pursued by a hungry T-Rex; needless to say, they do not post a guard and the T-Rex \\"surprises\\" them while they are asleep.

Can we at least get one new idea? This was one of the worst movies I ever bothered to see, and based on one of the worst books I ever bothered to read, so why did I? Because the first book and movie were good. (The original movie pales next to the book, but don't they all?)The acting is second-rate at its best, and the young girl was terrible. The special effects have all been done before, and the Godzilla run through San Diego was at least funny when you could laugh at the rubber monster rather than trying to believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Seems To Good To Be True...","review":"The Lost World: Jurassic Park is by far the worst movie I have every had the discomfort of watching. As mentioned by Leonard Maltin, the plot was contrived, the action dirivitive, and the only redeeming qualities were Goldblums acting and the incredible special effects. This movie in no way compares to Jurassic Park and is what I affectionetly call a sequel of convenience. It was very convenient for Universal Studios to lay down money for this... because they knew even though the movie stunk, audiances of mindless drones would still flock to see it. Stick to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"JURASSIC BOMB: THE LOST MOVIE","review":"Unbeliavable someone can give this pile of garbage a five-star rating! To show my point of view, I suggest something to you all: why don't you have a private and informal talk with Spielberg himself and ask his real opinion about this motion picture...? YOu'll probably hear him say that this is one of the worst he has ever done, that he did it only because of the money (the studio pressure was too much) and that he never watched the movie once after he finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true sequel to Jurassic Park","review":"Does this movie have flaws? Yes, But at least it's a respectful sequel to the original. Jeff Goldblum is in fine form as the lead, and Pete Postlewaite is great as the big game hunter out for the ultimate game. The film is not as good as the first but it&#65533;s much, much better than Jurassic Park 3. This film deserves your attention, and it really does deliver on its thrills.If you want to watch a real sequel to Jurassic Park that really delivers on what it promises, then The Lost World Is your Film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jurassic Plot","review":"I hate to say this, but the sequel to one of the best films I've ever seen is nothing more than a bland cash-in. There are great special effects and some good characters (the send-up of paleontologist Robert Bakker was amusing) but they don't stop this being nothing more than entertainment. As an evening's viewing it's good, but watch it again and you'll probably be bored senseless. And why are there so few new kinds of dinosaurs? Ray Harryhausen et al never resorted to showing the same things over and over. The only realy good thing I can say about this film is that its made to look the height of sophistication by that execremental Godzilla film."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING EFFECTS ARE NOT EVERYTHING!!!","review":"What about acting? This joke of a movie has only one thing going for it and that's the spectacular computer effects. If you have an IQ of more than one digit then you'd better avoid this one at all cost and just watch the first JURASIC PARK.

If I could give it a turkey I surely would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a monster movie","review":"I'll agree that this movie has plenty of typical thriller fare which can entertain, and seeing the dinosaurs is still interesting (though nothing like the first time). But when I saw the Raptors streaking through the field, closing in on a party of unsuspecting humans, I said, \\"This is just a monster movie. Nothing more.\\"I bother to write a review, however, because I'm still irritated at this story's philosophy judgement. The good guys are horrified at the team of \\"capitalists\\" who want to put the animals in a zoo. How could they be so cruel?! So an Earth First activist works with the lead female character to set them free and rescue a baby T-Rex. That single act causes almost all the deaths in the movie (including the activist's partner), but the story gives the activist a pass. The capitalists are the bad guys in this picture, least the viewer be confused, and most of them get eaten as they deserve. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimaginative effort","review":"This plotless sequel is a disappointing let-down from the well-constructed and believable JURASSIC PARK.

Lovelace was far too villainous (every villain needs a redeeming quality). And the presentation of the \\"fake fire\\" followed by his complete recklessness seemed straight off the set of a high-school play.I regret being this harsh, as I'm always rooting these programs to be first rate. But the performance turned up no redeeming characters for me -- save for Hermione Norris (whom I have worshipped ever since seeing Berkeley Square). Saskia Wickham's performance as Clarissa is without nuance, never truly tempted and predictably snappish throughout.I walked away from the screen wishing Andrew Davies had writ the script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dark","review":"If you like Pride & Prejudice, you won't like this film.This movie is too dark and foreboding for my taste. Yes, the actors play their parts well, yes the costumes are terrific, but the script leaves you feeling depressed and yelling at the tv, \\"Enough is enough!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking and depressing","review":"WARNING, SPOILER: Clarissa is hounded by an evil young man whos see her, at first, as nothing more than a challenge. then he is obsessed in possessing her even if it means sullying her honor and breaking her spirit. Toward the end of the movie, after many twists and turns, when it is clear that she wants nothing to do with him, and rapes her while others hold her down, something I didn't expect at all. She feels so violated, that she wills herself to die. I hated the story so much that I regret viewing it. Had I known about the rape scene I would not have wasted my time watching this. Silly me in believing that virture will always triumph--certainly not in this story. If you love Jane Austen and all that her heroines stand for, then don't waste your time on this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow-moving story","review":"CLARISSA may be one of the slowest-moving teleplays I've ever seen. This despite some top-notch performances (especially Sean Bean as Lovelace); the exquisite costumes, the settings. The actress playing Clarissa, unfortunately, came off as a self-rightous little prig. You're not supposed to feel relief when she dies, but I sure did. She's not very pretty either, so the attraction or lust that Lovelace felt was inexplicable -- I guess corrupting her absolute innocence and strong morals were the real attraction, and yet, despite his dastardly deeds, I felt more pity for Lovelace. The story does drag a bit; don't let the rave reviews fool you. It's worth seeing for Sean Bean's performance and several of the supporting ones but the story moves too slowly and is on the whole a very depressing one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD, DISAPOINTED","review":"this movie is the most disapointed i've never been with a movie i've picked for my wife and i to watch, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful story","review":"No matter how \\"well done\\" this movie is, it is an awful story, including a graphic rape scene.

For my taste though, the characters are a little flat and too one dimensional. I could not get through this bland piece of soft-boiled prose and had to put it down unfinished. I found Banks and his companions very wooden and not believable. Excluding the victim, there was not enough to go on to feel any true sympathy for the other characters. The plot line IS interesting but gets to a point of being turgid. Perhaps I'll give it another try someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent police procedural","review":"I am becoming a big fan of Inspector Banks mysteries. He is such an ordinary \\"copper\\", and I love watching his thought processes as he tries to solve a case. In this case, a seven year old girl goes missing. All the stops are pulled out to try to find her, but before they can they find a murdered man in an abandoned quarry? It doesn't look like the two cases are related but as Banks investigates he finds out all kinds of things, and he finds a link between the two cases.

The figuration in Bamboula is way too stretched out, and Souvenir de Porto Rico, which is a march, she plays lyrically with a lot of rubato. I have no doubt she could do a fine job with other Romantic composers, but here she misses the dancelike character and the spirit of Gottschalk's Creole heritage.

His playing is just as powerful, and he doesn't interrupt dance rhythms with inappropriate Chopin-esque rubato."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite make it","review":"Cecile Licad is a fine pianist, but she's not right for this.

Andy is delicously dim, and what a nice curve the new guys in the office seem to be. I really look forward to the rest of the season!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Office - Season 9","review":"I have always been a loyal viewer, but I have to admit that the show has died some over the past few years. This season, however, feels like some of the originals. I can honestly say that I have cracked up during every episode, and I am so happy that it will be finishing on such a good note! I thought the show would crumble without Michael Scott, and while it was definitely a blow, The Office survived. Pam and Jim's relationship/marriage, which was such a focus and high point for the first half of the series seemed to lose its flair later on - particularly when Jim was made manager and had to take on a serious role in the company. Lately, though, the camaraderie within the whole team has been revived, and the show is just FUN.The joint radio show prank on Dwight had me in tears, and it's been a while since The Office made me laugh quite that hard.Well done, team! It's certainly sad to note who has left the show, but I'm glad to see it rebound so nicely :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please have mercy and kill this show.","review":"Every episode not only manages to disgrace this brand name but actually make seasons 1 through 5 worse, somehow. After seeing this season, I want to forget about the entire series and that's a shame, I recall truly enjoying the awkward Michael seasons. As for the actor who plays Andy, his absence at least made the show tolerable. Upon his return in this episode thoughts of blinding myself and bursting my eardrums became preferable to finishing the episode with his talentless non-portrayal of a character that has no aspirations beyond being overlooked, unfortunately thanks to the horrific brand of \\"look-at-me-I-didn't-get-enough-love-from-mommy-as-a-child\\" acting, we can not simply ignore Andy. Never underestimate the ambitions of individuals for attention and money to ruin art. Please cancel it now, we don't need an ending or series finale to this any more than we need a resolution to any rotting roadkill corpse in the middle of the interstate."},{"rating":"1","title":"The many faces of Jim..

For example, most of us would agree that body language, and in particular, facial expression, is a powerful means of communication. But Mr Priolo can't accept this unless he can find a Biblical example. Happily, he does so in Cain's response in Gen 4:5.Now take that poverty-stricken kind of exegesis, and apply it to the relationship between husbands and wives, and you have the basis for Mr Priolo's book. Those reviewers who characterize his view of women as patronizing are correct.There were a few ideas that I found interesting. His chapter on sex (excuse me, \\"sexual relations\\"!) was perhaps the best. However, the \\"bones\\" to be discarded far outweigh the \\"meat\\" to be enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this for my husband because of the blurb on the cover saying it would be \\"a favorite gift to husbands from their wives.\\" If she wants her husband to believe she needs to \\"repent\\" if she is not always as eager for sex as he is (so that he can then graciously forgive her), she should buy him this book. Or if she wants to be viewed as \\"weak\\" and \\"easily deceived\\" and treated in a condescending and controlling way she might want to give this to her husband. Priolo's interpretation and application of Scripture (often out of context) is highly questionable in many instances and directly leads to these extreme views.Also, the publisher did a very poor job with glaring typo's and difficult-to-read, extremely small type. Cheap looking and not the thing I want to give anyone as a gift. I threw it in the garbage. Best place for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Husband MUST have!","review":"\\"I think that this is the most awesome book for men on how God requires you to be a husband!

And say that he is the Lord of your life! There ARE SO MANY men out there that say that he is yet fail to let him LEAD them!!

Must Read.","review":"Mr. Priolo has done it again! This is a must read for all current and future husbands. The book is filled with insights and instructions on the roles and responsibilities of the husband. The author compellingly exhorts the husbands from the Bible on how to love, serve and lead one's wife. The appendix section with questions and practical suggestions alone is worth the price of the book. Again a must read for all husbands seeking to grow as servant/spiritual leaders at home.

All too often this subject is presented by specialists for others with biological training, but this book is written well-enough for the general reader. She provides examples of the hard work to remedy the problems associated with invasive species, as well as potential solutions for the future, giving us hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel, if we make the effort and dedicate appropriate resources. If I had to find faults with the book, I would say that she focuses too intensely on just a few regions (albeit important ones): Montana, Hawaii, Galapagos Islands, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa (a little about Florida). Problems in other regions receive little or no attention. But the book is still a great one for this very neglected yet extremely important subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful story--such realism","review":"Cardinale weaves such realism into the many delightful plot twists.

I should know because I went looking for a bargain on Ebay, and while I got an ok price, I failed to realize Ebay sellers are not authorized Apple resellers. Buying from an authorized reseller means that you can get the Leopard OS X upgrade for a minimal fee. And Amazon is an authorized Apple reseller. I'm stuck spending the full amount to get Leopard.To add further regret to my decision, the Ebay seller is taking a month to send it.

I also upgraded to \\"Snow Leopard,\\" mine came with the \\"Tiger\\" version of Mac OS X. The upgrade is only $29 from Apple, unlike the prices you'll pay to upgrade your Windows OS. I like the fact that this previous model of the Mac Mini has the CD/DVD drive built into the unit. I am not as fond of the newer design that requires an external optical drive for CD/DVD media.

Apple still refuses to take responsibility. Avoid Apple products unless you don't plan to upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mac Mini - Good Buy","review":"Excellent product. Replaces an older version of the Mac Mini. This one is much faster and was purchased as a replacement for the older version mainly because of the newer operating system. Got $250 for the old unit.

Way better than my custom-built Vista Ultimate computer! Though I have found glitches in Mac OSX, the glitches are far more minor than those found in Vista. If it weren't for the ease of use and the tiny design, I would have given this computer a four star rating because it is overpriced for what you get. Not a gaming machine, but certainly a reliable computer for all sorts of activities that have minimal hardware requirements. (Such as web browsing, basic photo editing and music production, word processing, and so on and so on.) I am very pleased with this computer. I am now a Mac convert."},{"rating":"2","title":"great machine but hard to upgrade","review":"I purchased this machine a few days ago. It works very well but Apple makes it really difficult to upgrade the ram in this machine. You have to use a putty knife to open up the bottom of the case; because Apple has never heard of using screws. Other than it taking 20 minutes to open up the case the memory upgrading process wasn't too bad after unscrewing the optical drive.Otherwise this machine runs pretty well, you definately do need to upgrade the memory on this machine because 1gb simply is not enough for OSX to run properly; it seems Apple based OSX on Vista and decided that you need atleast 2gb of ram for the machine to function properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dealing with Apple","review":"The Mac Mini is a great product when it works. Dealing with Apple is NOT fun. Hours to get them on the phone to see about the disk drive which did not work at all even after a half hour with a techy. He was helpful but could not fix the problem. They would not replace the computer even though it was just out of the box since I had not bought it through their store. There answer was to send it to be repaired NO concern for an unhappy customer. Fortunately Amazon did care and sent out a new one right away. What a difference in attitude. Also I had to purchase a $100 adaptor from Apple to hook up the DVI connector from my flat screen monitor as this was not supplied with the computer. It is a large adaptor about 5x5 ins but is supposed to improve the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Display options limited","review":"Overpriced considering the cheap/missing components. PC laptops have more features and include a keyboard and LCD display for less money.No support for HDMI so forget about using this with your huge flat panel TV's digital inputs. You'll be fighting over scan unless your TV happens to have DVI in addition to HDMI. Sure you can fall back to fuzzy analog if your TV happens to have a VGA input. And no, that $20 DVI > HDMI cable won't make it work.Only supports SINGLE link DVI. This limits monitor size to 1920x1200. DUAL link is the current standard, it enables additional pairs of wires within the same connector for use with the largest monitors.As of 12/2007 I wouldn't buy this as it will shortly either be discontinued or upgraded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine little machine","review":"I'm very happy with this little Mac. It replaced an old 1.6-GHz P4 machine that has served my wife and kids for at least 4 years. We were all so tired of the various Wintel hassles that this was a long overdue step. However, for the few things that only run on Windoze, this machine runs VMware Fusion well, alongside any number of concurrent OS X apps.Other than the fact that this machine required the most painful memory upgrade I've ever done, I am completely delighted with it. Runs great, easy to use, just works. On the physical design side, I'd prefer to have the DVD slot on one of the adjacent sides to all of the connectors, as opposed to the opposite side, because it's awkward to access the slot where our machine sits.

Sandy Weil has been on the front lines of American business movers and shakers for four decades, yet most people know little about him. The authors do a great job of outlining his ups and downs, all the while treating Weil with respect and even affection, while not treating him with kid gloves. Weil appears in all his complexity, warts and all, in the context of his business and personal relationships. The authors understand that Weil's accomplishments can be understood only in the context of his ability to build and maintain last relationships. The book is a critical contribution to the literature of American business history of the last 40 years.

The first message from an alien life form has been received, and Simeon Krug is obsessed with his self-imposed role as the man who will respond to that message. Wealthy, powerful, and brilliantly inventive, Krug has made his fortune in many ways but primarily by developing the first artificial people, the androids, to serve as slaves to their human owners. \\"Tower of Glass\\" has some of Silverberg's best writing, and the character development is powerful and believable.

Thus we learn that although Jane Appleton Piercelost her 13-year-son in a railroad accident that greatlydepressed her (seems reasonable enough), she was, according toFarquhar, a \\"real loony\\" because she was depressed.Similarly he jumps into homophobia by suggesting that JamesBuchanan was gay; and then winks and nods by telling us aboutthe long-time male companion he lived with and how sadhe was when he left.THIS is a scandal??As I breezed through more of the same kind of nonsense, Irealized that Mr. Farquhar's research is astoundingly limited,and in some cases, non-existent. His facts in many places areincorrect, and his desire to make fun of every public leaderwho may have had even the smallest human failing is ultimatelyjust tiring.Truly, one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Scandals ?","review":"If you are really looking for salacious scandals this book is not it.

And indeed, some stories we already knew.But the lay out of the book is in such a way that it provides an ease with reading. A book with short stories on scandals is always a fun read. I'm often traveling on public transportation and find that it's nice to read when I have the chance, but find it frustrating to leave a good story in the middle of the tale because I've arrived at my destination or the break isn't long enough to finish the chapter. But this book, and the others this author has written, is set up so that leaving in the middle of a chapter doesn't happen that often. Plus, you can flip through and pick a topic at will.I really enjoyed this book, and have read his other two books and ejoyed them as well.

I asked the guy why he was being so rude and his reply was something like, he didn't have time to answer any questions.

I cannot believe Alexander Rahbari was a student of Herbert Von Karajan and it was his and Alexander Rahbari's fault that their Turandot recordings sounded so weak and omitted every rhythmic texture that should be in there. Gunter Neuhold should've conducted this Naxos recording instead. To compare Gunter Neuhold's and Alexander Rahbari's Madame Butterfly recordings, Gunter Neuhold's orchestra is much larger than Alexander Rahbari's and gives Puccini the ultimacy of his 1904 version of Madame Butterfly. I could tell that Gunter Neuhold is a much more capable Puccini conductor than Alexander Rahbari."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but ...","review":"I used this product for several years.

Shannon is such a raunchy character I couldn't help but crack up, she has one high libido...but don't we all. ClanFinatan is the centaur, and one of the yummiest hero's I've read in a while. Their romance was superb...the only thing I wish is that Cast would have shown more of his own thoughts, which is why I'm not a big fan of 1st pov...but anyhow...the drama moved along nicely.

Pretty much the only way to align items is to zoom in as much as you can, Even then it is almost impossible.

Is this a perpetuation of the stereotype that all Chinese women want a White man? This is analogous to portraying the Virgin Mary as a prostitute.

Stranger in This Place will do it. A funky mixture of traditional bluegrass, country, folk, and tongue-in-cheek social commentary, this CD is a joy to listen to. My favorite cut \\"Wake Up and Smell the Coffee\\" is, perhaps, not the foremost musically speaking, but any baby boomer that grew up with the Maxwell House Coffee commercials will find it enjoyable. All-in-all, this CD made me smile.

I definetely recommend this movie ot anyone looking for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Disappointing","review":"The acting is truly horrible. The special effects are sadly dated. The plot is okay (for a Japanese remake of a Korean movie). Miike is always an aquired taste, but this is definitely not one of his best attempts.

You probably will never watch it a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad pictures and impossible to follow even for adults","review":"My 10 year old got this for Christmas and we are returning it.

It took me a little elbow grease to get it on my 14X54 ironing board but once it was on it fit perfectly. Another nice thing is that the pad is attached to the cover which also makes it easier to put it on the board. However, the reason I gave this product a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because the velcro fastening straps, which was a selling point for me, are entirely too short. When I reached under the board to put them together to hold the cover in place, they wouldn't even meet. I will now have to buy some additional velcro to extend the straps so that they will serve the purpose that they were designed for. Otherwise, I am happy with this product and I will keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"Ordered as a replacement to existing Plantronics and the sound quality is great!

I bought Plantronics 43038-01 (Quick Disconnect to 2.5 mm plug) to use with my home wireless handset (AT&T TL88102 DECT 6.0 Landline Telephone). It's light and comfortable to wear for extended times, and the cord combo is long enough to give you range of motion when the phone is stationary. As other have said, the sound is very clear. My husband has difficulty hearing and he loves this combo.

The microphone part is very bendy, so if the caller is in a noisy atmosphere I can bend it closer to my mouth.

I should have replaced the padding ages ago, it's way more comfy on my head now."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is exactly what I expected.","review":"I bought this headset because I am in sales and do a lot of cold calling that requires note taking. I can type about 20 times faster than I can write, so I needed my hands free and was tired of having a stiff neck from pinching the handset between my shoulder and ear. I went with the binaural set because it was only $3-5 more and with a $65 headset, that's not that big of a difference. Having the caller come through both ears is great in my noisy office setting, and the people on the other end say I come through loud and clear, and they only hear me, not my co-workers (which is a good thing). NOTE: This may be obvious to some, but be aware that the \\"noise cancelling\\" refers only to the microphone, not the ear pieces. The set is lightweight, fits comfortably, and has worked well for me so far. (I have had it for only 2 weeks now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"Great book. great writing.

The government keeps an inventory and a database. In real life, they would have flipped the badge over, read the serial number and input it into the database. They would have had a name in about 10 minutes...without even having McGee or Abby hack into anything.

This is an excellent frozen drink maker for use during the hot summer months. It's pretty much idiot proof. You follow the instructions and it makes great drinks. The only downside is that all drinks must conform to the standard proportion recipe. Stray from it, like my wife did once, and it makes lousy drinks.

However, the quality of the item justifies the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"way overpriced, and poorly designed","review":"I bought this product brand-new and used it less than a dozen times. In less than a dozen times, I had to replace the blending blade FOUR times because the the base of the blending blade that catches with the motor base is made out of HARD RUBBER. This hard rubber would strip anytime I put anything in the blender that any ordinary (and cheaper) blender could handle with no problem (e.g., soft frozen yogurt, banana pieces). Soon the blending blade base would strip even with the shaved ice in the blender, and the motor base wore down because of this.Do yourselves a favor and ignore the fancy Margaritaville marketing and get yourselves a real, durable blender for a lot less money.

Just add liquor and flavoring, push the start switch and there you are.Two drawbacks: Must remove lid to pour and I wish the shave and blend times could be custom tweaked in automatic mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just love it","review":"Was hesitant to purchase because of price, but find the product makes exceptional drinks! Very pleased. Looking forward to using more this summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Works great! Shaves ice then blends the way it should be done!","review":"This is a sweet blender for frozen drinks! It shaves the ice BEFORE it blends just like the pro units like island oasis machines do. Its like a baby oasis machine... load the ice on top put your booze and mizer in the glass blender hit the switch... your ice starts to spin and then is shaved and dropped into the blender then its blended... you can add more shaved ice or blend extra with the manual switch to the right.The price may at first seem like a lot but when you look at what it does and what a pro unit costs (2k) it really is a fair price... its a solid machine built by Sunbeam.The last thing: its FUN to use !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Margaritaville DM1000 - Good addition to Bar","review":"I purchased the Frozen Concoction Maker for my wife. It is tall and will not fit in a kitchen cabinet but would be fine in the bar area. The unit itself is easy to use and relatively easy to clean. I would suggest using a differenct margarita recipe than what is in the book. Just a matter of taste. I believe the best feature is the shaved ice. Good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite","review":"I was determined to finish this book just to count the number of times Georgia Durante mentioned how beautiful she was. It was a million plus. You get the drift. This little lady couldn't get over herself. Her poor daughter Toni took the brunt of her mother's bad, bad choices and paid the price. There was claptrap galore, from her inane, juvenile musings to the stupefying way she portrayed herself as a hapless victim. And the verbatim dialog? How could anyone possibly remember exact conversations from three decades ago? Come on!!Georgia Durante should just have named her book, \\"All About Me\\". At least it would have been an honest if not vacuous biography by just another celebretard who managed to sleep her way to the top of the heap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about over rated!","review":"This book is highy over rated. I bought this book after seeing all the high reviews, and I was sadly disappointed. I had to force myself to finish this book simply to see if it would get better. It didn't.Georgia is so wrapped up in herself she claims to be unaware her daughter was being sexually molested by Georgia's ex-huband. What mother doesn't really know when something is wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Company She Keeps","review":"This book is as far from your typical non-fiction \\"2 chapters with milk & cookies before bedtime\\" reading as it gets. \\"The Company She Keeps\\" is phenomenal reading and you won't put it down! This book kept me grabbing for the next page and my mind spinning many questions, which the author thankfully answered. The depth of Ms Durante's style in describing her thoughts and life experiences often left me awed, outraged, and at times numb. What a journey! Don't bother waiting or holding out for the paperback version - this book is an absolute keeper that you won't be loaning to your friends. If \\"The Company She Keeps\\" ever hits the big screen, be prepared for some VERY long lines at the box office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of celebrity","review":"I don't particularly care about celebrities, and it is very interesting to read a realistic view of that world. I expected a little more mob stuff from the book jacket. I think Ms Durante has a lot to offer the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read this year!","review":"It's time for frantic Christmas shopping. I try to buy only items of meaning for my friends and family. I was thinking this weekend, what book meant the most to me this year? I read a lot and \\"The Company She Keeps\\" lept to my mind as the book I wanted to share the most. I read a borrowed copy, and totally fell. If I'm not mistaken, it got me through a cross country flight, and I skipped a business dinner to read it during that time. (I won't tell If you won't) I just couldn't put this book down! I can't add much to all the 5-star reviews other than they are dead-on accurate. The author has a special way of telling her story and making the reader truly understand and care. To live such a life full of highs and lows and come out such a winner!WHEW!!This is a great book that I recommend to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whow! I couldn't put it down! A fellow Stunt Coordinator","review":"I hate to read.....Most of my time is spent planning action sequences, working out. or reading scripts. When Georgia asked me to read her book I was shocked:First as her past was revealed:Second: I hire stunt players for their talent, their professionalism and their character. Georgia is all that! Understanding how she got there..... Made the book all the more fun.For me to say the book did this or that would be a waist of time. I am the company she keeps now and I'm proud of it. I enjoyed the read because it's written with PASSION and I believe that anything Worth doing is Worth doing with PASSION.\\"Company radiates Passion. Read IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Women take notice!","review":"This book could be an autobiography for so many women. I, for one, felt like Georgia Durante was hiding out in my closet. Georgia was raped at seventeen and suffers the after effects of the assault throughout the rest of her life. This book goes into her mind and shows us that even when the world deals us the most cruel hand we can survive. Take a bow, Ms. Durante--and keep writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I found it to be a very delightful book to read. This book is a biography but it reads like a great fiction novel. The life story of the author is an amazing story. I wish more books were as interesting and well written as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever.","review":"This is literally the worst book I have ever read. I have no idea how anyone found it enjoyable. The author was narcissistic, shallow, and played the victim role entirely too much. It is so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A psychiatrist's dream patient","review":"This woman could stay in therapy long enough to send a psychiatrist's kid through Harvard ! This poorly written book tells the story of a personality disordered woman who not only destroyed her life by living on the edge but those of her children. Domestic violence,abuse,life long friends who were sociopaths and she jumped from one \\"wise guy\\" to another in an effort for someone to take care of her!She would have been better off learning how to stand on her own 2 feet instead of some man taking care of her.Do not waste your time in buying this book,its a waste"},{"rating":"2","title":"I truly enjoyed and recommend this book it's the real deal!!","review":"This book was sent to me in Sicily as a gift by a family member. I thought the book was a great read, put together in a nice easy to keep up with manner. If you want to know the real deal into crime and it's effetcs on people who truly been there this is the one. I highly recommend Georgia Durante book \\"The Company She Keeps\\". Written by a woman with great strength, wisdom, and common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave Up","review":"Read 63 pages and gave up. So many books, so little time. Not bothering with any more of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I will give her this, her life is interesting but only because she kept making such stupid decisions. I was appalled to read how she uprooted her child as she went from man to man to man thinking each one would be better for her. Even more appalling was her admitting she used alcohol while she was pregnant. Hardly mother of the year material.Georgia, the author and subject of the book also seems to have a high opinion of her appearance as noted by the multiple references to her figure and 'beauty.' It wore thin.The writing was poor and the conversations quoted seemed way too cheesy to be real.The more I read the less I liked her and the more I realized that she was just as much of a sociopath as the men she slept with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I would NOT recommend this book to my friends. Unless you like to hear one state over and over and over again just how beautiful she is and then read how she would let nothing, including her children, get in her way to fame and fortune, don't waste your time reading this. If you want to blame her problems on the company she keeps, then maybe one should ask why she never learned from her mistakes, but kept going from one dangerous relationship quickly into another. The book also seems to be poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Company She Keeps by Georgia Durante","review":"What a great read. Having lived in the area where Georgia began her life and knowing some of the same people, I first set out to see if I agreed with what she had to say. I soon forgot my own opinions about the mob, and became fascinated with her unfolding and ever changing life.Georgia manages to give hope and courage to people who have gotten off on the wrong track in life and found it very difficult to re-position themselves. Her writing is descriptive, insightful and exciting. It is a great read for men, women and especially teen aged girls who will find it easy to identify with the young Georgia.Starting off as a Kodak cover girl, then becoming a mob wife and finally escaping that life to become her own woman, Georgia seems to have turned her life around.Too bad the executives at Kodak couldn't have used her as a role model for rising from the ashes.Five Stars.Dorie Patanella"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Book - You Can't Put It Down!","review":"The Company She Keeps is the compelling story describing Georgia Durante's life from her teenage days as a model in Rochester, New York to her current position as the owner of the Performance Two Driving Team. The book describes her tumultuous life as she suffers through one abusive relationship after another. Not only is she physically and emotionally abused during these relationships, her children are forced to suffer also. She is financially ruined, yet she survives. Her connection to the Mob only heightens the drama in the book. Georgia becomes a survivor, as she overcomes the hardships dealt to her and her family. An exciting and revealing book that is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This book sucked me in from the very beginning. The obstacles faced by this woman were constant; every time it seemed that she finally found some peace in her life a new problem arose and I could not stop until I knew the outcome.Although the actual mafia involvement that Georgia had was minimal, aside from her romantic involvement with some of the lesser guys, I would have found this book even more interesting if it had been easier to keep up with \\"who's who\\" as far as the mafia characters were concerned. There were too many Josephs, Joeys, and Salvatores to keep straight.All in all this was a great read and had a satisfying ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary story from a very impressive woman.","review":"I knew about this book before I read it, since my mother was a friend of Georgia's who thought very highly of her. I knew some parts of Georgia's story, but I wasn't prepared for what I read! Georgia is to be congratulated for having taken the extraordinary difficulties of her life and translating them into a book that has the power to inspire others to transform their own lives as she has done hers. I'm glad this story made it into print. Georgia is a very impressive woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring and poorly written","review":"What a disappointment! I bought this book after reading some of the favorable reviews and I have to wonder if we read the same book. It was nothing but dull. The writing style was what you'd expect from a teenager. It can't be easy to make the mob so plodding. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a exciting but drawn out life.","review":"I heard Georgia on a radio station talking about her life and the mob so i decided to buy her book. it started off very slow, mostly talking about herself and her accomplishments in stunt driving. I felt sorry for her in a way but she could of avoided everything if she only spoke up from the start. I would'nt say she was in the mob, she had very little ties with it. To me she hung around with people who wanted to be like the big dogs. As you read you think she would of got the hint with her first husband but she fell in love every minute through this book. if you like a long drawn out book that is predictable then this for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too Long","review":"This book could have been much shorter. She should have used a ghost writer too, because the writing wasn't very well done. There was some skipping around and when she started new subjects, there was no preparation, she just jumped into a whole new story. Some of this book is interesting, since most of us don't live this kind of lifestyle, however, after the first 10 chapters, I just kept wondering when it would end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Breeding Bimbo!","review":"Save Your Money,Ever Read A Book & Think...\\"This Nonsense Goes On FOREVER!\\"?? well I'll Walk You Through It Right Here & Now.Georgia Was A Bit Too Fast & Thought She Was Just as Furious,But Her Choices Proved Her To Be Exceptionally Ignorant Of Real Life So What Does She Then Do??Start Having Kids To Pass The Bad Brain To!As She Jumped From Man-To-Man,Maniac Husbands Here & There,Then Acts Surprised When Her Daughter's FRIEND Tells Her That Her Ex Husband Has Been Molesting Her Daughter.I Guess Ol' Georgie Girl Was To Self Involved To Notice On Her Own.Save Your Money,I Had To Give It Something So It Got One Star-& I Even Want That Back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Company She Keeps- G. Durante","review":"What a spectacular book. Durante keeps you involved with her story and the evolution of her life. The worst part of the book is that it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book I don't keep!!","review":"Waste of time! Where do I begin?Georgia made bad choices aplenty and her kids paid the price.First off, she talked at length (and frequently) about how pretty she was and how many bookings she had. She flew here and there and was the kodak girl 60 years ago and blah blah blah. She's a gorgeous woman, I get it!And the mob? She knew some of the guys but I got the impression that she was just a pawn or some pretty thing that hung around. Oh, and the wife of one of the low ranking jealous/abusive mobsters.Finishing this book was more painful than getting whacked by Tony Soprano.My advice to her would be:**Get a fan-based website. Don't make people read a book full of name-dropping and self-promotion disguised as spiritual growth.**Beg and plead for her daughter's forgiveness for the early trauma that she was subjected to as a child and a teenager.**Never EVER write another book. Just stick to the website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Georgia is the Rise and Fall and Darkside side in us all!","review":"After reading her book, studying her on television, and growing to know more about this intensely driven lady I can only give her incredible praises. She is the Rise and Fall and Darkside in all of us, and she takes us on her rollercoaster of a life filled with incredible highs and torturous lows that only someone of her incredible character and strength could not only endure, but overcome.Georgia's book is a most fascinating tale and savagely detailed look into the underworld and just how deep one can become involved before realizing it's too late to just 'step out' of it. Every man and woman alike should read this book and learn from it while you enjoy the thrills and chills throughout the journey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Read!","review":"I've known Georgia from childhood and am quite stunned at the experiences she has shared in this book. I saw her many times at \\"Caesars II\\" and we got together often in Las Vegas and yet I had absolutely no idea of this dark side of her life. I couldn't put the book down until I knew she was safe. After reading THE COMPANY SHE KEEPS, I now realize this book isn't about the Mafia but about her survival of it. Georgia, I applaud you for your courage and your will not only to survive but to successfully overcome each obstacle thrown in your way. You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely spellbinding! Couldn't put it down!","review":"This book is one of my favorites, as is the author. We grew up in the same town, same atmosphere. Georgia had a determination that I have always admired and the book sure gave me an incentive to go after my dreams. Thanks, Georgia, in more ways than you will know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Company She keeps","review":"This is such a real writing. I couldn't put it down. This woman led an amazing life and always kept going. Talk about survivers. She is someone who should be recognized. For a first writing, she blew me away and I am an avid reader. I only hope she continues with her writing, I will be first in line, with many in back of me. I think everyone should read this book to see how we can make some wrong turns, but overcome them by the right turns. Georgia Durante is passionate in her writing, as well as living. Do not pass up reading this book..............."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Was AMAZING","review":"While I was reading this book I felt so much power coming from Georgia. It takes alot to overcome what she has and for that, she deserves everything good that life has to offer. This book made me realize that life can get rough but you always have to push past the bad stuff to get to the good stuff. I had already thought that way but, having it come from a successful model was different. It made me realize in more light, that celebrities are just like us, they dont have perfect lives. There was absolutely nothing I did not like about this book. I recommend it to all my friends because it is truely the best book that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new definition for survival","review":"Woe, baby, you've come a long way. This is an incredable story of how one woman was able to survive deaths ugly face, not once, not twice, but several times. This is not only a fasinating read (written extremely well), but a storey with many lessons to be learned. It makes you really think. It's a look into the underworld from a whole different perpective that I found captivating. I sailed through 456 pages in two days and was sorry to see it end. Can't wait for this authors next book. She has a fan in me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Lessons From An Exciting Story","review":"Georgia Durante's story of real life adventure and real life survival offers lessons for everyone who reads it. Her escape from her abusive Mobster husband teaches all abused women that they too have the power of survival within themselves. The challenges she overcame being a parent reminds all parents about their role in their children's lives. The steps Georgia Durante took to build a successful stunt driving business in what had previously been a \\"man's world\\" teaches everyone that the only limits a life has are the one's we place on ourselves. Buy The Company She Keeps for two big reasons. You get a thrilling story.

Identical to the conclusion drawn after reading some of Bishop T.D.

This man, using biblical examples and beautiful imagery, breaks down that the trinity must work together to make a loving, healthy relationship. His message to women is to cherish yourself and your Divine purpose, to find men who will fall in line with that and how the Lord can ease the burdens for both. Jakes' words make you feel so beautiful and divine that you can't help but seek out a brother who can come correct, and he breaks down how God fits into it all. A beautiful, beautiful book with many necessary truths and advice on how faith and the Lord can lead the way to relationships we deserve. If you are a woman who has just left an unhealthy relationship, or you're in the process and need healing, this book is a GODSEND!! TD Jakes is truly, truly blessed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOMEN - BEWARE","review":"As with anything deceptive, this book has some truth. However, this man is leading many women astray by his total distortion of God's Word. I read this and one of Jakes' other books because I knew many women were reading them & hanging on every word. Why can we not just read God's Word which clearly states the position and role of women, as well as men, in the world and His Kingdom. I find it amazing that women are so unwilling to allow their husbands to be the \\"spiritual\\" head as the Bible so clearly instructs, yet they will flock to a strange man for their spiritual instruction without a thought! And yes, I do understand that when husbands are the leaders in the home, this does not mean domination, being treated as a secondary person, etc. I have been HAPPILY married for 37 years and it is because of the Lord, not \\"Bishop\\" Jakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Map doesn't match text","review":"I took my first walk today, taking one of the tours in the book, Greenwich Village.

Problem is, I would have to pay shipping on the new order (I ordered the first one with other items for free shipping).Amazon should waive the shipping on replacement items when they ship the wrong item.

I'm on my second one, because when it fell, the handle broke in half. No handle, no good. So be careful not to drop it, especially in cold weather. It's made of a cheap plastic. You don't expect a gas cap to break, even when it's dropped. If you can find one made of metal, it would be worth the extra money. Besides being made cheap, the key is diffcult to place in the slot. There is a metal cover that somehow has to move out of the way when you place the key in the slot. It can take several attempts before the key actually goes in the slot.

It only lasted 1.5 seasons...(Also, in my location, pools are only in use for about 3 months per year.) For a pump that cost over $1,350 delivered and then the extra installation cost.... I would say it was an extremely unsatisfactory experience. I have been reading reviews on the web and it seems like my problem is not uncommon.The engery savings this pump gave might have covered the extra cost of it, but with only a 1 year warranty you take your chances that the extra $800 or more dollars you spend is worth it.I am a bit of a techie, but the menu to run this pump is not very intuitive. You might spend quite a bit of time pulling your hair out trying to figure out what settings you should use.You pays your money, you takes your chances. If it lasts longer than 2 full seasons, then you might have saved enough to cover the extra pump costs. My Hayward pump lasted over 8 yrs, but was not energy efficient...."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, but the risk","review":"The research work is better than most available and the writing very good (See his other book as well). However if somebody can answer the following: Isn't there a risk of blowing up the strategy with a string of limit days? They may be rare, but their effects are extreme (see Nassim Taleb's site and/or book). At one point limit days are mentioned; they are handled by using the price at the limit. This assumes that one can trade futures at the limit price, which is not a guaranteed thing. Otherwise, the new and refreshing look at option pricing is excellent. Clearly accuracy is more important than precision in markets with bid/ask spreads and Mr. Gallacher is able to cut to the core of the issue. Lots to consider, but that one problem remains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and enjoyable read","review":"This book contains some very useful information for people who write options and wonder if their profitability is sustainable over the long run (hence the title \\"options edge\\"). Although Gallacher states that the edge between writers and buyers is zero (based on his empirical evidence); he illustrates that writers still can make consistent positive return on their trading, as long as they sell implied volatility which exceeds historic volatility and as long as they cover their short positions in options with futures at strike. Unfortunately, Gallacher doesn't compare LEAPS to futures as a way to cover short positions in options.

I picked this up maybe six months ago, used it prior to washing my hair a few times and never went back to it. Two months ago I decided to give it another try, this time after towel drying my hair (which I wash and condition as always). I can't believe the difference. My hair feels so silky that I can't stop running my hands over it. I usually just let it air dry and if I scrunch it I get soft, gentle curls. I can't believe this is the same hair that used to look like I should be wearing tie-dye and polishing up my Woodstock bumper sticker.

The fact is that the author and his texts are boring as Hell. His books - and this one in particular - are as clich�� ridden as a book can be.

Although I am not particularly demonstrative, I began to weep in horror during the first rape scene. Then, the book worsened. It reads like a doctored account of spousal abuse, and by the time I finished, I was more seriously disturbed than I have been in years. Anyone experiencing what the heroine experiences would be expected to suffer from serious post-traumatic stress, but she, bewilderingly, doesn't seem to retain any long-term effects.I recommend this book only to people researching misconceptions about domestic violence.

Adding insult to injury, there a few tracks on this album that aren't even in the movie, mediocre and unworthy of such a great soundtrack and film.In a perfect world, whenever the Distributor decides to release the DVD format of this picture, they would include a superior version of the soundtrack, so that we could all finally enjoy what Ry Cooder and his musicians accomplished in \\"The Long Riders\\", a truly great Western.I would recommend the soundtrack grudgingly since some of what's there is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely natural sound, lovely playing, offbeat","review":"A beautiful collection of bits of Americana, something of a cross between folk and soundtrack, it presaged and far outclasses the songs of the 'Civil War' television series.

When reading this book, you are not longing for any long fishing stories (most of which are published earlier somewhere else anyway) and you don't want to see a list of guides or lodges (you can find them easily from the web). The pictures with short comments are enough. I have seen some books that have five excellent shots from a particular place, but this one has tens for each of the destinations. Unbelievable book. I have to buy a bunch of these as gifts for my friends, for fly fishermen and for non-fly fishermen alike.

This book is not about Chicago, it is about the author's politics (which is communism disguised as liberalism.)Early in the book, the author claims that the owners of Chicago steel companies got complacent and forgot how to compete. The fact of the matter is that meeting the demands of the unions priced the steel much higher than the units arriving from East Europe and Asia. This is the first of so many instances that the author proves he is uninformed. He is also inaccurate in geography, history, and one funny instance of a math goof.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Tour of Chicago","review":"Like Alex Kotlowitz, I too am an \\"accidental Chicagoan.\\" As such, I very much enjoyed this book and would have enjoyed more, were it a bit longer.

I was a bit disappointed that he spent so much time on the West and South side of Chicago. It would have been nice to have more focus on the loop and North side as well.

If you are only cutting cardboard or other clean materials it will serve you well. Has a professional remodeler it does not measure up. Cut a piece of sheetrock and you must clean the blade in order to retract it. If the blade cannot be fully retracted the knife cannot be folded.

The fondness between Cressida and her father was very sweet. At times Jack was perfect and what we all would love in a man and then at times he was just so off his mark that it didn't make alot of sense.

I will admit that I've only read one other book from this author, but I seriously doubt I'll be picking up another. While the story line for the book is interesting, Cressida annoys the crap out of me. From the beginning, I wanted to reach into the book and smack her. First she acts like a spoiled child, then becomes a cross between a whiny five-year-old and a hormonal pregnant woman. The \\"misunderstandings\\" between her and Jack were too numerous to count and got to the point where the only misunderstanding I had was why I was still reading this book. I'm all about the angst in a love story, and the battle for the happy ending; but for crying out loud, sister, you should have given it a break after the third one!

According to the application guide, this is the model number that fits the 06 Sonata. They fit fine, but the operation is mediocre at best.

Lesson learned!Additionally, I purchased a set of these for a 2004 Cadillac CTS (not this model--see different reveiw), and they work a bit better than these. However, the lift support does not work nearly as good since the weather has gotten cooler.

It so obviously tried to evoke emotion while never establishing a valid enough depth to the characters to warrant any feeling whatsoever. I loved the original Tarzan. It had a sort of innocent charm that this remake never comes close to achieving. The Tarzan character's continual grunting and roaring while with other people was especially tedious after a short time. While in the original version Tarzan was endearingly ignorant of normal human mannerisms, this Tarzan just comes off as lacking intelligence.

A difficult read. I like a love scene as well as the next gal, but I felt I never got out of the bedroom. Sorry, Coulter was not at her best this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"Lot's of fast talking characters with dead pan deliveries of the completely absurd. A fun hero. A heroine who though innocent isn't a fool and an obstacle thrown between the two of them that's a doozy. Coulter gets a little over infatuated revisiting her characters from the Bride Triology, but this book makes a nice light hearted romp on a rainy afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asinine with Vapid Characters.","review":"If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot. As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least. I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day. If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book \\"Improper English\\", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Coulter is slipping in quality","review":"Her novels used to be fun and passionate, if with perhaps a bittoo much violence toward women. Used repeatedly it seems like aneasy-to-invoke plot device.The first clue to quality slips in the Regency/historical offerings were the re-issues of shorter novels as expanded ones. The new Regencies since then are beginning to all sound alike.Every heroine's \\"eyes cross with lust\\". Etc.By the time I got to Mad Jack, I was totally confused mid-way through. Simply because the author kept throwing in new elements to separate her main couple. Eventually the two of them seemed like different people in each chapter. I could not imagine how Jack got from an ignorant bride (of things \\"bridal\\") to the wisdom-dispensing mature counsellor of her husband over the trauma induced by his mother. When did Jack make THAT transition? The story takes place over a fairly brief period of time.Slow down, Ms. Coulter. It seems like she's hurrying to the bank to deposit royalties."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poorly written","review":"the subject was rediculous. it was unreadable. if this is a sample of more to come ms coulter has lost a reader"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much chatting with characters from previous books!","review":"I hate to be a nay-sayer, because I usually like Catherine Coulter's books, but I was very disappointed! There was much too much chatting with characters from previous Coulter books. If you haven't read those books, you may feel lost. I have read those books and I merely felt impatient. Where is the story for this book? The answer is that it is very thin and very contrived. Many other Coulter titles (including The Wild Baron and The Wyndam Legacy) are very good with a lot more character development and the same light tone. Read one of those! Your time and money will be better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are losing your readers!","review":"For the first time in 10 years, I threw a Coulter book out half way through it. I got the feeling the publisher was harassing Catherine Coulter for a book and this is the trash she produced. What a waste of money, but worse yet, since this is the second time I bought a Coulter book I didn't like (the first was a re-release supposedly re-written) I no longer buy a newly released Coulter romance. If it really looks interesting I will get it from the library.Don't let this stop you from reading her \\"modern\\" books. Obviously, Coulter is bored with romances and has changed her focus! The mysteries are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak effort, at best.","review":"This book gives one the sense that the author was rushed when writing it. The plot is silly and totally lacking in originality. She drops all these other characters into the mix which are apparently just filler, and serve no purpose.Consider another work by this author, she is really talented in this genre. Unfortunately that is not evident in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Is is my imagination or has Catherine Coulter started using the same hero and heroine in, oh say, the last 5 or 6 books? This was the most boring by far. I have other Catherine Coulter books that I love and re-read over and over. This is not one of them. Ever since The Wyndham Legacy (which is one of my favorites) the characters have begun to seem like they are all the same person. Even the minor characters. They are no longer entertaining and humerous. Now they are stilted and repetitious. Of course, the last couple of her novels that I've purchased were re-written older novels that were good the first time around.

Does ANYONE read this stuff before it goes into print? I've been reading historical romances for 20 years, and this is, without a doubt, the worst reading experience I've ever had! The flat characters and convoluted story line were bad enough, but the ridiculous, dithering, twit headed dialogue that has become Ms. Coulter's hallmark of late, aggravated me so much that I read not even half of this book before I threw it across the room in disgust!

The heroine was a complaining inept airhead and her \\"Devirgination\\"should not take so long and then we have to listen to her complain about it for hours afterward. And Georgie? who came across as a freakish stuttering child was reenactted by the narrator in an annoying stuttering whine.

So naturally buying Mad Jack (from the locate book store and not Amazon. Com) and paying full price was not an issue, until I finished the book, then I felt that it was the principal (paying that kind of money I'm going to finsh the book). I was truly disappointed with Ms. Coulter's writing. I almost could not get rid of the headaches from trying to keep up with the verbiage between the characters. I was truly disappointed that is wasn't what I am use to from Ms. Coulter, I will definitely think twice about buying another Catherine Coulter book, and full price....not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"This book was ridiculous. It had no plot and no characters and was very plodding. It was astonishing that Catherine Coulter could have written it. Perhaps it was a shadow writer?

This was a fun read because it was so different than anything else I had read by Coulter. It's set in 1811 London and Mad Jack turns out to be a young woman who has run away from her stepfather who plans to have her marry a sinister old man. She is aided by becoming the \\"male\\" valet to two lovely aunts of, of course, an attractive single Lord of the manor. Now, you may think, oh,this is just another love story...Not true! For instance, Lord Durban meets Mad Jack after \\"he\\" has stolen Durban's horse and when he catches \\"him,\\" he attacks \\"him\\" as the horse thief Mad Jack is...well, you get the picture...soon he finds out that he has been beating up on a young lady--quite a pretty young lady indeed. Only to have her kidnapped... Ah, quite a romp around merry ole England...what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off Rip-off Rip-off","review":"I paid the outlandish price for this book, assuming that Coulter would be up to her usual high standards. Such was not the case. The dialogue was almost bizarrely stilted (\\"I'm a man. I'm handsome and charming..... You will admire me. You will be pleased that I'm your husband. You will obey me, but I will never trust you\\".) Does/did anybody ever talk that way? Coulter also brought in characters from previous books, such as Sinjun and Colin, Ryder, and Douglas, which, I admit, influenced my decision to buy the book. Like the dialogue, though, their presence seems awkward and contrived, leading me to suspect they were reintroduced to lend some credibility to a vague plot (the heroine, Mad Jack, is trying to avoid being married off by her wick stepfather, hence the quickly failed masquerade as a male). Do yourself a favor and wait until your local library has this book. It's not worth buying..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was terrible","review":"I have ready many of Ms. Coulter novels and this was, by far, the worst. The sentences were short, stilted, and repetitive. Where was the plot, the story line? This book seemed like it was written with no effort or thought. She kept repeating the same thing to take up space. This one is going in the recycle bin! I know she can write better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Catherine Coulter has ever written","review":"Catherine Coulter is usually an amazing writer. But I think she rushed this one, not the plot line itself but I'm sure she was working under a deadline and it just wasn't working. She needs to slow down and stop trying to put out so many books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I'm a big fan of Coulter, but this book was a huge disappointment. The plot was bad and so was the writing. I'm glad she wanted to bring back characters from the Bride series, but what was the purpose of them in the novel? My advice would be to wait until the library offers it. Not worth paying that much for a book you will never finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Read","review":"This was one fun story!

I usually can read a book of this length within 24 hours if it has an interesting storyline. This book fell very short of that. It took me 3 weeks. I could never get interested in it. The characters were so unreal and very superficial. I feel Catherine could have done a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and repetative...","review":"Catherine Coulter has obviously gotten tired...tired of writing...tired of researching...tired of thinking. This book was a total rehash of previous books. It was also very poorly writen. The characters speak in odd run-on sentences, and the tale is not only unbelievable it is absurd. She WAS once one of my favorite authors, but after this I don't know if I will bother to read anything else that she writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing but not a total Disaster!!","review":"I have read quite a lot of Coulter's books but Mad jack was not up to her usual high standards.

As a student of graphic design (who really cant afford an $80 book) this really bugs me that so much emphasis is put on spell checking your work over and over to make sure there are no mistakes and then you buy a book all about graphic design and it's jam packed with typo's! How unproffessional is that?! And that is why I only give it one star. If you can get past the typo's and the gramatical errors that make the difficult subject matter even more difficult to digest then go ahead and get the book cos it will be worth it - but if so little effort was put into spell checking the book - it makes me wonder about the accuracy and the validity of the information contained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trade-offs","review":"There is good information in this book, but to find it you must dig through a heap of grammatical errors and typos. I wish I had known this beforehand, because I would not have settled for this massive mistake of a text book. Not to mention, this is the Second Edition. I would hate to see all the mistakes in the First. If we, as college students and/or designers, are going to spend time reading through this book, someone over at Wiley Publishing should have taken the time to do so - and make corrections. To find the information I need, I am not going to weed through broken sentences. I would suggest that you make every attempt to avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was not proofread","review":"Absolutely every chapter has at least 10 misspellings or grammatical errors in it. It is quite funny how in the first chapter they stress how important it is to proof copy before it goes to the printer. Maybe the authors or the publisher need to read the book themselves. It is a very dry book and each chapter covers the main points with in the first few pages then repeats the topics over and over again through out the rest of the chapter. I would not recommend this book unless the person does not mind being distracted by misspelling, grammatical errors, and repetition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Print & Design, Horrible Typos!","review":"The book is full of wonderful information that any graphics student/enthusiast should know, but EVERY page it seems has HUGE typos. Some words are even the complete wrong word \\"dot\\" instead of \\"does\\" or \\"pwdr\\" instead of \\"powder\\". This book isn't that expensive, but when I'm learning something or referring to a book for information (instead of the unreliable internet) I want to be confident in the information I am gathering. Due to the many typos I am not always sure their information is right. On a happier note, the print quality is awesome and the design work is something I would expect a graphics book to look like. So, 4 1/2 stars on the graphics side, 1 star on the grammatical portion and 3 on the info only because I am not always so confident in the information."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TO HARD TO READ, DISAPPOINTED","review":"This book has a ton of great information, and has been very helpful. But I have to agree that it is filled with typos, which makes them look bad. BUT the HUGE problem with this book it the text is too freaking small.

And no, I am not farsighted, or really old and can't see, I am a young graphic designer, but find it VERY hard to read this text.Because of this I wouldn't reccommend this book, find a different book that knows how to spell, and knows not to make the reading text a 9 point"},{"rating":"2","title":"design production","review":"A thourough and interesting book on the processes and steps involved in print design.

It can be found in tube form as well, but that is much rarer.This little squeeze-tube, like the powder stuff, is just regular horseradish, mustard seed and some food coloring. It contains 0% of the actual wasabi plant, and the flavor is different from hon-wasabi, although similar.But it still works. For most recipes, using the expensive hon-wasabi would be a waste of money, and this imitation does the job just fine. I personally keep both kinds, hon-wasabi for when I am using it directly for sashimi and a tube of the old faithful S&B; for when I want to make wasabi-flavored dishes.It is too bad that it is so expensive, because this tube would go for about a dollar a pop in Japan, but that is the price of imports eh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Confederate Spirit Kunstler","review":"This book is gift quality.

It is impossible to bond in any way with any of the characters; the interrogation - broken up by other story lines which serve as a relief but not much else - is interminable, and the ending is about the most depressing ending possible.

I think they're great. They give extra descriptions, and usually include small scenes that weren't in the movie. Part of the reason is because they're usually written straight from the script. BUT, most authors try and give some more insight to the scenes occurring. They do RESEARCH. They explore CHARACTER. In short, they give new dimensions to the source material that aren't evident on the screen.Having said all of that, the novelization of Armageddon sucks. I think I read it faster than the movie takes to watch (never a good sign). It felt like a junior adult/children's adaptation. It was a joke. I was extremely disappointed.

Then he gets lost in a ravine. sara,joe melby, and her friend Mary go looking for Charlie. Everybody especially Aunt Willie expects the worst. But they find Charlie in a ravine.My favorite character is Boysie because he did not bore me like all the others. Also because he is alot like me. He is lazy and sleeps alot. I think he is the most interesting character.I did not like this novel because it was too long. If it wasn't for Boysie, this would be the worst novel ever. My teacher put me through this torture.

Charlie gets lost because he was tempted to see the elegant and white swans again. When he goes looking for the swans, he gets lost from the dread noises of dogs barking and the searing pain of the cut he gets from a barb-wire fence. As his sister Sara struggles to find Charlie and would do anything to see the sight of him, she had other sad things in her summer. Now that she had a true sadness, there were no more tears left that she could shed from her eyes. Over all, I think this book is awesome! So come on everyone! Go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not great","review":"This story was a very heartfelt one but way too predictable. Sometimes it rattled off and left me uninterested for queit a while.

There is a tragedy when Charlie gets lost while he is trying to find the swans he had seen earlier. When they discover Charlie is missing they have the whole town looking for. Sara discovers Charlie but, she also discovers there is more to life than the little things.My favorite character in this novel is Joe Melby. Joe Melby is a kind and clever boy who cares about Charlie and won't stop until he and Sara find him. He is very patient with Charlie. At the end of the novel he asks Sara to go with him to a party.My opinion on the novel was that it was a good book to learn from. It explains how a day with a mentally handicapped person would be. It also teaches you not just to care about the little things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"The Summer of the Swans is an excellent book for children about 12 years old.

To me it was very predictable and slow, because books like this always end happily ever after. I knew from the beginning that they were going to be happy in the end. My kind of book is scary, sad, and unpredictabe, but if you like happy endings, I would definitely recommend you to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book by Byars","review":"I thought this book was okay. It had a good plot and also good symbolism. However, there was one part of the book I disliked, the ending because it didn't leave any information to sum up the story and ended blankly. I also thought this book was too predictable, because during many parts you could tell what was going to happen next. Other than those two things, I thought this book was pretty good I would recommend it for people who like happy endings in their stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough for a Newbery Medal","review":"The book, The Summer of The Swans, is an obviously predictable book about a selfish girl name Sara who learns right from wrong. With no action,comedy,suspence or mystery, it's just a grade school drama that doesn't deserve a Newbery Award Medal. So unless you like predictble grade school books about what's important in life and a brother getting lost, this book isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding out what is important","review":"There are four main characters in this short story based in the beauty of West Virginia: 14 year-old Sarah, her older sister, Wendy, her younger brother, Charlie, and the relative who is raising all three children, Aunt Willie. While the story certainly centers on finding Charlie, a child who is mentally disabled, the reader also sees Sarah finding truth about her own self. The reader will survey many things: that all relationships in life are not perfect, that sometimes we make mistakes by assuming things, that beauty is indeed more than superficialities, that our desires can sometimes appear from places we never expect. The story has very short chapters and a very happy ending. There are some good layers of the story to unravel such as the significance of the swans to Sarah and the meaning of their return to the lake at the university. Overall, young people should find this a very entertaining story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theresa's Review ; )","review":"This book is a mixture of drama,emotions, and different kinds of relationships.

It was our favorite of all the books we read this summer for book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good novel that's not really about swans.","review":"I give the novel \\"The Summer of the Swans\\" four stars because it is an insightful and suspenceful story. The novel is based on a fourteen year old girl's summmer that changed her life. The story has very descriptive characters so you can actually visualize them. The plot of the story was exciting, adventureous and dramatic. It made me feel grateful and lucky for the things that I take for granted. The swans are not really character but symbols of the change that was coming. The suspense comes when the main character's younger mentally handicapped brother has gone missing in the woods.

Aunt Willi takes over the mothers role in the house and she looks for charlie and sara. Only one think happend in the story that was that Charlie went away from his house and Sara and Aunt Willi had to search for him. Sara and Aunt Willi were very nervouse because they told Saras father that they would look after him very good, and finally the had found him. Thats all about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"This book contains lots of problems. The book the Summer of the Swans is about a 14 year old girl who can't really decide about herself and her ideas about herself change throughout the novel.Sara's brother is called Charlie who is aged ten, but has the mind of a three year old due to a childhood illness. Sara cares for him like a mother. One night however Charlie goes out to see the swans, but gets lost. He panics and falls down into a ravine. Sara looks for Charlie with Joe Melby the alleged person who apparently stole Charlie's watch. Sara finds out that Joe is not what he thought he was and they become friends. Meanwhile Charlie is found by Sara and Joe and she really finds out how much he means to her. I liked this novel because it was well planned and had a moral.

She was happy one minute, discontent the next. No one sympathized with her. One sleepy summer night, Charlie disappeared in search of the swans he and Sara fed the day before. The family realized how much they really love him, even if he was annoying sometimes. Read the book to see if he's found.

Plus at the end, the heroine Sara had this big philosophical soliloquy that seemed forced and out of place with her character.The only one I liked in the book was the sensible,open minded older sister Wanda.Its too bad that she wasn't written into the story a lot more.The only reason that I can figure out that this book became a Newbery award winner is that it featured a prominent character with a disability and when this book was released in 1970, that probably wasn't an overly common thing in young adult literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book By Far","review":"Okay I was forced to read this awful book in school and hated every word of it.

She try's to deal with her life, her brothers life, and her sisters life. There is a sort of interesting middle and ending, but it is more boring than interesting.I really didn't like this book because I personally like fantasy and action and this was the complete opposite.

Brown's success writing other fiction must be the reason such worthless drivel could be published in the first place.

I recommend it highly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectations are prearranged resentments","review":"Upon finding this \\"liberal\\" novel in my conservative, college library, I was quite interested to read the author's views about homosexuality in southern aristocratic culture. The beginning of the story grabbed my attention with Frazier's near-death experience and her subsequent \\"outing\\" to her friends and family. However, by the second half of the book I was wondering if the author had a point to make, or even a plot. The conclusion of the novel was highly disappointing because the author forgot about the minimal plot she had developed and proceeded to display highly controversial political messages in the form of Frazier's interactions with greek mythological characters. All in all, Rita Mae Brown could have spent more time on character and plot development, and less time on the southern scenery she so loves to describe. If you are expecting to read an interesting and open-minded novel, chose something else, or you'll resent the time wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have read a number of the author's books and enjoyed them all which is why I chose to read Venus Envy. I was very disappointed in this book. In my mind is was nothing more than a means to advocate alternate lifestyles and gay culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"a premise that holds promise lost in bad writing","review":"When I read what this book was about, I thought it sounded interesting - what would we do if we thought we weren't going to live. However, I found the interesting idea was way overshadowed dull characters and writing. The characters are either goody/goody or someone absolutely hateful - very one-dimensional and totally unrealistic. As for style of writing, I felt like the book was written for pre-teenagers - very, very simplistic, although the subject matter certainly is adult. The ending read like some kind of inane dream that the author had one night, embellished with some kind of misdirected how-can-i-make-this-seem-spiritual mythology which seemed to me to be just asinine. I was bored from the beginning but kept reading, hoping it would pick up. Alas, it never did - I was embarrased for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasantly preachy","review":"A novel like this needs a light touch. Instead, Brown gives us a fantasy sex scene after which the lovers lie in each other's arms discussing Reagan-Bush AIDS policy & the evolutionary purpose of gay people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"This book in not anywhere near Ms Brown's usual standards. Lacklustre story based on an unbelievable premise. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Showed promise but a disappointing ending","review":"I read this book and it began really well, and I thought that the story had promise but when I read the last quarter of this book, it got really boring, and had to put it down. The book started off well showing promise but faltering at the end. I was disappointed. The ending should have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraordinary","review":"Extraordinary book! Mr. Belknap really cuts to the core of the issues surrounding the My Lai incident and the subsequent Courts Martials (Calley being the only person actually found guilty). His review of the political issues of the era as well as the personal sacrifice made by the prosecution, really help the reader understand what happened after Lt. Calley returned to the United States. Anyone interested in military justice, or who may remeber the incident and not understand fully what was involved, should pick up a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"Perhaps I was just not young enough for this title.

Through a personal story Karsten makes both his huge trek and the region's biological challenges seem relatively easy to face. This is an important feat conssidering he and others hope to engage and mobilize thousands in a pioneering international conservation initiative.As a PS, I was surprised to learn the Canadians were doing as much, if not more, damage to the environment then we 'mericans.

I am very pleased with both knives.The handle is well constructed. All the wood fittings, joints, and rivets are tight, giving the knife a solid feel. Although the handle is thinner than the hunter series knives, it still feels sturdy in the hand. That, combined with the lock-back, give this knife a solid, sturdy, and safe feel during use.Since I purchased this knife, I've carried it in my pocket almost every day. On weekends, fishing, and camping trips I carry it in my shorts pocket and it works well as a utility knife. I also carry it during the week: because of it's sleek, thin, handle, and light weight, it is equally at-home in my suit pocket and works well as a gentleman's knife.All around, this is a great knife. It's solid, sturdy, incredibly useful, and has a touch of class."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied with quality of this product","review":"The blade had small spots of what appeared to be \\"rust\\" on them.

I still have the first Buck 110 I bought back in the late 70's, and now have 4 different models. The Squire is a perfect size for everyday use carried in a pocket. I doubt you can find a better knife at any price, and on Amazon it's about half the price of retail. It's a solid 11 out of ten!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned It","review":"After looking extensively for a single locking blade knife about this size with a wood case, I settled on the Buck Squire. I was disappointed when it arrived, though. The wood just didn't look very nice. It appeared low-quality to my eyes and the color had a strong red tint to it, unlike the picture shown here. Otherwise, the knife was very nice--good blade, opened smoothly, locked and unlocked as it should. But since I'm looking for a nice knife to keep for decades and I wasn't happy with this one's appearance, I returned it to Amazon (with absolutely no hassles.- love how easy it is to shop here). Maybe the one I got was an anomaly and another one would have looked better, I don't know. I'm shopping around for a different knife now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I had bought a few Buck knives and overall were happy with its sturdiness and craftsmanship until this one. Yes it is still sturdy as the others I had bought but the craftsmanship was absolutely lousy - the blade seems to be cut by a broken tool and it looks very coarse, and the screws underneath the nickel silver bolsters were so disturbingly conspicuous (It doesn't show on the picture.). So much for the legendary knife maker. I was going to return it but was too lazy to go through the trouble. I just bought a folding knife from Kershaw instead and I am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD","review":"This is a nice cd, I had a great time listening to it today and remembering my old days.

This area stretches from north to south in mid-Tennessee between Nashville and Knoxville where the mountains start to rise toward the Great Smokies. Anyone who thinks that the inhabitants are prototypes of The Dukes of Hazard will be surprised to read the truth about the music, history, crafts, culture, religion, and habits of a people proud of their heritage and sturdy as the mountains that surround them. The book encompasses Civil War lore, religious revivals, moonshining, music, farming methods, and many more insights into the lives and history of the area. It is at once scholarly and readable (those two characteristics do not always go together) and is a treasure of information for the student of Southern culture as well as an entertainment for the casual reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"When I received this item, part of the black coating (powder coating?) was already coming off around the area that was drilled for the lock. Upon attempting to install the fuel door, I discovered that the lock would not close onto the lock plate without significant trimming of the lock plate. So far I have turned the lock plate, which comes from the factory shaped like a 'C', into an 'L', and it looks like I will have to thin out the vertical section of the 'L' even more to get the lock to close. So much so as to worry me about whether the lock plate will hold together at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perennial Pleasure","review":"Over the years we've collected a slew of holiday albums. Some we take out for a single favorite song or a humorous oddity. But this album, \\"Good People All\\" is a pleasure to listen to from the first track to the last. Great as background music at a small gathering (though it deserves a more attentive run-through) the album presents both a festive lively air and that ancient wonderful wisdom that comes with winter contemplation. Curl up, watch the snow sparkle, and listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY DESPITE WHAT OTHERS SAY","review":"I purchased this product on amazon and have had nothing but success since. (It even arrived a day early) I went with my gut and ordered it despite VERY negative reviews. I must tell you. IT WORKS! No matter what they say, it operates exceptionally well if you have a somewhat new pc, XP home edition. The installation process is lengthy, but the rewards are amazing. You can do virtually everything. This product is PERFECT for amatuer filming (which I do) and simply making home movies. You can make video cd's, once again perfect for amatuer filmers, cd's, and even dvd's. The precision editing is amazing in that you have total control over every aspect of your movie. Perfect for novices, yet great control for veterans. The steps are so simple to follow, that I didn't even read anything from the guide and was able to begin working.This new product is great.

However, after installing the \\"patch\\" to version 7.0.1.34 or whatever number it was every video file and DVD I owned played so dark in any media player that I couldn't even see the video. Luckily I had a hunch that Roxio 7 was the problem and just uninstalled it, instead of re-doing my entire system. I'm now back to version 6.2.xxx.xxx and will stay there until they fix their problems with 7. I've never seen a company that allows such noticeable problems to be released to the public. I guess they've never heard of beta testing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generate low quality DVD movies","review":"I bought this product to create DVD movies.

Read through the support comments - how much time can people afford to waste. Twice I have returned the product. I called customer service - voice mail and they want $35 an hour to support the product that won't install on Windows XP, 60 MB and 1.6 mgz.Finally had to return the software for a refund - 4 to 6 weeks turn time.

There is no phone support without paying. I emailed support regarding the program crashing and I got some template reply that had nothing to do with my problem.

So goodbye Roxio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still no dual layer support for downloaded versions","review":"Roxio has an update available that provides support for dual layer DVD burning. However this update is available ONLY for retail boxed versions of Roxio 7, not the download versions such as what you buy from Roxio's own store. Moral of the story: Roxio does not have an emphasis on customer satisfaction, they are ignoring much of their user base, and if you must have this product then buy it from Amazon or a physical store where you get the retail version! Better yet, check out Nero Burning ROM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to uninstall it.","review":"I upgraded from Roxio 5 to Roxio 7 and it has been terrible. When I start my computer it keeps trying to reinstall again and again. According to the Roxio support page that has been a problem for awhile.

Think twice before buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have Roxio 5, why upgrade?","review":"Slide show creator module is inferior to the Video Impressions (Arcsoft) included in the Roxio 5. I never could get the Sound Module to work; I had to record using Windows Creative Recorder and then import. If you're using 600x800 screen resolution for other programs, you'll have to switch to higher resolution each time you access Roxio 7. I don't understand what all the 4 and 5 star reports found so useful; I notice most of the faorable ones were written early in the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"The video editing software is absolute garbage","review":"The video editing part of this software is completely useless. It didn't come with a manual and I ended up buying on my own a book about how to use it. It hasn't made a difference. The software is completely uncooperative. My computer more than meets the minimum requirements for running the program. If you bought this software for the video editing, I recommend using the disc as a drinks coaster and buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to launch applications","review":"This would probably be a pretty good piece of software if it actually worked. I installed EMC7 on my new computer, but almost all of the applications (such as DVD builder and VideoWave) fail to even launch. I've spent many hours with Roxio's (feeble) technical support and on their discussion groups and tried many of their suggested fixes (including their new updates) but nothing helped. I could understand this software not working on an old computer with inadequate specs, but it should work on a new computer that far exceeds the minimum specs. This has been a complete waste of time and money. I think I'll try Nero instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work","review":"This would not install on my new computer with windows xp.

BAD DECISION! The program is slow (and I have a very new computer), it hangs up, it has a mind of its own when creating the timing for the picture and the transition, have to change the screen resolution in order for the program to work, and on and on. The worst part is that technical support is horrible - I would send an email and 14 days later get a response! And, if you want to call they charge!

There are alternatives.","review":"Do you know if u ever need to get support, or to download a patch for your paid Roxio software, registration IS required from their website?! Yes everytime you need an software update/patch, you need to login with password. Registration needs an valid email address and your ROXIO software key. Thanks to this COMPULSORY registration I need to keep record for one more login/password combination. And Pray that you don't loose your cd key.BTW if your cdburner came with a bundle Roxio Easy creator, forget any update / support from roxio since you dont get a cd key. Somehow this is one evil way ROXIO try to get your business. if one day you upgrade your operating system and need to update for the bundle roxio software, you have to BUY the retail version Easy Creator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't even install... what customer support?","review":"The product would not install on any one of 4 machines (all running flavors of XP).

Nero works really well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with widescreen video","review":"Once I figured this software out, I was able to do a slideshow of my pictures, integrate video, and produce a decent DVD. Only problem is, it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my DVD camcorder shoots in 16:9. This sucks. I have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9. Roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it doesn't support 16:9 at this time. Even in the new 7.5 version. Roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I have had countless problems since installing this software. The software did not work properly, so I uninstalled and reloaded it. This did not fix the problem. Worse yet, installing the Roxio software also messed up my Windows Media Player somehow. I e-mailed Roxio about the problem and got no reply. So then I Googled the error message I get whenever I insert a cd, and I found a message board where many people have posted complaints about the same problem. Evidently, the best response anybody got from Roxio was: \\"Buy an upgrade to fix the problem.\\" Gee, thanks a lot.If you are tempted to buy anything from Roxio, I would suggest that you simply download a virus into your computer instead--you'll get the same results but without paying for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont expect help from Roxio","review":"Review: I have had this product for 2 months and havent been able to use it because I need the updates and I havent been able to download them.

There isn't any. The program forces you install AT LEAST 277MB of unnecessary, additional programs. For example, I had to install Roxio's 31MB Roxio Player, a DVD player utilility. This on a computer without a DVD drive. Ditto the Media Manager, Storyboard, etc., etc. All-in-all, this is a fat product with lousy performance, non-existent customer support and one for which there are a number of superior alternatives. Personally, I'm going to Nero and (like everyone else) will never buy a Roxio product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant","review":"This integrated suite of products is superb.

Well done Roxio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal software for management consultants too","review":"As a management consultant working from my home office I have both consumer and business software loaded on my computer. When I first bought Easy Media Creator 7, the intention was to use it just for archiving and editing my family and vacation pictures and making CDs and DVDs. As I used it more and more, I discovered that it has many applications for my business. I now use it to create secure scheduled backups of my work files, and also use the Disc Copier feature for making multiple copies of my work CDs for clients. A good example was a few weeks ago when I managed a business planning offsite meeting for one of my clients, and took many digital photos of the 3-day session. I then turned these pictures into a slideshow complete with captions, transitions, and background music that I gave copies to everyone before they left. It was so well received, I'm now going to use my digital camera and Easy Media Creator 7 all the time for my offsite meetings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Improved after Patch","review":"Like others, I had many problems with the video components of EZ Media creator.

I purchased Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 two months ago and have been using it continuously since. I have had nothing but a satisfying experience with it. The user interface allows you to pick it up quickly, openning up some powerful features for capturing, editing and creating with your digital media. I have been very impressed with Roxio's customer service, who have promptly responded to numerous questions via email within 18-36 hours. All the available features, plus great customer service and a low price equals incomparable value."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is an Easy Media Creator","review":"The user interface and support materials (users guides and how to video tutorials) made this a piece of cake to learn to use. It packs loads of functionality into this one product. As a digital photography buff I especially like the quick photo editing tools and turning my pictures into fun presentations with the Storyboad module. I can share my slideshows by importing them into DVD builder where I create the menu-driven interface, and then burn them to VCD format (which is readable on most newer DVD drives and players). It is a GREAT product that lives up to its name!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run for NERO","review":"I don't know if Roxio has fixed any of the nightmarish problems of previous versions, but you might want to read user reviews before you purchase any software from this company.

That product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics, burn it, then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort. Almost everything was intuitive.Creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility. So they added a few new bells and whistles, so what? The base use of this product is to make music cd's and to create inserts. Arranging music is not as easy as it was before. And the insert creator is so frustrating to use I don't bother.In fact, I have continued to use Creator 5 and have simply written off the fact I paid $100 for Creator 7 - for nothing!Now, with a computer upgrade, Creator 5 no longer works. I don't dare try another Roxio product (just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money). I'll be taking my chances on ANYTHING else . . . not Roxio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating","review":"This is the first time I've been motivated to leave feedback on a product - it is THAT poor. The DVD builder - one of the main reasons I bought the package - is dire. You can't rename chapters (you need to be content with 1, 2, 3 etc). The \\"help\\" function is farcical, and my PC spent four hours encoding the DVD I wrote, only to give the prompt \\"Error\\".

Response to email is worse than any I have used. Maybe it's a good product if I can ever get to use it. Don't understand the pleased reviews. Maybe I got a lemon. Creator 5 worked fine for me.

I shudder to think how sluggish and unresponsive it would be on a Celeron system.My other complaint is that all of the useful options have been removed. In particular, the bootable CD functionality has been gutted--it's no longer possible to slipstream a Windows install CD, which was a very useful feature for sysadmins.All I want is a fast, useful, and unobtrusive CD/DVD mastering utility, and Roxio 7 fails on all three counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 Attempts at installation----Gave up!","review":"I was initially looking forward to using this software with a new high end digital camera I recently purchased.

In my many years of experience, I have never seen such an unstable, flaky program as this Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite. It has caused operating system crashes when used with Microsoft Windows XP. Portions of the program such as the \\"Tutorial\\" become inoperable even after reinstalling. It is inflexible compared to other CD burn programs. I can not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Functionality","review":"Pros: All the functionality in one application, easy to learn and use, good customer support materials with it and on Roxio's web site, plus the great production projects I can create and burn to DVD or CD.Cons: Time consuming install, printed manuals would be nice to have, and sometimes its kind a slow when moving between apps.Overall: I like it a lot and if they could speed it up a little more that would be even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tightly integrated product suite with unique capabilities","review":"After doing my homework, I chose this product because it offers many video and slideshow, capture, creation and editing capabilities not found in some of the competing products. Some of these unique capabilities include -- The Storyboard which allows me to mix photos and videos with transitions and audio; Applying Pan and Zoom Effects to videos and photos; and SmartVideo Capture where I can preview video scenes on my PC and only import selected scenes directly from my video camera without having to copy everything to HD first. Creator 7 has not let me down, it works great under XP, I'm glad I bought it. If you own a digital camera or digital video camera, this is a must have product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this software. You'll be so sorry...","review":"Not only is the software riddled with bugs, but the customer service is terrible. I write software for a large corporation, so I have a little experience under my belt. This software was either rushed out the door, or Roxio's quality assurance department (if it even exists) did a very poor job of testing this software. Many of the features just plain don't work. And the one's that do, are often riddled with little bugs that make it take forever to get anything done. Usability is very poor as well. Nothing is labled what you would expect it to be or is placed where it should be.Don't waste your money. You are better off getting something else. When I posted something like this on their discussion web site, they banned me from the site. What does that tell you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"no support- lousey video editing program weak recognition","review":"I up graded to 7 to edit and burn a DVD. I had transfered my 8mm film to a DVD.

I then went to video editing nightmare. It dosn't allow you to take out snipits and save and re use. you can only change the begining and end. I tried to contact by e-mail forget it. It burns DVD's fine, but as a editing program it fails the course. I could go on about the problems with slideshow. The fact that you can not use prior productions made by 7 in a different production. all in all there must be better programs.

Great features and value.","review":"I rarely write reviews, but my experience with this product requires that I take the time to tell you about it. It delivers all the features and performance I expected at a modest price. It handles all forms of digital media -- music, photos, and video. The interface is easy to use offering two ways to do things -- as Tasks or Applications. I'm able to quickly convert my digital camera photos and digital video into slide shows and edited videos complete with fun transitions. Then create CDs and DVDs.

The interface makes it easy to use and explore. The Help Center and tutorials provide good documentation, and watching the tutorial video guides really help you understand how things work. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to capture my digital camera photos, and digital video footage, and then edit and create finished slideshows and videos. The best part was how easy it was to then create some great looking DVDs. It runs just fine on my 2 GHz PC running XP.

Here are the reasons I chose Easy Media Creator 7:It had to cost under $80 = CHECK. I did not want to have to read a huge sticking manual to try to figure out how to use it, so it had to be very easy to learn and use = CHECK. It had to be able to do everything I needed - burn CDs and DVDs, edit my digital photos, video editing and DVD authoring - all in one package = CHECK. It had to be well regarded by the editors who know this stuff and put products through rigorous testing, because I didn't want to pay to be a beta tester = CHECK.Easy Media Creator 7 met and exceeded my criteria and after 4 months of use has not let me down. I have no hesitation recommending it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have Product","review":"Easy Media Creator 7 is a must have product for any digital media enthusiast. The collection of integrated applications that make up EMC7 is very impressive, and the overall learning curve is low, thanks to the consistent user interface across applications.

The StoryBoard application is a good video editor with a timeline that gives you flexible audio editing functionality.I have been using it for the last 3 months, and am confident recommending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many bugs to count","review":"I purchased this product because I trusted the Roxio name and because of the positive reviews it had recieved.

There are too many problems associated with getting it to run straight out of the box. AND Roxio is refusing to address them. I did not up-date to EMC7 to be met with hours of reconfiguring my computer, to enjoy the product. Now I'm out the cost of the product, that I bought through Amazon.com, with no recourse to recover my monies.

There are no updates for the product on their support site but upon scanning the user forums, there are a lot of users with similar problems. Support is emailing patches but not posting an update.

I would install version 5 but it is not compatible with XP.

Following installation my system wouldn't recognize any of the optical drives. I had to go through the Restore Point procedure to bring them back. Even then, I had trouble with Roxio loading, other software ceased working properly (to the point that I couldn't back anything up to optical drives), and I finally had to do a clean install of Win XP.The sad part about this is that these are known problems with \\"workarounds and fixes\\" on Roxio's site. Unfortunately the fix didn't work for me.I feel terribly burned by Roxio and, since software is unreturnable, by Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very burdensome - non consistant -","review":"The software was very inconsistant. (Used on PC with XP Service pack 2 high level of multi media performance) especially in the \\"Plug and Burn\\" phase if you did not want to capture and edit the video. It would capture less then 50% of the time through a 50 minute DV tape. Unfortunately, sometimes you were 80% through the capture tape when it begins to fail. Out of 10 captures, only 4 worked from begining to end the other 60% failed; leaving for much re work, frustration let alone hours of unproductive time.

Using this software is not easy without someone to teach you what to do. Their previous, earlier versions were much easier to use.I also find that the \\"Photo Doctor\\" often highly distorts photos and any adjustments for exposure and saturation are better manually tweeked.I find that I'm only using a tiny part of this software, because I can't figure out all the rest. Even burning CDs has proven a challenge. Very few templates for CD labels and I've yet to find a list of songs that would actually fit in the template space provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful when you buy this","review":"Like others who have posted on this one, I spent hours just trying to get this program to install. I tried on three different machines. Thought it was a funky media, which I replaced and tried again, but same problem. So I went to Roxio web page. Well, guess what? Only works with a very select list of DVDs, and mine wasn't one of them. Before you buy, check for compatibilty. Wrote complaint to FTC. Buy Nero Suite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly buggy - zero stars","review":"I had an earlier version of Easy CD Creator that worked fine. This version 7 has to be about the lowest quality software I've ever purchased. It hangs, doesn't use the settings I've specified when burning a disk, doesn't save the right settings after I've saved a project, dies in the middle of burning a CD saying 'file not found' without telling you what file (after it had 'verified all the files'), tells me it is writing to a CD-ROM when I don't even have a disk in the drive, is extremely slow, extra windows pop up inexplicably, etc.. It tells you file names are too long, but not which ones. There are almost no settings or preferences. Even the fonts used are inconsistent, so it looks like no quality control group even tested this. Embarrassing for Roxio, a big disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess","review":"This product should come with lots of warnings. While installation was trouble free, Win XP wouldn't recognize any of my optical drives. I went to Roxio's web site and fixed that problem with a posted RegEdit fix. When I started doing some serious work, however, I realized that this product is soooo slowwwww. I'm running a 3GHz machine with 1GB RAM, dual 80GB HDDs and a fast graphics card with 128MB onboard. The \\"lite\\" versions of the ArcSoft and Sonic software that came with my HP DVD burner work much faster. I wish I'd just stuck with the free stuff that came with the burner. I'd have saved lots of time and aggravation.Oh, and PC Magazine has just given Nero 6 Ultra Edition All-in-One Digital Media Solution its Editor's Choice Award over Roxio. Napster has just bought Roxio's Creator suite so it's anybody's guess if the problems will remain.

Also, the graphics were not very big, so you could lose yourself in a drawing.I found the chapter and subheadings easy to misconstrue.

IMHO these three books, and numbers 7 and 9 previously published by Dell, should be required reading for anyone who enjoyed what is perhaps the best science-fiction TV series ever made in America. This title was not without some misgivings, however. For about the first half of the book, it seemed to read more like a novelization as opposed to a \\"proper\\" novel, and the humorous lines spoken by David Sheridan seemed incredibly out-of-place. However, once the momentum starts, about 2/3 of the way in, it simply does not let go, and one is left with an urge to know just what happens next, and it in no way disappoints.

I often read this genre of book as a relaxing \\"intermezzo\\" to work, other more demanding reading or just to learn someone else's way of looking at the world, but this one didn't do it for me, as they say.

Then I decided to make one of the quilts - Drunkard's Path - knowing it was one of the more difficult patterns. However, being an experienced quilter, I thought I was up to the task. Well, the directions from beginning to end were not only poorly explained but in several instances incorrect. Some of the fabric measurements were so off that even though I had purchased extra amounts, I had to go back and buy additional fabric.

For instance, the bias binding technique is limited to one sentence, whereas in Marsha McCloskey's Quick Classic Quilts, a whole page (with 5 pictures!) is dedicated to the technique.

While I can understand how to some people, this film may have lacked some background information, to me, it was just perfect. The subject is not uncommon, the characters only wanted a better life, and as someone mentioned, they did not care about politics and money, as most people don't, contrary to popular believes. The movie concentrated on the journey and nothing else. I loved every minute of the movie no matter how uncomfortable it was. I was touched by the humanity of the people and I am grateful that the director didn't squeeze any emotionally charged moment, because simply put, I would have bawled. I am not sure I care about the presentation of the movie as much as I care about the point it drove home and this was far more superior to anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same quality and handling you expect from Wiss","review":"I was a bit apprehensive when I when I read in a earlier review that this pair of Wiss 20N shears had changed...

It is a throwback to a rigid conception of reality as having only one meaning, only one mode of expression (and if your mode does not conform to mine, beware). Not only is the style of writing pretentious in the extreme, the student example which is cited throughout the book contains a huge, really huge, compositional mistake, which makes me wonder just how much classical rhetoric depends on a priori bias. The book is impossible to teach because it assumes that students already have in mind the basics of writing as process, an odd assumption since neither ISI nor the school from which this author comes values anything as modern as process. It sounds too much like progress.

The book has a lot of good facts that most people do not know and also information for further reading. Its you who has to take care of your animal companions welfare. Yes majority of vets love animals otherwise they would not be in the business. The key word is business they get more money when an animal is vaccination frequently. Vaccinations should be kept to a minimum and if a animal is getting more then one vaccination it should only be 2 at one time and then wait awhile for the others (least 6 weeks) There are many people who have started to go vaccination free and their dogs are perfectly fine and healthy. The book also shows that there is no evidence that frequent/yearly vaccination keeps an animal healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad - shouldn't be called a \\"guide\\"","review":"This book is not a guide as it doesn't guide you to answer the obvious question \\"if you don't vaccinate, what DO you do??\\" It discusses all the bad things vaccines do, but gives no solution for protecting your dog against the deadly Distemoer, Parvo and Rabies.

It took a lot of spraying and wiping but always left a film. I tried just using the cloth alone and it worked better but still left a film and one or two smears.

The product very gently breaks up the dirt and grime on your glasses, LCD screens, etc. When you rub off the product with the included cleaning cloth, you get a spotless, streak free surface. The cleaner doesn't contain any harsh chemicals, which means special coatings like anti-glare glasses are not harmed in the cleaning process.

There are no ingredients on the Purosol bottle, so it may just be water, I don't know. It works about as well as just water in that it does not remove the oil that gets on your glasses from you face or fingers.

This is the ONLY eyeglass cleaner I now use. Just ordered another bottle. First order was in Aug 2010. Use it every day. My glasses cost $900. To me, it's worth the money to spend on this fabulous product. Only one application per cleaning. If you touch your glasses often, like I do, then they need to be cleaned more often. But one application does it. No scratching. No fumes. No cloudiness. No film. Trust this product. Glasses are expensive. Don't use a cheap product on your expensive eyeglasses. I did a long time ago.

I write not as one who is musically trained, but just one who knows when he hears something that is absolutely excellent. One can discern in these pieces the development of Church music throughout the ages, the distinctive influence of the Baroque period, and the strong Latin American flavor derived from the Spanish and native cultures. It is simply uplifting, and we don't tire of listening to it again and again. I would not have known about this recording, or even Ex Cathedra, had I not heard the first track, \\"Hanaq pachap kusikuynin\\" on London's Classic FM station on the internet. I am surprised that this work is not yet more popular in here in the States. Certainly it deserves to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"* * * * * * 6 stars out of a possible 5","review":"This record was my first taste of the Renaissance and Baroque music from Latin America. The dates of the pieces range from roughly 1500 to 1750.The range of styles is quite broad - from pieces that sound very close to the masterpieces from Europe during those time periods, to pieces that have a very strong influence of native music.The pieces with a relatively 'traditional' sound include, e.g., the Masses by Padilla and Zipoli.In my feelings, the one thing that characterizes this music is a sense of the spirit dancing.Note as an obvious example tr. 6: Araujo's \\"Los Coflades de la Estleya\\" - but that sense of ecstatic dancing also comes through in the other pieces.The performances by Ex Cathedra are close to perfection.I also highly recommend Ex Cathedra's companion album \\"Moon, Sun & All Things\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"jacket review","review":"I am very disapointed with this jacket - it was a bit pricey and you'd think that would coincide with good quality - it does not.

What is more amazing is the fact that many of Mr. Friedman's other recommendations have not been realized. Mr. Friedman makes the best case I've seen so far for school vouchers.

Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did.\\"If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you.

The classic theme of get the government off our backs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freedom","review":"I read this book twice in a week (its not that long, but requires some thought, and concentration). How one can possibly argue with the points Friedman makes is beyond me. Individual chapters address specific issues (suh as foreign trade, fiscal and monetary policy, and education) and he uses logic and simple math to \\"prove\\" his illustrations. The idea is that people certainly would chose freedom over slavery (socialism), and that any unnecessary governmental intervention threatens freedom. Political freedom is only attainable through capitalism (leave the markets alone {S=D})."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth about Capitalism and Freedom","review":"30 Years ago, the sophisticated wags of the intelligencia told us Milton was wrong, that he was a guy who just didn't get it. ! Well, so many years later, the reality that capitalism and freedom are inextricably linked is the overriding truth of our times. Milton has triumphed. This great book is another brick in the wall of the Friedman legacy. While years ago no one might want to admit that Milton was right, today legions of people see the light. One of Milton's disciples, David Henderson, has just written a book that Friedman enthusiasts, like myself, may also enjoy: The Joy of Freedom: An Economist's Odyssey. A nice bookend to this new Friedman book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good defense of the free market","review":"This book quite concisely demonstrates Milton Friedman's gift as an economist. It, however, also depicts his inferiority to Hazlitt in terms of writing ability. While many of his essays and points are very interesting and precise, the book is VERY dry. One should not let the small size fool them when purchasing this book, it takes quite a commitment and interest in the subject to make it through the book. That said, Friedman elucidates just what capitalism is and should be. He does believe in some government, however, he argues (and quite successfully) that it should be as limited and nonactivist as possible. I certainly recommend this for anyone interested in just why Milton Friedman (and other laissez-faire capitalists) thinks the way he does. Henry Hazlitt's, \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" is a less difficult read and is also better constructed. I would recommend that as prerequisite for tackling this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This guy is the best. He really has a handle on the idea of limited government.

Mr. Friedman is one of the greatest economists, and certainly the pre-eminent living one. However, Mr. Friedman does have an agenda, and the economic theories he advocates most strongly are not houses built upon rock. In particular, they do not consistently agree with Keynesian theory. Keynes wasn't always right, but he did have an astonishing amount of predictive ability. The test of time weighs strongly in favor of Keynes and against Friedman. By all means read what he has to say, but please remember that his theories describe a special economic situation that is rather rare. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating","review":"It is ironic that the book (an attempt into political theory by a leading economist) has given me some of the answers that I could not find in any Economics textbook. However, one warning: the book, outstanding when it deals with economic issues (International Financial Agreements, Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy) is weaker in the more \\"political\\" chapters. Mr. Friedman justifies public financiation of schooling in terms of neighborhood effects: society as a whole benefits of my going to school, therefore, it should pay for it through taxes. This is of course just an economist's approach to the matter.I suspect the valid justification is more one of priciple: if one of the main sources of inequality is different education (and therefore, ASPIRATIONS), then let's try to promote at least equal opportunities by granting access to school for everybody. For a broader perspective of these subjects, I suggest Ludwig Von Mises' \\"Liberalism,the classical tradition\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant writing from Friedman","review":"This book really needs no introduction.

It helped shape my views - I am a fan of freedom and today's liberals are (ironically) driving us further and further into slavery. In Capitalism & Freedom, Friedman clearly articulates the basic principles of freedom from an economic view. He's not so much concerned about free speech as he is economic freedom such as property rights and the right to keep what you earn. He proceeds to discuss many of today's social programs (public housing, Social Security, corporate, farm and other forms of welfare) and how they all diminish our freedom. Redistribution policies are discussed as a failed philosophy and practice.Liberals will hate this book because he tears their sacred cows to pieces and exposes them, as Teddy Roosevelt said, \\"well-intentioned but weak-minded.\\" This book is as pertinent today as it was when written."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great books of our time","review":"You have to read this book of you want to live in modern America...

My water is at 120 in my water heater and I don't dry dishes in the dishwasher, so I don't know why they would do this. Several of my plates and a couple saucers have done that. I wish Corelle would go back to making the cups in the same material as the rest of the dishes.

What looks dark grey in the photo is really a lighter shade of brown, however. That was a bit disappointing, but the colorset is generally very neutral so it will not clash.Corelle plates are the best... lightweight and break resistant. Again, I have not used this set yet, but I expect them to be just as good as my mom's old Corelle set, but without the flower prints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color not as pictured","review":"Color of the dishes in the picture looks to be black and a bit of light brown. however, the color is actually dark brown, light brown and a greenish color.

This DVD contains information that went way beyond my yoga teacher training, which was heavily steeped in interesting Tantric philosophy. Paul's manner is straightforward & exceptionally clear, so anyone can understand the important aspects of chakras-- what they are, what they influence, & how we can work with them. He explains things in a scientific manner, by which I mean there isn't any froo-froo on top of what he shares here, making this information even more accessible to all kinds of people. I love that he makes a point of being so inclusive, pointing out that this information can work for people of many different religious backgrounds.I believe that anyone interested in spiritual disciplines will greatly benefit from this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done, Paul Grilley","review":"I was curious as to how Paul Grilley would handle this subject, wondering if it would be as matter of fact as his others. It is well done, and he does use the familiar, down-to-earth, matter of fact manner. Very nicely done.As he works through the theory it got more difficult for me, so I watched it by sub-section at a time. That worked like a charm, and the information 'stuck' with me. It's a great introduction to Chakra Theory and Meditation indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I just received today and have watched the entire DVD!

I will not buy any more in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babylon5 Casting Shadows-The Passing of the Technomages","review":"The author has turned some of the most intriguing characters in the B5 universe into 2nd rate David Copperfields--illusionists with little power other than being very good at maintaining probes everywhere. Despite stating several times they are a power that could stand up to the Shadows, they seem ridiculously easy to destroy. Galen has his spell of destruction, but he seems incompetent in every other type of spell to make up for it. Speaking of Galen, except for his love of Isabell, his character is nothing like that shown on Crusade.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, but very worthwhile for Babylon 5 and Crusade fans","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two Babylon 5 trilogies, however this book was the hardest for me to get through. I found the first 3/4 of the book very boring. I thought the story got too detailed into the nature of the technomage's power. It spent so much time talking about how Galen came up with equation after equation for his spells, I felt like I was in math class. However, I am very glad that I read the book. If you are a fan of Babylon 5 and/or Crusade, and you want to know everything there is to know about the Babylon 5 universe, then you need to read this book. All of the B5 trilogies fill in some gaps of peripheral stories that were hinted at in the show's episodes. This book really let's you get inside of one of my favorite characters, Galen. The end of the book was very moving, also."},{"rating":"1","title":"eeeehhhhh","review":"While the way the technomages are shown combining guile with technology to was very interesting and almost made the books worth reading, the characters where every terrible marry sue cliche rolled together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Confused for My Taste","review":"The book has its' interesting moments. A man who cannot die should be interesting. However, for us left brain people, the were just too many loose ends and unresolved issues. Also, the characters are without exception unlikable. I am not sure I can ever read anything Jung has written again without being prejudiced. If Pilgrim had lived forever, why was he always someone famous in the past and not so famous now. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful and Pompous","review":"I did not enjoy this book. It was painfully disjointed and not in a way that is simply hard to follow for those not familiar with challanging fiction, but instead, in a way that strives for intelligence but ends up with ridiculous babble. It also doesn't help that you never care about any of the characters becuase none of them are entirely likeable or fully explored. Pilgrim an entity of flesh and blood who has lived for an eternity and cannot die, intersting premise but it is never made interesting because it is like a foot note, like the rest of the characters. This is a mildly entertaining read at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Halfway","review":"When I picked up the book and read the jacket, I was all excited to read it. It looked right up my alley; a psychiatrist with a patient that seemed to live many past lives. On top of it all, the psychiatrist was supposed to be Carl Jung, a major pioneer in the field. The problem for me occured almost immediately from the first page. The story seemed to be written in a \\"painfully\\" boring manner. The Pilgrim, a man who cannot die, has just survived hanging himself. He doesn't talk. Carl Jung is assigned his case and tries to draw him out. Sounds exciting? It should have been but I just could not get into it. I think it was just the author's style of writing.I tried over and over to finish this book but I never could go more than halfway. And I am usually the type of person that must finish a book no matter what. I see most of the reviews here were pretty good so it may just be a case of the writers particular style and my brain being incompatible."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the whole, a dissapointment","review":"To begin with, a very nice premise. But Findley just doesn't deliver. It's not that I need every question answered after all life's not like that, no reason literature should be.

You've got an interesting idea now just tell the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Beautifully written and richly imagined, this is a fascinating novel that challenges historical reality and presents psychology and philosophy in a unique way.

It is a wonderful guide to everyday useful vocabulary, organized by common situations that require conversation.

Love her cat character, finally figured out who she had named him after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another delicious little mystery!","review":"This is the third in the Hannah Swenson series, and the books remain entertaining. This one is set around the first ever Lake Eden Winter Carnival. As usual Hannah is busy making cookies for events all over town, but this time she's doing it away from The Cookie Jar. Her shop has been closed to her because a murder had been committed in her kitchen. Hannah wants to get back to work in her own shop, so she and her very likeable sister Andrea are on the trail of another killer. There is no shortage of suspects since the murder victim was a very unlikeable, imperious and demanding woman. These mysteries, though cozy, are not that easy to figure out, and the characters are wonderful. This is a great cozy series, and I can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"I thought this series might start to get a bit stale after reading the first two books, but I enjoyed this third Hannah Swensen cozy mystery as much as the first!The book is light reading, of course, but enjoyable and well-written. Hannah Swensen is an engaging main character. The other characters are realistic/believeable, and the dialogue and plot points are not forced.I am enjoying this series.

Not too heavy, but not sicky sweet. Some thinking is involved in trying to figure out, \\"Who Done It\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannah Like Coffee!","review":"Did you know that? It must be important, because Ms. Fluke mentions it about 8 times in every one of these books. Anyway, this is another preposterous, cliche-ridden \\"mystery\\" that relies heavily on coincidence after coincidence. There are so many characters...Paul, Bill, Mike, Isobel, Andrea, Janie, Alex, Sally, Luanne, Norman, Delores, Greg, Tracey, Lisa, Lisa's father, etc. etc...that I found it difficult to keep track of all of them. The author has a habit of starting a subplot and then never going back to it. Like Norman and Hannah designing a dream house for a contest. It's mentioned once or twice and then is swallowed up in an endless, painfully predictable web of cookies, murder, cookies, romance, cookies, murder, cookies. Oh and plucky Hanna solves the case. Bottom line: I knew the murderer after the first chapter. And you will too. So another Mystery Fail for Ms. Fluke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable Book","review":"I love this series. This was a wonderful 3rd addition to the series. It is just so cozy and sweet that they are hard to put down. I love to read them while working out on the elliptical or the bike because they fully sweep you away that my 45 minutes of cardio seems to vanish. I can't wait to get started on the 4th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spend the Weekend at the Winter Carnival","review":"Winter carnival time in Lake Eden, Minnesota is the perfect setting for the third book in this series. These books are a quick and easy read that offer a good mystery, fantastic setting and charming main characters. It's always fun to jump into any season with Hannah and her family and friends. When I read these books I feel like I'm spending the weekend in Lake Eden. In this book Hannah gets more involved with Mike, the local policeman while still keeping her love interest with the local dentist, Norman. The mystery is set around \\"Cooking Sweetheart\\", Connie Mac who is bossy and ill-tempered. The mystery moves right along with a few twists and turns. Of course the blueberry recipes looked inviting. I have yet to try the blueberry muffin recipe but it's on my list of to-dos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and Boring Murder Mystery","review":"I found it to be boring and totally unrealistic for a cookie baker turn dectective.

Don't waste your money !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written","review":"I like the occasional murder mystery and I always have one or two books going at any one time, so I do read. I couldn't even finish this book. The characters weren't appealing and visualizations for both people and place were lacking. It's really cold there, ok, but how cold? There was no sense of history for the recreated home of the town's first mayor- yep, it's nice and it's got a lot of old stuff. There was no sense of time- one minute it's the wee hours of the morning, and the next thing you know the mid day tour had begun. I couldn't even get a good handle on how old our heroine is (roughly speaking).Throwing in a couple of recipes didn't make up for the general lack of writing skill. Sorry, but it's a 2 star book all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blueberries","review":"This series just keep getting better and better and I like seeing more of the underlining characters coming more into play. This book had everything from ghosts to secrets and much more.

Her investigative technique is straightforward and not very imaginative, but the delicious recipes and the warm personal interplay make it for a satisfying and occasionally funny read. One or two of the supporting characters are interesting, but most others are rather flat plot devices, including the victim.The book does not demand much exertion from the reader, and neither strives for nor achieves a deep emotional engagement, but it works admirably as a cosy diversion."},{"rating":"2","title":"first last amanda exposure","review":"this is the three song demo from Last AmAndA and it was my first exposure to the band I now list as my favorite.

A map showing where the species can be seen within the area covered by the field guide accompanies every description.In some cases, the drawings of the birds are more accurate than that of the more comprehensive field guides.This is my favorite of the Lone Pine field guides because in the description it also includes best sites to see the species.

It's hard to believe it's only 12 watts, because it seems much hotter than that. It heats up very very quickly and does the job very very well. The pencil tip is not perfect like my other one, but I think that is because a pencil point can break very easily. They made it very close to the end, just the perfect amount that it gives a very nice pinpoint without much worry about breaking off. If you solder little amps or dacs and need something for those very small and tight to reach spaces, get this thing and you will not regret it one second. The best thing about it is that the whole end point heats the solder, not just one side like my other cheap ones did.

The Drug Information Handbook gives some of the best summaries of indications, adverse reactions, drug interactions, available dosage forms, and dosing information for health care professsionals--far superior to the information in the more commonly used PDR.

In this case, guy owns a record shop, rightfully loses girl because he is a self-professed jerk, and his ex continues to talk to him, mainly because he is John Cusack. Generally, John Cusack films are amongst the most entertaining movies out there, but this film makes me wish Cusack had the genetic ability of Ralph Macchio to always be that High School Guy. The best thing about this film is Cusack's brief dalliance with Lisa Bonet. Too bad Dr. Huxtable wasn't around to save the rest of the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was meant to be set in the UK anyway","review":"I couldn't see the point of this movie.

High Fidelity is about an underachieving, self pitying, sarcastic record store owner (played by Cusack) who just broke up with a long time girlfriend. Cusack's character then spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out what went wrong. Cusack gives an ok performance primarily because he has played the same character in at least 4 other movies. The rest of the cast is quite forgettable including the irritating Jack Black and the usually funny Tim Robbins. The plot is very thin and the script is just not funny (yes I did understand the \\"humour\\" in the musical references). Even the soundtrack is a letdown in this film. High Fidelity is a bad romantic comedy which lacks romance and humor. Actually the only thing missing from this bad romantic comedy is Meg Ryan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is much better","review":"Yes, I loved the book, humor was deeply embedded on its text. but I fail to match the Rob Gordon, the main character, with John Cusack's performance.

It's not perfect; I agree that sometimes the top-five bit gets a little tiresome, but the ending was for me so moving and exhilirating - the song he chooses to conclude the story is so perfect on so many levels it vaults the entire film into my top 10 all-time favorites (along with \\"The Player\\", \\"Godfather's I and II\\", \\"Falcon and the Snowman\\", \\"The Graduate\\", \\"Dr. Strangelove\\", and a few others I'll have to get back to you on).It's also a subtly inspiring tale of how a consumer can become a producer.

Two anthological passages - dreaming of his ex making love to the new guy and options to what to do when he enters your vinil store. Nice love story, even if you better be in the mood to appreciate it. The DVD - good image, good sound. Widescreen. Has many point of views by John Cussack and the director. These extras have a minor flaw. Since they are short, they could have an option to be played all at once. Anyway, valuable. A nice piece of entertainment that sometimes you'll take a look at again.

His character is a self-indulgent, whiny jerk who spends the first hour of the movie talking to the screen about all of his past relationships while going through a breakup that isn't a breakup. I really couldn't relate at all to the character. He's just horrible. He sleeps with everyone and then whines about the various flaws of each of his former lovers. I just don't get the movie. It bored and irritated me. It's slow paced, full of immaturity and shallow people (not just Cusack's character) and just plain silly.

I have never before actually heard an actor mention Sigue-Sigue Sputnik or Massive Attack on screen, and it was shockingly nostalgic and funny. Plus the comparison of Echo and the Bunnymen to The Jesus and Mary Chain......Anyhow, even beyond the references that occur at Dennis Miller speed, the performances are funny as well. The two misfit clerks are just about perfect, as well as polar opposites that play off each other.the only reason for a four rather than a five is that the book my Nick Hornby is one of my favorites. Althought the movie is reasonably true to the book, the location in Chicago instead or London takes a small piece away from the flow of the story. For some reason it seemed more believable in London. Regardless, this movie is still miles ahead of most of the schlock released in theaters in the last year or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Cusak: today's Jack Lemmon","review":"John Cusak is one of those actors (along with Jeff Bridges) who never lets a bad script get in the way of providing an inisightful performance.

Including probably one of John Cusack's best performances to date.

Yes, that may be an argument for the CD but in this movie it's integral to the fabric of the whole film.In short:Totally worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality","review":"Audiophile Rob Gordon (John Cusack) runs his record store, pines over his latest failed relationship, and looks for the next. That's about it. No high concept plot here. Just a very insightful film about smart people living a little off the mainstream and trying to make it work. I would like to live in the same neighborhood with these characters and hang out with them, which is just about the highest praise I can think to give. The whole cast is outstanding, but Jack Black and Todd Louiso stand out as Rob's employees, who were hired to work part-time but have made the record store the center of their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Angst filled, very identifiable rage, wonderful soundtrack.

They are a passionate breed who argue any detail to death. That kind of passion is healthy and is a springboard for creativity.Rob loves music so much he regularly makes mix tapes and top five lists. On the neurotic list he rates just below Woody Allen. To me, this movie plays like a journal of my life. Girls are an ambigious but ultimately rewarding part of my life, just like in Rob Gordon's. The writer avoids the pretentious nature of emo music and instead makes an earnest and endearing movie. Who doesn't love John Cusack? Or Jack Black...\\"Dude, that is perverse, you don't own Blonde on Blonde! It's gonna be alright.\\"If you dig bands like the Smiths, R.E.M., or The Replacements...get this movie.

This film had me laughing about all that was wrong with relationships...well, at that time. John Cusack in all his unsophisticatedness made me fall in love with him myself. Combine that with the amazing music and those beautiful sets! (I loved his place and the store!) And you have an extremely good film that takes very little thinking about right there and then.

John Cusak plays a completely self-centered jerk who wonders why all his girlfriends keep leaving him. It's painful to watch, and not funny. Sorry folks, but self-pity is not entertaining, and this movie consists of John Cusak's character feeling sorry for himself and whining into the camera. The whole movie is a rip-off of the Woody Allen movies of yesteryears, such as Annie Hall. There's the main character breaking the action to direct address the camera, and there's the hapless nerd who can't keep his girlfriend.

The main character made me sick, he is such a whiny, self- absorbed loser. The only times he takes a break from the whininess, he switches to being aggressive and immature. Especially when he learns that his ex-girlfriend makes love to her new boyfriend, then he completely freaks out and thinks it's so unfair. It's okay for him though to have slept with somebody else while they were together?! What a pathetic, two-faced jerk.Oh yes, and then there's his little posse of loser friends with whom he owns a record store. Delightful and pretty (NOT!) creatures, who think they know everything there is to know about music even though they know only about a few music styles that they deem the greatest and can't even play an instrument or something. What they can do, though, is scream at customers who dare to have their own, different musical taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inteligent, funny and moving.","review":"This is my favourite movie of year 2000.

The shallow characters in \\"High Fidelity\\" consist of the second group of people.I saw this movie when it was originally released, and it was excruciating to sit through for the most part. Thinking about even trying to sit through it again is painful.We get it, Jack Black, you're obnoxious. Now go away.John Cusack is usually great in everything he does, but his character in \\"High Fidelity\\" is just a totally unlikeable and uninteresting person. The fact that he is unlikeable is established within the first few scenes - so that means you're stuck for an hour and a half watching someone who is unlikeable and not interesting. Sounds like a recipe for a good time, right?Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've seen","review":"Ok, now if you liked \\"Dumb and Dumber\\", take this review with a grain of salt.

His two annoying record store buddies were obnoxious at best, nowhere near the \\"hilariously funny\\" characters I was promised. I was truly unable to finish this movie. It was painfully slow, pointless, and just plain dull. I personally am a fan of John Cusack. For example I thought his work in \\"The Thin Red Line\\", while a small part, was exellent.

Give this one a BIG pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Okay, I'll admit it. I rented this because Bruce Springsteen is in it. The critics in general enjoyed it and I assumed it would be great. Er....I was wrong....It's not that it's a poorly made film...it's a great concept, and VERY well acted. But the problem is that the characters are such losers that you really don't care what happens to them or how their story will turn out. It's unfortunate, but this movie was a total dud for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"Is there ANYBODY out there who agrees that Jack Black's performance was NOT \\"scene stealing\\" and \\"hilarious?\\" Does anyone agree that in a cast of annoying characters that he was the most grating of them all?Anyone?Please...Somebody..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Cusack but Almost Walked out of Theater","review":"One word: UGH.My husband and I really like John Cusack (16 Candles, The Grifters, even that wierd western he made), and we're both into alternative music, but we both hated this movie. We liked ONE character, the annoying record shop worker, and despised the rest. They had no redeeming qualities, weren't likeable in the least. I couldn't understand why any of them liked each other.I wanted to slap Cusack in the chin to get him to close his mouth. Mouth-breathers-as-heros just ain't my thing. The main conflict was WHEN WILL HE STOP WHINING?I guess I just don't understand. I just didn't find it funny at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have stuck to pointe blank","review":"After a beautiful come back with Grosse Pointe Blank...to the comedic medium, Cusack flubs it in this horrific movie.He loses all remnants of the nice guy image and the actress who plays his girlfriend is just awful.Distracted by her awful haircut the most interesting charactersin the whole film were his music shop employees.Here is a clue, Cusack, you are a product of the 80's. I first saw you in Sixteen Candles. Don't even try to go grunge it ruins it for me...Stick to what you know...let's hope we see better of you in \\"Serendipity\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Grown-up Ferris Bueller","review":"If you haven't seen this, don't bother. I expected more, since it is John Cusack, whom I like, but I found it pretty much an adult Ferris Bueller, which doesn't work well. Expecting a comedy - maybe that was my mistake - I was very let down. The 30-something male narrating the story of his failed love life made me wonder if Hollywood is really that hard up for movie ideas. Maybe it was done better in book form, as most are. Most of the music I'd never heard of (seems to be the sub-culture of American pop) and the \\"story line\\" was uninteresting psycho-babble. It Definitely wasn't worth the $3 and 2 1/2 hours of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, My Wife Understands Me!","review":"My wife actually watched this before I did and she said she could finally understand why I was so obsessed with music. Of course, I then had to immediately watch it and she was dead on the money!! Such a witty script and winning performances make this the pinnacle of John Cusack's career (which is really saying something). Along with \\"Almost Famous,\\" this movie does the best job of showing exactly how POWERFUL music can be in someone's life, especially for a geek like me. Who else but seriously depraved people make Top 5 lists?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is Better","review":"And I really like John Cusack.Movie is definitely worth watching, but I had very high hopes and they were not quite met. Watch the movie, enjoy the book and check out Grosse Pointe Blank! Great soundtrack on that movie as well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too close to the book","review":"I was disappointed by the film's inability to 'open out' the book. This isn't the fault of the cast - they pretty much all turn in likeable performances (although Joan Cusack if miscast), but way too much of the film is Cusack talking to camera, and almost all the dialog is lifted straight out of the book. What deviations there are (skateboarding kids who turn out to be talented artistes) are jarring and out of key with the rest of the film. If you've read the book within the past six months I'd suggest you wait awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie - Horrible DVD - reject the forced trailors!","review":"This is a great movie, one of my personal favorites. I will not be buying on DVD however, because while it may boast bonus features and nice video/sound, it's not worth having to sit through eight minutes of trailors when you put in the disc -which, unlike a VHS, you can't skip over or fast forward. This is a horrible ploy that consumer's can't just accept. Return your DVD's if they feature this kind of forced advertising, and they'll get the picture. Your paying a lot of money for these things - the day they start handing out DVD's for free, I won't mind.The movie itself is wonderfully written and the acting is great. I will be enjoying this for years to come - on VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another whiney Cusack movie","review":"What to say about this film? Well, Cusack has definitely done better. The most interesting characters in the movie are Barry and Dick (Jack Black and Tom Louiso). It would be a much better movie if they were incorporated more into the story rather than appearing here and there when the story gets a bit slow. Unfortunately, the little they do appear doesn't make the film any better.If you want to see a movie about a guy who runs a record store and don't want to deal with depression, check out Empire Records."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time...","review":"I watched it because of John Cusack... that's all... and what a waste of time it was watching him play some pathetic immature idealistic loser... Then there's the stupid way his character handles relationships - do guys like that really attract that many girls in real life? The fat guy was funny in the beginning, but it gets tiring after a while trying to listen to all his snobbish opinions about music... The novel is much better than the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercials Spoil The DVD","review":"Nice movie but there are over 5 minutes of commercials at the beginning which had to be watched. It was impossible to skip them or fast forward past them. If you want the movie, get the VHS tape. I don't plan on buying any more Touchtone DVD's because I hate these commericials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless stupid movie","review":"This is easily the worst movie in recent years, aside from the dreadful 'Memento'. Let's get one thing straight here - John Cusack is not funny, and never has been. Over 2 hours of pointless story telling here. It's no wonder Cusack funded the film himself - everbody else could see what a silly storyline it was. The DVD contains deleted scenes. However, all of the movie should be deleted. Life is too short for poor quality films like this. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.O.S. Read the book.","review":"What an offense to frontal lobes everywhere. The book was a riot, the characters were engaging AND REAL, not like these nihilist puppets. A waste of every actor in the film (all of whose work I have enjoyed elsewhere but each of whom owes me a handwritten letter of apology for this one). Mr. Springsteen, how could you have given 30 seconds of your valuable time to this pile of festering refuse? I wish Amazon allowed no-star reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't have much to say about this movie...","review":"...other than that I didn't like it much. Supposed to be a movie for the boys, about a frustrated music-lover that \\"any guy can relate or identify himself to!\\" -well, I didn't. The acting (John Cusack), he certainly is not the problem -he delievers with style what he has got to work with, but the story is a shallow mess! This guy whose girlfriend has broke up with him, and suddenly he starts to ask the main question in life -who is he? And as an idea to find out where he goes wrong time after time he asks all his past-girlfriends out on dates. This may sound hysterical-funny, but it's simply (in my opinion) so \\"unbeliavable\\" and too much! I couldn't relate to this \\"losers'\\" way of thinking or anything else in \\"High Fidelity\\". \\"About a boy\\" starring Hugh Grant (ever so different, but...) is a far better way of describe the \\"modern\\" man. This movie, I've seen it twice to see if it would change my opinion, is SO overrated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Fidelity","review":"Frears's surprisingly insightful film, adapted from the Nick Hornby novel, examines the comic romantic entanglements of a lovable music-store geek. His record stacks and Top Five lists may be in perfect order, but his love life is a shambles, and Cusack plays the part with shaggy-dog affection. Aside from solid direction and a great soundtrack, the other selling point here is the supporting cast, in particular Jack Black as a crass, super-snobby record nerd and Robbins as a New Age devotee. High Fidelity hits a steady, heartfelt groove that will keep you in stitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT COMEDY WITH A GREAT CAST!","review":"Watching this film again now for the first time since it's released, I found this movie better than ever! The cast especially Cusack and Black are at the top of their game in this smart and relevant love story. Backed by a killer soundtrack this film is heads and shoulders above most romantic comedies. There are many dramas that with they rang as true as this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Cusack at his best.","review":"If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, I highly recommend this one. John Cusack is fantastic as the underachiever who would go far in life if he would just figure out how to apply his penchant for top five lists to improving his dismal outlook on life. The supporting cast is A-list, but Cusack carries the movie.The film's best achievement is that it teaches lessons on life without taking itself seriously. Both male and female Gen-xr's can identify with Rob Gordon and find themselves silently encouraging him as he tries to figure it all out.This movie may not make the all-time top five best sellers list, but it's on my list for top ten of 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Only Rock and Roll","review":"A story about the life and times of music fanatics in Chicago. John Cusack plays a record store owner, who is going through some life changing experiences. He tries to keep himself protected by his record collection, however the relationships in his life are making him do some serious thinking.Cusack gives a wonderful performance in this film. However, Jack Black is absolutely amazing as one of the record shop employees who lives and breathes music. The scenes in the record store between Cusack and his employees are amazingly well acted and realistic.Everyone knows someone completely obsessed with music, like the characters are in this film. This is definately a film to see if you are a music fan or a musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cusack Doing What He Does Best!","review":"Cusack seems to fit these roles. The dark, lovelost, sarcastic self abuser who, though seemingly utterly disfuctional, actually taps into the heart of \\"normal\\". Especially when dealing with issues of growing up and relationships. In this way, High Fidelity could in fact be the continuing story of Better Off Dead. Or any number of other Cusack greats. The other factors that make this a stand out are the references to bands and music you thought only you still held onto. Especially when his 2 employees get into the nitpicking realm of conosieurrism (sp?) of music collecting. Top 5 reasons to by this movie, 5-Musical memories 4-The break-up stories 3-The heckle and jeckle dialogue of the employees 2- great script 1- John Cusack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An fun comedy about music and life.","review":"Last year, John Cusack gives two great film of 1999, the underrated Pushing Tim and Comic fastasy masterpiece:Being John Malkovich.

Then he talks about his best top five ex-girlfriens of his lifetime and the music, he\`s loves best. Then he found out that his ex, she going out with an bizarre man(Played by Tim Robbins)and Rob, will do anything to get his ex, back in his life. Great direction by Frears(The Commitments). Also Cusack co-wrote the script with three another writers. An underrated gem.DVD\`s Picture Quality with an anamorphic Widescreen(1.85:1) transer is great with an fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

They were very disappointed to find that the camera blacked out and quit working altogether after a couple of pictures each.

It's possible to create a system with rigid rules, but still doesn't provide any insight into what the market will do next.2. You can fill 193 pages with absolutely nothing.3. You can charge outrageous sums of money for something, if you print it on shiny paper, wrap it in leather binding, and hype it heavily.4.

But 'That Hurt Thing' is pretty good, don't get me wrong. It scared the heck out of me -- I'll never relax in a funeral home again. That slutty Lyra character is ohhhh...so interesting, and Gerald Ford's crossdressing made me laugh out loud more than once. How Nick got caught up in these types of people is strange, considering all he wants to do is make Chloe realize that he's a good man for her. I won't give away the ending, but you won't see it coming. Just when I believed I had it all together, I found out I'd been tricked the whole way through. Gutsy move!

Julia's family was well to do, and Julia's culture and education are clear as she describes daily events, feelings, family, and friends. Historically, I found the names of many relatives, and names of others in the area who also figure into the family tree. Her attitudes, feelings, and remarkable spirit are evident in her writings of this time period. Julia died at age eighteen, in 1803, possibly of tuberculosis, while engaged to a son of the past Governor of Connecticut.These diaries were passed down to Julia's great nephew, William Sheffield Cowles, and his wife, Anna Roosevelt (sister of Teddy, the President), arranged to have the diaries published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing and stylish","review":"This single have many mixes of the \\"Farewell to the moon.\\" My favorite mix would be the club mix edit.

Set in turn of the century France, Satie is forced to wait out a tremendous rain storm in a local pub. The fellow patrons are all Cirque performers, who interpret his music and writings (it is narrated via use of his memoirs) through their performances.

But the real kudos go to Peter Cook, the mod devil-may-care chap who supplies to LH all the pertinent spy goings-on with a mordant, off-color humorous style.

Although it is pretty short @ about 6 hours or so, you'll have a blast the entier time. The beauty is in the simplicity of the gameplay. You, as Samus Aran, run around an alien world trying to eradicate the threat of Space Pirates, here how you do it:A. Shoot baddiesB. Jump. A lot.C. Proceed to next area.There is a heavy emphasis on exploration, in fact you'll be revisiting a lot of the map, as this is a part of the games structure: When there is a seemingly out-of-reach ledge, you'll have to come back once you've discovered how to jump much higher. The Metroid series pioneered this mechanic. Once you've played through, you'll realize that there are many different paths to take, sometimes you'll learn how to reach that too-high ledge without the aid of a boost. The game features multiple endings based on your item collection percentage and overall time to complete.

This book was far from spectacular but also not as bad as many of the reader reviews would have had me believe. The plot itself had definite promise, although some of the potential was left unfulfilled as plot lines were left hanging. Action sequences kept me turning the pages. All things considered, there were enough positives in Shark Mutiny to make me take a chance on some of Robinson's other works. Hopefully some of the shortcomings will be less evident."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the only book on your cell block, read it.","review":"I would have loved this book if it were written by my child, a great book by a 10th grader.

If this is the only book on your cell block, you should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Ending \\"Seals\\" It","review":"Ok, enough already...Mr. Robinson has basically rerun all his previous novels in this one. You have China take over Taiwan with no resolution and not even a peep from the USA; the court martial at the end is interesting but crammed into twenty pages;and the racist slurs against the Chinese get real old. The book starts out well, with the potential of two major plot lines, the blocking of the Straits of Hormuz and the takeover of Taiwan. And does anyone really believe blowing up an electrial generator in Burma is payback for China taking over Taiwan?Time for a new plot-line, and a new enemy. The slurs in this book are as bad as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.......","review":"I had anxiously waited for this book to become available. I looked forward to a great action story with political implications. The first 2/3's of the book met my expectations.The Chinese/Iranian alliance was interesting. A stronger President would have been more work too develop but certainly more enjoyable & realistic. SEALS deserve respect and admiration.What is amazing is that a serious invasion occurs and the reader is left with no resolution save a paragraph or two. The mutiny seems forced into the book.....almost like reading two novels in one. The significant events in this one seemed forced together. I was thoroughly enjoying this book until the mutiny....and the rush to wrap-up the story lines.Will not be as anxious for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Researched, rushed ending....","review":"This was my first Robinson book and might be my last. The fact it was poorly researched greatly detracted from what could have been a compelling story line. For instance, only Congress can award a Medal of Honor, not a commander. And Merseault wines don't come from the Loire Valley, they come from Burgundy (okay, that might be a little picky on my part). It also seems that after the main build up in the book he quickly rushed to wrap it up. Any further character or plot development was dispenced with in the name of brevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Robinson latest book...The Reader's Mutiny","review":"I know the genre is fiction but some fiction has to have at the very least some plausible ideas. This was the second book I've read by the author and by most account it may be my last. The plot was bad, the politcal views were unwelcomed and the author needs to research his information more. He knows nothing of the the US Military whether by AirForce or Army. I don't know what type of information his advisor to his novels is giving but something is amiss here and its obvious in his writings.From the overall concensus his readership isn't happy either hopefully his next novel is planned and researched carefully otherwise he may have readers mutiny on hand to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Techno-thriller Trash","review":"This book is a poor imitation of early Tom Clancy, ala The Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, etc. The plot is ridiculous, and the dialogue and characterization is pretty silly.The author seems to think that the fate of the world depends upon two 12 man SEAL teams, and that the lack of a single carrier battle group would allow the PRC to make a major invasion. He conveniently forgets about the Marines deployed in Okinawa, Army and Air Force in Korea and Japan, other units in CONUS, etc.In his world, all US military policy and strategy is devised and controlled by a cranky National Security Advisor, who is a former Navy Admiral, who likes to yell orders across the office at his secretary/fiance, who won't marry him until he retires.

It's evident Robinson's home in Cape Cod plays a role in his beatification of Chappaquidick Teddy who obviously, among his many fears, hates being in the water. And this is a book about watermen.No, I truly doubt the above-mentioned military men hold Kennedy in the esteem Robinson does. Just the opposite, I'll bet.Once I saw that passage, I threw the book away since it was apparent other passages would lead to further preposterous observations.Mark Berent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Air Force?","review":"The invasion of Taiwan is a hoot. Even if the U.S. Navy was unable to support the island, where is the Air Force? The author goes in to great detail about the beach landings, capture of ports and cities. But, he knows nothing about how the U.S. could / would respond with forces other than the Navy.For example, The US would have the option to outfit B1, B2 and B52 bombers with air to surface Harpoons. One or two good long range raids would have broken the back of the invading navy. Also, where are the US Subs? There would be subs deployed in the area outside of the Carrier battle groups.

Perhaps you could forgive this if the plot and the writing were of a high standard but they aint!I have a real fear that this reads like the first of a two part book, many things are left unresolved (like the Chinese take over of Taiwan) and there may be more to come. There are much better things to read then this, don't waste your money.Personally I think Mr Robinson should change tack and perhaps his passion for the SEALs should be undertaken alone while reading Soldier Of Fortune in the bath and not inflicted on the rest of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Naval \\"technothriller\\" from the knowledge of a grocery night","review":"Tom Clancys books were great because when they did deviate from plot to focus on technical military insights, they were correct, interesting to those in the military as to how detailed his information was, and informative to the general public. This cheap british knock off author held his own in the first two books by writing about britain as much as possible, and probably had some great coauthoring. Since then his plots have devolved, his characters never evolve, and continue to be trite stereotypes of american regions (not all Kansans are ranchers, nor all new englanders lobster fisherman) and also misses the most obvious details of military protocol and technology, the public is best served by treating every detail in his books as fanciful fiction (just like all of those of us serving on submarines know it to be) Hopefully his publisher will stop promoting and printing this trite ... and find a new author to spend their efforts on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"Disappointed Reader's Mutiny\\"","review":"I was quite disappointed with this latest work from Patrick Robinson. I too have read all his previous books, and was anxoius to get The Shark Mutiny. The inexcusable error of having the incorrect address for the White House at the beginning of the book sets the tone for a VERY dull book.I rarely lose interest in a book before I finish reading it, but, I just HAD to put this one down.

The US is pure and wholesome and can do nothing wrong, the nasties are bad, bad, bad and can do nothing right. The actual \\"mutiny\\" of the title is a bizarre appendage at the end of a longish book, and by this time you've lost all interest in both story and characters and are reading out of sheer determination because you paid good money for this garbage and you are desperately trying to get something slightly more closely approaching your money's worth.

Immediately after he moves the White House two blocks, the author has a four-star general involved romantically with an enlisted member of the Navy! Ludicrous.

This book was obviously written either to meet a deadline or for the money alone. The dialogue is stilted and unrealistic. The plot is ill-conceived and awkward, being forced and uneven. In addition, the grammatical errata in this book is far beyond what can be normally expected.This is probably his worst book.

Today's U.S. military also has long-range planes, missiles, fast deploying Army troops, and doesn't take orders from the National Security Advisor.

These characters would have been fragged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worse and worse","review":"I initially enjoyed Robinson's first two books, but ever since HMS Unseen they have gotten steadily worse to the point of rediculousness with The Shark Mutiny. Many other readers have pointed out the glaring flaws with the court martial already, and the ending of this court martial left me feeling like I had just re-read USS Seawolf.Secondly, the manner in which Capt. Cale Dunning acted in \\"deciding\\" the fate of Dan Headley is hardly what one would have expected from him given his own actions in Kilo Class which nearly cost him a court martial himself.Finally, I think Robinson needs to get back to the point of view of Nimitz Class and Kilo Class which were told more from the point of the commanders in action, rather than spending half of Shark Mutiny listening to Adm. Arnie Morgan musing to himself without even speaking to anyone to convey his thoughts.Escapism it may be, but don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third rate novel","review":"From the opening pages where Robinson lionizes one of the most cowardly, immoral men to ever sit in the US Senate to the final pages this is one of the most poorly researched and written books I have ever read.

It covers all of the history of the band, from when they played the Whiskey in San Francisco to the release of the Black Album. It also covers the tours Metallica has appeared on or headlined.

It will dig out any size nail even if it is sunk below the wood. Does a little bit of damage to the wood. Down sid is that it is easy to damage plywood. One tip: If there is room, slide the hammer out as far as it will go before prying. It increases the mechanical advantage for prying by about 2. For some reason it was not the most natural motion, for me at least. The one I have is many years old and actually has hardened removable jaws.

Sure enough, after we pulled perhaps 250 deck nails, the bottom lever snapped: perhaps a fluke, but likely crap Taiwanese steel. I'm ordering a replacement, hoping it was just a fluke.

If you are doing demolition work and don't need to salvage the boards then go ahead and whack away with the crow bar type pullers. If you are salvaging 100 year old oak or maple then use this puller. I also use a 1/4 inch chisel and tap around the nail head before pulling to minimize the tear out and make the puller jaw insertion easier. Very minimal damage to the wood. Try it - you'll like it. I wouldn't recommend it for general use (plaster board, ply wood, decks, etc.) but if you have the need to salvage expensive woods this one is great.

The language and the sensibilities portrayed in the book are, for anyone who has lived in West Africa, so real. It is impossible really for a middle class person to fully understand the trials of a life of extreme poverty and the types of emotions faced by those who have no other experiences than poverty. Somehow,Ben Okri manages to open a window for us to try to understand what it is like. Anyone who has had a serious bout of malaria can understand a lot of the dream sequences. The humour in the book in the face of the grinding poverty is also a welcome change from the grimness of the subject matter. It is worth a read, if only to try to get a completely different perspective on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"not your ordinary book","review":"Those people who grew disappointed because they were looking for a \\"plot\\" and \\"character development\\" were looking for the wrong things.

The little boy is not so much the narrator as the consciousness that filters this world to us. No, there is not much in the way of plot, although many things happen. \\"Going somewhere\\" is not what this book is about. Rather, \\"being somewhere\\", and viewing that place in a different way, is what it is about. This the author accomplishes stupendously, with vivid, imaginitive prose, a startlingly original worldview, and an amazing eye for detail.

A very frustrating reading process. I pressed on for a long time, hoping the book was actually going somewhere -- and maybe it would have done had I persisted, but it's hard to imagine how or when or that it could have been worth the effort.

Sadly, I haven't liked a single recipe that we've tried. The sauces are often too sweet and most seem to have a similar taste. I thought it might be the sherry that is often called for, but even after trying a sauce without the sherry I was disappointed with the flavor (very bland).

Usually intriqued by Kinsey and her capers, I found the floundering Kinsey taking orders from Reba, the jailbird she was being paid to keep straight too farfetched.

Perhaps the author is running out of steam with the series or perhaps she simply didn't know how to make the story move with Kinsey's usual intelligence, wit and character. She seemed to just be propelled along by others the entire story line and offer nothing of herself.Always allowing herself to do what -Reba- wanted with the rather weak explination of \\"what could i do?\\". In each instance- she always had the option of doing the smart thing but instead let herself be dragged into situations with a display of rather weak will and repetitive McDonald's eating.I hope the series picks up again or maybe i'll have to start at the beginning again for the best storylines and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"R\\" rates an \\"F\\"","review":"What is this anyway?

Kinsey is so willing to be led around by the nose, not only by Reba, but by Cheney, that I wanted to smack her one and tell her to snap out of it. The non-mystery is less-than-engaging, the characters are mostly annoying, and the writing lacks any sparkle. I was far more interested in Henry's romantic adventures than anything else.Now that I've thought about it, maybe 'R' should have been for \\"Rewrite.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"R is for ... Really disappointed","review":"As many reviewers have pointed out, this latest installment of Sue Grafton's alphabet series finds Kinsey Millhone reduced to basically a chaffeur for a parolee who displays the common sense of a doorknob. And Kinsey, inexplicably, just goes along with everything. Private investigator? The scattered instances of Kinsey actually investigating anything are mildly interesting but few and far between. I give the book two stars -- one for just continuing the series about a character that many of us love, and one for the hypochondriacal discourses of the character William, which are a hoot.This book reminded me of the lackluster \\"H is for Homicide,\\" which, despite the title, was mostly about ... auto insurance fraud (yawn), and in which Kinsey again spent most of the book going along for the ride, literally. If you want to read about money laundering, then knock yourself out with \\"R,\\" but as for me, if I'm going to read a mystery, give me a juicy murder any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull plot. Novel is littered with useless and irrelevant fillers","review":"The plot, if one can even call it as such, is dull. Some episodes are so impropable that their only reason of existence is to glue together a flimsily constructed story. If you still intend to read the book, I might suggest that you read just the first and the last chapters. You will still have read the same story, and saved yourself a bit of time and grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Like most Sue Grafton fans I was really looking forward to this latest installment in the Kinsey Millhone series. Unfortunately, this book was a big disappointment. Hundreds of pages were used to provide what I thought was background and setup for some great payoff to come. Alas, the kicker never came. Reading this book was like engaging in prolonged foreplay without the climax. Very unsatisfying. As another reviewer noted, Kinsey was inexplicably complacent throughout the drama. She abdicated control of the situation to a flighty, impulsive felon at every turn. The romance between Kinsey and an old acquaitance was pointless and the two lacked any kind of emotional connection. But that could be the nature of the characters. I now feel compelled to run out and buy another Dan Brown novel to get a fix of gripping suspense and intelligent intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"R is for \\"Remaindered Bin\\" (reduced to $2.98)","review":"I have read most of the entries in this series -- I missed P & Q, but I thought \\"O Is For Outlaw\\" was well-done, even though it fizzled out a bit near the end. This R entry, however, is the weakest of the ones I've read. Henry & his brothers should be committed to nursing homes for the senile -- or, they should be eliminated via fatal heart attacks. So Kinsey's got a sincere, seemingly enduring romance going -- or is it a sub/dom relationship? And it has made her slap-happy to the point that she no longer bothers to carry a gun. I would advise Grafton's publisher to cut its losses, and consign this dud to the remaindered bins -- and assign a new editor to the \\"S\\" book, one who is not merely a yes-person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow up!","review":"Kinsey Milhone is an ex-cop, an experienced PI--yet she follows every foolish lead of the alcoholic, gambling-addicted, ex-con Reeba.Hard to see anyone she DOESN'T betray except her elderly neighbor, Henry.No savvy, no morals--quite an unlikeable character in this book.There are some interesting plot twists, but Kinsey doesn't figure out any of them.Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"R is for Run Away!","review":"Two years ago I accidently discovered Sue Grafton by reading \\"L is for Lawless.\\" I was so taken by her writing and memorable characters that I had to start at the beginning. I read her books faster than you could sing the alphabet song. When I finished last summer's \\"Q is for Quarry,\\" I couldn't wait for \\"R.\\" My opinion just changed. With all due respects to the author, you should run away from this book. No meat. No mystery. No cliffhangers. Believe me, you can put this book down. Everything up until now - go for it - devour every page! True fans will still enjoy this offering because we all pull for Kinsey. If you collect Grafton's books, you should buy it. But if you don't, visit your friendly neighborhood library and put your name on the list like most of us do. Read it because it is a series and to show your loyalty. Otherwise, run away. Run as far as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"I honestly suspect McDonald's product placement","review":"No kidding--I am beginning to think McDonald's is paying Grafton to mention their products.How many times do Kinsey and Reba eat massive quantities of quarter pounders, moan with the pleasure, and discuss how unhealthy yet fabulously delicious they are? Does that have anything to do with the plot?Then once, when Kinsey went out for dinner, she says she passed McDonald's for one and went to a \\"competitor's fast food restaurant.\\" What, she's not allow to include the words \\"Burger King\\"??Pondering the possibility of product placement even began to distract me from the admittedly already weak story.Also, these stories have become period pieces, so locked as they are in the 1980s with typewriters and pay phones. Of course, to speed Kinsey ahead 15 years or so would mean that Henry would have passed on. So she's utterly locked into the time frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinsey is coming into her own","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that sometimes it seems that the Kinsey Millhone books are either wrapped up too quickly in the last few pages or not totally wrapped up at all, but I still enjoyed this one very much. I liked the bit of romance thrown in. So what if he doesn't seem to be her 'type'? He still sounds like a hunk, so why wouldn't she be interested - especially if he's interested in her? The 'G is for Gumshoe' with Dietz is still my favorite - I wouldn't mind seeing him come back and have them become a husband and wife team of private detectives! I also enjoyed Kinsey's interaction with Reba in this one - it's nice to see her have someone to pal around with, even if they're getting her into trouble. All in all, I would definitely recommend this book and am all set to start on the next letter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon is such a disappointment","review":"Very disappointed.

First of all, the story really did not get going until about halfway through the book. When the story did take off, Kinesy was a totally ineffectual participant. Throughout the whole story she was nothing more than a dupe. Even the resolution did not benefit from her actions. Apparently, this was Grafton's plan. The last line refers to Kinesey being an actor is someone elses play. Perhaps Grafton is bored with the alphabet series and wanted to try something a little different. But did she have to destroy the credibility of her detective in the process?"},{"rating":"1","title":"GRAFTON LOST IT ON THIS ONE","review":"I have read A thru R and R is for Ricochet is the worst.

The personal tidbits only enhance the detective story. I disagree with the people unhappy with the romantic parts. Ms. Milhone is old enough to get her head on straight and enjoy a quality man at this time in her life and I don't need a sex manual to get the picture. Her writing is better with each read. Kinsey seems like an old friend and I enjoy my time spent with her. As usual, I am looking forward to the next story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sue Grafton can do much better!","review":"I love all the Kinsey Milhone novels. I can't wait until the next one comes out. This one, however, didn't seem to be about Kinsey at all. It was pretty boring and I didn't feel the same \\"at home\\" feeling I usually get from her novels. I will read them all, but this one was my least favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duck for the Ricochet","review":"This is only the second Grafton book I have read. As a public library director I try to read a variety of novels so that I can recommend, honestly, the best authors writing to my patrons. I have to honestly say that I really enjoyed R is for Ricochet.Kinsey Millhone is hired by Nord Lafferty to baby sit his middle aged daughter, Reba, upon her parole from prison. The assignment seems straightforward enough, but as in most of Grafton's novels, the obvious should never be relied upon too strongly and often what seems to be simple on first blush often turns out to be complicated. It isn't very long before the simple assignment turns difficult especially as some of Reba's old friends begin to make their appearance.Well written....written with the reader in mind....R is for Ricochet will keep you turning pages. Not Grafton's strongest work (I liked Q is for Quarry better), R is certainly worth the time you'll spend reading it. I wonder what S will be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Kinsey Milhone really seemed to take back stage throughout -- the real protagonist was Reba. This reads like a non-series novel about Reba, which was somehow pushed into the Kinsey Milhone series. Too much hanging about, waiting for _Reba_ to move things on, with repetitive descriptions of food. The story really gets going only near the end. The various threads are rather too obviously brought together (eg Lucinda's role at the end, or Misty's 'secret' transactions.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mystery Here!","review":"Just like everyone else, I love Sue Grafton's alphabet series. This meant R is for Ricochet was a disappointment for me.I think it's great that Grafton wants to try some new ideas (the series can use some perk!), but this was just too out there.I kept reading wondering where the mystery is! This was just a story about Kinsey and Reba Lafferty. No mystery, no murder, nothing.I got the feeling that it was time to write R and Sue didn't have any ideas so she came up with this. I hope that S will get back on track with some good ol' mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Just plain and simple......This book was boring.I am on the last chapter, and it still hasn't gotten exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another ok Milhone mystery","review":"ok.

Grafton should take up poetry. She runs on and on describing everything from the color of some building, down to a single blade of grass. I have completely enjoyed \\"A\\" through \\"N\\" and then things started going wrong.

There are some interesting personal developments as well, that only add to the fun.Can't wait to read 'S'."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more mystery writer bites the dust","review":"In volumes \\"A\\" through \\"Q\\" we watched Mrs. Grafton grow from a women with a cute mystery, worth reading, to a serious mystery writer. But this book is the prostitution of all that talent for the praise of dirty-minded little book critics.Apparently she now has a new editor. The new one can't edit. \\"R\\" contains partial sentences, sentences with missing words, and lost thoughts inserted in the wrong places, hanging there as if they were picked up from the cutting room floor and stuffed in through a silt in the plot.All these errors do not destroy a readable book, BUT, now gratuitous sex has been introduced.Mrs. Grafton is talented enough to let us know what happened between the sheets without assaulting our sensitivities. But, somehow, I presume the new editor talked her into selling her soul, a good mystery writer has now become a poor sex book author.I couldn't finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho-hummer","review":"A friend recommended Sue Grafton.

I have to say that after this, I have no intention of reading another one. The plot develops so slow, and the characters are not so likable. Most annoying, as some others have already pointed out, is that the author would describe things that are completely not helpful to move the story along in minute details.

It's like watching the paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed reader","review":"I have to agree with everyone else who is disappointed. As an avid Grafton reader from A I always anxiously await each new title. This one was such a letdown. Kinsey whom I've come to love would never be lead around by anyone which made the whole Kinsey/Reba dynamic soo confusing. As much as I love Grafton's work I would suggest she take a break for a few years until she finds a new direction to take Kinsey from the S-Z remaining novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"R\\" should stand for \\"Rotten\\"","review":"Having read A thru Q I have always liked the series and have always looked forward to her next book. But \\"R\\" was a real letdown. I struggled thru the pages and simply could not go on beyond page 240. The attempt to provide Kinsey a romantic life was simply pathetic and Henry's character a total bore and stale.I got the book at the library after a lenghty waiting period but it was not worth waiting for. Is Grafton running out of ideas? I daresay if \\"R\\" is an indication of what is to come in the next installment, \\"S\\", then I fear the end is near. Grafton should call it a career. Perhaps \\"R\\" should have stood for Retirement. Its sad to see a good auther falter so badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOOOOOHUM","review":"I was very disappointed in this book!! Sue Grafton did not display her usual flare for a mystery thriller. She portrayed Kinsey as a hapless puppy to Reba. She hooks Kinsey up with a new beau (Cheney) and all of a sudden, Kinsey becomes a dumb, helpless female without a whit of sense. Reba, a convicted felon, showed more intelligence and hootspah. Kinsey just followed along with whatever Reba wanted to do even though she knew better, left her brain shelved at home or in the bedroom with Cheney.No mystery here...just stupidity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly dull","review":"I completely agree about the filler. I skipped paragraph after paragraph. Would have been interesting to read what Kinsey thought or felt about what was going on, but in most situations, no luck. I also object when characters do something stupid or out of character in order to move the plot along. Kinsey is supposed to be an independent thinker, but in this case the story wouldn't have had any forward motion unless she unquestioningly let Reba lead her around by the nose. Complete nonsense. I agree, Grafton is fulfilling an obligation, not writing entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best. Kinsey needs more.","review":"Kinsey needs to get a life. Maybe Kinsey should travel some and get out of the alias for Santa Barbara.The first part of this book seemed like it was cut and pasted from the other 17 books with the same characters. I bet it is a real challenge to keep them fresh but that was what she accepted when she decided to write about this little burg and these few characters.I didn't get into the story until the last one third of the book.Although she has had one or two clingers in her alphabet series, Ms Grafton is better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Ricochet","review":"I've read every Sue Grafton written, and on the basis of this latest effort, I think Sue should knock Kinsey off and try a new detective. Milhone is completely ineffectual in this volume, simply letting circumstances play out. There is no detective work to speak of, and the plot is so thin that Grafton pads the book shamelessly with numbing descriptions of such things as federal money laundering statutes and irrelevant side plots like Henry's love life. Characters wander in, bore us for a while, and then are never heard from again. This has the sickening feel of a book written solely to meet a contractual obligation. The well has run dry. Don't waste your time with this book. Grafton's earlier volumes were far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picking up again...","review":"I have always anticipated the latest installment of Kinsey Millhone's antics; although the previous 2 were not as exciting to me. \\"R\\" is right back on track with the action and fun plot lines; from her personal life (finally a love interest which I hope Grafton will cultivate!), her landlord's kooky family, and on top of that a fun mystery to solve!

A few of the stories didn't work for me. They would have been very funny if I read them closer to when some of the events happened, but time and distance tempers the joke for me. However, with the vast majority of the several hundred stories here, the author has managed to transcend time and place. This is just very, very funny writing, and some of these \\"business\\" stories, such as about employee slapping, the Fed \\"policy rave,\\" or selling off your most loyal employees, will be funny 50 years from now.That said, I'd still like to see what the author could do with a more timeless subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy and derivative","review":"This book tries way too hard.

The website is very quick to produce hysterically funny material, focussing on the events of the day and skewering the rogues who need to be skewered. And that is part of the problem with this book -- much of the material is pretty old and refers back to events that no one really remembers that well and therefore do not resonate. The jokes have no immediacy. I read much of the book and thought \\"This I'm sure was funny then, but it sure falls flat now\\".

The 2 pressure flow mechanisms, one on the bottom of the basket, the other on top of the pot, have to be aligned perfectly with just the right pressure, which is impossible unless you lift the coffeepot 3/32 of an inch. You might as well try to balance 2 golf balls ontop of each other. Well the coffee didnt flow into the pot fast enough, causing the paper filter to overflow washing grounds over the edge and further clogging the flow mechanisms. Designed to fail. How did this machine ever make it past testing and onto the market? I want my $8 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy one of these","review":"I have had nothing but trouble with this coffee maker. It leaks and makes one heck of a mess. Needless to say, I've not been using it although it looks good on my counter. It's overall design is no good, I regret to say. Moreover, I'll not buy another one nor will I buy from the seller ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after only 2 uses!","review":"I purchased this coffee maker as a long distance gift. I believe the carafe never fit properly into the main coffee area - because the coffee kept overflowing over the top of the filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky","review":"I was not impressed with this coffee maker either, in fact I'm returning it. Sometimes half the coffee goes in the carafe, and the other half leaks all over the counter and gets inside the machine.It is also difficult to pour coffee out of the carafe without removing the lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaster Brewing","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. The coffee runs all over the place, and, if you are lucky enough to get coffee in the pot at all, prepare to lose it while trying to pour it. It is, without a doubt, the very worst coffee pot I have ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would like to give it zero stars!","review":"You would think designing a coffee maker wasn't so difficult this day and age - turns out it is!- Spills coffee all over while it is brewing- Coffee is cold within 10 minutes as the system shuts off right away- Pouring is absolutely outrageously difficultThis is possibly the worst coffee maker ever designed. Please read other reviews complaining about the same symptoms - it is not just me! Buy this item for someone you totally hate - you are better off boiling coffee on a pot or flushing down thirty dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY LOOKS!","review":"There's one thing nice about it: its looks! But that's all. Coffee leaks everywhere.The coffee maker is hard to use in both filling the coffee maker and pouring the coffee. The carafe pours too slowly. Another peeve is that the coffee maker shuts off right after it brews.I had 'spillage' problems every single time I tried to use it. This product should be taken out of the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disappointed...","review":"I was intially drawn to this coffee maker due to it's looks. In my opinion looks is about the only thing going for it. I found the coffee maker cumbersome to use in both filling the coffee maker and pouring the coffee. In filling the coffee maker the design of the top lid seems to increase spillage of the water when filling. The carafe pours slowly, you almost need to take the top of the carafe off to pour a cup of coffee. There is an led clock disaplay that is virtually useless since it is almost impossible to see. Another peeve is that the coffee maker shuts off right after it brews so the only thing keeping the coffee warm is the carafe itself. I also had some 'spillage' problems as indicated by another reviewer. I'm not sure what caused this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker","review":"I hoped this would be an excellent way of having coffeee made and kept warm. Right away I had difficulty with the coffee brewing and pouring anywhere but into the carafe. I called Toastmaster who told me a particular way I had to put the carafe and the funnel but although it improved short term it proved too awkward to keep getting it \\"right\\" and could not rely on walking away to let it brew alone or put the timer on. I would like to return the coffee maker but have not done so yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This is not an easy pot to use...I got it because I wanted a thermal coffee pot and it was the least expensive. I found it to be more of a hastle than it was worth and I returned it and went back to my old drip pot. Bargains are great, but only when you get a respectable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a poor design product","review":"I bought this coffee maker because its design and it looks durable too, but when I received it and find the pouring is a little difficult. It is not the only problem, after used beyond the return period ( one month within purchase) it starts to leak and make me very diappointed. I cannot return it and I cannot use it. This is what my situation. Poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward to Use this Setup","review":"I wish I had seen the other reviews before I bought this. The carafe pouring is ridiculous. The manufacturer indicates that the button on the handle allows easy pouring. Not so. You have to awkwardly push down the button on top of the carafe (the one that allows you to pour coffee while a brew is going)while you pour. You invariably spill coffee on the counter while you are doing this. As for the thermal qualities, not impressed. The coffee is not all that hot going into the carafe, and cools rather quickly. I only make 4 cups at a time, so perhaps that is a factor. It is an adequate machine, it does what it claims to do, but I should have stuck to the cheap $20 models. They work just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas gift. I thought..\\"looks stylish\\" compliaments our kitchen, has good features.Till the first time he used it. Poor man out in the kitchen 7:00 in the morning cleaning up coffee that had \\"missed\\" the pot and was all over the counter. He has been fiddling with it ever since. I asked him if he wanted to send it back, but he \\"keeps trying to get it to work correctly\\"The digiial read out must have shorted out with the initial spill because it doesn't work anymore.I can't immagine anyone paying $70.00 for this. I can't belive I paid what I did! for such good craftsmanship :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good primer on the M8 and M20","review":"I like the Osprey series in general in this book in particular. Like other Osprey books, this volume gives a brief history of the weapon's development, it's specifications and modifications through it's career, a lot of good pictures and accurate color artwork, and even a first-hand account of the weapon's effectiveness in combat.It's a good, short primer on American armored car design and employment during WWII. The only thing I do not like is that these nice little books are still a bit overpriced for their length. I recommend it in spite of this small flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"good read. The plot device of switching back and forth between two narrators is sometimes jarring. But the writing is smooth, the characters mostly well sketched, and the plot carefully crafted. The WWII - Resistance plot is,of course, pretty old by now, but I still enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at first but it definitely gets interesting","review":"There was a lot of superfluous information that made the book longer than it had to be. It was a little slow at the beginning- hinting at the mysteries surrounding the woman who has been at the scene of several deaths. After about a third of the book the plot starts to pick up and there are A LOT of twists and turns that makes it all worth it. I didn't even guess at the depth of the characters and the evil that some people will commit. I definitely recommend this book for anyone seeking a mystery worthy of some time and thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classroom book!","review":"There are lesson plans written for the use of this book. It is a wonderful way to bring different math stratagies into your classroom. You might want to plan to use this book two different days because of the amount of material avalable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a little more and get yourself a decent step...not worth it!","review":"I bought this product for my step aerobics class. I chose this itembecause it was more cheaply priced than some of the other stepsoffered, but wish I had spent the extra money on one of the moreexpensive models. For one thing, this step is too narrow. A widerone is easier to navigate. The extra risers don't fit properly and keepfalling off (once on my foot...ouch!) so I don't even bother with them.Also the plastic risers attached to the step are very slippery, so Ihave to put my yoga mat underneath it so I won't go sliding acrossthe room. Overall, I was disappointed in this product and wish I spenta little more and received better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"Like I sad, don't waste you money, it's cheap, but no good. It is very small. I bought it for the price and 2 weeks later was forced to buy a normal Step with risers for about 100$. In the end it cost me more."},{"rating":"2","title":"California Alcoholic","review":"Tim Treadwell, junkie and hopeless alcoholic escapes California urban life in search of his life's calling and sobriety. After several near death experiences with Grizzlies, Treadwell decides to quit drugs and alcohol. His book is a real life Van Helsing with Grizzlies. It makes the reader paranoid to the point of emptying his backpack at night and removing all scented items before sleeping. Treadwell discovers the the 25th Grizzly in Alaska. The formula is as follows: 24 out of 25 Grizzlies are socially capabale to cohabitate with humans and other Grizzlies without killing them. It's the 25th Grizzly that Treadwell is trying to avoid during his summers in Alaska.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big mistake","review":"Maybe next time someone gets the bright idea of playing around with dangerous and unpredictable predators they'll think twice and bring a gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Provoking nature only to kill it?","review":"That is bear territory. If we go there we are jeprodizing ourselves and the bears. Nobody wins. No one doubts that bears will (eventually) try to eat humans if given the chance. If you do go bring bear spray or something. If you kill a bear, even in self defense, you should be severly penalized (huge fines/jail time). YOU are the idiot who went to bear country. It's like sticking your hand in a bee's nest. Dugh! So do the bears a favor, don't temp/provoke them only to kill them with your gun! This is bordering animal cruelty. By the way - being there IS provoking them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscientific and misleading. Fittingly, killed by a Grizzly.","review":"Although his accounts were entertaining, Treadwell was ultimately a fool who anthropomorphized a beautiful, but truly dangerous creature. I say WAS a fool because he was eaten by Grizzlies along with his girlfriend while camping among them. This book best serves as a warning to people who romanticize nature to the point that they lose respect for its true dangers.Go ahead and ejoy grizzlies, but bring a gun, just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the methods and ideas should be revisited","review":"Well now we know what can happen when people push bears too closely. The warm fuzzy feel good folks ended up dead and the bears ended up dead. This is what happens when common sense takes a back seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"He may have","review":"Timothy Treadwell finally got his wish and was eaten by bears yesterday. Unfortunately, a woman who trusted him to have some knowledge of wildlife and two Katmai Grizzlies also lost their lives because of this sick man's foolish behavior. If you see my review of this book also posted here and dated August 27, 1997, you will see that Treadwell's death was entirely predictable by anyone with even a minimum of understanding of bears, the only question being how the National Park Service could have allowed this garbage in the name of science to go on for as long as it did.This man and his book were pathetic in a very literal sense of the word. I am truly sorry to have been so right in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book indirectly promotes irresponsible behavior!","review":"Come on now people. It doesn't take a genius to know that a bear is a wild, often unpredictable animal that has, and will attack (and kill!) humans at times when hungry enough or when encroached in its territory! DUH!!! Treadwell had to have known this, but yet ignored this simple reality. Now, two humans are dead as well as two bears. What a waste. While I applaud Tim's love of nature and respect for animals, I fail to see or understand how he deluded himself into thinking all this would turn out OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's proven . . human's are the worst animal on earth.","review":". . . this book is a landmark in the battle of getting humans to realize that they are by far the worst animal on earth . . .when Flip Nicklin swam with wild Killer Whales we realized that they are not so bad . . and now someone has had the guts to live with grizzlies and lived to tell about it. It made me appreciate the guts it takes my cats to live with me, a much bigger and more powerful animal and I believe that this book will spark much controversy in the scientific and governmental communities who have always told us how to interact with animals. I think Timmothy Treadwell's book took more guts than the fact of his living in the wild with bears in some respects and I hope for his sake that we never make the bear a warm fuzzy because of it but rather people reevaluate our relationships with all animals"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a travesty to grizzly bear stewardship","review":"This book shows the author up close & personal with wild amimals- so close that if he were in the lower 48 states, in a national park, he would be arrested. THis is not good stewardship! He calls Alaskan brown bears grixxly bears, but these are NOT the same bears as those in the Yellowstone & Glacier ecosystems. In all places but Alaska, when people get close to bears, bears become used to people and are eventually killed by bear managers. In fact, Treadwell's presence in Alaska has ben condemned by Alaskan authorities!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Passion and Lunacy do not= Intelligence","review":"While my heart goes out to all those that knew him and loved him,I am deeply saddened by this story of a man who was so disturbed that his fantasy became his undoing. I appreciate his interest and passion in ecology and the environment but I am saddened by his lack of animal knowledge and his aparent mental instability. In many way he caused these bears further harm by allowing them to become so accustomed to human presence. Other humans do not have such placid motives in tracking bears."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great book .....for Walt Disney.","review":"I think Timothy Treadwells' heart is in the right place, but I feel his grasp on reality has been altered by his past history of self abuse. I started to read his book with the best of intentions but after a few pages, I really started to doubt this guys sanity. There is no way a person so totally unfamiliar with bears could have survived so many chance encounters and walk away without so much as a scratch. Sorry dude, but I think childrens books might be a better literary choice for your story telling abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unbelievable story","review":"Timothy shows the complex social system, personalites, and smarts that grizzlies have. I personally think he was crazy to even attempt this, but he pulled it off, and lived to tell his story, so all the more power to him. The book also shows that man (as usual) is being stupid and shows how grizzlies could *EASILY* become extinct in a few years. A very enjoyable, and educational read. I only wish the pictures were in color, but I guess they wanted to keep costs down.

As best I can determine, the Grizzly People cult believe this:1. If you believe that people, bears, ducks, etc., ought to love each other, love is guaranteed;2. If you talk enough about peace, you'll get it;3. There are no such things as enemies (or predators), just friends we haven't apologized to.Notwithstanding the tragedy of his death, I am heartened that darwinian effects invariably removed Treadwell's genes from the pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eaten by Grizzlies","review":"Today, he got eaten by wild bears in Alaska.

The connector for the power plug broke after only four months of use. I took it apart to investigate and found that the power connection to the circuit board is very light duty. The process of simply pluging it in and unplugging it caused it to break. My previous Wilson amplifier had a much stronger connection to the circuit board. It worked for years and was subjected to the same type of use. Like other Wilson products I've used over the years, the quality seems to be in decline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"This works just like they said it would.

My reception was always hit and miss in the valleys. Now I can keep on talking without the, \\"I'll call ya back if I drop out\\" statement.

We called the 800 number and tried everything that we were told to do (including going into the dashboard), but it simply would not match the system that came on our vehicle. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I believe the fault lay with our system, but the product said it was the replacement (and looks exactly the same); however, since it did not work, amazon paid for the return postage, so it cost us nothing but time and frustration.

Petrucci also gives a little insight into himself; he discusses his influences, approaches toward songwriting and band situations, and at the end, he gives a little tour of his rig (from the Awake era).

From the first words of 'The long night', the listener is pulled in, aware that something very special has been gifted here. This is music to envelop the heart and soul, music to heal, music to treasure. Some of Austin's finest musicians add their tasteful touches to complete the package.

High-level undergraduates should appreciate the directives it gave concerning culture-media preparation, as well as sequential isolation of bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, and microscopic algae.

I loved all of Armistead Maupin's novels and couldn't get enough of them; however I literally had to force myself to keep reading and finally gave up 3/4 into it. I have to say that I was really disappointed especially with the raving reviews the book seems to be getting here. The book simply seems to be all over the place, and focusing too often on meaningless details for chapters at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a tour of 18th & Castro, Folsom south of Market","review":"I provide gay tours of San Francisco and I came across this novel which was written before I moved to the City. This memoir is chock full of gay history details when Castro was in bloom with Harvey Milk and the Cockettes and clones and leather in the 1970s. I think that tourists to San Francisco, especially gay tourists coming to Mecca, might better enjoy their visits to 18th and Castro and to Folsom Street with a copy of this memoir in their backpack.

It is not a serious work of scholorship.

The work also lacks structure and needed a good editor.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offering a reprint of titles not even 2 years old","review":"The stories by both authors are wonderful, I am a devoted fan of McNaught. I just find it upsetting - and a easy way to mislead people into spending money on something they've already read - to reprint stories that appeared one or maximum two years ago under a new title and cover.

I was very disappointed in the writing of these stories. The authors break or ignore all known writing rules that beginning writers are taught: in two of the stories, we don't meet either the hero or heroine for the first couple of pages. The first paragraphs of \\"Double Exposure\\" describe two women, Diana and Kristin, and yet NEITHER ONE is the heroine.

Poorly written, wandering, and moralistic.","review":"I usually enjoy the volumes in the VSI series from Oxford University Press, but this is a glaring exception. The author, as other reviewers have noted, seeks out less to provide a history of the conflict then to paint a ringing endorsement of the Spanish Republicans. As someone with very little background knowledge in the conflict, this bias is still glaringly obvious. In addition, the book is horrendously written, with random scatterings of text boxes, superfluous use of quotations to ridicule nationalist positions, and slapshod organization. I have turned instead to Antony Beevor's \\"Spanish Civil War\\", which, while in many ways sympathetic to the left (as I am myself) at least attempts to reach a nuanced understanding of the conflict. Negative stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best introductory books on the Spanish civil war","review":"As one of the foremost scholars of the spanish civil war , Graham cogently sumarized various aspects of war and related them with the present , namely , how post-war Spain perceived the war and its impact on the modern day Spain. Especially helpful was the bibiliography that surely gives the direction of reading for those who want to know more about the Spanish civil war. The downside of the book is , as one reviewer mentioned, Graham tend to minimize the cover on CNT-FAI and Anarchist activities as many other scholars have done so far despete Anarchists contribution and controversial collectives would have been very interesting subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't historians write?","review":"I don't think the author got the concept of a an introduction. She should have not only summarized the events (which she did) but put them in readable prose, simplified so the unenlightened reader could grasp the subject easily. Isn't that the point of an intro? Instead, we get a book poorly written with deadening prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased author...","review":"This is a twisted attempt to make the Republicans win the war in history's pages. The authors completely ignores all the information which has come out from the former USSR secret files regarding the involvement of the Soviet Communist Party in the Spanish Civil War. How about the thousands of children which were forcibly taken from their families and sent to Moscow? Read Hugh Thomas or Beevor's Spanish Civil War books rather than Graham's or Preston's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful, but very tough to read","review":"I just finished reading the book, and it was helpful because it provided a brief overview of not only the conflict, but also the \\"new Spain\\" that emerged in the postwar years. Unfortunately, the book was a tough read because it is very poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst of Nick Nolte's movies.","review":"I like Nick Nolte. The only reason why I saw this movie is because of him. However, I have to say that this is the worst acting I have ever seen from his any other movies. Very often, it was awkard and unnatural. Another problem is other supporting actresses and actors. They don't act like real. They acted like they were just out from acting school. The whole plot is not really well coordinated (I won't say anything about it, since it is going to be a spoiler). The movie was boring to watch. If there is a reason why I hung on till the end, it was just to see how it ended (and the thought that I paid money for this movie). As a plus, you can somehow get some slightest idea of what is going on behind making movies (selection of actors/acresses/kids). There a few nice phrases which come out of Nolte. If you are a big Nolte fan, and want to see above plus things, you may want to see this movie. Otherwise, this movie is boring big time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming Hollywood","review":"Originally shot as a musical with songs by Sinead O'Connor and Prince, this remarkable pic tested so badly in pre-release that they excised ALL the songs and dance numbers. You'd never miss em'. Nick Nolte is an earnest actor struggling to make it in L.A. when his ex-wife drops the bombshell that their five year-old daughter (who Nolte barely knows) will now be coming to live with him. You thought that kid from \\"The Sixth Sense\\" was good? Wait til' you see THIS little spitfire! Julie Kavner is amazing as the head of a test-screening/marketing company, who spews truth (and uncanny insights) like bullets from an AK-47. The real draw here though, is the rocky and tender relationship that develops between Nolte and his young daughter, against the backdrop of a gutless and brainless movie business."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Did","review":"You have to be in the right mood to see this story of a down and out Oscar nominee who has principles. He also has trouble raising his daughter. You'll like it if: 1. You want to see a film that was a musical --and they took out the music(no kidding); 2. You can weed through all the characters you hate until they mellow out; and 3. You want to see some great acting by Nick Nolte, the only one you really like.

(For real! me = perv) I spend a great deal of time searching for them and researching where to get them. And this is by the far the BEST yaoi title I have ever read.The story is absolutely gripping and the sex scenes are top-notch and hide nothing! You get to see every detail of the you-know-whats. No blurs here! I really fell in love with the characters and wasn't able to put the book down. I really, really love this book and you will too! Enjoy! :-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and smutty...thin on plot","review":"If you're in the mood for a hot yaoi manga, this book delivers. No glowing cones here; there is explicit detail throughout the book, and plenty of eroticism in the artwork. The story merrily flings around taboos (it contains incest, of course, and one of the characters is under 18), so it may not be for everyone, but if you don't mind a little \\"brotherly love,\\" then this is one sexy manga.The artwork is attractive, though there are a few scenes where anatomy is distorted. DramaQueen has done a great job with the translation. My only complaint in that area is the sound effects--some of them are just plain silly. (\\"sproing\\"?)The manga's weak point is its plot. If you're looking for a great piece of literature, keep looking--there's nothing here but \\"two step-brothers have a whole lot of sex.\\" It's not badly written, though, and this book gives you plenty of \\"bang\\" for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty like garbage...","review":"Sex, Sex and More Sex: if your cravin a book of yaoi porn this is for you, pretty much from page one you'll get what you need. For those of us who like a story: read the summery, cuz thats the entire story-literally the rest of the text in this book is like accompanying sounds.

Look no further, my fellow otaku!! No Gakuen Heaven here, only yaoi heaven! Definitely NC-17: steamy and oh-so-detailed. Not safe to read in public (unless your friends love yaoi too!) Yeah, the name of this manga implies a questionable relationship, but these are STEPbrothers with absolutely no relation, except for a shared younger half-sister, if you count that. This authors drawing style is not my favorite, nor are some elements of the story (having to do with the awkwardness of living under the same roof with your parents and little sister and under the pretense of being \\"brothers\\"), but the steaminess more than makes up for it. I don't want to give many spoilers because I think being surprised is part of the fun. So what are you waiting for??

The last one lasted about 3 years before the keys began to stick. That makes it slightly less durable than today's average keyboard in my estimation. Aside from that, it's got a laptop keyboard feel, which I prefer. Since I have two keyboards on my desk, the compact size helps as well without feeling too cramped. On the downside, the chrome plated plastic around the edge will begin to wear off in about 2 weeks. They should just use black plastic. (Black and chrome went out in the late 80's anyway!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim keyboards rule!","review":"This keyboard is ugly, has a short wire, and the volume controls are rough.

I never liked it, in 1 year of owning it I made more typos and had more difficulty typing with it than any other keyboard I've ever had. It was very difficult to press the keys down, and seemed to 'miss' letters alot. After about 9 months it started to have sticky keys, and finally the \\"G\\" button died altogether after less than a year of regular use. I rejoiced, as it gave me the excuse to buy a new compact keyboard (which I am typing on now, and which is oh so much easier to use - the Logitech K300). I recommend avoiding this keyboard like the plague - very poor construction, very difficult to type, and also, it has a strange edge on it that accumulates every type of dust and grime imaginable. This keyboard is abysmal - I hated it with a passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard; great price","review":"I'm a heavy user of my keyboard and I find this USB keyboard from Kensington to be excellent.

I spend 40+hrs/week on my keyboard, so that's a lot of control presses, but I wasn't expecting this. I am likely to buy another of the same keyboard however, unless I can find another deal in a keyboard with laptop-type actuators. One of the things I was looking for was a quiet keyboard.

I can't afford to use them up with the keyboard and mouse. And, the loss of the two USB ports that are always on a Mac's keyboard is too great a loss. You can't even plug the mouse in, for heaven's sake! No, if Kensington is going to put \\"for Macs\\" on the package, they must design the keyboard to have built-in USB ports, or else it just doesn't work, not for me. I returned mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid keyboard, though key arrangement takes getting used to","review":"The keyboard showed up from Computer Brain on time, in perfect shape. My better-half and I have had it for two weeks now and it's pretty good. The key arrangement really does take a bit of getting used to. For example, the Delete key is in the upper right corner; I still miss it every time. And the cable seems slightly short to me. But the touch is very good, crisp and fast. Now that we've had some time to use it, we're adjusting to the key arrangement and my typing is speeding up nicely. I like this one. No installation problems at all. This is a safe one to order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted about a month!","review":"After less than one month of light use about half the number keys and five other's just stopped working today. I am currently using the 10 dollar cheapo that I thought I had replaced with the Kensington. Phooey!It is a nice keyboard overall but maybe a little overpriced for the build quality. The keys are pretty darn quiet, but still not as nice as a Mac keyboard. The 'chrome' border around the entire thing is cheap looking and distracting as well.I do not like where the delete key is at all. Anyway, to their credit Amazon responded immediately to my email and is sending me a replacement. I will have to see how well it does and how long it lasts. If it also gives out, then I will try another brand.If I had it to do all over again I would most likely NOT buy this thing. Oh well, live and learn right?PRODUCT UPDATE as of 9-30-09 Replacement keyboard still working.

First off is a list of major battles of the period, 3200 BC to 1185 BC for Egypt, and 1300 BC to 612 BC for Assyria. Next follows a series of short chapters on the tactics employed by the title powers and their enemies, their organization and formations, and the composition of their armies. The crowning glory is a section on the dress and arms of the soldiers/warriors; each type of soldier (e.g. light spearman, medium archer, horse archer, etc.) is described, and accompanied by a picture copied from an actual ancient painting or carving!This book was written with war gamers in mind, but it is an excellent resource for anyone who is interested in ancient warfare.

It packs well and is extremely versatile. I love the ball head and ability to use it as a tripod or monopod. Since it is light, it might not be completely stable if you have a heavy camera or lens, but you can hang ballast (such as a camera bag) to the top to give it more weight and stability.My only problem, which is why I give it only 4 stars, is that a year ago one of the joints became stuck and, after freeing it, I found that the bushing (or plastiuc washer or whatever) had become torn, which makes that one leg a little less stable. It still works, but I am more careful.Given the many years of service it has given me, this is a great and innovative product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tripod for the price","review":"I've owned this tripod a number of years, and it's always been one of my favorites. Although not hi-tech carbon fiber, it's lightweight and very stable, even with a heavy camera and lens. It extends to just under 5 feet tall, which puts my camera eyepiece at just the right height. Best of all to me is the way it folds flat, making it easy to travel with compared to most other brands - indeed, for this feature alone, it's worth having one.Only minor complaint is that it sometimes gets difficult to operate in extremely cold weather. Otherwise, it always works smoothly and securely.Highly recommended for a sanely priced high quality tripod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and frightening","review":"This book should be a real wake-up call to people who think freedom is a core idea in our country.

He actually suggests that we have only recently seen that the three-body problem is chaotic. (Instead Poincare proved the chaotic nature of the problem around 1890.) He seems to think that Asian philosophies actually capture the mathematical substance of chaos theory. I could go on.

Also for giving old kitties baths.They also worked great when I spilled a purple color smoothie on the carpet, spilled coffee down my shirt on the way out the door, ate a particularly juicy peach while wearing a white shirt, etc. I now carry these around everywhere as my go-to wet wipes (previously used wet-ones which I always found to be a tad too wet).

With regard to observations by other users - I did not find the noise disturbing, and in fact it offered a good \\"white noise\\" background for sleeping. The display, however, is exceedingly bright and cannot be adjusted; I ended up taping a post card over it so as not to illuminate the room.Obviously I wasn't looking for a $330 noise maker and nightlight, so I will be returning the item.

The AllerAir has a 7-pound VOCARB carbon filter that will remove the odor from the air and filter it with its comparable HEPA filter/pre-filters.I really thought this unit would work based on the reviews here. However, I'm an engineer and do my own testing. It simply didn't clean the air. This BioGS has a fancy smell sensor, which spent the entire time in operation indicating 3-4 bars of smell in the room.

They can be set to be ultra quiet at night, which is great for scrubbing the air whilst you sleep.As for my smoke problem, these will scrub the air clean of smoke and other odors, also removing dust and allergens.

Comes in at around 45 minutes to an hour I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most emotional soundtracks in history!","review":"Alan Silvestri's beautiful score for \\"Contact\\" moves me to tears every time I listen to it... as a deep believer in the existence of life beyond the Earth, \\"Contact\\" stirs emotions and ideas within me that no other film does, and Silvestri's score is the perfect accompaniment to those emotions and ideas! Where most film composers might have chosen to utilize a more bombastic orchestral score for certain parts of the movie, Silvestri instead takes an unexpected tug at your heart by using a few light piano notes, and the effect is magical. For its emotional content alone, \\"Contact\\" is easily one of the best soundtracks I have ever bought, and is also a beautiful tribute to the memory of Carl Sagan and his limitless sense of wonder about the universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle, moving score","review":"Silvestri's score for Contact is an understated, introspective meditation on the primary themes of the eponymous film. Silvestri's music lacks the grand aural declamations of a John Williams' soundtrack, but his approach is in this case equally effective and entirely appropriate. The brief but poignant statement of the main theme in track one sets the tone for the succeeding movements. Track 2 is frenetic and thrilling, while track 3 conveys a sense of mystery and suspense. Tracks 9-13 should really be listened to in one setting in order to experience the full emotional impact. Overall, the lush strings and the evocative musical themes fully won over this reviewer! The last scene of the movie alludes to William Blake's immortal words, which I think best sum up both the film and the sountrack: \\"To see a world in a grain of sand // and a heaven in a wildflower, // hold infinity in the palm of your hand, // and eternity in an hour...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"I bought this to remove one way screws.

The story follows one woman's journey from childhood to motherhood. Rachel is a victim of circumstance as a child. One who is from an affluent family with professional working parents. Often her days are long and lonely. She discovers at an early age how to get attention and carries that need for attention into adulthood as she becomes a mother. The story tugs at your heart as you follow her child's ordeals as Rachel seeks attention. I would recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit Working after about 6 months","review":"Again, (this is the second pair in a year) the sounds quality was awesome until the left one quit working. Sound comes in and out if I move even the slightest bit. If I hold the part where the one wire splits into two - it quits going in and out - but you shouldn't have to do that. I agree with the other reviewers that say the reason for all the positive responses are people write these when they first get them. There are plenty of other decent earphones that wont break so early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned to Appreciate it","review":"I've had these earphones for about 2 months now. Absolutely hated them and was very, very disappointed when I first got them. Funny thing though is that the more I used them the better I started appreciating how excellent they are. Sound quality - or maybe clarity is a better term - is fantastic. At first I thought the iPod's earphones were better, but when I went back to them, I realized just how much better the Shure's are. Once your ears adjust to the clarity of the Shure's you'll never go back. I'd love to know how much better the E3 or E4 are, but out of my price range for earphones. As others have said, finding the right fit is imperative. Also I recommend leaving the EQ settings on the iPod off, no need to add artificial sound. Yes Bass could always be better, especially for Hip-Hop, but with the proper fit and placement, the sound is pure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic after correct setup","review":"These earbuds are great but you have to set them up correctly. First, they have to be put into your ear canal not just hanging in your ear. Second, you must use the correct size rubber earbud cover. I initially used the smallest sized ear bud cover because it fit in easily but I was a bit frustrated with the weak bass. After switching to the medium earbud cover the bass was absolutely fantastic. I recommend these 100% and they are infinitely better than standard Apple earbuds. I suggest trying the earbuds on first with the small black earbud cover to get used to inserting them into your ear; then use the mediums for incredible sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality earphones","review":"The earphones received were the Shure SCL2 which are the professional version of the E2C (although I ordered the E2C (this is why I can't put 5 stars)).The sound quality is exceptional! The frequency to which it responds is 22Hz to 17.5kHz (respectable). I've listen to different kind of music (including Techno/House, Classical, Blues, Hip Hop and Rock) and the sound is very good.The isolation is also impressive: even with the music to a low level (about 1/6 of the max in my case) I cannot have a normal conversation with the surrounding.The only bad point are the bass which aren't very good. If in your budget, consider buying the SE110 which have better basses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with the bass and volume levels","review":"I spent considerable time reading reviews and searching for an upgraded pair of earpuds for my new 80GB fifth gen iPod. After doing my due diligence, I settled on the Shure E2c-n.I spent several minutes changing the various sizes to get the best fit then plugged them into my iPod to give 'em a whirl. I was very disappointed when I hit play and heard very little bass and an overall lesser volume over my stock Apple buds. I fiddled with other sizes of covers, without success, and swapped the Shure with the Apple stock ones several times with several different genres of music and continued to be disappointed. The one advantage the Shure offered was they did block out external noice to a much greater degree over the stock buds but this was a minimal positive compared to the lower overall volume and reduced sound quality.I'll be returning these tomorrow. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Was Given as a Christmas Present.","review":"The receiver of the gift stated that the earphones were great.

The plugs need to fit perfectly or else they will fall out of your ear. The manufacturer suggests you wrap the wire around your ear. This is very uncomfortable and if the cord gets caught on something it will pull my ear off. They sound good but not great. I wish I bought these in a retail store so I could return them easier, but I guess I'm stuck with them now. I suggest you pass on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Bass?","review":"I don't get it...I've tried every single ear attachment and there is literally ZERO bass.

I was expecting good (or better) bass from these, thinking that the standard iPod earbuds wouldn't be that great. I WAS SO WRONG! I put the E2c-n earphones on and immediately knew I had made a mistake! The bass response was really poor, and that is no overstatement. I put on the iPod earphones and was treated to WONDERFUL bass response, and I sent the E2c-n's right back. Amazon refunded me fast! Lesson learned: Apple has DEFINITELY improved their standard earbuds compared to earbuds I heard with an iPod purchased four years ago. Save yourself $100... iPod earphones are great now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, well worth the price","review":"These earphones are great. I did have a hard time getting them to fit well.

I have the sony $40 headphones and those are much better than these or the Bose headphones. I would not tell anyone to get these. I almost bought the E3c's but I could not see myself buying headphones for $180 when the Sony ones work perfect. The have noise reduction and they have earbuds as well as awesome bass/sound quality .. for $40!I fly a lot so I needed something that would take away the sound of a plane and the only reason I was looking for something else was becuase after two years of owning the Sony ones, the cord broke. I will be re-buying the Sony ones. Do yourself a favor and buy Sony or look into E4c's if you're really into sound. If you're on a budget, do not go for these or the Bose as they're both way overpriced for such under-performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound but some construction problems","review":"Shortly after receiving my Shure E2c-n headphones I used them with my I-pod Nano for about an hour and was quite pleased with their performance. Later, however, when removing the earpieces from my ears I realized that 1/2 of the left earpiece casing was still stuck in my ear. Though it came out quite easily I could not get the earphone casing to go back together. I had thought about trying to glue it myself but decided just to return the earphones to the Shure Repair Department in Niles, IL for repair or replacement. I am assuming that this will be accomplished with no further problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable with Little or No Bass","review":"I was dissatisfied with the both the sound quality and the comfort of these earphones. As other reviewers, both positive and negative, stated, I followed Shure's instructions for selecting the right sleeve. Many rubber, plastic and foam sleeves of varying sizes are included. The soft rubber one produced the snug seal needed to generate low frequencies, but at the expense of comfort. As others note, you feel like you're under water. Also, none of the sleeves kept the earphones comfortably in my ear.These are not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother, low value","review":"I owned the e2c for one year and really didnt have any plans to replace them, but one winter the parts taht bend around the ears broke and the wires eventually went. If that didnt happen I would never have tried the Ultimare Ears fi.3 OMG, I now see what a ripoff the Shures were, the UE has the greatest sound I have ever heard in an earphone, it makes the e2c sound like they are made out of cheese.

I lost the sound in the left headphone in both sets (probably a wiring issue). Even for moderately-priced earbuds, this lack of durability is not acceptable. Buy a product with better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds and fit are Great but other minor issues","review":"Sounds great and comes with a foam and rubber ear plugs in three sizes (a total of 6) so you are sure to find something that is comfortable and fits well. High quality constructing (gold plated contact, decent strain relief on BOTH ends of the wires). Sound is high quality and very good background isolation (I can turn the sound down on my iPod, while I am on a train platform that is 20' away from the freeway).The disappointments include:It is not one single cable, but a short (18\\") cable for the earpieces and a SEPARATE longer (24\\") extension cable. So while the earpieces are light the connectors at the end of the extension cable/earphone cable weigh it down and pull on your ears.Travel case is big - Hangs from your belt, but doesn't fit in your pocket.Straight plug on the end - Right angle plug would be much much more convenient.Overall: Pretty good but overall excellent for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bang for bucks here","review":"Hard to get to fit correctly and extremely uncomfortable.

I expect earbuds to last more than 9 months when you're paying a premium. Luckily these carry a 2yr warranty. As soon as the new pair comes in, I'll be auctioning those and purchasing a another pair of buds that don't have the wire wrapping around the ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Long Last - The Ultimate Buds!","review":"I have been through many pairs of earbuds -- Sony, Koss, and a variety of lesser known brands. The Shure e2's have it all. They are the first pair I've owned that stay in position in my ear even when I'm cycling or working out. The sound quality is amazing. I am an avid CD collector. Recently, I finally capitulated and got an MP3 player. In the past, I listened to CD's on my portable player and the sound was great. When I switched to MP3's, I didn't really notice too much difference. With the e2's, the difference is obvious. I can hear the dynamic range so well that I can tell that there are frequencies missing. It's still better than not being able to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissappointed with Shure......","review":"This is my second round trying these headphones, previously they were given as a Christmas gift and right out of the box one of the ear buds was broken. At the time I needed something else so I exchanged them. So a little over a month ago I decided it was about time to get some decent ear buds again and thought I'd give Shure another try. My headphones worked well during the first few uses (which was seldom and usually while sitting down somewhere) and it wasn't long before the left ear bud started failing, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I will say that when they work they sound fantastic. All in all I'd avoid Shure's E2c's if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better with you money","review":"I've owned this product for about 8 months now, and at first this is a great headphone, great sound, good bass, perfect fit, but too bad it wont last too long.1.

Perhaps that is why these ear buds were such a disappointment. The sound seems flat (and I don't mean just the bass). When I tested them alongside some $12 earbuds, they did not stack up. I was looking for some clear separation of music and instruments and I did not find it with these. Perhaps for speech they will be OK, but that is not saying much for some $70 earphones. Likewise, getting them to stay in your ears is a chore, requiring fitting and refitting of the rubber cups. My advice: look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Rock","review":"I own these. The bass is good. You HAVE to wear them correctly, I actually wore them wrong at first then, put them in correctly, You have to put the wires behind your ears, and then they fit exactly in your ear at the angle that they should.These sound good, good bass, and it makes your battery last longer since, you use less volume, and power.Perfect, much better than B&O; A8 , as I also have a pair of those , and they are horrible,"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"These earphones rock, literally.

The sound clarity is very good with my ipod now i use only 1/10th of the volume and its clear and loud enough. It does not just boost the volume, but isolated the noise, the unique design helps it. However the user should take extra care, high volume with this phones can defiantly cause ear damage, esp. certain musics genre.However, i have a complaint, it take a couple week before you can experience the good music without pain. For the first timer, the fitting it tricky and needs experience.Surprisingly this one also delivers good bass for its size. usually it is very difficult to find a a earplug with good bass, but this one is exceptional.Pricewise might be expensive, but for the quality it is worth, look for speacial deals in amazon. you can save more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product, Great Price","review":"These earphones are great, I have not been on a plane yet with them, but I can say that I used them several times now while cutting my lawn and could not hear the lawnmower at all, just music.

Many of the author's ideas may encourage emotional closeness in one form or another, but too many of the author's premises are based more upon continued stereotypes than scientific data with many of the studies used to support his point of view being narrow and self-serving in scope. The most workable ideas presented are as fit for female bonding as for male, and parents could find equal alternatives if only they would look past the outward genitalia, relax, and relate to their children as people -- for there are too many exceptions to purported behaviors, etc. to be ignored in favor of yet another testosterone theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Premise","review":"An incredible premise.

It wears out and falls apart pretty quickly. It looks easy to assemble but it is very hard to line everything up correctly when putting the screws in for the rope looking designs under the glass. I got alot of complements on the glass because it is not smooth around the edges which gives it a cool design. But forget setting anything on the end tables or coffee table because it will wear out and sway because everything loosens so fast. And if you try to tighten the screws back up, they just strip out because they are so worn. The screws also have balls on the end of them for design that appeared to be glewed on and they fell off pretty quickly too. Dont waste your money on this product.

It seems ironic how the American Dream was achieved through an American product, with an ambitious Cuban man. I found the book to be a little biased. It refuses to show the readers any outside view of Roberto Goizueta. It seems that the author wrote it with the intention of making Mr. Goizueta out to look as perfect as possible. I found the book to be compelling. I very much enjoyed hearing about the gambles Mr. Goizueta took. Such as abandoning TAB SODA in favor of DIET COKE. And when he changed advertising corporations only to change them again years later in order to boost sales. Not to mention his influence in expanding Coca Cola world wide and improving the quality of Coke bottlers globally.

Her dad calls her before the first day of school and at the end of the day to let her know that he too wishes he could be there but the divorcee makes this impossible. The usual fourth grade things happen the first day (teasing, armpit noises, who went where for vacation, etc.) in school and Amber is able to make a new friend. They are placed in detention together due to their excessive giggling. Amber is able to realize that life does go on. The illustrations compliment the text in their simplicity and originality. At one point, Amber writes what she wants her new teacher to know about her and it is done in a child like scroll. This is the third book in the series and worth reading.

This is the sort of book which has SO much stuff, you will never use it all - but it will (almost) always be able to help you.This is the one reference book I was willing to pay for out of pocket, whether or not my employer paid for it.I found a 1927 copy of this at a used book store a few years ago ... - I still have it, and believe it or not, I do use it. It's got really neat stuff the modern editions don't. Which is why you shouldn't hesitate to drop [money] for one today.

Unfortunately, it is so rambling and disorganized that I was not successful.In reading the other reviews, it is apparent that the focus of this book was on the college level student reader. True, to my knowledge there is nothing out there with the same focus. However, Land of Contrasts, while written at the supposed high school level (though I enjoyed it), is much more organized and a better read.I did enjoy the Bleeding Kansas section, Civil War impact, and the building boom time period of the 1880's. Then the organization starts falling apart.I tried hard to like this book, but I couldn't get past the way it jumped around in topical themes to decide whether I really was enjoying it or whether I was missing something somewhere. I decided to put it back on my book shelf and to get over the headache it had created, and then try again another day.College students, keep looking out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to figure out","review":"I bought this for my husband who, like me, is a crossword nut.

It's simple to set up and easy to use. It's so simple, in fact, that I didn't have to read the manual (Who needs those manuals anyway?)! I had it on my wireless network in 5 minutes and reading from my server in 10 minutes. The large-ish, bright display makes it simple to read from the couch, even in the dark, and the remote works from more than 20 feet away. The SMCWAA-G works flawlessly with the Twonky Music server (via uPnP) on RedHat Linux and MacOS X as well as with MusicMatch on Windows.It just works. I can't ask for more than that, especially from a $100 device!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best unit but Woth the money","review":"Was able to successfully connect to my wireless network (which even had TKIP). I had to change the key to all lower case since the unit only allows lower case letters. Build quality cheap when you hold it but you wouldn't notice it from 10 feet away. Sound quality is fairly good. It's hooked up to a Denon receiver with 5.1 speakers. Can't complain, for $35 definitely worth the money. Instead of plugging in my laptop to the home theater this unit does the job. Just wish it had some facility to rate the songs played. Don't know how long it will last so keeping my fingers crossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sil-a-Gel, but not a bad product","review":"After ordering this product I discovered it was made of Sil-a-Gel PVC, which conveniently never shows up in the product descriptions (which is almost completely lacking for this product) of these things unless it's a high end material. Having had other bad experiences with this material, namely Doc Johnsons Sil-a-Gel crystal Jellie line, I was a little wary that this product too would smell extra bad and burn sensitive skin. However, my fears were not founded as this is a quality economical product; no-frills, cheap, and does what it's supposed to. While things will definitely stick to this (like skin, hair, lint, etc.) and I wouldn't describe the smell as good, it has a slight PVC rubber scent, is really easy to clean, and didn't irritate my skin. Also the heads are pretty big, so I wouldn't suggest it as your first toy.

One day it was for soba. With no local sellers I tried this. Bad move. This is very generic, run of the mill, brand X. Nothing special about this at all. Japanese cuisine is supposed to be subtle and not overpowering, but even by those standards this was bland.

A person can state that someone needs a better editor, but someone who intends to write for a living must have a better grasp of the English language themselves. There is a rather identifiable difference between minor errors and someone who clearly lacks a fundamental understanding of grammar, sentence structure, spelling, and sentence fluency. This is not intended to come across as an ad hominem attack, but as a statement of fact.An honest attempt to tell an interesting story is present, but it's lost beneath the unnecessary vulgarities, off-color humor, and again, the unacceptable writing quality of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feardorcha","review":"I loved the book. It needs a few rounds of editing, as every book does, but the story is really a great one. I would say to either give this 148 page book a chance or wait for a possible revised edition. I also believe that anyone who is going to write a review of this novel should read it. It seems a reviewer used the Search Inside The Book feature to eviscerate both the book and the author, which speaks volumes about that person. Webster defines a review as 1 : a looking over or examination with a view to amendment or improvemen. This person neither looked it over wholly nor did his critique aim to improve the quality of work in any credible manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"450 8\\" SS Square Johnson Level & Tool Co.","review":"Although the square is marked \\"STAINLESS\\", the metal rusts very badly.

As a mechanical engineer, I am aware that there are many alloys of stainless steels some of which will rust, but when the manufactured metal product is stamped \\"STAINLESS\\", the user does not expect it to rust.

Check her out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Chante","review":"As a fan since the Precious Album I have become increasingly disappointed in Chante's releases. I am sick and tired of hearing her fabulous voice on \\"okay\\" tracks. She is the best background arranger out there and if it weren't for that the songs on this album would just flop into oblivion. The only songs that save this album and reflect the Chante Moore that diehard fans fell in love with are M-A-N, Bitter and Better than Making Love. We miss the real Chante Moore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still A Fan","review":"I'm still a Chante fan but I couldn't give this one five stars. If I had rated it when i first bought it, I probably would have given it 2 or 3 stars. It took a minute, but it's kind of grown on me now. Chante has such a smooth and beautiful voice that I've always just wanted to hear her sing ballads. Now, I've grown to really like the hip hop sound of \\"Straight Up\\" and of course I like the smooth sounds of \\"Bitter\\", \\"Train of Thought\\" and \\"I'm Keeping You\\". Other than these three songs, the album doesn't do as much for me as some of her previous albums have. However, when you're a fan, you don't totally dis the artist because they don't hit the mark with you every time. I still love Chante and hearing her do these songs in live concert is a totally different experience than hearing them on the CD. I'm hoping for a better next release, but I'll settle for this one for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good","review":"Nice R&B album. I think all except Bitter will stay on my computer. Four star for the song. But it looses 2 star due to the copy-protection; installs itself without warning when I forgot to turn off autoplay. Evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It....","review":"...I'm telling you I've purchased \\"Precious\\", \\"A Love Supreme\\" and \\"This Moment is Mine\\". Precious, was by far the best CD Chante will ever do in this lifetime. Lots of artists only dream of such a wonderful debut with the likes of George Duke, BeBe Winans, Stanley Clarke, & Will Downing behind the scenes. \\"A Love Supreme\\"...well, all I can say is \\"what a waste\\". \\"This Moment is Mine\\"...I thought well maybe she's heading back in the right direction. Then I bought \\"Exposed\\"...what a joke! Not one song showcases her truly incredible voice. All of the songs are electronic \\"hip hop\\" produced by the likes of Dupre, Jam/Lewis, and Laney Stewart (whoever that is). Her vocals are light, airy and devoid of any real substance. All I can wonder is doesn't a person that can really sing know when they are HEARING BAD MUSIC? I can't imagine Chante would signoff on such a project. Totally disappointed. If anyone wants a copy you can have mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Fat Zero","review":"This is the album that turned real music lovers away from Chante. Two web sites that were devoted to Chante were taken down because the owners were so disappointed in the direction that she took. Why, because she sold out BIG TIME with this record. When this was first released, I listened to the cd twice and then put it away. I hated it. Recently, I pulled the cd out and listened to it again and my opinion has not changed. This cd is really bad and she sounds desperate. Desperate for a hit, she employed Jermaine Dupri and Da Brat of ALL PEOPLE to help her and made herself look bad. Had Chante stayed true to herself, her style would have made an impact. I really believe that. But she took the low road and paid for it. I really hope she get it right the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a true talent","review":"This CD is a waste of Chante Moore's beautiful voice. Instead of her usual beautiful and elegant ballads, we have Chante gettin' \\"ghetto\\".....and she's no Mary J. Blige. Thank God. The songs just don't work with her angelic voice. Go back and listen to \\"A love Supreme\\" or \\"This Moment is Mine\\" this CD is a dissappointment for any Chante fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"......But Damn She's Fine","review":"This album is \\"Straight Up\\" garbage. The only song she has out right now is weak and it has JD in it. To me Chante needs to make movies :-) if you know what I mean. Because her body is a horrible thing to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding","review":"I downloaded this cd and after I heard Bitter I deleted the file.

Not all Black people use this word and it's just so shocking to hear her sing it. It really takes away from her physical and lyrical beauty.The rest of the songs are overly commercial and just plan silly.It's obvious that she's a 33 year old woman, who looks 23 but acts like she's 16 with juvenile lyrics and her stupid gym video! She should stop trying to compete with Christina Aguilara and Britney Spears.She's a mother and supposedly a \\"lady\\" whose supposed to have class, dignity and self respect yet she has let producers/artists like Jermaine Dupri and DaBrat record with her and this \\"cheapens\\" her image.This album belongs in the trash can and will not stand the test of time. Teenagers are fickle and will not be singing songs from this cd even 3 months from now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Baby Girl?:-(","review":"This album doesn't seem to fit the Chante I remember hearing when she sang \\"Love Me Tonight\\" with El DeBarge and classics \\"As if We Never Met\\" and \\"Your Love's Supreme\\". I sure wish Chante would re-discover that old-school-luvin' sound that made her one of the smoothest-sounding sistas in this ever-so predictable world of R&B. I understand that with time comes changes but Chante you sound as if you sacrificed your monumental voice for spark-in-the-pan \\"commercial sound\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord Have Mercy!!","review":"I'm all in favor of musical artists expressing themselves with different types of art, but this is ridiculous! Chante started out so good with the first three albums and just totally lost her mind with this one (well, she started slipping on the third but it was still tolerable)!! Maybe it's the pressure of trying to be like the other lackluster R&B artists out there. Maybe she was confused after her divorce from Kadeem Hardison. Whatever the case, let's just all pray that she return to the original style of music that made her a star in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck !!!","review":"Please note, I gave one star out of sympathy if nothing else. What's going on ?? What's happened?? I have just cringed my way through a pathetic line up of tacky, pubescent lyrics that sound like they belong to a teeny bopper group and not a mature woman. What's happened, Chante? It was painful to hear her beautiful voice being wasted on lines such as \\"here's the number to my cell......\\". I'd like to think that she has grown out of that adolescent behaviour. Oh and by the way, did you really use the N word on your third track? - Shame on you, Chante, comments like that will obliterate 400 years of struggle and send us right back to the plantations. Chante, do whatever it takes to get back on track. If you do another album like that.........you'll be finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a big Chante Moore fan, loved all her CD's prior to this, especially Love Supreme. She seemed to be trying to hard to keep up with the mainstream music. I like the old style alot better. She sounds like any other singer out there on this one. You can definitely tell Jermaine Dupre had something to do with this one. what's the saying again, don't fix it if it's not broken...that definitely applied here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review by a REAL Chante fan","review":"The people who gave this album such negative reviews obviously didn't make it past the first 5 tracks, seeing as how \\"Bitter\\" is pretty much the only song mentioned on a consistent basis (OMG she used the \\"N\\" word! Somebody call Farrakhan! Give me a break...).The tempo may have been turned up a few notches, but Chante is still singing about what Chante has always sang about: love, relationships, and intimacy. People need to stop focusing on the beats and pay attention to the lyrics, which, with the exception of the slang-heavy \\"Straight Up,\\" pretty much sound like they could have come out of any of her previous 3 albums.Chante didn't do a disservice to her fans, her fans did a disservice to her by being so shallow and closed-minded, and as such, missed out on an album that, despite its missteps, is a solid effort worthy of being a Chante album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Most Of The Stuff Out There, But COuld Be Better","review":"As a big Chante fan, I was dissappointed by this album. SHe has too many fast cuts and that is not when she is at her best. The few ballads do satisfy, however.\\"I'm Keeping You\\" \\"Train OF Thought\\" \\"Better THan MAke Love\\" \\"Love's Still Alright\\" and \\"Bitter\\" are vintage Chante ballads that make the album worth listening to. The up tempo songs are okay, too, but I prefer her on ballads.

They are just as bad -- not much walnut flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I love almonds, but these are awful. What Emerald refers to as \\"baked on seasoning\\" overpowers any taste of the almonds themselves. I knew something was wrong when I opened the package and the nuts clearly had a shiny coating. I tasted them and couldn't even figure out what the coating was, so I looked at the ingredient list. The coating contains stuff like modified potato starch, sugar, paprika, onion powder, corn syrup solids, etc. It seems odd, but these taste more like a potato chip than a nut. If you are accustomed to eating almonds, I don't think you'll like these. If you're just looking for something salty, oniony, and crunchy, these will probably do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure pleasure for Cause","review":"I bought this for a lot of reasons.....that is why everyone that enjoys various styles should have this in the collection.....To save Darfur is reason enough, but I am sure everyone would find an artist they enjoy on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice CDs for an excellent cause","review":"If you're a John Lennon fan, you'll find most of the cuts to your liking.

There are, of course, some tracks that you may not like, but overall I'm pleased with the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one....","review":"While saving Dafur is an extremely important cause, listening to this album is really difficult. Most, if not all, of these covers are really unimaginative, boring, tedious, plastic, crappily rendered. The only decent cover is Whatever Gets You Through the Night by Los Lonely Boys. It's just decent, not great, and the only reason I like it is because I never liked the fast tempo of the original. Los Lonely Boys slow it down, and get it in a nice groove. But that's the only good song. There are no great ones, and some are downright obnoxious. Steven Tyler's Give Peace a Chance is histronic, Aguilera's Mother has no feeling at all, REM's #9 Dream is boring, and Nobody Told Me is really bad, with a smarmy lead vocal on it. Avril's Imagine sucks, too. Like another reviewer here said, just give the money to Dafur. That's the best thing to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome CD","review":"Amnesty did an amazing job with this CD. Both in the selection of artists with the particular Lennon covers they were to do, and in the way they made sure anyone who purchased this CD would be well aware of its benefits to stop the genocide in Darfur.Though Amnesty never uses the term \\"genocide\\", be very certain that the humanitarian crisis in Darfur is nothing but a genocide. It will take more initiatives of this scale to see any progress.Some of the artists that did an exceptional job were Ben Harper, The Postal Service, Jack's Mannequin (surprisingly, I didnt think the frontrunner of Something Corporate could actually put out respectable music), and Regina Spektor.Well worth the money, well suited for the cause.[..]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby You Can Drive My Karma","review":"The songs of John Lennon are a perfect compilation for a political action CD set. The artists who contributed their covers are faithful to the original music and lyrics while adding their own undercurrent trademark sound. It is good to hear these songs again. The Black Eyed Peas provide a fist pumping rendition of \\"Power To The People.\\" What better time to bring this song out of hibernation. People need to feel empowered today more than ever to Save Darfur, Stop Global Warming and End the War in Iraq. Power to the people, right on!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Lennon Covers for a Good Cause!","review":"This collection of covers of the music of John Lennon is a fund-raiser for Darfur, so that should be enough reason to buy it.

Unfortunately, it turns out that that is the only song on the CD that I will ever actually listen to.

But there are some excellent covers on this album. U2's Instant Karma is this first song on the disc for a reason. Easily the best track. R.E.M. makes Dream #9 sound like an R.E.M. song. Green Day, Jack Johnson also rock solid. Aerosmith's \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" is a disaster.Overall, very worth the price, and its for a good cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why must saving the world be so disappointing?","review":"I bought this album because it supports Darfur, but was very disapointed. Out of the 2 disc set I liked 6 songs. Granted I'm not a huge Beattles fan, but many of the covers were just plain bad. Considering the wide range of talent on the album I expected something better. I encourage you to buy the album as a social statement and consider the cost a donation to support Darfur rather than an investment in your music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick...","review":"Nice idea; bad result.

Not a big deal unless you don't have a separate voice mail system (we do) or unless you want to add another handset. We've had two base units so far. We returned the first unit as it was still on warranty but in order to benefit from the warranty we had to send the unit in and wait for them to send us a replacement. It was a hardship as this is our only telephone and without the base unit the handsets don't work. So, unless we want to use a cheap spare unit while we send the second one back to the manufacturer we are stuck with a non-functioning base unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"If you liked J. Robert King's Invasion Cycle, this is about status quo. Lots of annoying fourth wall breaking, lots of INCREDIBLY melodramatic prose that doesn't fit the setting, lots of choreographed violence. It's not as bad as the books that follow it, but it's not going to be winning any Locus or Nebula awards any time soon. This is the best of the Onslaught Cycle, but that's not really saying much. If you want thoughtless fight scenes and escapism that doesn't require a lot of thought, go with this book.

I read the book from cover to cover and cried through almost the whole book. The tears were healing tears, I believe. The beautiful poetry and entries put words to the feelings that I was experiencing and couldn't name. It is a beautiful, creative, intelligently written book. It is sad and joyful.

The parts come stuck together with plastic that needs to be broken off. It's impossible to break off the plastic nubs cleanly - they're sharp! I had to cut them off with a box cutter. The item is only 1 shade of pink and not 2 like the photos show. It's flimsy and not as nice looking as the photos appear when assembled. My 3 year old thinks it's ok.

There are also very sharp \\"knobs\\" on the edges of each piece that actually cut my finger. All the pieces are stuck together with these \\"knobs\\" so you have to dissasemble each and every piece before you put it together, which leaves the sharp knobs still attached.

Why in the world would you have over 50 pieces of plastic held together by 10,000 screws??? Not only are these screws in the most obscure places but it takes about 40lbs of torque to get them in. I've scraped my knuckles less putting in a new AC compressor on my vehicle- took less time too.

There are so many pieces and almost all of them needed to be screwed into place. The material is very flimsy and not durable....overall very cheap. Each of the small pieces comes together on a grid like system...all of the pieces are attached by more plastic that you need to either cut or twist to get off. Which in turn leaves tiny pieces of plastic sticking out on the sides of the small parts. These are very sharp and need to be filed down so your little one doesn't scratch them self. My daughter does enjoy playing with this toy...but I would not recommend it. I would have rather spent a little bit more money on a better made product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brace yourself!","review":"While it's a considerable effort, this toy is worth it. Very good value if you can handle extensive assembly. Directions are quite good, just lots of pieces. As the other reviews mention, the pieces are still attached to the plastic molds.

This will eliminate the sharp nubs and results in better fits.Good compact design with lots of activities packed into one toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Took 2 hours to assemble.

Some of the pieces are kinda sharp and can cut while assembling. Its made very cheap compared to other baby cribs out there for around the same price. The directions aren't horrible but had to use the colored picture on the box to figure some parts out. The doors aren't the easiest or very quiet to open so if you have a spouse or siblings napping it might wake them up. It takes up a lot of space but is very short. My 3 year old loved it for about a week and now has no intrest in it. Im just going to give it to our local budget center and buy a wooden crib like the Badger or Mellisa and Doug versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but...........","review":"I like this all-in-one doll nursery set, it helped me save a few bucks instead of purchasing everything separately.

It was hard snapping everything together, but the directions were easy to follow. I did not find the snap off pieces to be too sharp as some reported. The kids have not complained about any scratches. It is very study for the price. My 2 year old constantly sits in the high chair and the bath.

If you enjoy Janet Evanovich's \\"One for the Money Series\\", you'll love this book too. She has a similar tongue and cheek humor that keeps you laughing as you turn each page. The heroine was not a silly goose, while Romeo was a flawed but loveable hunk. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this book, expecting something more after reading several reviews. I found it to be choppy, with poorly developed characters thrown into contrived situations. The \\"hero\\" sporadically swung between spoiled child stubbornlly wielding his power, with no concern for his own life, to sensitive man learning to enjoy the simpler things in life in forced comedic situations. No matter how good-looking the author wrote him to be, I just couldn't find him attractive. The \\"heroine\\" was equally unlikeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun!","review":"This book was a whole lot of fun. Good characters. Funny situations. Kept me interested and laughing. The book is set in Cleveland, my home town. Great fun reading about places I recognize and the author captured the flavor of the city perfectly. Bingo, bowling and pork and sauerkraut.

It has been a very long time since I had the misfortune of reading a book with such a one-dimensional hero! Adam Romero is just not realistic. He is not old enough to have forgotten what it was like to be in college and having to \\"rough\\" it a little. You can understand the griping at the beginning, but when it is still going on at the end it's just a little too much! Additionally, Alex comes from Cuban descent and is really concerned with human rights activities - I can honestly tell you a person such as this would not be as hung up about clothes and food as he was! They make a point of his heritage at the beginning and then it is completely dropped fpr the stereotypical corporate millionaire persona. It was a great disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Romeo falls flat....","review":"This was an incredibly unbelievable attempt at writing a interesting book.

I swore I would gag if I read one more comment about \\"the Academy\\" and the heroine's \\"duty.\\" She's a Fed guarding a JKFJr clone. We get it! It had amusing parts. Put together, it did not amount to a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine Movie...Horrible DVD","review":"I enjoyed the movie fine, this new DVD is a travesty, though.The image is, at least anamorphic widescreen, but the interlacing is absolutely abysmal! I started getting a headache after the first 10 minutes. All movement on screen is smeared, and everyone moving in a scene looks like they are leaving trails behind them.The really weird thing is, at several points in the movie and in the short subject included as an extra, a single, solid frame of red will appear that is disorienting and quite noticeable. Searching the web brings up several links claiming this is an issue with some mastering software when going from PAL to NTSC. In other words, there seem to be some issues with the encoding on this DVD.Anyway, buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you feel good about choosing to stay at home.","review":"Overall, I really liked this book. It addresses the mixed feelings you may experience by transitioning from working full or part time to staying at home with your children and points out the good feelings you will experience by making the choice to do so. Although there are a few chapters that point out obvious and sometimes extreme ways to save money while at home, most of the chapters revolve around coping with your mixed feelings, obtaining support that stay at home moms need and acknowledging God's guidance as you stay at home during the most important season of your childrens' childhood. Easy and quick to read... I recommend it for anyone planning to stay at home or just merely thinking about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless adivce with a huge focus on Christianity","review":"Nowhere on the book jacket does it mention that this book is written from an entirely Christian point of view.

All the negative things that people have said about it are true. I have used it for a few (wasted) hours, and this is what I've found:---It is very difficult to navigate the software. It is not intuitive. I am an experienced computer user, I've even used Fritz before, but I could not figure out this software.---It is very cumbersome to set it up to review a game you've played, which is what I mostly wanted to do.---This software is not just difficult, it is BUGGY! There are many functions in the program for which there is no \\"Help\\" at all! I tried the openings trainer, and the openings are all named in a foreign language! (Polish?) There is an option to delete games from the database, but it doesn't work! And so on.My advice: don't buy this software.

Deep Fritz 8 is ranked 10th on both the CEGT site and the SSDF website with ratings of 2793 and 2783, respectively.And contrary to another reviewer, Fritz 9 is almost twice the price of this product (comparing Amazon prices today). And for the extra dollars you really don't get any more power. Fritz 9 is ranked 11th (CEGT) and 6th (SSDF). Why pay more for essentially the same playing-strength?

Shrift's produced some truly unique and cinematic sounds sure to appeal to the over 40 crowd, as well as to lovers of world music and electronica. \\"Lost in a Moment\\" makes for perfect background music on those cold wintery nights, or during those cozy soirees of yours. Shrift and Miranda can also crank it up a bit with the funky \\"Floating City\\" and \\"To The Floor\\"--just make sure your guests see it coming, or else they may be startled like I was.

He reiterated that the item is made for large inflatables. He could be wrong in terms of adapters, but I don't know yet.It may be a good product, but the write-up needs to be adjusted.

So I washed them before first use. The label says wash cold - work pants to be washed cold? We are talking dirt, grease, sweat, mud- you name it, they'll see it. So wash cold is not an option in real life now, is it. Surely the manufacturer is being over cautious here, right? So I washed my pair at 40C (about 100F), warm, not even hot. I put a 34\\" waist into the machine and got a 30\\" back out. I did plan on a diet after New Year, but 4\\" is probably somewhat overly optimistic.

I would just skim quickly through pages when the narrative would digress and by the last half of the book, I was mainly reading it because, hell, I bought it. Do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Andrea Doria accounts.","review":"Having read most of the accounts of diving on the Andrea Doria and other deep diving sites I can say that this is the worst of the lot. The author is not a diver and admits it but obviously has not taken the time to have his work checked. Several references to \\"1-2 knots per hour\\" leave the reader wondering if the author has spent anytime on the water at all. Also some technical goofs where author makes clear he did not really understand some of what what communicated to him. Most aggravating is being left not knowing the outcome of the legal actions taken with regards to accidental drowning of Chris Murley. It was as if 1 or 2 chapters were missing from the end. Still some pretty good accounts of the mishaps aboard the Seeker from 1998-2001 as well as a reasonable retelling of the Andrea Doria sinking. In the end it is a worthwhile read as long as you look into the other books in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads more like a magazine than a book","review":"After reading \\"the Last Dive\\" I had great hopes for this book. But it was very disappointing, little depth or background, reads much more like a magazine article pulled together two minutes to deadline. I returned it for a refund -- glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate but disappointing","review":"I had just finished Shadow Divers when I jumped into Fatal Depth. That's a shame because Shadow Divers so overwhelms FD that a completely unbiased review may not have been possible.Haberstroh knits together the string of fatal dive incidents using the state of mind of dive boat captain Dan Crowell as the unifying thread. This attempt, though, turns up so little that the incidents really have to stand alone. As such, they seem like little more than incident investigations with perhaps a bit of background color for each of the victims. The author seems to have had no particular agenda and draws no conclusions. Even the status of a lawsuit described in the book's closing chapters is left unresolved.If you want a STORY, ready Shadow Divers. If you want research material on deep diving fatalities or just cannot get enough of the genre then by all means pick up Fatal Depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooooring!","review":"I actually had to forcefully keep my eyes open to finish reading this book. If you have read The Last Dive or Shadow Divers, you know that these books both share an immediacy and drama that reads like a novel. These are up-all-night page-turners that will leave you breathless. Fatal Depth was written like a summary of the author's short magazine articles about the events described; the book reads like the Coast Guard's accident files, lacking utter poignancy or interest. There is no attempt at defining the divers' characters or motives; as a result, we find ourselves feeling sorry for the victims but all the while unmoved by their two-dimensional profiles. Save your money and instead buy the aforementioned books. On a side note, this book's editing, as has been noted elsewhere, is aweful, inexcusable given the major publisher and the author's credentials"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pounding square pegs into round holes","review":"I hestitated before buying this book. It was by someone who worked at a one of those tax deductible foundations suposededly dedicated to improving the planet for their fellow man.

Well the writer of this book is constantly twisting facts to fit his preconceived conclusions or to say it another way, pounding square pegs into round holes.

The oil is oderless which is good, but before buying, be sure that you want \\"shea oil\\", and not shea butter or any type of natural oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off with regular shea butter","review":"So, as someone who loves all natural products from the earth and as someone who is in love with African shea butter, I expected this oil to sort of be as good as shea butter, just in oil form. I'm not sure what this is. It's super thick and oily, but just not as efficient as shea butter. It's a little grainy too.It has zero moisturizing properties like other oils like coconut oil or olive oil. It's straight up greasy- doesn't absorb well into the skin or hair shaft.

And doesn't do anything exactly what I read. It didn't even make my hair soft. So I was really disappointed. I accidentally spilled it on my bathroom counter. My counter is granite and for some reasons it accumulates a powdery substance that I can't get rid of. My husband says it's the minerals from the water. Well, I wiped it on the counter and it got rid of it. So now I use that on my bathroom counter top and the powdery stuff stays away.

This one will astonished anyone looking for fast Alvin Lee electric licks (if that's what you are looking for, don't get this album). If you want to share a pure moment of retreat under the wooded forest, in company of Alvin, then, go for it, you will enjoy the serenity this album will bring you.

For example, there is no doubt the Bible calls for assistance for the poor, but there is no explicit biblical statement about whether this should be solely a matter of private charity or also a matter of state assistance. Bandow sets forth several criteria for applying Scripture to the modern state, but also offers biblical criteria for Christians to think on particular issues when there is no explicit biblical principle. Bandow is clearly leans in a libertarian direction, and he doesn't convince me in several key areas, but he's thoughtful and fair.

With self-important theorizing on the meaning of this-and-that, and hackneyed philosophizing on the significance of some banal lyrics or events, this book attempts to pass off various cliches as meaningful metaphors for other cliches. Nothing much is really said, nothing interesting is really brought out by his observations, and his attempts at capturing meaning leave one with the sense of \\"So What?\\".This book is another in a tired line of works on the sixties based on repititious mythologies and platitudes. It's useful if you are looking for some form of validation; however, one would be better off sticking to VH1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal claptrap, verbose, NOT worth using as toilet paper","review":"As complete waste of money, not worth using as substitute for toilet paper !

Even when Dr. Rains himself was teaching the class, the book was entirely confusing. This textbook is not user friendly and certainly does not achieve the goal of teaching psychology students about cognitive neuropsychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This textbook is one of the poorest works I've had to deal with in college. The materal is not organized well, the topics are out of date, and the chapters are difficult to read. I agree with other reviewers that the book needed to be reworked.Although Rains may know his stuff, he fails to show he can communicate that knoweldge in a way that is both interesting and educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to understand","review":"I know this is not supposed to be easy stuff to get, but the way the book is written makes it all the harder to comprehend. I know classes where this book is required, and fear taking it. In previous courses, Rains required Carl Sagan, and other authors who had a crisp and interesting approach to the topic of the human brain and behavior. This book is too dry and uninteresting.Dr. Rains does know his stuff. He lacks the ability and warmth to communicate it in this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book badly in need of a rewrite","review":"This text book sets out to be all things to all people, and ends up falling short on all counts. I tend to agree with the other reviews, but something more can be said for the style of the writing. Rains paces his material at a snails pace, and often his references are off. His style lacks the crisp humanness of other authors and he seems to be so engrossed in the material, that he has forgotten how to instill the text with passion and fun, the things that attracted me to the subject of neurology in the early days of my career, the so called \\"sense of wonder\\", is missing here. What we get are just the facts, and the author seems intent on showing everyone how much he knows. This leaves the reader overwhelmed and tired.Rains should have spent more time reworking his style, and injected it with verve and life. He, like one of his idols, William James, is often beyond the scope of human understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better work is out there","review":"I reviewed this book for a class on neuropsych for next year, having seen an advanced copy. I was disappointed that the writting is so dry, the topics covered briefly, and that several mistakes appear in the text. The book serves as a complex edition, more for those with a solid background in the subject than for someone just starting out.Rains seems fixated on the images of William James and Sigmund Freud. While Freud started with a background in neurology, he soon left for other, more notorous studies. James, while well thought of as a man of science, also fell short of a scientific method in several areas.The author, while obviously well versed in the subject, seems to have no skill for communicating that knowledge. I myself, had a hard time understanding his style, which is often obtuse.For educators, there are better and more comprehensive textbooks out there on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Messy Affair","review":"This book tries to be detailed and cover a subject that is complicated and broad. Ideally a textbook, the book fails on almost every level to satisfy. The research is scattered, the writting is dull, and the analogies are almost non-existant. The author seems to give off a certain air of superiority to his readers, rather than the joy and wonder of the subject one may find in Pinker or Oliver Sachs.I feel sorry for the students who may loose a love of a great subject as they read this book. A very disappointing attempt.One ultimately wonders who Rains is writting for. The editors should have sensed the writting lacks a certain crispness that grabs readers rather than repels them. Overall, not a book to read if you want to be entertained while gaining knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"If required, buy it used","review":"I found this book used online, and was glad I did not pay full price. The other reviews bring out the essential points I have against this book, style of presentation, poorly organized, outdated references....so I need not add to them. I doubt this book will find the audence it seeks. It will not become a standard text in neuropsycholgy as it fails at it's basic point...to teach.I do not doubt the author knows his material. But knowing a subject does not mean one is qualified or capable of presnting it to others. The text creates more problems than it solves. I would not recommend it to anyone interested in learning about this amazing subject, as far better texts exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this text book!","review":"I actually was forced to use this book for a course and shelled out hard earned cash for it! Turns out, the teacher never even used it, and instead taught from other, more professional sources.

I was able to return it to the bookstore and get some money back, but the book isn't being used next semseter anyway.

The sex takes second place to the love that starts to evolve between 2 very different people, he's a cynical cop, she's a small-town teacher. There's a lot of sex of course, but for once he's the one who would like more and she wants to keep it purely physical.

This world is one in which the land is alive just as man is, and the closeness that people have with the land makes for a more complete life. Hogan's descriptions make the reader feel for the Indians and even yearn for the simplicity of the old Indian ways that are shown to be being lost throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put Down!","review":"You know when you read a book and your sad when its over because you just want to keep living in that moment of what's going on in the book?

The novel, based on true story, really touch me and makes me feel for the Indians. The Indian seems unlikely to win the 'confrontation' against the white government.

Of course, I am not a very big comedy fan. Most comedies to me are not funny, but stupid.Honestly, I think the Number 23 was some of Carrey's better work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It!!!!!","review":"I am a huge Carrey fan, but this movie absolutely blows. The story makes no sense, and it is nothing like the previews indicate. Absolutely absurd, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I wish I could say something positive, but I can't. The movie is so dark and dreary it is actually hard to see, not just difficult to watch. Characters are introduced randomly that have seemingly nothing to do with the plot, and why Virginia Madsen is still making big screen movies I'll never know. Wasn't she the one from the original Candyman movie? I guess she made some kind of comeback in an indie film a few years ago, but she is terribly vapid in this movie. Carrey is all over the place, with the facial expressions of the Cable Guy, set on the backdrop of \\"the Grudge.\\" I give it 2 stars for trying to be creative but even Carrey can't save this trainwreck of a film.

I can't even believeJim would play in such a stupid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"\`Number 23' a big ZERO","review":"I'm sorry, but this movie is a total piece of garbage. All of these fine actors have wasted their time. I've never seen such a disjointed pile of nonsense in all my life. It's a giant mess. It's not scary, suspenseful, or interesting, nor does the story make a lick of sense. As a viewer, I felt cheated and insulted by the ham-handed way the filmmakers cobbled together a \\"surprise\\" ending. The only reason it could be seen as a surprise is due to the fact that you wouldn't believe professional writers and filmmakers would attempt to provide such a ridiculous and implausible solution to their story. To make matters worse, I didn't like the way the picture was shot either; particularly the \\"fantasy\\" sequences, which I found jarringly annoying. They upset what little mood the film had and took me out of the story.Don't allow the well-edited trailer fool you. I wouldn't suggest you give this aggravating movie even a minute of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"urgh!","review":"It pisses me off that hacks like these are allowed to steal the ideas of brilliant dead guys like William Burroughs and Robert Anton Wilson and make such tepid swill.

I mean, as a dogcatcher maybe, but can you buy him as a hard-boiled detective? No. It's ludicrous, despite the gritty and saturated look in those scenes. Suspension of disbelief just vanishes in those scenes.Otherwise, it's entertaining enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"23 min is enough of this garbage, really sucks.","review":"Jim Carrey has reached an all time low, this movie was really bad, do not waste 23 dollars on this, 23 min into to it, you will feel ripped off. Do not even rent this, glad we did not buy it. Enough said, you are warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Number 23 - thrilling and exciting!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this mysterious, intriguing film. I went into the theatre knowing nothing about the movie except that it was about the number 23, the main character was seeing the number everywhere, and Jim Carrey plays that main character. Little did I know that the movie would unwind into a scary obsession with the number 23 - an obsession that led to extreme paranoia, murder, mystery, and a little red book penned by a mysterious author. Jim Carrey shines in this compelling, dark thriller. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no!!!! It's a number! And it's coming after me!!!!!!","review":"\\"Number 23\\" is the worst movie I have seen in the past 5 years and it just reinforces my belief that Jim Carrey is the most over-rated actor to have ever received a check for acting services rendered. The plot is just dumb. They could have at least used a REALLY scary number, the Fibonacci number. But, no. 23. 23 is like a cute fuzzy kitten compared to the golden ratio.Take it off your netflix queue.

Carey? Well, I guess he is trying to break out of his obnoxious 'look at me! look at me!' comedy personality and I don't think he did a bad job. The concept is interesting but when they put it all together it just wasn't that good. Don't want to give anything away but I have seen movies with this type of ending way too much lately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"I would have given this a rating of 2 or 3 but you know. I was so excited about this movie because it is very differen't from most of his other movies. The story starts out VERY slow. You start to fall asleep right away. Then it starts showing him as the character in the book he is reading. This makes things very confusing. It keeps jumping from one character to another. Then when you find out what actually happened. (in the last 15 minutes) It makes no sense and it leaves so many dead ends and questions that you ask yourself why you watched it all. I have never wanted to leave during a movie but I wanted to leave after 15 or 20 minutes of this one. The only reason I didn't it because my mother and I went to see it and I thought she liked it. Only to find out she hated it and didn't leave because she thought I liked it. I would deffenitly rent this instead of buy it. Jim if you are reading this stay away from the guys that made this movie. Far far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was expecting a cheesy psycho-thriller.

Pretty much everything else. (And, okay, Carrey as a a-hole to animals when he's an animal control officer immediately made him completely unlikable for me. It was pretty much downhill from there--and that was the first scene.)Movies like this need a character to like and root for--someone. For me, as talented as the actors in it are, there was absolutely no one to like or care about. I couldn't wait for it to be over--and the \\"mystery\\" was a huge let-down as well.A \\"fail\\" on pretty much every level--plot and character. Even the structure was darkly filmed and quite choppy.
