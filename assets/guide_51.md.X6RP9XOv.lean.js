But you should always let the music speak (I love it!) and it is not necessary always to exaggerate the darker musical happenings within the staging. This is a film I do not want to see more than once. It is terribly ugly, dirt grey althrough - and with rather much overacting. There is BEAUTY in the score, you can see nothing of it in this scenery and direction. As for Ms. Rysanek however, she clearly shows that she could have given us Elektra on the stage. Varnay is partly overacting. Catarina Ligendza gives some of the warmth that a Chrysotemis surely is expected to. I think I must mention here that I greatly admire all these artists, Varnay - I just adore her - in Wagner, Ligendza (in Wagner), and Rysanek, in amonger other fields, Wagner and Strauss, notably The Empress."},{"rating":"2","title":"beaders review","review":"This book has a lot to teach you on the basics.

While I would have liked to see more of how Plath's favorite authors influenced her, there is enough new material (letter and journal excerpts, as well as the author's observations) to make it a worthwhile addition to the ever-growing pile of books on the legendary Sylvia Plath. A good study for beginners and scholars alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I have been shopping on Amazon for a long time but never thought to search for \\"espresso pods\\" but I am so glad that I did. This pod is awesome! It is smooth and creamy and tastes sooooo good. In fact, I just ran out of them and went to Starbucks for my morning latte and it just tastes like cr@p. I was buying Starbucks pods for about 10 years and using them in my old Barista machine but their espresso is super bitter and often tastes like the bottom of an ashtray but finding another pod until now was and seemed almost impossible. This purchase has just confirmed what I already suspected... Starbucks is just more American cr@p that they are trying to pass off as I don't know what.This pod is like that love you have been searching for all your life and suddenly you meet and realize that the last 10 years could have been so much better. Then you get angry for dating all those other idiots. Oh wait.... this is a product review.

Tastes good and I would have 3 or 4 shots every morning. The pods make the espresso making process much quick and clean. However, my only gripe is that each pod is individually wrapped in a blue plastic pouch, like in the product photo. If you make as much coffee as I do, this amounts to a lot of trash!

I had been buying Illy ese pods from Sur La Table and the cost was astronomical. I was looking for a tasty and cheaper replacement...That being said, I will keep looking. These Lavazza ese pods are not great at all. They are poorly made, the espresso is somewhat loose in the pod and not packed properly. A few of my pods were not sealed all around the edges and the grounds leaked out into the foil packet rendering them unusable. The filter material itself is very cottony and ends up soaking up your brewed espresso rather than just filtering it through into your cup.While it does produce a beautiful crema, the espresso flavor is flat with no body, no tone, no aroma, no nothing. I was a professional barista for years and I know good espresso. This is NOT worth the cost, even with free shipping. You will end up with a cup of muddy, gritty, acidic brown water.

Don't waste your $10 bucks on this lousy product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dance of Despair","review":"The subject matter is obviously heavy and weighs the audience down as much as the protagonist, but this is a mostly successful (if highly earnest) adaptation of the famed memoir by prize-winning documentarian Barbara Gordon. With such a lukewarm endorsement, my five-star rating may seem unwarranted, but this movie deserves a wide audience for one reason, as far as I'm concerned, and that's Geraldine Page's stunning supporting turn as the cancer-ravaged poet about whom Gordon is producing her latest work. The scene in the hospital, when Page explodes at Clayburgh, for the sentimentality of the documentary, will raise all the hair on your body and is further proof of Page's greatness. That she was not nominated for an Academy Award for this lacerating performance is an irrevocable blight on the movie industry.One day Page will get her due.

Much of it has been fabricated.","review":"\\"Blood and Banquets\\" is a fascinating book and a good read. The reader thinks that he/she is getting a behind-the-scenes look at the Nazis' rise to power. It turns out that much of Fromm's book is fabricated. Historian Henry A. Turner has examined the veracity of the book in his article \\"Two Dubious Third Reich Diaries,\\" in the journal Central European History, volume 33, no. 3 (Sept. 2000). Turner shows why this book should be regarded with skepticism and not relied upon as a historical source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction","review":"Current thinking is that Fromm fabricated alot of this book.

The book was apparently written after her move to the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"This is one of the best 'diaries' or memoirs I have ever read concerning the Third Reich. Bella Fromm was a German Jewish woman who worked as a social columnist until the Nazis forbade Jews from being published under their own names. She traveled in international and diplomatic circles and met/observed all of the top Nazis, including Hitler. Her diary traces the beginnings of Hitler and his policies from the 20's up until 1938 when she was finally able to emigrate to the United States. It's very interesting, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Hat","review":"I love this boonie hat. It is has more style and is better looking than some other very floppy hats. The brim keeps its shape well all the way around: you can turn it up and it will stay put, or you can turn it down, or you can snap the sides up and it looks like a cowboy hat. The neck cord is very useful if any sudden breeze comes up. This hat is much cooler than any baseball cap I've ever worn, and keeps your face shaded all the way around. In 90 degree heat it feels at least 10 degrees cooler under there, with no perspiration. The underside is dark and seems to cut glare. You can fold the hat in half, then in quarters, and stow it easily. The Medium was a tad tight for me and I thought I had a relatively small head circumference, but it fits my 12 year old; I am ordering another hat-- Large--right now. Oatmeal color is like stone and a nice neutral color."},{"rating":"1","title":"not firm, small.","review":"in the discription it says it has a firm brim which is false. it's floppy and wouldn't hold up a penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hat to wear summer time","review":"The hat arrived much soonner than it was promised.

As it turns out, that song was \\"Bucket Seat\\" by Sam Bisbee, and the whole song was every bit as good as the few bars that made the commercial. Bisbee's style is an easygoing American pop/rock that feels very familiar and comfortable. There's not a lot of variety between the tracks, but the main source of enjoyment from the music is the lyrics, which are variously humorous and sarcastic as well as love-sick and nostalgic. I find it is the perfect album to pop in when I want to listen to something other than the radio, but I'm not sure what I want to listen to.

This Jesus character who claims to be trying to make sense of everything speaks in Parables which means you have to translate everything he says.I can't help but feeling that all the authors that have been placed into this compilation lost track of the main goals that they were going for and really created a lot of confusion that would only lead to arguments and possibly oppression of people based on misinterpreted or absolutely wrong ideals.For this I feel this book is not worth anyone's time in reading unless you are a glutton for punishment and don't mind the lack of cohesive story throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Connecticut","review":"I paid the \\"guaranteed' over night delivery which was not extravagant but a lot more than 3 day delivery.

The cleansing of the soap itself isn't while not bad isn't very good. It is not overly harsh and can be used twice a day with no problems. It just doesn't seem to me to have any lifting action.

What I'm hoping is that I won't gain it back this time; that I can just continue eating the same, 1800, and my body, which fights me to gain, will be happy with the lower weight.

I cautiously tried it again a few days later, one dose, itching and hives, took another antihistamine and that relieved the symptoms. I've taken lots of supplements and this has NEVER happened. Please be cautious! I was trying this based on the recent research about CLA and Crohns disease.

The 2 cardboard box/liners inside help keep the shape of the bag and provide some mild protection against simple crushing. The items included are of fairly good quality. Enough room to add some additional items (e.g., a multi-tool or swiss army knife, small roll of toilet paper, small radio, etc).

The barbed wire match is great, if you don't mind ALOT of blood. The menus are easy to get around, letting you set up a match in less than a minute. The CD Load time is quick too, and in fact is faster than Attitude. And, personally, nothing is more beautiful than seeing RVD do a 5-Star-Frog-Splash from the top of a steel cage. Parents should be warned, however, that this game contains alot of very strong language and blood. Overall though, this is a great game, so I give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real shame","review":"ECW deserves alot more than what this game gave it. Essentially, this is the exact same game as WWF Attitude (Attitude was good for it's time, but that was a along time ago in video game time). The barbwire match is dumb. The only difference is that when an opponent is thrown to the ropes he falls down and holds his back. The cage match is weak as hell....all Acclaim cage matches suck. The worst part of this is that the majority of matches you play in career mode are just normal matches! NOT ECW MATCHES! You'd think since this is ECW all matches would be hardcore rules, but no. Just basic matches with a few gimmick matches thrown in. I'm really disappointed about this game. It deserved so much better. If ya gotta play it, RENT FIRST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gameis O.K","review":"This game is o.k but it takes to long to load and even loner to load on a PS2 system I was not apeccting anything better that it was because Acclaim because they can;t make wreslting games and when I go into death math mode I only got the table in the corner of the area once in about 20 times. But I loved the barded wire math the should make more wwe game with blood or a on or off button for the blood.

SURE, ALL THE ECW FAVORITES ARE HERE, SUCH AS ROB VAN DAM, TAZ [WHO'S HIDDEN IN THIS GAME], JUSTIN CREDIBLE, RHYNO, AND MORE. BUT, THE GRAPHICS ARE BAD AND THE GAME IS A REAL BORE TO PLAY. UNLIKE OTHER WRESTLING GAMES, THIS HAS AN M RATING AND IS VERY PROFANE (...) AND VERY BLOODY. OTHER THAN THAT, NO BACKSTAGE ACTION, NO STAIRWAY TO HELL MATCHES, NO SANDMAN, AND ALMOST NO REAL ECW MUSIC TO EVEN HEAR, MAKES THIS THE WORST WRESTLING GAME OF ALL TIME.

One has an infra-red beam, which makes a beeping noise when something moves in front of the beam and blocks it. The other has a sensor, which triggers a beeping noise when the sensor is moved. I enjoy using these to keep my family away from where they don't belong (my moms always going through my stuff)! The only reason i gave fun a 4 instead of a 5, is because sometimes the beam is hypersensative, and will just go off at random times. Overall, however, it is a really cool toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Bible translation around","review":"I have the Oxford/Cambridge edition of this Bible published in 1989. The format and text used is identical to the current version. I cannot recommend the REB enough. This translation has a fantastic literary style. The language used is both majestic and readable. I have several translations of the Bible, but this is the only translation that I have encountered where I was not constantly being reminded that I was reading a translation, rather than the original document. Along with classic Bible translations like the Authorized Version and the Douay-Rheims Version, the REB has the makings of a literary classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, dignified, but slightly biased.","review":"The text of this bible is the best ever, since the Authorised Version, as far as dignity and readability are concerned. However, I have found a definate liberal bias in the translation. For example the Greek word for homosexual is translated \\"sexual pervert\\" in one passage of the REB; the actual Greek word is very specific. In fact Paul uses two Greek words in the passage one which refers to a person recieving a homosexual act, and one which refers to a person performing a homosexual act (there is no such distinction in English). Overall the translation is good and fair with the facts, but the reader should be aware of the translators' biases. On balance, these \\"gaffs\\" probably won't make much difference in the quality of a person's relationship with Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I played WM2K before this. When I looked at it, the barbed wire ring seemed nice, so I rented it.I wish I hadn't.It's got many features WM2K has, including Create-A-PPV, Career Mode and more. Throw in configurable matches, many known wrestlers and it seems this game is as good as WM2K. Right? Wrong. There were many things which irritated me a lot. Among the foremost were the impossibility of executing certain moves, like the Irish Whip (I wish I could just whip the enemy into the barbed wire). Another thing is that the commentator sometimes referred to the two wrestlers as \\"Player 1\\" and \\"Player 2\\", which annoyed me. The difficulty of a great deal more things, which could have been done with one mere button press in WM2K, served only to aggravate me (the manual doesn't even explain how to read the moves list found in-game). Overall, matching up fights and designing wrestlers is good for this game, but the core of it, the actual gaming, is lacking terribly. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hardcore Revolution\\" is as \\"extreme\\" as TNN's ECW","review":"I bought it on the first day, thinking it would be possibly the most hardcore wrestling game ever. I was disappointed, to say the least. (I returned it the same day.)ECW itself is entertaining and a great alternative to WWF or (ugh) WCW. However, the game is boring! Joey Styles' commentating is barely there, and the fast-paced action we expect from ECW is watered down--even WCW is more hardcore than this! The game features a great cast of characters, but it lacks several key characters (like The Sandman). The assortment of weapons is more diverse than any game, but they pack no punch.Unless you want to play more of the same boring Acclaim wrestling, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"better games on n64","review":"If you really want to play with ECW wrestlers then get WWf No Mercy and create an ECW roster.

I bought WWF Warzone and i bought this one, just because it was a HUGE step for a great wrestling federation in EC F'N W! Yet i am truly disappointed. I personally think THQ should take ECW up as their follow up to WWF WM2K! The only good thing about this game is the new and vast modes it offers. If they make another ECW game except this time from THQ (with their play control) they should include all the game modes. Plus, have some backstage and \\"in the crowd\\" fights.

It combines excellent grammer and word lessons into one book and presents them using actual articles published in Japan. This is my 2nd copy--the forst one disintegred from over use.If it has a weakness, it is in the organization of the definitions. It is difficult to find the definitions of kanji presented in the texts. This book was first published before the advent of word processors.

The author writes a good hunting story. He also hunts in different places in the USA which makes his book applicable for many places geographically.

There were 5 small bulbs, in the size we bought, and rather then give an overall even lighting, they showed 5 separate spots of light. The light quality itself was unpleasant and it strained your eyes to look at the paintings. When we bought them the dealer said that they were non-returnable. Now we understand why. They must have had so many returns that they had to make that policy. Rather then give them away and inflict them on someone else, we threw them out in spite of the rather expensive price. We understood that The House of Troy has been in business for a long time and has a good reputation, so we were quite shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisis and Catharsis","review":"Well written and researched book on the Book of Revelation.

Neither Jade nor Tanner are immoral people but both they and Tanner's mother make decisions that harm the guilty and innocent alike. I thought this book clearly showed the consequences of wrong choices and ignoring the voice of God.This book also shows that God is a God of forgiveness and second chances. When we confess our sins, He forgives them and puts them as far away as east is from west. Sometimes we have to live with the consequences forever, even when we're forgiven. And sometimes the door is opened to something even better.In addition to the above, the reader will learn a lot about the erosion of religious freedom in America today.

I'll tell you, it doesn't happen very often, and even when it tries to, it often glorifies the experience in such a way that you're not sure of their actual message.

I figured I would only be watching Matt (the teacher), but I ended up loving the whole concert!! JL has a greatr voice and hot dance moves. Not to mention - hes hott. No I don't havea crush on him, but I love his music. He's great other than being able to play OVER 10 INSTRUMENTS, JL writes and performs all of his songs. Just try the CD - I guarantee you'll love it. (I especially like the songs \\"Burn\\" and \\"You're the Only One\\") If you want to tell someone how much you love them, play \\"You're the Only One\\" for them- it's a really sweet song. Basically JL is not good, but great!!!! Buy the CD you'll love it!! I'm not even kidding.

If listless disco-funk and poppy soul is your thing and you were sporting an afro or mullett 30 years ago and wanna revisit old haunts, then go for it. If you're a crate-digger type, don't be fooled by titles.

While different, the two books share a similar theme: community makes a difference in the lives of those in trouble. Both novels don't preach to the reader but they do inspire. I loved the main character, although at times I struggled with some of her decisions. In the end, I knew that she was on her way and it was all thanks to the beautiful, yet diverse characters who helped her. The themes of both novels are timeless and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story of perseverance and love","review":"A Place Called Wiregrass is a story of perseverance and love. Its main character, Erma Lee could be the story of any woman who faces hardship in the form of poverty, abuse and low self-esteem. Anyone who reads Michael Morris' first novel will see how accurately he has portrayed the life of someone whom society views as being \\"at the bottom of the barrell.\\" The spiritual storyline is a true representation of the place and time in which Erma Lee, Miss Claudia and all the characters in this debut novel find themselves. And for Erma Lee, it's the avenue she finds to rise above the negativity and chaos in her pre-Wiregrass life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For Our Book Group","review":"I'm a native of Mississippi who now lives in the Northeast. I wish that I could claim that I selected this novel for our recent book group discussion but I cannot. Why do I wish that I would have selected it? As I told my club, this novel captures the heart of the rural south and the strength of 'real' southern women. It's the perfect picture of small town life with the 'haves' and the 'have nots'. That said...whether you are from the south or not, you can't put down this book about a good ole girl trying to start over again and the elderly, wonderful Miss Claudia who steps in to help her while also having to face up to a dark secret from her own past. I can't say enough good things about this one. Loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"A nice read, quick page turner, but not much to tax the mind. Most of the characters are pretty stereotypical and the plot is rather simple. Kind of similar to reading a formula book: poor woman is taken in by rich lonely woman who wants a daughter and finds that she is needed by SOMEONE and with the help of God saves another soul. I too look forward to Mr. Morris' next book since this may have been his test first novel, and hopefully he has read other Southern writers such as Faulkner for reaching below the surface and finding some depth to his story."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE of buying this book","review":"In this debut novel I was drawn into the story because of its honesty, its character development and its subject. However, it becomes obvious that this is an initial work for this author by his predictablity and his inaccuracies in the very difficult task of writing in a woman's voice. But the truly annoying part of the book comes after 3/4 of the novel when the main character \\"accepts Jesus into my heart\\" and attains direction, the light, and salvation. Too much! If you are a Christian you will see this book as powerful and very satisfying, but no where on the fly leaf or the back cover does it say it is of this genre. I felt ripped off and betrayed. If I had read SOMEWHERE that it is a Christian book I would have thought: \\"sounds interesting, but not for me\\" and I would not have bought it. So, if you are a Christian you should definitely give this book a second look, if you are not then you may be offended by its directions and its outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Disagree","review":"Poorly written and with a tired plot, \\"A Place Called Wiregrass\\" reads like a rejected episode of \\"Touched by an Angel.\\" The characters are flat, the dialect obnoxious and unbelievable, and the religious elements grafted on like a necessary but unconvincing afterthought."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL WOMEN AND REAL LIFE","review":"FINALLY A NOVEL ABOUT SOUTHERN WOMEN THAT DOES NOT PAINT THEM AS DIRT EATING FOOLS!

IT IS THE MORE REFINED MISS CLAUDIA THAT WON MY HEART. I FINISHED THIS NOVEL THINKING THAT I NEED A MISS CLAUDIA IN MY OWN LIFE. THIS IS REAL LIFE (FRIENDSHIP, FAITH, HURTS AND DREAMS).

Being a native of the real Wiregrass (Dothan, Al) I can speak to the authenticity of the characters and the dialect.Reading this book was like a visit back home.

The anthemic \\"Finest Worksong\\" and the horn-ridden \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" are also spectacular. Plus, have any of you noticed how much \\"Lightning Hopkins\\" resembles the style of the present-day Red hot Chili Peppers !?! Who's plagiating who, then? But the most notable change are the lyrics, which have taken a much more political features on this album, due to the Reagan era depression.

There's lots of sleaze and glamour when Annie and her husband Max attend a Southern Book Fair on this island. If I have a complaint about these books, it is that each one always puts Annie or her nearest and dearest as prime suspects in the murder. Why can't they just try to solve a murder because it happens in their vicinity, not because one of them is suspected of killing someone?

Their relationship, in my mind, was just plain old dysfunctional. The author created no real emotion for me to feel although she talked about it constantly. I just didn't get it, feel it, want it, anything!! And the sex scenes were just blah. Corum didn't set the scenes well, didn't write the characters well, didn't describe anything enough for me to feel it, or be there.

I've had the standard DVD version for several years and, played on my Oppo upconverting DVD player, it was fine. Still, when the Blu Ray version came out I ordered it right away, foolishly ahead of the reviews.As it turns out, this is one of those lousy Blu Ray disks that was released without regard to image quality - merely to get it to market.

They should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this garbage on an unsuspecting public.The bottom-line; hereafter I'll wait for the reviews and not be duped again by studios that are after a quick buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder And Erotica","review":"Well acted and atmospheric modern noir thriller with Kathleen Turner creating sexual electricity in her debut role.

My favorite movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reconnecting with Body Heat","review":"This particular movie of excitement and intrigue has a dozen twists and turns and still, after all these years, (and having reviewed it several times before) is highly entertaining. I only wish it had not taken so long to arrive. I had to delay a \\"viewing party\\" while I waited. It is particularly fun to watch now with someone who has not seen it. Those folks are rare as this was a hit back in the 1980s, but younger people still can see it for the first time.Price is good.

Frankly, I can't tell the difference between the widescreen side and the pan & scan side. If you're a true movie aficionado, don't buy this title until Warner Bros remasters it correctly. If you just want to watch the movie and don't care about picture quality, then go ahead and buy it. But you've been warned.

He lives in a hot, humid Florida town and becomes dangerously involved with a married woman, Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner). They begin a torrid affair and soon the thought of killing Matty's wealthy, older husband is voiced. Matty's cuckolded husband is played by Richard Crenna and a young Mickey Rourke plays a scene stealing Teddy, the arsonist.This is a dark and enticing movie full of humid nights, guilt, passion, and violence. The story flows well and builds to a sizzling crafty amazing finish. \\"Body Heat\\" is one of the best and well worth any mystery lover's watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"great film, great price","review":"An excellent DVD for a great price. fast delivery and I was kept up to date on the status of my order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play in our DVR","review":"The movie is great or I wouldn't have ordered it...one of the classics....but it was ordered from Europe and must be encoded for European systems only.

This is a collection of short vampire stories by different authors. I don't know where else Anne Rice's first short story \\"The Master of Rampling Gate\\" is published other than the oop graphic novel I was lucky to find a long time ago. This is a must have for the vampire fanatic who's just getting into vampires and wants some tastes from classic to modern. Honestly I have only read the Anne Rice story. Other things in the book include Dracula's Guest (Bram Stoker), Close Behind Him (John Windam), and a bunch more by authors I don't really know any other stories by.Mine is published in 1993 which is probably the original publication, ISBN 1555219004."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This album is AWSOME!

When i finally listened to it, it moved me in such a way that i can't describe. I've been involved with music for 7-8 years of my life and no album compares to Mae's \\"The Everglow.\\" Each song carries a different personality and message, which rich chords and catchy melodies. I reccomend this album to anyone who appreciates music to the fullest and can respect the work these guys have put into this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAE is aMAEzing.","review":"This is an incredible change, but I love this CD possibly more than I did \\"Destination: Beautiful\\". They've grown lyrically and musically, and this CD is almost like a story from start to end. There isn't a single song you can skip on this one, for sure. The Prologue and Epilogue play a huge role in introducing and concluding the CD, a great idea and a great touch to \\"The Everglow\\".My three favorite songs on the CD are \\"We're So Far Away\\", \\"Suspension\\", and \\"Anything\\". What are yours?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Album!","review":"A few weeks ago I took what I thought was a risk on buying Mae's new album. It was a risk worth taking! Their previous album was good, not great, but not what some of the people in reviews above mine say about it. But \\"the Everglow\\" has really blown me away; I did not expect to find it to be such a strong album. It's almost on par with Jimmy Eat World's \\"Clarity\\" and if you know what a brilliant album that was then you understand that I'm giving \\"the Everglow\\" high accolades. \\"The Everglow\\" is diverse and overall just really beautiful music. The concept of the album as a story book is ingenious and it gives the whole project a sense of artistic substance that is rarely achieved by any bands today. \\"The Everglow\\" is a work of art, take a risk and I hope you'll enjoy as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best albums i own!","review":"This album is so much better than their first, Destination Beautiful, which i also liked. Great lyrics, great mixture of piano and guitar riffs and great vocals. They are definitely going to be really famous after this album. Every song is so good that i dont have just one favorite. This album is a must buy for any music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"I think that this album is worth more in one complete listen through than the individual tracks are. That's not taking anything away from any track, they're all great. But the theme of this cd is to take the listener on a ride and experience everything in between the first and last track - which is The Everglow. Even on the more emotional songs that deal with heavier topics, Dave Elkins, the lead singer of Mae, doesn't mind staying focused on the bright side of things; that's a welcomed change of pace in my music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"I bought this album after I'd spent some time listening to some of the songs on [...] and read a review about the concept of the album, which initially attracted me to it.Since listening to it, I can't see me ever buying another concept album. The artistry on this album seems to take a back seat to the 'story' which gives the whole thing the feeling of being overly contrived. I also had a problem with the different personalities expressed in the music, it seemed like the thread that linked all the songs together was the concept and, nothing else. There's definitely a style that is inherent across the album, but it's not strong enough for my liking.Individually, there are some great songs on this album. 'Everglow', 'Suspension', 'Anything', and 'Someone Else's Arms' are all pretty good songs, and if you're a patient person, these along with a few others maybe even make it worth the purchase... but not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, just wow","review":"i was skeptical when a friend said she had and extra ticket to a concert of a band called mae. i had never heard of them before and the minute i started playing, i was hooked. when i got home i bought this cd and they have never let me down. the songs are great, beautiful songwriting. forget what you know about \\"christian rock\\" these guys are the real deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied to say the least...","review":"When I first bought it, I took peoples advice and just put it in my cd player, took out the booklet, and listened to the cd from beginning to end.At first, to be honest, I didn't really like it. The first song, \\"We're So Far Away\\", may be one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard... a flat out ballad, it almost made me say \\"aww\\" out loud a few times. However, in general as the cd progressed, not many of the songs are catchy right off the bat, like a lot of the songs from Destination:Beautiful (e.g. summertime).However, after listening to each of the songs a few times over, I'm addicted. When I started really paying attention to the blends of guitar, piano, and voice, i fell in love...Half of the tracks could easily be prom songs, and suspension could easily become a billboard single if advertised.If your liked Mae's first album, or are a fan of Something Corporate and more of the emotional \\"girlier\\" (to some) type of music, you'll love this.highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I listened to a little bit of every song on iTunes and I was hooked. Not as hardcore as Hawthorne Heights (another pretty good band) but perfect for when you don't want someone screaming at you. I would like to highlight the title track \\"The Everglow\\". This is probably my favorite song on the album. A close second would probably be \\"Mistakes We Knew We Were Making\\". Probably my favorite part about this band is that they have yet to be infected with \\"MTV-intitus\\" that seems to ruin so many bands that start out cool *cough* Fall Out Boy *cough*. The artwork in the booklet is AMAZING and is definetly worth owning. I have (and will continue to) recommend this CD to anyone interested. Also see MxPx, Rufio, Relient K, (I saw all them in concert and was that not the best night of my life) Hawthorne Heights, Anberlin, Rise Against, Sum 41, Five Iron Frenzy, My Chemical Romance, and Yellowcard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good follow-up to Destination: Beautiful","review":"The Everglow is a testament to Mae's maturation as a band - they go for a fuller sound, and kudos for creating the story that is The Everglow, complete with the storybook album booklet and narrator to guide you along. The songs are crafted well, although I personally think they might have tried a bit too hard in the lyrics department - the words lost the groundedness and relevance that it had in Destination: Beautiful, and instead focused on fabricating a story.Nonetheless, this is not Destination rehashed - The Everglow stands on its own perfectly well. I'd recommend it!Favourite tracks:This Is The Countdown - the melody embodies the lyrics; brilliant songPainless - great rock track with excellent lyricsThe Ocean - beautiful, hope-filled songThe Everglow - one happy, inspiring numberThe Sun And The Moon - wistful and lovely; perfect way to end off the album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Pop/Emo","review":"It's probably a masterpiece as far as Christian rock goes, but how much does that really say?

Although most of them were enemy aircraft.I finished the game in around 3 hours which makes its lasting appeal minimal.

I can not believe it has taken me so many years to finally get this album. The Christmas Song - is of course the song I was most familiar with since it is played constantly during Holiday time.

I often find it hard to purchase a new CD that I already have based on \\"digitally remastering\\" but this is such a classic and the sound quality on the original CD that I have was so poor that I decided to purchase it.

From the eponymous mawkish opener onwards, nothing could be more emblematic of the deadening, empty side of Christmas. \\"Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe / Help to make the season bright\\" croons Nat in his syrupy voice. How romantic is a slab of dead beast? Another real highlight is the near-hysterical fakeness of 'Come All Ye Faithful', with its film-music style backing chorus. By the time we reach 'The Happiest Christmas Tree', a truly moronic ditty, any sane person will be reaching for the carpet cutter. Don't do it, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"W.

It was nice to see an ending to kenshin story, but it was just too tragic. It should have been a happier ending. However, this was a excellent anime from the drawings to the story line.

I might only see this because of the music. I have heard there will be some good heavy rock/metal in this. It said above that if you enjoyed this you will like \\"Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses\\" from Slipknot. Sometime they'll bring back King Kong though.

I stayed faithful to Chucky through all his movies, but this was embarrassingly bad. Even Jennifer Tilly who was sexy in the 'Bride of Chucky' is now a fat joke and cliche of herself.You really got to put your mind in neutral for this. First you have to see that this movie is about the making of the next Chucky movie. Then you have to let it go that the two monster dolls can actually conceive offspring.

You figure; you've got a couple of dolls possessed by murderous spirits and who somehow go around murdering people for fun and right away you can forget all about suspension of disbelief. Anything is okay here, since the premise is so absurd. This is not a horror film, it is primarily a comedy with a bit of blood. And Jennifer Tilly is hysterical as herself playing the screen idea of herself: on a diet, sneaking candy bars, ready to play a sexy version of the Virgin Mary for a film done by Rapper Redman. It is so good to see a gorgeous woman on screen who doesn't look like she's starving to death.And, oh, yeah, the special effects are incredible. All done with puppets, not CGI. Very impressive.

First of all some of the characters like Jennifer or Redman play themselves. I don't know about you but it is kind of weird knowing that they are playing themselves and not a made-up character like in the other child's play films. However there are some nice scenes in this movie including Chucky killing Britney Spears and Tiffany cutting out Redmans intestines. I do think that I liked Child's Play a little more in the first three films before Chucky got any sort of family.

With the introduction of Glen their whatever (i think son) I was excited about the possibility. But the premise of putting them in hollywood just seeems wrong. It seems extremely campy in a bad way.

This movie reminded me of Wes Craven's New Nightmare it was not scary at all and it had the actual actress Jeniffer Tilly star as herself in the movie which made it seem all the more ridicules and if that wasn't enough they cast rapper Redman in the movie as well!! I don't know why rappers think they can act on screen but in my opinion they should stick with being phooney gangsters over the sound waves it's best they stick with what luck they might have already.

If you are a fan of the Child's Play series, you were probably disappointed in Bride of Chucky and hoped for a better sequel next time around...Seed of Chucky doesn't do it, and I think they should stop making money out of Chucky and let him rest in peace. This sequel feels like \\"Scary Movie: Chucky Edition\\"...the elements of suspense and apprehension are lost, replacing with comedy and humorous gore. Please don't buy or rent this if you are thinking you are going to watch a horror movie, because Seed of Chucky isn't one...unless you want to see Chucky masturbating or Jennifer Tilly's stupidity, please avoid this movie at all cost.

The remote works, at least, and it shuts off when it gets tilted, so all that is good. However, the thermostat in this thing is awful- it doesn't measure the room temperature but measures instead the plastic heat in the back of the unit, which heats quickly so the unit shuts off and you can't force it back on. Overall, it does not do the job. They need to move the thermostat and get a stronger fan in this thing. Don't bother buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"HONEYWELL OSCILLATING HEATER","review":"I LIKE THE HEATER BECAUSE IT IS SMALL, OSCILLATES, AND PUTS OUT A LOT OF HEAT.

Thot the other guys that had this problem were just unlucky, and decided to trust the Honeywell name. Boy, was I wrong. SureSet, my foot. The thermostat in this device does indeed seem to be measuring the temperature of the unit itself, although not the actual element, maybe the heated plastic body. I do not recommend that anyone buys this heater if they want to use the automatic mode. It functions well in the high and low constant heating mode. I have a lasko 5365 heater as well, that works well in all modes.Update: Lasko 5365 is displaying same odd thermostat behaviour, I am beginning to think this behaviour is a product of the environment where the heater is used, and not just poor manufacturer design.Update 2: Confirmed that 5365 thermostat works fine if heater placed in middle of open space to be heated as opposed to against a wall. HZ-338 thermostat performance doesn't seem to improve when in open area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermostat doesn't work","review":"Ditto the other's observations... The thermostat seems to register the temperature of the unit itself rather than the room... I had the thing in a 63 degree room, had it set to 85 degrees. It would register 90 after 30 seconds of running, turn off, slowly ramp back down to 84 degrees over a 2 minute time period, and then repeat. The temperature of the room never got above 64 degrees...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"The thermometer of this heater is completely messed up. It does not measure the room temperature, but the temperature of the air that has just been heated up. In other words, if your room temperature is 60 degrees and you program it to heat up the room to 70 degrees it will do so (according to the thermometer reading) in less 2 minutes and stop. If you do not use this functionality, but instead let the heater run for some time (5-10 minutes) the thermometer will want to make you believe that the room temperature has gone up to 90 degrees. The thermometer is probably in the wrong location.

It works about one time out of 5. I've had it too long to send it back. When it does turn on, it seems to measure temperature from the air that it's just heated, so it shuts itself off after about 90 seconds. In some rooms, that is... In other rooms, I've had it run for several hours at a time. It's so inconsistent. A heater should work when you turn it on, and stay on until you turn it off - or until the room reaches the desired temperature. This isn't rocket science! I spent almost $50 for this thing. It should work..... I've tried to contact Honeywell customer service, with no response. Glad to see I'm not alone in my misery...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and quit with barely any use","review":"Cannot recommend this at all.

I was not disappointed! The enemies soldiers are more ruthless, and the storyline is more polished. What I loved most about this game is that I'm able to use my honed skills from Syphon Filter 1 to move through the levels. A lot of people who said the game was difficult probably tried to outshoot their way through scenes and got drop to their knees.

Stunning.So why not give it 5 stars? While the chorus is solid, the surrounding pieces (mix in, bridge and outro) contain a super-cheap bassline reminiscent of b-grade 80's 12\\" mixes.

As of the date of this review, the 6100 is on its second software version. However, one big problem remains in that version: the caller id feature does not work properly while roaming. Your phone may display \\"Call from: no ID\\" when receiving an incoming call. However, once you answer the phone, the caller ID information shows up. This only happens about 50% of the time: sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't. I have been told by Verizon technicians that this problem will should be fixed soon in the next software release for the phone. I will be waiting for the new software to come out rather than exchanging the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre phone, at best.","review":"I've had this phone for about 2 years and 8 months, and I got it as part of a new-phone-every-3-years deal. I honestly don't think my phone will last two more months.Everytime I have dropped this phone, it has broken. Sometimes just a piece or button will fall off, and sometimes it completely comes apart and I have to spend 20 minutes reassembling it. Keep in mind, these are not falls from my apartment balcony, they are falls from my back pocket or my hand to the ground (3-5 feet drops).I have had to replace this phone TWICE. One time, it rained and the phone was in my pocket. That completely killed it.So technically, I have had THIS phone for 10 months, and it is falling apart- all of the side buttons are falling off and i have to hold the casing in place when the phone is flipped open.The camera quality is poor, and there is nothing special about this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"DECENT PHONE","review":"I HAVE HAD THIS PHONE FOR 2 YEARS NOW.I ENJOY THE VERIZON WIRELESS SERVICE.IT IS A PRETTY DECENT PHONE.I AM DEBATING ON WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD UPGRADE TO THE LGVX-6100 OR JUST KEEP THE PHONE FOR ANOTHER YEAR.LGVX-6100* STORES UP TO 499 CONTACTS* WEIGHS 3.88 oz.* UP TO 3 HOURS OF DIGITAL TALK TIME; UP TO 150 HOURS DIGITAL STANDBY TIME* SPEAKERPHONELGVX-6000* STORES UP TO 499 CONTACTS* WEIGHS 3.98 oz.* UP TO 2.5 HOURS OF DIGITAL TALK TIME; UP TO 110 HOURS OF DIGITAL STANDBY TIME* NO SPEAKERPHONEI WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PHONE FOR PARENTS NEEDING TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR NEW HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.THE ONLY THING IS I WISHED IT HAD SPEAKERPHONE.OVERALL IT IS A NICE PHONE ESPECIALLY FOR NEW CELL PHONE USERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 3 years later.....","review":"Once the end of July hits, I will have had this phone for 3 years.

The first edition of this book was published in 1955 and, after nine more editions, appears largely unchanged in its mentality. Specifically, the textbook is written for a time when corporations had legions of industrial engineers who did nothing but detailed and tedious time and motion studies. Unfortunately, today's dynamic manufacturing environment renders many of the authors' techniques impractical or even financially hazardous. For example, it emphasizes the need to maximize machine utilization (even if the machine is not considered a bottleneck operation). Practices like these lead to excessive inventory and sub-optimization of the collective manufacturing process. In summary, I believe this textbook does a great disservice to those manufacturing firms that have achieved dramatic productivity gains through the application of lean manufacturing techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Methods, standards and work design","review":"I got the book on the first day that it was expexted to arrive and its in great shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"eight miles high and that they were","review":"i saw these guys for the switch tour in columbus ohio and they blew me away so when this double live came out they did it again this sounds so good its like being there again. this is one of the live albums of the time that will take you somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard 8cm DVD-R","review":"This standard 8cm DVD-R is exactly what you'd expect.

What you get here is a live version of Living in the Past (without vocals), an obscure version of Warchild (not as nice as the original US release), and a number of rather forgetable tracks that would only be for true collectors. The best cut is an inspired live version of Locomotive Breath. Runner up is The Whistler (from the Songs from the Wood album). The collection does include the 10-minute version of Budapest, which is not bad, but I can't stop feeling that this is a Dire Straits song instead of Jethro Tull.Overall, there are better collections out there. Original Masters is great for the price, and Living in the Past contains the best cuts from the band's early period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compilation","review":"This is a great compilation that really does span \\"Through The Years\\".

At first, it was difficult to enjoy the book as the reader is barraged with typos, grammatical errors and misspellings, but as the plot developed (or failed to develop), the editorial errors became the only amusing aspect of this apparently self-published novel. The time line is jumpy and conflicted, the characters (especially the villian)are completely undeveloped, and the events are predictable. Mr Verbicky should learn a little of human physiology in order to make his fantasies close to believable (i.e.: feeding a captive steak and french fries after days/weeks/months (again, a bad timeline) with no water).

It's not; it's vacuum-cleaner loud. I wonder if that other reviewer was using one of those cardboard box crushers you see on loading docks before this...Yes, it'll shred a credit card. From the sound it makes, you're never quite sure if it's going to finish, jam, or fly to pieces. It makes it, in the end. Very dramatic.After about a year, it simply stopped working.

The book is packed with information and Hopkirk's writing style will keep your eyes glued to the book right through to the end.This book was of particular interest to me as I live in China and I've traveled to the far west of this country (Kashgar and the Silk Road which also figure in this book) and I wanted to know more of the historical background of this vast and puzzling region of the world.

For anyone with an interest in world, British, or Russian history, Hopkirk's book is superb. He deftly weaves the tales of adventure and high stakes that marked the Anglo-Russian rivalry in Central Asia. With this region growing more geopolitically important each day, Hopkirk's story is relevant today since those nations (unlike us) do not easily forget their treatment at foreign hands. It's also a story of bravery. Young British and Russian officers went into uncharted territory to win over tribal allegiances for the good of their respective Empires. Many naver came back.

It is notable for its clear telling of an unending tale of historical intrigue. Although most of the historical figures in this book are virtually anonymous you can feel yourself walking in their shoes. Where the book falls short is its lack of coverage of the Great Game from the perspective of the native inhabitants of the region. Still, it treats the peoples of these harsh lands fairly.

Page-turning, cloak-and-dagger stuff that seems too almost elegant and balanced to qualify as non-fiction; Hopkirk has mastered the \\"tale\\" of history.

Entropy is very well dealt with. The last part of the book deals with thermodynamics vs statistical mechanics & there it gets pretty rough.

I'd be in the middle of a great song, and all of a sudden some hispanic radio station would cut in for 10 seconds. Now it starts up doing that and doesn't stop for hours.I tried all the different settings, channels; moved it to different locations; added an additional receiver to strengthen the signal - nothing. Thought maybe it was where I lived, but when I moved over the summer the problem followed. Customer service is almost non-existent - I got one email response that didn't really answer my question and then never heard from them again.Wish it wasn't true, but this product just isn't worth the frustration.

(the batteries that came with the camera were empty after shooting 15 pictures and downloading them to PC) When you turn the camera on, the LCD monitor turns on and the camera is in constant metering/focusing mode.

Six by Seven traffic in new millennium dreampop, but they make a deep, hard rocking impression. The Closer You Get, their second release, betters their first with varied tempos, sharper songs, more orchestrated clatter. Two songs are genre masterpieces: the gothic \\"Ten Places to Die\\", the roiling \\"My Life Is an Accident\\". When they can't get their songwriting in order, they do the next best thing: they rave, which usually counts for something."},{"rating":"1","title":"sobre calidad del proyectos personal de View Master","review":"Buenas noches. Escribo para decir que realmente esperaba una mejor calidad de proyector. Sinceramente, tuve un view master de niño y por eso lo compre a mi hija, pero los detalles de calidad con muy pobres.

You can call it anything 'affirmation' 'positive thinking or any of a host of buzz words but basically concentrate of what you want like real hard like all the time and if it manifests 'cool' and if not 'oh,well'. This basic theorem has been around for time immemorial in many guises. Save the 3 bucks and bank it for your longed for BMW Roadster. Who knows what will happen after 36 years of your daily affirmations (and daily $3 tithings ). My girlfriend wanted this book to visualize herself in high-dollar S.F. area on an Arizona budget. If we hit the tele-transporter in the next couple of days, color me wrong.BTW, all the 'testimonials' at the end of the book appear not to exist on this earthly plane but may be there in some parallel universe.

The key to life's successes or failures is not just about choices, but also about your perception of the reality you have created. It's about faith, plain and simple.

To call it a book and require it to be shipped, is a price-ridden illusion that makes the sale of this book work. Ironically and coincidentally, it is the premise of the book to believe in the unbelievable. So, it works for the author/publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book still for sale?","review":"This 28-page booklet cannot truthfully be called a book. The advice it gives is merely this: Write down what you want and tell no one. This booklet was intended for a very unsophisticated audience with \\"Cold War Values\\" and is not at all relevant to the world of the 21st Century. It talks about housewives who are late for Bridge and little Billy getting poor marks in school and the tragedy of those two things. It would be funny if it weren't meant to be serious.This booklet was written by some fundamentalist Xtian crackpot who was too ashamed to put his name on the book.

I often think that I can't find effective ways to better myself and make personal progress because I can never finish those long, drawn out, and very dry books that tell me how to better myself.This one should be called an oldie, but a goodie. It lays it all out in simple terms, even an idiot can follow...not that I'm an idiot, but it all makes perfect sense.If you have any doubts about where you are heading in your life and how to get there, make the investment in yourself by buying this booklet. Don't let the size fool you, it packs a punch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Release the handbrake!","review":"This is not a book for those trained to be all mind, with heart suppressed. It won't make sense to you; save your money. This book is for those who have heart and head and are working into the intuitive. The idea is that if you believe you'll never have positive in your life, you'll make it so. Further, you need to choose what you believe needs to happen for you, so that you'll pass by everything else that isn't a fit for your dream. If you start down that path, you'll then begin to mold your dream into a vision that includes the rest of the beings around you, because you'll need their partnership to get to where you deserve to be.

The message was stated very simply, too simply, but there is more to making things happen than just wishing them to happen. \\"IT\\" doesn't happen all the time. Depends on what \\"IT\\" is. I understand that you can make \\"IT\\" happen, but as one reviewer said, you have to MAKE it happen. It won't just appear.

What I got was a new age manual that instructs you to pray to yourself, or rather to the god that supposedly dwells within each of us. I would consider myself a progressive christian, and do my best to stay objective on matters of faith, yet this method undermines many core christian beliefs and certainly not worth giving up my convictions of faith for. In short, caution to all the faithful out there; if you have a belief system that doesn't put YOU at the center of the universe, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"Yes, \\"IT\\" works, but if you're tempted to try, resist!

Write it down - don't talk about it - and give thanks. It's simple but effective. I like that I can carry the book with me everywhere. It convinced me that if you know what you want and write a short list, you set something (Divine perhaps) in motion that will answer your requests. I think it's amazing that in 1926 the author outlined a premise about a great magnetic power in the universe that's just now being discussed scientifically in books like \\"The Field\\". That to me is proof of its timeless message. After this book, some other good followup books are \\"Write It Down Make It Happen\\" and \\"I'm Rich Beyond My Wildest Dreams.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Easy to READ anywhere, anytime","review":"This book is very motivational. The concept is so simple and basic, you will wonder why you didn't find this book long ago. \\"IT WORKS\\" basically encourages you to tap into your inner positive power to visualize your way into your desires.

The man with the smooth, rich baritone voice sings with an almost velvet-like softness. There's not a bad song on this collection.

Other standouts on the collection are I fall in love too easily, We'll be together someday, I'm glad there is you and I see your face before me. Bethlehem has also included some pretty interesting alternate takes of the songs, it's nice to heard how Mr. hartman worked in the studio. There are even a couple of out takes.

It brilliantly recreates life aboard ship from the day to day matters of diet, dress, pay and conditions to the weightier matters or mutiny, weaponry and war. There are full accounts of famous battles with battle plans, maps, diagrams and descriptions of the different classes of ships, and full colour illustrations. Everything you ever wanted to know about naval life in Nelson's era is here and as the book puts the characters of Forester, O'Brian, Kent and others in a historical context, it's also great for fans of naval fiction.

Instead of explaining concepts and helping develop abilities to solve problems, Griffiths plays silly algebra games throughout this text. Some truly elementary material he made rather complicated, explaining the obvious but omitting points crucial for understanding. With this book, forget about any intuitive knowledge of QM. If you like the monkey business of endless calculations, this one will not get you bored. But if you simply want to learn this fabulous branch of modern physics, consider N.Zettili, \\"QM Principles and Applications\\", which I guarantee you'll find invaluable. A little note for students to whom this reading is mandatory: Save your own nerves, and get the Solution Manual - will help you a lot on the exams."},{"rating":"2","title":"required","review":"This book is required for my quantum mechanics class.

This is an excellent text. However Amazon sent Thanatochemistry: A Survey of General, Organic, and Biochemistry for Funeral Service Professionals (3rd Edition). No joke! We returned the funeral chemistry textbook in brand new unread condition (of course) and never received a refund. This is bizarre. Amazon does not deal well with gross errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Griffiths Drivel","review":"As usual, Griffiths replaces formalism and math with hand waving nonsense. While that may work to some extent in E&M, it fails miserably with a topic such as quantum mechanics. Also, as others have mentioned, Griffiths leaves a good chunk of the actual learning to exercises, which would be fine if there were answers in the back to select important problems or *gasp* a solutions manual, but Griffiths lacks both. Save yourself the grief and buy someone else's book. Griffiths, as usual, just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Confuse","review":"It's very confuse book. The author don't give a good introduction that is very fundamental to teach an undergraduated student. The Mathematical formalism it's almost nothing, when a student in this level still needs a strong basis in that point.This book can maybe be a good introduction to an advanced course (only a introduction), for the students that just need to remind something that they already have learned. I recommend for a initiate undergraduated student the book of Shankar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent international edition instead of US edition pictured","review":"The book was in good condition but was not the edition I expected to receive. I expected the US edition and instead got the international edition--not the same quality of binding or printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better approach","review":"Griffith takes a different approach to introducing QM by ignoring the historical development and stepping into the math right away. QM can be considered similar to taking a bunch of baby physicists and dumping them in the pool at the deep end.His text shares the same problems all QM textbooks have which is they expect only the smartest students to be able to come up with the math.Having taken nearly 2 years of QM I'd recommend helping students by thickening it up more along the lines of his E&M; text.What's really needed is a better version of Liboff who covers a lot of territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK intro to QM","review":"This is a pretty decent introduction to QM. Not many prereqs are assumed which is good. Ch. 4 is organized a bit strangely (angular momentum is presented after the hydrogen atom). However, you will probably have to read a more advanced book to move on to QFT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Condition, Respected Author","review":"I'm making this review short. Griffiths is a well rounded author on physics who also wrote my class textbook on electrodynamics.

The only problem is that the first few chapters are great, but it becomes suddenly hard after a few chapters and it doesn't provide much information and it isn't rigorous, plus there aren't answers to the problems so if you get stuck, you are stuck for good unless you have an instructor. If you have an instructor, however, it would be a great text book and a reference. If you are studying on your own, I think that the book written by Nouredine Zettili is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author is phenomenal","review":"The paper looks like someone used Elmer's glue to attach the first and last pages to the cover. It has that lumpy/bubbly look from crappy glue drying. Text very fluid read, easy to understand, but the topic discussed is not easy, and it adds a lot of interesting physical descriptions with the equations. One of the best books I've ever owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Undergraduate Quantum Text","review":"I find this an entertaining problem-focused text, which enabled me to learn and master basic concepts in Quantum Mechanics during my undergraduate Physics studies. Griffiths writes with clarity on key topics in an easy to understand manner. He introduces Dirac notation a bit later than other texts, which allows students to play with and get familiar with some of the concepts first before trying to decode and gain fluency in Dirac notation. Also to note, Griffiths uses delightful language, at times with humor, that kept my attention while reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The Radica Cube World Global Get A Way isn't nearly as much fun as I thought it would be.

At the time, Amazon had them on sale for under 10 dollars. At that price, this toy is great! It does have sound, and is VERY loud. I put tape over the speaker and that helped, but everyone knows when it's running in the room. (Not so good for my husband to use at work after all.) Large screen much easier to see than the smaller \\"regular\\" cube world cubes. My 7 year old would rate this a 7 out of 5 stars for fun, but my husband gave it a 3 or a 4 star fun rating. My father-in-law and kids carried these from house to house Christmas day - they entertained everyone.When used with other cubes, the characters visit each other, interact, and then return to their original cubes.

Better than what?","review":"This book was not too bad at the start. The first chapter covers feeding your 2 to 4 year old, and the second chapter talks about feeding your 4 to 6 year old. They give tips on how to increase your child's fibre, and suggest trying to reduce juice consumption. Futher on, there's a discussion about essential vitamins and minerals. Some time is devoted to food contamination and food allergies, choking, bowel function, obesity, daycare, and dental care.Where this book really falls apart is in the recipe section. I would NOT call these foods BETTER foods. Almost all of the recipes include either butter, cheese, or sugar. I don't think it's a good idea to feed my children Quiche Lorraine, Fettucine Alfredo, and biscuits dipped in cheese and mayonnaise. Really. The recipes in this book were less healthy than most of the recipes I see in regular children's cookbooks.

Nevertheless I never followed Trout, he seemed too much hard guitarist to me for the Blues until I heard the 2006's Walter Trout's \`Full Circle' with several collaborations (John Mayall, Jeff Healey, Coco Montoya....) I liked it very much in spite of Walter Trout goes on being a hard guitarist, however I began to be interested with his discography.This CD \`Face the music' is a very good live record, great stuff, performed with great passion and highlights for all songs specially \\"Got a Broken Heart\\", \\"Obstacles in My Way\\" and the slows Blues \\"The Reason I'm Gone\\", \\"Tired of Sleeping Alone\\".

This book is painful.I was so hopeful too: Great concept (romance in the 60+ crowd), interesting setting (NYC upper society). But the only thing that held it together was one cliche after another!I don't understand how this book got through the entire New York agent/publishing scene (not to mention, apparently, an extended network of family and friends who critiqued it for him) -- and the writer still couldn't come up with even one original analogy or description in the entire manuscript!Really.

The movie definitely followed the story line in the books. I suspect this was a low budget film and there are some things that could've been better, particularly the music score. The acting was decent and I thought the video footage was probably the best aspect. I honestly think if the music had been better the whole film would've been more effective.My daughter (8 yrs) has watched the famous American Girl movies but has little to no interest in reading the books. After watching this Mandie film, she went out the same day and bought the second Mandie book. I feel like the movie wetted her appetite for more. I am thrilled because it prompted her to READ!

I mean, Lilith is not all she's cracked out to be, if you know what I mean, like, she kills men and eats babies. Like, that's the point of this book. Oh, McLachlan's name is on the intro but i highly doubt she wrote it herself, judging by how she has so many problems making sense when she talks to the media, too.

I LOVE IT! plus ashlee is so sweet and nice..... i like the songs autobiography,pieces of me ,shadow,LALA(GREAT song), love me for me, and surrender the best but i love all the songs on the album 2! lol well ashlee's cd is awesome! GO BUY IT NOW"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!","review":"I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!! It's my new favorite...EVERY song on this album is GREAT!!Her raspy voice rocks! Her vocals are similar to Gwen Stefani!I totally recommend purchasing this album! If you don't, you're totally missing out on an amazing music experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a pretty face","review":"For someone's first album this was amazing. It fulfilled all my wants in an album. The love song, the lust song, the dance song, and everything else in between. Two thumbs up to Ashlee for staying true to herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autobiography Rocks!!!","review":"This CD is one of the best albums I have bought in a really long time.This is a CD that I like every song which I find is really rare.Every song has meaning and you can relate to at least 6 songs if not all.If you are lokking for a fresh new face who can sing and rock her butt off this is for sure it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I really enjoyed this CD throughly! I though that the CD had a little something for each of my moods, so it was like if I feel bad one day or good then there is a song for it! I am very glad that Ashlee has found her own style of music rather than following Jessica Simpson's style, considering I am not a fan of Jessica's but a big fan of Ashlee's! This is a CD worth every penny! Especially, if you love music and are a Ashlee Simpson fan!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKS. PERIOD.","review":"Finally, she got busted on SNL. Now people can actually see the TRUE fake she is. The fact is that she can't sing. She showed herself singing live on her show in the studio, no one would've even have known she couldn't sing if it wasn't for her show! She messed herself up! Anyway, she claims that she's a \\"rock girl\\", well guess what Ashlee if you were would people who buy your albums also be picking up Usher and Britney CDs as it says on the \\"Customers who bought this also bought\\" section of Amazon.com. No! Sure maybe if you like pop you'll like this album but if you're a person who likes rock and looking for an actual rock album you WOULD NOT like this. This chick is no different than Hilary Duff..or even Britney for that matter. Save your money if you like rock music, because this isn't it, this isn't the album to buy if you're a rock fan. But if you're a fan of Britney, Avril, Hilary then this is the album for you!And it's not \\"punk\\" either."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!!!!! What an AWESOME Frisbee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Yes. The best Frisbee in America.I needed a Frisbee the other day when I was at a family reunion at my uncle's house last Sunday. There were a bunch of kids so we needed some entertaining. After laughing with a video of Simpson's monkey dance that we downloaded, we wondered if we could get a frisbee. I didn't know any store in which I could get one so my father told me \\"Hey, you should go and buy the CD of that girl that was dancing like a monkey\\"Awesome idea. 30 minutes I was back at home. I took out the frisbee and began throwing. The kids and the dogs had a hell of a time catching it.Pure entertainment people. The Greatest frisbee in America!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She makes her sister look talented - 0 stars","review":"Just when you thought music could sink no lower than Jessica Simpson, her little sister comes along with her whole \\"punk\\" music and image.\\"I sing punk music actually. I love to run around and scream and rock out and play guitar.\\" - Ashlee Simpson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is still buying this crap?","review":"Pieces Of Me is one of the worst songs on the radio right now. It's awful!! Little Ashlee has no discernible talent whatsoever and her show was just a marketing ploy to get naive MTV viewers to go out and waste their money on this CD. The whole stereotype about music producers creating these puppets is, sadly, all but true. Ashlee can't sing, play an instrument, or write music. But yet, because her sister is famous, MTV was able to saddle Ashlee with some generic songs, and a grating TV show, and voila!! A star is born. It's so sad.And all I hear is how Ashlee is \\"so punk!!\\" Yeah, I'm sure that The Ramones, The Clash, and The Sex Pistols are shaking in their boots.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the talent?","review":"SNL screw up (and complete lack of professionalism)notwithstanding, this girl's voice is like nails on a chalkboard. Just like Brittney Spears and all the other bubblegum trash that's so prevelant these days, she's trying to substitute style for substance but she's not pulling it off well at all. How nice it is that our society accepts an image now in lieu of actual talent. I'm tired of hearing all these kids who are 5 to 10 years younger than me whining about how horrible their life is when they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars to push their less than mediocre skills. These are the kind of problems you WANT to have. I'll pass on the angst and pick up a CD with real music, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!","review":"This CD is such a GREAT CD! It's totally different from Ashlee's sister, Jessica. You would expect the same thing because they're both siblings, but Ashlee has her own sound and image. It's a great CD. I love: Autobiography, Pieces of Me, Shadow, Love Me For Me, Surrender, and La La. All the other songs are GREAT too! I suggest that people should buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Versatile","review":"While many of her peers stick to the same formula and sound, Ashlee mixes it up effortlessly. She's not afraid to go outside of her comfort zone and show you her many different sides. A little Pop, a little Rock, and a smooth ballad here and there. You will not get bored listening to \\"Autobiography.\\" In fact, you might discover something new with each listen because I have. Ashlee leaves you with a full stomach, but still wanting more. There's no filler and this is one of the few CD's that I can actually play all the way through. Ashlee has a lot of potential and no one should miss out on this excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old people back off","review":"I thought this album was more for the younger generation pop rock listeners so old people shouldnt waste their time listening to Autobiography if they are just gonna diss it and pay it out. I really like the song La La but pieces of me got real old real fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"LET'S DO THE ASHLEE SIMPSON DANCE!!!","review":"Someone tell Mr. Simpson to stop pimping his daughters please.I hope no one believed that \\"acid reflux\\" crap. First they said the vocals weren't supposed to be playing, then they say she needed them because of her acid reflux. To the whole ugly Simpson family- go get real jobs!!By the way, Jessica looks like an alien."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't like her music","review":"As a person she's not much of a brain, but she is entertaining, kind of like the car wreck you can't help but be drawn to, as shown on her reality show. Sure she has the looks and the clothing styles down, but she is not cut to do music at all and she may have been pressured by yes men around her to do this and was told she could sing just so they can capitalize on the simpsons mania we see all over television. I hate to say it but ashlee is the worst singer I have heard in my 22 years of life, and it's not because of the music she does, it's the vocal skills she is lacking in completely, it sounds like a wreck and she's in it for the money, no doubt. True she had it coming with the orange bowl incident but maybe it's a sign that she is not fit to be a musician at all and should consider going to college or designing clothes or something like that. That's my review, the best I could do by seperating the music and the person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autobiography....Zero Stars","review":"Why do famous people have the tendency to be so gullible when it comes to a career move.Music talent doesn't always run in the family.Jessica Simpson is a great singer,despite her lousy songs.She has control over her voice and i love it.However,Ashlee Simpson's voice is beyond ATROCIOUS.This is the worst thing i have ever heard,William Hung sings more convincingly than her,this is horrible.Way before the SNL incident i thought that she was a terrible singer.Now has for the title of this album was a complete mistake.She poses has a song writer.Sending your half done poetry to some one who converts them into song lyrics is not an autobiography.This is what i call a joke singer and there are many of them out there.The whole point is that Ashlee needs to try other career options before she makes another complete fool out of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is she?","review":"She was famous for 3 months in 2004 for her 1 hit \\"Pieces Of Me\\" Her songwriting is good...but she is talentless everywhere else. her follow up singles all flopped! her show did too and her and her sister jessica who is also a 1-hit-wonder flopping everywhere is over...so both DIE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like it Sorry :(","review":"Got it yesterday and after a whole of listening to it, Sorry Ashlee but i didnt like it.

If you know a whole lot of people don't like your singing, that should give you a clue to quit. This album is terrible and some of the songs don't even make sense. I mean \\"You make me wanna la la\\"? What the heck is that all about?! Look, I'm not trying to be mean about all of this. Maybe Ashlee could take up acting? I know she was on 7th Heaven. I just hope for all our sakes that she decides singing just isn't right for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest debut from someone with moderate talent ever!","review":"I got ripped off!

No one plays a cornfed moron better, no one wears hot pants with more substance and elan. By comparison Ashlee is just the little sister wannabee. Music for TV people, watch Drug Store Cowboy if you don't get the reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT cut out to be star","review":"Ashlee Simpson is just another wannabe like Hilary Duff. She has absolutely no talent whatsoever in this kind of field and doesn't even write the music itself, just like Duff. I really can't stand it, and I don't know who can. There isn't a single track on this excuse for an album that doesn't make my face sag. Simpson is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 and 1/2 stars because some of the songs are tolerable","review":"\\"We have to make sure you're the opposite of your sister,\\" Ashlee's manager father told his latest starlet (Entertainment Weekly, 8/23/04).This statment spells out one thing. P-o-s-e-r. I really think the only reason they made this cd is because of image. The lyrics are bad as well as the singing. She's trying to be what she is not. I don't know what she is, but I know one thing: she isn't talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they made a half star option...","review":"Poor Ashlee, ..she wants so desperately to make everyone believe she is..well, talented. That's sad! =(It must be extremely hard to need to be as good as your big sister.. But, this girl honestly needs to realize that just because her sister can.. doesn't mean she can. ASHLEE!..We're all good at something, this just isn't your thing. *She didn't write it, who knows who did! And her voice is awful,.. I can't believe how much money she is making because her sister is famous... Get her off the radio and TV. MTV will use any excuse to make a show.LOVE YOUR EARS!

She tries to pass this CD off as her original work. She \\"sang\\" on it but had almost 0 effort of her own in it. She lets the records company control her. The CD itself is not that bad. I do not like Ashlee's way of music or her opinons. She lied to millions of people, and then got her stories mixed up. However I still like Pieces of Me. Maybe if she tried on this CD instead of letting everyone else do it for her people would like it better. Look at Avril Lavigne. Her first CD was panned to no end, but \\"Under My Skin\\" still gets respect because she wasn't just handed the music.Recommendation (alternative to Ashlee): Bjork, Tori Amos, Utada Hikaru"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discusting, Scratchy-Voiced Old Drone... Eeeeeeeeeeeww!","review":"How discusting!!! I must say, that the contents of this album are absolutely pitiful with Miss Simpson's scratchy little voice totally struggling to reach notes that are NOT high. Please, DO NOT waste your money on this horribhle attempt at pop music. Just like her sister, the Dronesons continue to fill our world with horrible, \\"I am sooooo cute and rich\\" merchandise. Not to mention, Ashley Simpson LIP-SYNCS!!!!! She's just as worse as fake prats Wannabe-Princess Hilary and Ms. Lohans."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 100 cd's","review":"Released in 2004, now re-reviewing in 2011. I was recently cleaning my room and found this Ashley Simpson CD behind my cabinet. I cleaned it up and played it again. I had forgotten how good this CD was! Unlike most CD's, every song is very good to great! What I find ironic, is that she was dissed after her lip sincing mishap, losing her credability, yet nearly every artist does it! But, I will say that also like most artists, she gave it all up on this CD. Her following CD's were not even nearly as good. I guess she was feeling a lot of different emotions writing Autobiography, which, like Allanis Morrisette, makes for great music/lyrics. In my opinion, it's one of the best all around CD's in years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This dumb bimbo can't even lip-synch right!!!","review":"If she makes a complete fool of herself on SNL, and can't even li-synch right, do you actually think she has any singing talent???

Of course I do! Otherwise it is just a little rude, don't you think? I have three good reasons why you shouldn't get this CD:1] How can you tell if that's even her singing? Didn't anyone see Saturday Night Live?2] She's just angry that her sister is far more popular and pretty and is married, blah, blah, blah......3] Do you really want your friends to see you with an Ashlee Simpson CD?

Ashlee has a lot of fake clones, I mean fans...","review":"Ashlee Simpson is really competing with Avril Lavigne in my book for most revolting female 'music artist' of the century. Ashlee tries so hard to look like a hardcore rock chick that the entire concept blows up right in her face. Dying your hair black and having other people write 'moody' songs for you does not make you rock. The fact that she cannot sing certainly does not help. This album is a bunch of whiny drivel with no real merit. The songs are annoying and all very similar... no depth...

Your sister is 100 times hotter then you are. The kid who said \\"are those teeny bopper girls who have there mommy and daddy buy there entire wardrobe from Hollister and have never even heard of...\\" is right. Anybody who likes this girl should go follow her.Talentless. Her songs say she was left out. You have all the money you ever wanted. You have no life except lip-syncing on SNL and blaming it on everyone else. Her band is probably those reject kids who shoot themselves because they had no friends in high school.

Come on people, there is so much great music out there being put out by people with real talent. Why her, why Avril Lavine? why Britney Spears? Music is art, or at least suppose to be.

Her voice is pretty bad though. I have watched a few of her shows on MTV and everyone seems to be frustrated with her when she is trying to record. She can never get her voice to do right. They had to really help her voice out in the studio for her album. She is not a singer at all. But there are many out there who can't sing and they make it big. It is like they pulled her off the streets and asked \\"hey would you like to be a star?\\" \\"It doesn't matter if you have talent or not.\\" Jessica can sing a little better but she yells and strains too much.

The music's mundane melange of Avril-ish brat pop and Sheryl Crow cod rock reaches its nadir on \\"Love Me for Me,\\" an anemic rip of AC/DC's \\"Back in Black,\\" wherein Ashlee does Courtney Love, wailing in lieu of hitting notes. \\"Nobody's really seen my million subtleties,\\" she says on the title track.

I've seen her show and I've heard enough of the songs to know that I wouldn't ever buy this garbage. The thing that saddens me the most about this cd is that people actually believe that she's talented. She is not punk....she will never be punk. When I look at punk...I see NOFX and Bad Religion to name a few. This is the most pathetic thing MTV has ever done. I for one am boycotting this album along with any other MTV produced crapp. And my last point...I didn't believe that all of the 5 star posts are fake....until I checked them out.

If you've even just seen previews of the Ashlee Simpson show you'll see that, and plus I've seen her perform live on a Late Night TV show and she sounded really bad. She's also trying to make little girls think shes part of the \\"punk\\" scene- she wore a shirt that said \\"PUNK\\" on it in her \\"Peices of Crap... err... Peices of Me\\" video- basically shes trying to get little girls to put this CD in their collection right next to New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, and Yellowcard- even though she sounds nothing like them. Whats the similarity between Ashlee Simpson, Hilary Duff, and Avril Lavigne?

Pieces of Me is catchy, but only because of the song itself, and Shadow falls flat coming from a well known tv actress and center of a reality show. The rest of the tracks try to transform Simpson's average voice into edgy rockerish, but instead end up quite painful and fake. Although I'm not a big fan of Avril, she succeeds at what Ashlee attempts and fails at. I'd recommend buying Avril's CD instead, or just buying the better of Simpson's singles. Basically, Ashlee tries to boost her own fame using her sister's fame in the music business, where obviously Ashlee does not belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Modern Music Get Worse? Yes, with Ashlee Simpson","review":"I don't think I should waste my time analyzing why this album sucks. For reasons already explained by previous reviewers, the album is horribe and rides on the coat tails of \\"Pieces of Me\\" which isn't even a great song, even for bubblegum pop standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did we do to deserve Ashlee Simpson!!??","review":"I would never actually buy one of this stupid poser girl's albums but like most unfortunate people you have in random places heard some of her brain tumor inducing garbage such as that you make me wanna ya ya crap or something it hutI would never actually buy one of this stupid poser girl's albums but like most unfortunate people you have in random places heard some of her brain tumor inducing garbage such as that god awful la la crap. Five seconds is enough to send you into spasms. Artists like her that can't sing and are just hot, believe me the teenage boys aren't listening to your music their masturbating, are the worst. I just hope for her sake that she stops her embarressing career befor the next time she sings live on tv, orange bowl anyone, the crowd attacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's serious?","review":"When I 1st heard \\"Pieces Of Me\\", I quickly became addicted that I want to grab the whole album. When I got a copy, I was so disappointed! Only 2 or 3 songs there are considered good. I could conclude that she rushed her music career without much thought. Ashlee, if you are reading this, take time to do something and make sure everything goes great. If you guys don't know what I mean, watch the Ashlee Simpson show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage CD! BOO!","review":"Wow what concept why not ride on my sister Jessicas coat tails because I am a talentless oaf. If you actually happen to like this CD then you must be one of those mindless drowns that are hypnotized by MTV. Ashlee go back to being Jessicas sister and stop tring to become famous through your sister who does have alot talent. Better yet just go back to acting where you just might make it as a hack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some songs are better then others","review":"I was skeptical about Ashlees new album because on the show she cant really sing all that great. But I like to listen more to the words of songs and the message they give rather then judge the person on their voice. As long as the person doesnt sound terrible then its fine with me. I burned this C.D. from a friend because there is no way I would ever buy it. I like 6 of the songs: Pieces of me, Shadow, Love makes the world go round, Surrender, unreachable, and LALA. All the other songs in my opinion are terrible. My 3 favorite songs on the album are 'unreachable', 'LALA', and 'Love makes the world go round.' those 3 have the best beat and lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album sucks.","review":"I'm sorry to say that ashlee simpson is very dissapointing to become a singer. I saw here live at the MTV VMA's and she sucked singing live. Ashlee keep to your acting even though u suck at that as well. Jessica's cd is awesome. Ashlee I hop u do not come out with another album. P.S. Your voice is very aggravating."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD I OWN!","review":"I love this CD! I listened to it on The Leak on MTV.com the day it came out and I knew I had to buy it! I bought it that day! This is the best CD I own and I listen to it all the time. All of the songs are amazing. The lyrics and music are great. Ashlee even was a co-writer on all of the songs! She feels the music is important and you can see that! I LOVE ASHLEE AND HER CD! She is my new favorite artist! She is awesome, buy this CD and you won't regret it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Sound","review":"Ashlee Sipmson has a sound that's all her own. She doesn't have to live in her sister's shadow anymore because she's come out like a roaring lion. Ashlee's grabbed Pop music by the reigns and she's never letting go. This is the jolt in the arm that the music industry needed. She captures fun and the CD unleashes pulse-pounding music that you can't get out of your head.Great Pop/Rock music should accomplish a few things:1. Good Lyrics2. A Fresh Perspective3. Enjoyable from start to finish4. It should be Memorable5. An energy that's contagiousAshlee's CD is all of those. No other artist this year has put out a CD that's more worthy of being called great Pop Music than Ashlee Simpson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut!","review":"Ashlee's debut album definitely sets her apart from her sister. Ash shares her voice and thoughts with the world. I can't get enough of this CD and would recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely original and unique!","review":"The first time I saw Ashlee on tv, I thought oh no, here's just an Avril Lavigne wannabe. But as I watched her show and watched her record her album, I realized that she isn't punk, she isn't rock, and she certainly isn't pop. Ashlee Simpson is unique and that is something much needed in the music business these days. On the show she states how she doesn't want to be Avril or Jessica or Hilary Duff. She wants to be Ashlee and that's what \\"Autobiography\\" is. People are going to judge her based on her sister, her family, her show. But the bottom line is this is a fantastic CD. \\"Unreachable\\" is my favorite track, it's a beautiful song that puts feelings I currently have into words I could have never written myself. Ashlee is very talented, but most importantly, Ashlee is her own person and that is what is going to make her music career a success. You will not regret buying this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome AWESOME!!","review":"One sentence: She surprises me with this album. Im a big fan of Natalie Imbruglia and Lucy Woodward, and Ashlee does the right impression where the previous two artists have left. Most of the tracks (Better Off, Lala, Love Make the World Go Round, Giving It All Away) have such catchy chorus, and this girl can scream loud out of her lungs!! Although the lyrics is pretty childish, but for me, who care about the lyrics when her music is so good? Another thought: This album won't be as good if it is not John Shanks' production!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"Ashlee Simson prooves that she can join the music business with an outstanding #1 album. Her platinum-debut, \\"Autobiography,\\" can get played over and over all day long, but you will never get tired of hearing upbeat, sassy songs like \\"La La\\" and \\"Autobiography.\\" But, she can also move your heart with ballads such as \\"Love Makes the World Go Round.\\" She shows the true side of her childhood in the deep song (and her next single) \\"Shadow\\" telling how hard her childhood was growing in the shadow of older sister, and American barbie-doll, Jessica Simson. No one will be dissapointed with their purchase of \\"Autobiography.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"ASHLEE SIMPSON'S AUTOBRIOGRAPHY *TOTALLY ROCKS*","review":"I purchased Ashlee's cd just to support her as a new artist & because I liked 2 of the songs I heard on her shown on MTV. I went to buy it the night before it came out and I was totally blown away!!! The cd totally rocks!!! It is the best cd that I have ever purchased! I am so impressed with how talented she proves to be in this cd!!! I usually only like about 3 songs when I purchase a cd and the rest of the songs are ok but ALL THE SONGS ON ASHLEE'S CD ARE TOTALLY AWESOME!!! I have not stopped listening to her cd since I got it! I am positive that you will be impressed with it as well! I cannot express how awesome it trully is. I am sure all her young fans will enjoy it but I am 24 years old and married and I was totally impressed with the quality of her songs!!! BUY HER CD TODAY!!! I GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL TOTALLY LOVE IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On...Are You Serious?","review":"How can people give this record 5 stars when there are so many other rich and creative artist out there not even being played on the radio. They are the ones who should have #1 albums and singles. First off, Ashlee \\"can\\" sing, but her vocals are very limited. Especially when compared against her 8 octave voiced sister. But to her credit, there are some catchy tunes. \\"Pieces Of Me\\" is almost irresistable, and \\"Shadow\\" shows us how Ashlee delt with being the overshadowed by her very famous sibling, but most of the lyrics are so bad and the rest of the album lacks creativity and falls into practically the same formula track after track. And Ashlee's attemp to be so-called \\"punk rock\\" seems more forced than natural. Maybe with some growth and new experiences, Ashlee can find a nitch of her own instead of mimicing what she thinks is supposed to be cool music."},{"rating":"1","title":"the day that mtv made it's biggest mistake","review":"what kind of world do we live in where a no talent clown can hop on her talentless sisters coat tails and ride them to the most publicized album in the history of music television. i swear if at the end of another mtv show i have to listen this fake, overpruduced and over-populized garbage i'm gonna hurl. the only good she brings to society is that she raises the price of clothes for people who think they can buy punk at Von Dutch. how does a no hit wonder get 15 hours of fame?oh and yea, i do know you better that you know yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond retarded","review":"THIS MUSIC HAS TO BE A JOKE.

I think it is so different from Jessica's and really has a lot of meaningful lyrics that really express Ashlee. A lot of artists say that they write music that expresses themselves. Ashlee's really does. It's so personal, but so cool. I just like to rock out to the songs. It's an album that both guys and girls can relate to and enjoy. It is different from the definition of Pop. She is no Britney, no Christina, not even Avril. She is something completely different and is really, really exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who said anything about punk rock","review":"First off, Ashlee never claimed to be punk rock. So i take it the people that bagged on this album have listen to the entire thing? Well I have and I love it. I have never listened to a young solo artist and never purchsed any of their cds. The bands I listen to consist on No Doubt, Rancid, Sublime, 311 and other ska/punk bands. Ashlee cowrote every song and has John from Goldfinger (ska punk band)producing a song on it. Everyone is just mad that she has her own show and he record went to number one. Would you have liked her more is she wasn't Jessica's little sister? She's not Avril or Hillary. She has secured her spot in the music industry and has written quality songs. She doesn't claim to have a great voice or to be something great. She's just wrote an album for her love of good music. People who claim \\"oh im so punk rock and i lknow what punk rock is\\" are the people who have no clue what punk rock stands for. I highly recommend this cd to any diverse music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes you think.....","review":"This is the kind of album that really make the wheels turn in your head. It provokes many questions and profound thoughts. It makes me think how truly shallow the music industry is. Obviously the number one priority is to take a marketable image and promote her as some sort of talented pop star. We've all seen SNL and the Orange Bowl. We all know that \\"untalented\\" is much too kind of a word to describe Ashlee's singing abilites. Seriously, this album makes me feel a whole gamut of emotions. Anger, sadness, pity, resentment. I guess that's the one good thing about this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Music Terrorist","review":"I have listened to this disc and I'm very sad. She should have never been allowed near a recording studio. She is a marketing tool, not a original artist.The whole reason she got that show was to sell more albums. My guess is that she will get plenty of air play on MTV. Artists don't need a reality show to sell music. Good music should sell itself. Ashlee Simpson will never realize that in her world. Stop hurting America Ashlee Simpson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS ALBUM A JOKE OR WHAT??","review":"This cd was not worth the money i spent on it!The singing was horrible throughout!Lyrically my 6 year old daughter could write better than you (and probably have more interesting things to say)I could probably put up with only one track on the entire album but the rest is pure crap!Im not a big fan of your sister but as hard as it is to say it, leave the singing to your sister!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste your money.Expecting to hear Ashlee Simpson well don't cause she doesn't sing any of these songs.She is a spoiled brat who doesn't care or feel ashmed that she was caught lip syncing.buy Cds that are the real deal like good charlotte,the used,or evanescene.When i found out ashlee was a lip syncer i trashed her Cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MUSIC TODAY SUCKS","review":"SHE'S NOT ROCKSHE'S NOT TALENTEDAND I THINK SHE LOOKS LIKE A MANWE NEED TO KILL MTV AND VH1"},{"rating":"1","title":"GO AWAY ASHLEE AND NEVER RETURN!","review":"I hate the fact that she is trying to be all hardcore and punk rock.

I saw the music video for Lala and it is the stupidest music video I have ever seen. That goes for the songs too. Her voice is raspy and whiny, so it sounds unattractive. In her songs and her videos, she is trying to be punk, even though her songs are pop. The record company labeled her as a punk to be something different from her sister. I don't like the Simpson sisters, but at least Jessica doesn't try to be something she is not.

Ashlee looks like a sweet little girl but don't let her image fool you. She has some dark songs on this album like \\"Shadow\\" We're all hearing the over-played \\"Pieces of Me\\" right? She just can't manage to hit the high notes in the song like Jessica does in \\"Angels\\" Like I said, she does have a few sparks of talent flying here and there but her talent isn't steady. Even though she does hit some high notes on the album, they were just plain luck.

Rock is more than screaming and wearing dark colors. Beyond her persona... She actually had a hand in writing the tracks on her disc, the problem is that the lyrics blow. The music is cheesy, similar, and blows, and I regret spending $15 on it. The only semi-good songs on the disc are the first 4 then the rest of the disc is droning. She is interesting, She is adorable, She doesn't deserve to have a record contract. The guy on her show even said,\\"You're not singing on these tracks,\\" but they put the songs on the disc anyway. What is that? Well anyway, I give the girl her props for selling that crap like hot cakes.

I think she did a great job on this album, and by her record sales in the first week, which surpassed Jessica's last album in it's first week, I am not the only one who feels this way. I love the album, and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Jessica fan but I really like this CD","review":"This is for all the Jessica fans who are wondering if the should get Autobiography. If you like Jess for her upbeat songs-like me-YES ballads-probably not. My favorites are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 11. I really like how in Shadow she said \\"dont feel sorry for me\\" and \\"i got more than any1 should\\" I would have been really mad if she thought she had it so tough being second to jess and now being really famous.

I didn't know what to expect, but when I heard part of it on AOL music I decided to get it.Ashlee certainly doesn't sound like she's new to the music scene, but more like a vetran. Songs like AUTOBIOGRAPHY and LALA are instant Pop/Rock classics. You can tell she had great fun recording this CD becuse her energy is contagious. She definitely has her own sound and stands out from others in her genre.I think she's going to be one of the few breakout artists this year. I hope the Grammys give Ashlee consideration. She is certainly deserving.My Favorites:1. Autobiography4. LaLa5. Love Make The World Go Round7. Love Me For Me8. Surrender10. Giving It All Away12.

Filled with heart felt lyrics and Rock-in' melody's it was just what we needed. When I found out Ashlee Simpson was making an album, i have to admit I had my doubts I had been fan of her on seventh heaven but I wasn't quite sure she could make the transition from actress to musician. Boy was I wrong! This is what she should be doing. She's not trying to fit the mold of some other female pop stars she's out doing her own thing she's being original. With songs like \\"pieces of me\\" and \\"shadow\\" She's well on her way to becoming a Kick a** rock star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible album from a horrible family","review":"Ashlee Simpson is quite possibly the biggest disgrace in the history of music. She's awful. She's so awful that we need to invent a new adjective to describe her unique level of failure. My suggestion for this new word is \\"omnihorrent.\\" Ashlee's latest pathetic foray into the world of entertainment, the pitiful and dreary \\"Autobiography,\\" is omnihorrent. It's worse than worse. This CD is so bad that it makes Ashlee's bird-brained sister Jessica Simpson seem talented by comparison.If you buy this CD then you are contributing to the downfall of humanity. There is not an original bone in Ashlee's body, nor is there the slightest semblance of talent. Do the world a favor and pass on this trash before we have listen to more of Ashlee's lipsynching. The people have spoken. They booed Ashlee off the stage at the Orange Bowl. Don't let their boos fall on deaf ears. Don't buy anything related to Ashlee Simpson or her slime ball father. The world is begging you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No talent.","review":"Her attitude of lip syncing on a live show is really punk but her music isn't. Her songs are actually well written but I could tell that she didn't write them though she claims she did. She can't play instruments and doesn't know anything about chord progression or music theory so there's no way that she could have written them. You have to know at least some basics about music to be able to write songs unless you are a real genius. I think she made this record just because she wanted some fame. That's a real insult to the music. If she had a musical talent, it would be alright for her to do whatever she wants. So just ignore her. She's the most talentless singer today. She's as bad as Kelly Osbourne. Listen to better music. There are a lot of talented musicians out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't like ashlee simpson's album","review":"i don't know why this album was number 1 on the billboard charts cause ashlee should go back to 7th heaven and retire from the music busines cause this album sucks big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did someone say vocoder?","review":"Bouth this album and I completely regret it.Low quality production, singing and song writing.If anyone doesnt know what a vocoder is, its the piece of studi equipment that madonna and Jlo have made famous. It mixes a person voice with a synthesizer, basically it allows people who cannot sing to hold a key. Even still with the help of the vocoder, Ashlee's voice is still very bad. Avoid this release and looks elsewhere for good pop/rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autobiography of a fake","review":"After the whole SNL disaster, who would actually buy this? Who would pay for something that is as fraudulent and fake as this? Tone deaf, that's what she is. I would rather listen to Cannibal Corpse than this. *shudders* The sad thing is some people still buy her shirts and go to her concerts and listen to her \\"music\\" even after the fact that it was made clear that she is a complete fake. Rich Daddy's little girl. The record companies were forced to make this counterfeit in order to keep Jessica (who is also a talent less Britney Spears clone) or otherwise their father would break the contract. Look it up losers, its true. The only thing the CD is good for is for the rifle range. Otherwise avoid like the bubonic plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"um.....","review":"If this is truly her Autobiography, then her life is pretty sad. I am all for new and fun young pop stars, but she has little musicality. She plays no instruments and writes no songs; hopefully, she will explore trhose areas.

Good luck to her on a new cd!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashlee Schmashlee","review":"Indeed, with this chick's lip-synching debacle, what was she thinking? What are we the general public thinking? Why do we elevate her and so many other non-musicians like her into stardom? The music world has become such a fashion show that it's not only more difficult for real musicians to gain any footing, but it's also incredibly nauseating. So Ashlee Simpson got caught lip-synching...what a shocker! The only respect this 'band' deserves is for its members who actually play instruments. The other reviewers who deem this girl as having \\"exceptional talent\\" must either be her relatives or the mentally defective. Her entire career is forced and preposterous. It is an insult to actual bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who would pay money for this?","review":"It's bad enough the world is subjected to Jessica Simpson, but do we really need to have Jessica's far-less-talented sister shoved down our throats?Just because you are the sibling of somebody famous doesn't mean that you deserve to be famous too. Seriously, if this girl wasn't related to Jessica Simpson, do you think that any record company would give her the time of day? Enough said.Her meltdowns on SNL and the Orange Bowl just prove that she is totally untalented. A year from now, she'll be nothing more than a punch line to a joke and anyone owning a copy of this CD will be left feeling very, very embarrassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my buddha. she cannot sing for poo.","review":"her cd sounds decent probably because she recorded each track a gazillion times and selected the ones that didnt sound like chicken wailing.as many people noted, the fans booed her off stage at the orange bowl a couple days ago. deservingly so. she demonstrated that she has no sense of tone. and thus, to make up for her poo-poo voice, she decided wail her aweful hoarse voice and to thrust her [...] body all over stage.why is she so popular? i have no idea. she has no talent or skill whatsoever. she was lip-syncing on SNL... to the wrong song. so later, she blamed her band for messing up. good one. she needs to just shut up, quit the singing business, and just be glad that she is jessica's sister. she complains so much about herself being in her sister's shadow. but clearly, she is so much better off in her sister's shadow than being a complete loser-of-a-musician that she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"judge her by snl","review":"she gets all that for lip singing. she deserved it. and she lied. dont support a liar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashlee Simpson Is The Worst Singer Ever!","review":"OMG!

Crooning about boyfriends, flirting and her childhood, Ashlee's sound and lyrics aren't as mature as these veteran chick rockers, which makes the title of her album almost ironic.Perhaps she should have saved the title \\"Autobiography\\" for her third or fourth album, if she's lucky enough to make it that far. With 12 songs she co-wrote, it's also questionable whether this is really her autobiography."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok...","review":"ok, I think she borrowed her style from avril, I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure.

Ashlee sings about real things and she makes you feel like you are her because she describes her songs so deeply. This was the only CD I have ever listened to that has had a purpose.

This girl is miles ahead of her time by opening her soul like this, and we all should realize it now. Take the lyrics \\"I love how you can tell, all the pieces of me\\". I mean, it doesn't even sound like proper English on the first listen... but then I got it. She doesn't even need the English language to communicate her music, the song transcends the verbal form. Ashlee also perfects the art of metaphor with \\"Lala\\". She obviously wants sex, but using the term \\"lala\\" instead makes it so much more meaningful and intelligent.

That's when I heard some idiotic lyrics (\\"You can throw me like a boomerang, I'll come back and beat you up\\"), and a song which sounded like an AC/DC ripoff.If you want good female singing, look no further than Jill Scott, Joss Stone, Fantasia and Rebecca St. James.

More Hilary Duff than Courtney Love, Ashlee belts (or attempts to anyways) catchy hooks and one typical chorus after another. In the end Ashlee comes off desperate to make an image with her lyrics (\\"I'm the baddest girl in this messed up world\\", \\"you make me wanna La la in the kitchen on the floor\\") and fails to seperate herself from her pop peers.If looking for a good pop/rock album I recomend early Liz Phair (whip-smart) or Fiona Apple (Tidal)."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is total crap!","review":"im pissed off that i actually bought this cd!this album is terrible.she lacks any singing ability. thats all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"She hurts my ears with her terrible intonation and whiny voice.

Ashlee did a great job with this album! the songs are just awesome! and her voice sounds very good!. Its a shame what happend in SNL LAST YEAR, but Ashlee has proved in many times that SHE CAN PERFORM! her album Autobiography has sold over 3 million copies in the U.S.GO Ashlee!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Okay, first off, Ashlee Simpson does not have that good of a voice. But I do really like the songs on her CD, and she does sound better on here than when she is live. Obviously. But its not like she's a terrible singer, she's just not that good. But her songs are, so I don't know. I thought it was a pretty good CD. Of course, I didn't buy it though. So I don't know if it woulda been a waste of my money or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"LISTEN TO THIS!","review":"Hey i just bought the cd today and this cd is very very good for a debut cd. Its one of the cds that i can listen to from Beginning to the end that has been released this year!Ashlee Simpson is defaintly out of her sisters shadow now cause her debut cd is #1 on BILLBOARD charts already! and this cd is also POP/PUNK cd! This cd is just sooooo awesome. TRUST ME YOU WONT REGRET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful just awful","review":"All i have to say is remember the SNL lip-synching fiasco.This chick makes Milli Vanilli look respectable. At least they didn't pretend to \\"Rock\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all the same","review":"Ashlee Simpson, Clay Aiken and other American Idol rejects, Twitney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and the most overrated of them all, the equally undertalented and overexposed Jessica Simpson: These are poor excuses for music and if the aforementioned slop is all that record companies can market today, they should just pack it up and forget about it.Whatever happened to club scouting to find some struggling *musicians* who can sing, play instruments, and write their own material? Is that another thing of the past?Whatever the Simpson sisters did to get \\"reality\\" shows on MTV (besides the fact that their father is media savvy), I'll never know.The \\"music\\" industry has been in such sad shape for the longest time ... and the future doesn't look that much brighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashleeeeeeeee Simpson looks like a man.","review":"God, she's so ugly. Her hair looks like it's been burned or something. I'm so sick of seeing her on MTV taking up the time that good s*** could be on. I wanna teach her to sing one of these days but she'd probably just act like a two year old and run around messing with things so forget it. Her album is terrible and her voice is just aweful. How many times do we have to hear that stupid \\"Pieces of me\\" song on the radio?! By the way, I thought Josh's review was funny. I wish somebody'd throw the pieces of her away 'cause they're littering this planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh man","review":"Can you say one of the most over rated artists out there? Her lyrics are very random and sometimes make absolutely no sense whatsoever. They have medication for acid reflux by the way"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Ashlee Simpson is a great artist. Sure, she may not have the angelic voice of her sister, but she has her own, unique sound that you don't hear much of. She's done a great job not becoming a \\"pop-princess\\" and is really her own person, not Jessica Simpson's little sister. The lyrics on this CD make sense, are great to sing along with, and are not completely nasty. The rebel-rock image she has is awesome. The only thing about this CD I don't like is that it's not that much of a \\"dancing\\" CD, more of a \\"listening CD\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is not good!","review":"It's funny how so many 5 star reviews pop out of nowhere in 1 day and each persons review history has only the review of this album!????Hmmmm yeh I think there's this weirdo keep on using a bunch of acounts reviewing this horrible album 5 star reviews over and over and you can tell it's the same person from how he post the review it's adenticle to the others!This album is just horrible it has no substance and poor writing plus Ashlee has no voice what so ever maybe a talking voice but deff not a singing voice!This album is not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Respect for Music","review":"I caught one episode of the Ashlee Simpson Show. You know, the one where she can't sing live and goofs off with her friend while the 'grown-ups' add strings to one of her songs. How is she a recording artist? If you haven't ever had a live performance and you don't take music seriously, why are you in the business?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Sucky Singer! I Could Sing Betteer","review":"I can not believe how people can like her i mean come on she got booed off the stage and lip synced. How much more proof do you need? Her voice is raspy and shes ugly. i like her sister jessica simpson but man come on i could even sing better then her. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this! Maybe she'll stop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"soon this won't be able to happen","review":"Record labels are crumbling because of the internet and soon enough they won't be able to do things like this. If a dying person was trying to sell me this cd for a dollar so he could live, I wouldn't give him a second glance. She doesn't write any of \\"her\\" songs, sing any of \\"her\\" songs, or even look attractive (currently an attribute which can single-handedly elevate you to stardom).It's ok though, people don't know any better. The radio and television are the source of all evil in the music world. In time, the record companies will fall because they can no longer serve a purpose to talented artists. The internet makes it possible to promote your cd without the help of a label, so only \\"artists\\" like ashlee simpson need the record companies to tell people that they're talented.Enjoy your new Ashlee Simpson cd, your soul is escaping slowly out your ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I would have never purchased this album if I hadn't been watching \\"Newlyweds\\", and caught some of Ashlee's reality show right after. I heard some snippets, and every one I heard, I loved.Jessica's baby sister is all grown up and tells a story through each song. I think we all can relate to in this CD titled \\"Autobiography\\".The hit single \\"Pieces of Me\\" is one of my favorites, but there is also \\"Shadow\\" a song about the slight twinge of jealousy she had over her sister and her fame. \\"Lala\\", a funky song which she went all out and showed us her wild side, and \\"Better Off\\" which is more along the lines of \\"Pieces\\" but with a slight twist.I think this is a great debut, and while I don't think Ashlee is the greatest of singers, the songs take away from that fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Album. First album I've Ever Bought That I Don't Like.","review":"Two stars for Ashlee this time. The only tracks I like on this album were \\"Autobiography\\", \\"Pieces Of Me\\", \\"Shadow\\", and \\"Love For Me\\". The rest is... let's leave it at that. I am not going to resell it, I am going to keep it somewhere in my music library because I paid for it and if I get rid of it in any way I'll be wasting my money because this CD, although it was used one time, it's not worth much. Sorry Ashlee. \\"I Am Me\\" was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jealous?","review":"Jealous? Not really. Just puzzled and deeply annoyed.I can't answer for others, but what annoys me is that there are LOTS of other, far more talented people who will NEVER get the promotion and publicity they deserve. (And I'm NOT talking about myself or any members of my family.) When someone with no discernable talent whatsoever gets this kind of insane saturation promotion by the record industry, it's a fair question to ask why. There are girls at my local high school who can sing and dance and play guitar much better that Ashlee can. So, like an earlier reviewer asked, WHY HER?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a rising star...","review":"Usually my way of getting an album for a new artist ive got my eye on, is either by listening to samples of the album via amazon.com or reading the reviews and average rating of the certain star in amazon.com, too! ive read some bad and some good reviews about ashlee simpson here in amazon.com and even in many other websites... but still her 2 singles \\"pieces of me\\" and \\"shadow\\" just forced me to leave all those reviews and samples and go ahead and get the cd! so i did... from the first time it entered the cd-player, and from the first time it just played the whole cd i TRULY loved it! its not one of those cd:s with a suddenly boring song u gotta skip... i didnt skip not even one song! i think she is really talented... maybe she aint singing Punk rock in all its terms, still u can feel the true RocK in her music and how all her songs has a meaning... she is truly a rising star..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Everyone","review":"Ashlee Simpson's debut cd Autobiography is a must have cd for everyone. It doesn't matter what kind of music you like, everyone will find something to love on this cd. Most cd's you only listen to a few songs on, this cd is one that you can listen to the whole way through over and over again. I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it. I definitley recommend this cd to anyone and everyone. Don't waste time, get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow..","review":"Oh My Gosh.. this album kicks ass! I mean totaly!! At first I was really questioning if she had talent but YES SHE REALLY DOES! Her voice is something new and different and her writing talent is incredible.. she writes about stuff every girl can relate to, and her upbeat songs make you want to dance and her slower songs make you think! It's an album that you can sit and listen to the whole thing and never get bored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!","review":"Oh my gosh. My new favorite CD. Even though the songs could be a little bit longer... WOW! Awesome instrumentals! Great mix. Love the lyrics, and obviously, Ashlee is great! Way worth the extra 15 bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ASHLEE,IS NOT JESSICA","review":"ASHLEE HAS A UNIQUE AND POWERFUL VOICE, I DONT OWN THIS ALBUM YET BUT I'M BUYING IT AROUND THE FIRST WEEK IN AUGUST,I HEARD IT THROUGH MTV.COM, IT'S A REALLY GOOD ALBUM, SIMPLE IF YOU LIKE IT BUY IT,IF NOT DONT CRITICIZE IT, BY COMPARING HER ALBUM TO JESSICA'S FIRST ALBUM , HER SECOND OR THIRD ALBUM, THEY'RE DIFFERENT AND I LOVE EM' BOTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should be - 1 star","review":"\\"My band played the wrong song\\" ????? If the music is live you can stop the band and start over with the correct song, if you are an actual singer you'd probably know the words to the song (it is after all \\"your band\\") or yet still I know a number of singers, if it's new music to them they'll just make up the words on the spot.For the love of all that's holy; What must we do to get rid of these plastic studio produced insta-stars?Parents please, don't give in to your children's whines for this pseudo-music, and stop buying this crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I cannot begin to describe how horrible this album is. The only people who listen to this trash, are those teeny bopper girls who have there mommy and daddy buy there entire wardrobe from Hollister and have never even heard of such visionaries as Jack Kerouac nor Jim Morrison. It makes me sick to listen to this talentless piece of trash. If this girl was bore to any other family she would be rotting the gutter right now becuase she is talentless and has had every solitary thing spoon fed to her. Get a life , read a book, and get political."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even with sampled vocals, she still sounds groundbreakingly awful!","review":"Someone sure made an uh-oh on SNL, didn't she?That's one more reason not to buy this album, unless you're in desperate need of a drink coaster or a frisbee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not in her sis's \\"Shadow\\"","review":"Ashlee's CD contains the best music I have heard in a long tome! She veers away from the major pop sounds that we hear a lot lately, and he has a more rock-ish sound. Her self written lyrics show you her inner most feelings, and through her music, you feel like you know her. I give her CD 2 thumbs up! Even 3 if i had 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this album rocks socks~!!","review":"I've been waiting for Ashlee's CD since I read somewhere that she was beginning to record it. I absolutely LOVE her CD~!! I've gotten like, 8 of my friends to purchase the album and we've all agreed that our favorite song was \\"Shadow\\". All the songs on the album are absolutely wonderful, but Shadow definitely stands out...to me anyway. Cop the album...it's sOo worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"This is a very cool cd. I do like Ashlee's music better than Jessica's bc its more rock and to me feels more emotional and close to her. I would buy this cd for all my friends if i could."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cd in the word!","review":"Ashlee Simpson is deffinetly #1. I absolutly love this cd. Its amazing!I can listen to every song over n over again and not get tired of it.

This albums sux big time, cos it has written FAKE all over. And even if she have written and perform all the songs, they sound the same after LALA, I actually own the record."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll give her two stars for trying.","review":"Ok, I'm cutting her some slack. Can she really sing? I don't know because she seems to be \\"screaming\\" and forcing her vocal cords over music that sounds way to processed. Each song on the album plays this way. It is not fair to compare her though to other singers in her age group or genre. Each artist has his/her own style. I'm sure that Miss Simpson has some talent, it is just that this album doesn't quite reveal it. My friend bought this for me awhile back thinking I would like it. It really rates high on my crap-o-meter. I may give her another try someday. Maybe she just hasn't hit her mark yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashlee Simpson is a wannabe rocker girl","review":"Ashlee Simpson is the worst poser I have ever seen. She wants to potray herslef as a rocker girl by her music and the way she dresses. She does all this just because her producer doesn't want her to be like her hott sis Jessica. In addition, she is a bad singer, which became apparent on Saturday Night Live and the MTV VMA's. If you buy this CD be prepared for electronically altered music. Her series on MTV sucks...who cares about the life of a wannabe punk rock spoiled bi*ch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"Upon hearing this masterpiece I immediately threw my Joe Satriani CDs in the garbage. I did the same with my Zeppelin collection, as that stuff just isn't rock like this is. \\"Autobiography\\" simply has amazing guitar virtuosity that puts those losers to shame. Simpson can shred faster than Michael Angelo, play more complex runs than Allan Holdsworth, sweep pick better than Malmsteen, play legato better than Satch, write better melodies than Gilmour, tap better than Vai, and write superior riffs to that of Michael Romeo or James Hetfield. Not only is the music exquisite; the lyrics are also really deep. \\"You make me wanna la la\\" is a poignant - as well as intelligent - backlash to social conformity. Notice the use of colloquial language? That gives the music a totally hardcore, EXTREME edge.Okay, seriously, crap like this makes me envy the deaf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore this JUNK","review":"Garbage, this is pure garbage. She is a liar to all her fans, she acts like she's performing live, and people think it is live and think she's really good, but got caught out on SNL lip-syncing and blamed it on her band! She lies to her fans and tries to blame it on her band! What a disgrace! Don't support h0ez like Ashlee Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Talentless Family...","review":"Jessica Simpson is a Joke, no two ways around it. So when I heard her sister was coming out with her own C.D., I had to check it out for laughs. It exceeded my super low expectations alomst right away. Why do these talentless simpson girls keep getting second chances when there are REAL talents out there waiting to be discovered? It boggles the mind. bottom line, I HATE THIS ALBUM, and by no means should you purchase it...unless you accually like formulaic, mass produced garbage shoved down your throat by the good people at Mtv..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I find the one star superfluous.","review":"Wow. So it has really come down to this. How embarassing. This is the most contrived, force-fed collection of digitally-recorded swill I have ever beheld. How sad that young people are presented with this horrible scourge of sounds. I am embarrased for people who buy this sort of thing. I mean, she doesn't even sing. SHE DOESN'T SING. She is a stuffed animal created by a company. Without her sub-100 IQ possessing sister (not to mention her stage parents), she wouldn't even have an album out. This is just so.....sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd!!!!!","review":"I heard Ashlee's first song, Pieces of Me, on the radio...and was isntantly hooked. I would listen to it over and over. I was so excited when the cd came out. The cd is AMAZING..better then I thought it would be. There is not one song on the cd that I don't like! My fave song would have to be the last one, Undiscovered. Go out and buy this cd.as long as you like Pop Rock..you will LOVE this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazed","review":"I was very amazed and impressed with Ashlee Simpson's debut album. At first I figured this was just another one of those \\"one hit wonders\\" and maybe just a \\"i got famous because my older sibling is in the industry\\". But as I listened to the CD, I realized that was not the case at all. Ashlee is extremly talented. Each of her songs has its own story to tell; one for every listener to relate to. What I loved most about the CD was that every song sounded different from the last. EVERY song on this CD is good; I love CD's that you can just play thought without skipping to your favorites. In songs like \\"LaLa\\" she lets out feelings through a kind of heavy punk feeling, but in others like \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Undiscovered\\" she pours her heart out through slower and deeper lyrics. Overall, this is by far the best album I have heard in a long time. With her ear-catching music, amazing personality, and distinct style.. she is definitely not going anywhere anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashlee is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!","review":"I can't say I was surprised just how much Ashlee Simpsons album kicked!!

Not only does she leave the others in the dust, but she never looks back. I've never watched Ashlee's reality show so this CD was a big surprise. I hadn't planned on getting it either, but I decided to give her a chance and I'm not disappointed that I did. This is the best Pop CD I've heard this year. It's the only album that stands out in my head, that I care to remember, that I actually enjoy. Congratulations, Ashlee!!!Autobiography 10/10Pieces Of Me 9/10Shadow 9/10LaLa 10/10Love Makes The World Go Round 10/10Better Off 9/10Love Me For Me 10/10Surrender 10/10Unreachable 9/10Nothing New 10/10Giving It All Away 10/10Undiscovered 10/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are fully automatic assault rifles illegal?","review":"None of you have ever heard me do karaoke after a fifth of vodka.

Her songs are great and her voice is amazing. Its just the style of music i enjoy listening to and i love the whole album!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People are so silly...","review":"First of all, you people shouldn't be comparing Ashlee to her sister, Jessica. Just because they are sisters doesn't mean their cds are in the same genres. That is like comparing apples to oranges. Besides, I always personally felt that writing your own music wins half the battle of being an artist which makes Ashlee more of an artist than Jessica. But whatever everyone is entitled to their own opinion. In my opinion, I like this cd alot. Ummmm yeah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding debut from America's favorite sweetheart sister","review":"I've always known who Ashlee is, but I dismissed her as a blondie wannabe until I saw her new pictures, with the new hair and noticed how pretty her eyes are. She's really cute. Now I tune in to the show on MTV, and I'm so glad I became an Ashlee fan. This album is amazing. It has great songs, catchy hooks, and her voice is so cool. I really recommend this album. People might think it's not worth it, she's a wannabe, blah blah, but no. Don't let those misconceptions get in the way. Get this album now."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMFG!!! THE, LYKE, BEST ALBUM EVARRR!!!!!111","review":"Oh, Ashlee! You are so wonderful! Your music has so much meaning! And your voice? Forget Madonna, Aretha, or Alicia Keys, she blows them right out of the water! Buy this now!!!Actually, I was blowing smoke up your a.s.s. in that first paragraph and the title. The exact opposite of what I said there is the truth. Aretha, Madonna, and Alicia Keys are real artists with talent and songwriting skills, and Ms. Franklin could smoke Ashleeeee's vocal chords with one high note. Please, do music a favor. Do not buy this if you care about your ears. Please: buy something, ANYTHING! Just not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I think this cd is great. She is being herself thats why its called \\"autobiography.\\" I think everyone can relate to at least one song if not the whole cd. I know i can. She sings about normal everyday things like breaking up, getting together, and being in the shadow of her sister. I think this is one of my top album choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"Unlike her sister Jessica, Ashlee's songs have a serious touch. Sure, Jessica is ok, but I think Ashlee's songs are real clear and bold; in my opinion you can hear her voice going straight into you.

There are NO role-models in pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"good pop-rock","review":"I like more her debut than her new album \\"I Am Me\\". \\"Pieces Of Me\\" & \\"Shadow\\" were incredibly catchy and fresh the first times you heard them (especially pieces of me) but now they dont feel catchy anymore, both songs are still good but not so catchy as before. \\"Autobiography\\" & \\"LaLa\\" are good pop-rock songs.

She can't write songs and she is not very good at singing at all. I didn't like Jessica's singing so I thought that Ashlee would be better but she isn't...not even close. This CD is a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected.","review":"I did not find one song on here that I hated and would skip. I've seen 'The Ashlee Simpson Show' and when I saw her recording her music it didn't sound very good, but this is good. So, much better than I had ever expected.Worth buying if you like rock-pop and like a lighter version of Avril Lavigne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as Jessica Simpson - 2.5 stars","review":"Ashlee Simpson's CD Autobiography is somewhat of a bubblegum grunge style, which makes her sound a little different from her peers - but the style doesn't work very well. There are only three songs that stand out - \\"Pieces Of Me,\\" \\"Love Makes The World Go Round,\\" and \\"Nothing New.\\" And \\"Love Makes The World Go Round\\" has a melody that's a lot like Jimmy Eat World's \\"The Middle.\\" The song \\"Surrender\\" sounds like Hole for youngsters who aren't ready for Hole's music. \\"La La\\" has a good beat, but sounds forced lyrically. And \\"Shadow\\" doesn't really make me emotional. Ashlee's father had a role in making Ashlee famous. At least Ashlee's CD isn't as boring as Jessica's CDs, though. And her vocals are versatile and go against the girly vocals trend. I bought this CD based on \\"Pieces Of Me,\\" and while I now know I could have gotten something better, there are songs that might make me listen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Say Cheesy?","review":"I found this CD to be a wooden, plastic performance by Ashlee. Most of her songs didn't even have that much meaning to them. In fact, I believe that she lipsings. She has a very raspy, raw voice. Better luck next album, Ashlee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pop music has just taken a turn for the worse","review":"man.. back in tha day pop music was the beatles, rolling stones, more recently nirvana, pearl jam, red hot chili peppers. and now 2004/2005 we have ashlee simpson.. this girl is kinda pretty but in all honesty, completely talentless (in music at least). that \\"i wanna lala\\" song is horrendous! it's just sooo horrible. and as if the song wasn't enough, she had to make a video for it! somebody explain to me what that video is about. she pushes and shoves her friends around while going from one place to another? it's just so dumb and mindless.. so everyone, DON'T buy this album. just download pretty pictures of her or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ears, my poor poor ears!!!","review":"What did I do to deserve actually thinking this might have been good!?!?!?!?!?!? Let me make this short and sweet, well almost short and definately not sweet.Ashlee Simpson is like all the other pop star singers sisters or younger siblings that decided, \\"Hey, I want to be just like my big sis, bro, or cousin because being rich and famous already since I am related to her/him isn't enough.

You are paying because they have sucked you into the commercials that they air 24 hours a day. Every minute of programming is a commercial, whether labelled \\"reality show\\" or not, there's a product in the works that they want you to buy. Ashlee Simpson is just a karoke singer with a famouse sister, but so many were fooled into thinking that they \\"needed\\" her album, this product for one reason or another. If you like her, that's fine, enjoy! But please look into all the thousands of struggling, talented artists that would blow you away!

Last but not least, how times change: almost 15 years ago, Milli Vanilli were crucified for basically doing the same thing, yet Ashlee gets a second chance and there is no uproar from the music industry...

But I have to ask why are people so surprised?I thought people would discover that Ashlee (Ashley/Ashlie/Ashli - you know spelling that name in crazy ways is kind of cute I guess) is another fake singer in a long line of fake singers. Just listen to a sample from each of these \\"Superstars\\" - they all sing the same songs in the same manner.I was unfortunate enough to listen to one of Ashlee's ditties while channel surfing; wow - is this stuff bad. Its worse than the creations record producers make for Brittany S. Sure she got busted on live TV. I get a laugh out of it but people will still buy her CDs because, like most mass marketing schemes, it has been carefully crafted to appeal to a large sector of a selected demographic.People are calling her \\"ugly\\" but that is irrelevent; all I care about is how the music sounds. It sounds bad. Demand more from your music people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which came first...","review":"... the german or the fake?Long story short... Ashlee's fake. I recently found a song that sounds exactly like 'Autobiography' by a german artsit. Unfortunately I don't speak german so the only similarity I can establish is between the sounds of the two songs. Anyway see for yourself... download \\"Tränenschwer\\" by Juli from the album 'Es Ist Juli'Again, I'm not drawing any conclusions as to which song came first. Just that there are two songs out there that sound exactly the same.

Unoriginal, bad lyrics, and even a bad voice. Why is this popular? Avril Lavigne is ten times better than this and I don't like her either. Jessica Simpson is hot with a good voice, and Ashlee is her kind of ugly her sister. That is the only reason she even made a record. \\"You make me want to lala with you on the kitchen floor\\"?

She's riding her (extremely talented) sister's coat tails, but it won't be long before the whole world catches onto the fact that she has no talent of her own. The punk image is clearly a way to distinguish her from Jessica - which is understandable because something has to draw attention away from her \\"voice.\\" I'm sure she's a very nice person, but I would rather listen to a dying goat than to Ashlee Simpson. That is, if I could even tell the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this music?!","review":"Too bad you can't give an album 0 stars, because that's ALL that Ashlee's Simpson's \\"Autobiography\\" deserves.

I was completely shocked to find myself hanging on every word and not wanting to miss one beat. IN ALL HONESTY her CD is SIMPLY AMAZING. From start to finish you will find youself hooked. Every song is something new and diffrent. It is definatly not like anything you have heard before.

Don't try to act all hardcore when you sound identical to Hillary Duff and Britney Spears. At least those two don't try to fake who they are.

Despite hundreds of manhours using Pro-tools and a world class team of songwriters and producers behind her, Ashlee still sounds like nothing but absolute garbage.Also the positive reviews are fake and were written by Ashlee streetteam members. Do not believe any of them. Notice how they are ambiguous and the reviewers have never reviewed anything else on Amazon.

It's so raspy and horse sounding, that it is unappealing. In her hit single, \\"Pieces of Me\\" I think that she actually created brand new notes that didn't exist before.She attempts to achieve that Avril vibe, but she doesn't realize that we ALREADY have an Avril who, although more talented with a better voice, is equally annoying. There is not enough room in the music buisness for one of them, let alone both.Ashlee should have just stuck to acting. She was great on 7th Heaven, and fit that role perfectly.

The music's mundane melange of Avril-ish brat pop and Sheryl Crow cod rock reaches its nadir on \\"Love Me for Me,\\" an anemic rip of AC/DC's \\"Back in Black,\\" wherein Ashlee does Courtney Love, wailing in lieu of hitting notes. \\"Nobody's really seen my million subtleties,\\" she says on the title track.

Sadly, she has no talent which shows through the album. The worst part is the tunes are catchy, so you embarass yourself at work or school singing them.We had to endure her struggling to sing each track on this album, in three-second clips at a time, on her MTV show. Then we had watch her get caught lip-syncing on Saturday Night Live because of, according to her, acid reflux!

Then they take the painting to some top art gallery and watch as a load of no talent, more money than sense, people critic it and praise the wonderful flowing streams of deepening shades of blue sky... and it promptly sells for $10,000 dollars.I am convinced that the recording companies have done the same thing with Ashlee Simpson. They have pushed forward someone with no obvious talent and are sat back laughing as people actually buy this rubbish. She was obviously embarrassed into singing live after the SNL stunt and we all saw the result of that.. how can people purchase an album from someone who obviously can not sing live.. ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashlee Simpson","review":"Ashlee's album is breathtaking. When I heard of Ashlee Simpson, I stereotyped her to be just like her sister. But then I heard \\"Pieces of Me\\" on the radio! It blew me away.

You can tell they're coming from Ashlee's heart and she sings them with an awesome attitude and an incredibly original voice. Some of the music on her CD makes you stop and think and realize you relate to it but then other tracks like \\"Lala\\" make you want to roll the windows down and blast it. Go buy it!

I automatically thought that she would fit into this cliche \\"girly rock\\", and that it wouldn't be original at all. I watched the show with as much of an open mind as possible, and I was completely blown away. This girl can sing, and I am not talking about poppy vocals only. She can sound as hard as she wants or as \\"pretty\\" (as they called it in the show) as she wants. The album has \\"in your face\\" songs (autobiography) as well as songs dealing with love (Pieces of Me), heartbreak (Unreachable), evolution (Shadow) and just feel good party songs (LaLa).

Her annoying creeky voice gets burrowed into your head and OMG you'll cry.. im serious..anyways.. bit waste of money, all these songs blow.. if you want a better pop singer, i totally suggest Avril.. she's way better trust me!.. yup well im trusting you to TAKE MY ADVICE! ha..

I don't know who or what that reviewer below is, but I think he would have been more correct in saying \\"I hate myself and choose to torture my soul with this terribly awful album, if you could call it that.\\" I have not heard this album and don't need to. Why am I reviewing it? Because it's 2 am and my soul aches with hatred for no-talent siblings of no-talent stars who somehow get record deals."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never seen Ashlee's MTV show...","review":"Interesting that most of the reviews here make some reference (mostly disparaging) to Ashlee's reality show on MTV. In my view, this lends an element of bias to the reviews, since most people who have seen the show have probably already formed a view of Ashlee (positive or otherwise).For impartial reviews, have a look at Amazon.co.uk, where the writers have, for the most part, never seen Ashlee on MTV, and many had never heard of her before this album was released. Like me, most people found this to be an engaging and enjoyable pop/rock debut. The fact that Ashlee is \\"manufactured\\", and that her voice may not be exceptional, is largely irrelevant. Why? Because you wouldn't know this if you just listened to the CD on it's own merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than her sis","review":"I love this CD. Even though Jessica's voice is prettier than Ashlee's I think that Ashlee has a much better CD because the songs are much catchier.

Not to mention, there are some really awesome songs that just make you want to dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok","review":"it is an ok cd but i wouldn t buy it.who wants to buy the cd of a phony?i heard her liveand she sucks.she lip sings anyways"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just complete C***!","review":"This album is the perfect example of how the Recording Industry would slam garbage in our CD players and fill our airwaves with trash and expect us to put down $30! This \\"artist\\" has no buisness being touted as a singer. The songs are boring and typical pop junk. I feel sorry for her band. I am tired of cut and paste music. If you like this you must be very small minded indeed. Get her out now. This is nepotisim in it's highest form. I would give it no stars if I could. How does a person like this get a gig like The Orange Bowl. It is completly beyond me.It is time for people to hear of IQ, Arena, Riverside and Proto-Kaw.

The only way this shiza sells is people who think like this excerpt i found on another review for this CD:\\"There are alot of catchy songs on here, alot I can relate to.\\"Case. Point. Everything. It's not music \\"we\\" are looking for anymore, it's an outlet to dispell our frustration toward not being able to fit into the ideal lifestyle (i.e. rich, attractive, popular icon).I may be speaking beyond my concrete knowledge of everyone else, but the pattern I see manifesting itself from pop music has little to nothing to do with actually making quality albums.It is quite unfortunate, and it will only get worse.

AINT GONNA HAPPEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOO....","review":"Ashlee Simpson has no talent! Bottom line -- her \\"talent\\" and image are manufactured just like all the other MTV pop princesses clogging up the airwaves. Just because she now has black hair and wants to seperate herself from her sister's image does not mean she is \\"unique\\" and \\"punk -rock\\".

These reviews are fake, and I can promise you there is nothing Punk or Rock about this CD. In fact, it goes against everything Punk and Rock stand for.The record company put a bunch of interns on computers and told them to write this stink, and the sad part is, all of those employees and interns actually did it, and in turn, sold their own souls to be a part of this machine.Please don't fuel an already completely screwed up industry, by buying this crap, this is the biggest widget you have ever seen, and I promise you this CD will be over by the time you read this reviewLet the truth be told!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My dilemma","review":"I just don't know.

Singing is not what makes an artist! Someone who can sing but nothing else is like a person who can draw, but they draw the stupedist things. Contrary to what peaple may think, maybe she does write her own lyrics; stupid people write stupid lyrics. She had her own t.v. show almost completly dedicated to promote this album, and people think that's okay. Real artists don't give damn about downloading music, how they look and they come from families not those of higher stock. At least most of them. She fails at most of these this album is purely manufactured by the stupid record company. This represents what is wrong with modern music."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not deserve any stars","review":"to begin my review i can confidently say that all the five star reviews for this lousy album are being written either by her pr people or her parents.this girl just cant sing at all .all the songs especially la la suck and it is no surprise that she was caught lip synching at the SNL permormance and gotbooed at the orange bowl.i will request you not to waste your money to make this woman rich.avoid.get any album from the eagles or the doors instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste","review":"I was very disappointed when I heard her CD.

I think you could spend your 13 dollars on another CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry, but I CANNOT stand Ashlee Simpson!!","review":"I just do not like her voice and her style, I mean Jessica Simpson is alot better that Ashlee!

But that isn't acceptable. Music is more than melodies and production. Music is about heart and passion, neither of which Ashlee has. Yes, I like a few songs and find this album to be pretty good. But \\"pretty good\\" doesn't sell 300,000 copies and hit #1. No, MTV does that.Stop eating whatever MTV feeds you and start to discover music for yourselves. There's a lot of undiscovered beauty out there that unfortunately takes a back seat to this MTV-concocted garbage. Mandy Moore is more rock than Ashlee can ever wish to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album.","review":"Despite all the controversy over her voice, the songs on this album are fun and catchy. I like every one of the songs on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very calculated music?","review":"Give Ashlee Simpson some credit - she (or her management) knew that the only way to break out of the shadow of her older sister, Jessica, was to be her opposite. So, she dyed her blonde hair jet-black, based her music in rock, not dance-pop, and co-wrote every song on her 2004 debut, Autobiography (Jessica only co-wrote one on her debut, Sweet Kisses). It could be argued that this makeover for the star of the square WB TV series 7th Heaven is a bit too calculated, but regardless of the intent, the end result is very, very bad music. Stay clear of this one folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down","review":"I strongly disagree with Tammy La Gorce(Amazon's reviewer of this album). Ashlee Simpson's attempt at a deep and meaningful album provides us with little more than a young woman with dreams of being an idolized singer, yet merely seconds into the first track it is painfully clear, that a singer she is not. Unfortunately for Ashlee one must first possess the pipes (naturally) to be considered a true, talented artist. She simply does not have that, in other words she is missing the first and most essential element in her fruitless quest to national stardom. I will not waste time in explaining why each and every song on this album lacks any gripping power whatsoever, but i will tell you that i did indeed (and it was painful) listen to every track in order to assess my review accurately and fairly. Im sorry Tammy you may be anxiously awaiting a sequel, I however am praying their will never be one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth 1 star","review":"Even though she tries to tell us shes not like her sister her music screams \\"I'm just my sister with a wanna be rock band behind me\\"! Even with Joel and Benji of Good Charlotte's help (which wasn't much) she still couldn't make it. Her efforts are wasted. Her sound is not unique or different. She sounds like everyone else. So why should anyone even waste their time on her? Please tell me b/c I don't know why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh good god","review":"This is the kind of uninteresting, uninventive and completely boring crap that is ruining modern music: There is no creativity, originalitly, or personality in this cd what so ever. This is for kids and (forgive my use of stereotypes) prepy highschoolers. I don't understand how this kind of stuff can become so popular. You want to listen to artists who can actually play instruments, are original, and know what they are doing? Try bands like Metallica, Aerosmith, Dave Matthews, Vast, or James Taylor. All of these bands put themselves into their music, know how to play, and can actually write. I wish bands like Ashlee Simpson would fade into an unpleasant memory and allow the true stars to come out and be seen for what they are. But, as long as this garbage is on the air waves, I will continue to bash it for the crap it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autobiography by Ashlee Simpson","review":"Coming from a trained musician, this CD is horrible. Not only does Simpson fail to hit any right pitch or stay within the key, she also fails to sing within her range. She will damage her voice as well as listeners ears which she already has done if she is not stopped. She cannot sing. The only reason why she ever got a record deal is that her father is a manager and that she is Jessica Simpson's sister. I am now reminded why she was booed at the Orange Bowl. Given, she did lip sync on SNL, but, if you cannot sing worth anything, then use a better track....BUT...she cannot sing, so no track is worth using. I warn any and everyone not to buy this album. It is yet another indication that musical aesthetics are no longer a premise on which to sign artists. The industry is a black hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"From George (a real record producer)This is the weakest major label CD I have heard in the last ten years. Amateur singing, generic arrangements, more of the same production. This girl is far from being in the same league as Gwen Stefani or even Avril Lavigne (both authentic developed acts). If this girl was not Jessica's sister this album would not have been made! Media made reality show driven throw away pop. Don't waste your money. This girl can't sing.This review board is being spammed with non authentic posts by Geffen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another reason to hate US pop culture","review":"this is proof how MTV and Clear Channel can make your career without actually having any real talent behind it.An awful singer AshLEE simpson is here riding the coatails of her sister Jessica who is a mediocre singer.Sa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Ashlee but your cd isnt very good.....","review":"This cd is pretty bad. Bought it at tower yesterday popped it in my car on the way home and by the time we got home me and my 3 girlfriends thought it was really really bad. The music itself is ok, nothing special. Her singing isnt very good and I cant related to her at all. Im a 16 year old and after watching her tv show and listening to her music, me and my friends cant find any way we can relate to a girl like her. How can a girl with her lifestyle try to write songs about my regular life? she cant! I prefer listening to Avril Lavigne who has much more to say about my life that Ashlee Simpson ever will. Sorry Ashlee, god bless you but your music sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave Ashlee a try....not impressed :(","review":"Before I begin my criticism of this cd, let me start by saying that Ashlee is a very beautiful young woman, Unfortunately her musical abilities do not match her looks. Think bubblegum meets bad shopping mall punk and thats this album in a nutshell. Her voice, which is heavily vocoderized throughout to correct her inability to hold a key pales in comparison to her sister, Jessica's voice. Lyrically the album is what youd expect from a teenager, very shallow and not very intense. The music itself sounds like something that is preset on a casio keyboard. Ashlee gives her best attempt at doing an Avril impression and just comes up short! This album gets 1 out of 5 stars, TERRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album totally sucks!","review":"Saw you on MTV and bought this on sunday.your singing really really sucks!your songwriting sucks even worse!tracks # 2,3,5,7 were absolutely pitiful!!!I totally do NOT RECOMMEND this album!1 out of 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon and Ashlee deserve each other","review":"How can a cd which has notched so many one star ratings get an average of 4 stars?

I seriously think my intelligence has been lowered just from hearing this on the radio. This girl has one of the most dreadful voices I have ever heard. You know there are REAL MUSICIANS out there who dont gain a fifth of the attention and respect this chick does. Ones who write their own songs and dont use machines to make themselves sound good (even though even with machines Ashlee Simpson sounds horrible). Really, if it wasnt for her amazingly hot sister nobody would care about this girl. Dont buy this album, please dont give the Simpson family more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashlee why dont u go on American Idol to see how well u do","review":"Ashlee why don't you go on American Idol to see how well you do?!! You would be voted off in the first episode, you have no live singing talent at all. It goes to show you how much voice editing went into her album. She is just like Usher, a terrible singer who uses mass amounts of voice editing. Usher cant sing live either. Just listen to her on the RMAs. She was terrible!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashlee, leave us alone!!!!!!!","review":"After the SNL issue, she still thinks she can entertain us. I never liked her to be honest but what was that? On SNL, after her voice played out, she did a heel-toe puh-lease, like we're convinced you're not a doofus already.I really don't like Ashlee or her air-head sister. The Simpsons need to get a life. Ashlee is a parasite and needs attention. GO AWAY!!!! no one likes your fake crap!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Talent","review":"This mass marketed junk somehow sells instead of real artists that compose their own work instead of letting producers do it for them.

You deserve every shallow lyric, and every studio-generated vocal on this. Wesley Willis has more talent than most of these pop clowns, and he was an obese shizophrenic who heard voices in his head and sung to the backdrop of the demo songs on a $40 keyboard. I hope it is clear from Ashlee's less than stellar performance on RMA tonight that her artistic talent is zero, and that \\"artists\\" like her should be thankful there are enough morons out there to buy into the charade to make them rich. Personally, I will continue to listen to music that isn't contrived and send my dollars to people who deserve them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to real music?","review":"[...]what so ever.

Much of the sound on this album youve probably heard elsewhere. Lyrically the tone is very simple and shallow, very much what youd expect from a rich girl with a gift record deal.

While at first glance, Ashlee Simpson may seem like the rest, her album sound is somewhat different. Of course, she has the regular pop sound with: \\"Pieces of Me\\" and \\"Better Off\\" (which is an excellent track, by the way), she also shows a little deeper side with: \\"Undiscovered\\" and \\"Giving It All Away.\\" All-in-all this album is great!

Its only too bad that orange bowl performance couldn't have been saved for halftime at the biggest one of them all and since it wasn't, we probably CAN expect another album <shudders>, seriously folks, save your money and go buy a Stone Temple Pilots or Mother Love Bone record instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic!","review":"Shame on those of you who pay money for this tripe and allow for shallow, talentless drones to continue to make a living in entertainment while true artists starve. Ashlee Simspson doesn't deserve any of what she has. She needs to be blackballed for the trickery and fraud she is guilty of. She must be removed from radio and television.

There's no creativity or any remote hint of originality! I'm getting so sick and tired of albums like this! The whole album is pretty much teen-movie-friendly pop-rock.

Ashlee should thank her lucky stars that she was able to ride her big sis's coat tails and have Daddy get her her own MTV show otherwise this CD would have been in the $1 bargain bin before you could say *heinous.* Save your money - unless you like really expensive drink coasters (which is what my copy has become)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a kid, but...","review":"Im not going to waste any time telling everyone what they already know, that Ashlee Simpson is just the powers that be duping the masses.

This music is about as dangerous as canned baby food and, while on the topic, about as musically inclined.Naming a song La La and classifying it as rock insults every principle of past or modern music.

Mtv does play a big role in her music career. she gets exposed by her sister, due to her so called ''talent'' and mtv shows her a lot. but what i admire about her the most is that at first she wasnt lip-synching.i saw her shows and she went to hospitals and truly cared for her fans. plus she is a rebel at heart who doesnt want to be known as ''jessica's little sister'' so i congrats you ashlee you showing everyone what you are really about. her cd overall was pretty good,she has a lot of hits on it unlike her sister who didnt have many like ashlee. so who has the talent really?AShlee is more talented than her sister she has a better voice and WRITES her own songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible....plain and simple","review":"Ok...Who gave this girl a record contract anyway?? Her voice is scratchy and her TRYING to be punk is just something to laugh at. The ONLY reason why she is considered famous is because of her sister Jessica who actually has a great voice, and that WONDERFUL performance on SNL which, i LOVED by the way! I read one review that said she only got a deal because of her looks and because of her family....ok I'm not buying into the looks...she looks like a dunk if you ask me. The songs on the CD made me laugh, she is pure bubble gum pop...not rock or \\"punk\\". The CD is NOT good at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"another person trying to sound punk","review":"the only thing I have to say is she sucks a$$. She trying to hard to sound like everybody else and her tv show on mtv only helped her to make people buy her cd because she knew that without being on mtv her cd would have not been bought.DO NOT BUY THIS AWFUL CD!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Of course you all fall for it","review":"AHSLEE SIMPSON DOES NOT MAKE ROCK MUSIC!!!! she is completely pop. just because there is a guitar in the background it doesnt mean it is rock music. another thing is she didnt earn her record deal, her sister is the reason she is famous. she probably woke up one morning and thought \\"im gonna make a cd\\". the guys her produce her know she sucks, but she has a tv show and her sister is famous so they knew her cd would sell. also she cant sing, its very raspy and airy, and on the show you can tell she is trying really hard to sing but she still sounds awful. ashlee simpson is an over privelaged spoiled brat who didnt have anything bad happen in her life to sing about. if i could i would give her 0 stars but 1 is the lowest. ashlee, start kissing jessica's feet, she is the only reason why we know who you are. and one more thing, just because you have brown hair it doesnt mean youre anymore punk, so go hang out with your buddy avril."},{"rating":"1","title":"ashlee sucks","review":"the one reason that ashlee simpson is even famous is because her sister is amazingly hot and has a wicked good voice. Ashlee is an idiot and doesn't deserve to have a cd at all. I hate her and think that the people at the orange bowl were right. If you want to listen to a girl that can actually sing, I recommend Janis Joplin."},{"rating":"1","title":"even i could do it","review":"Wow, ashlee has the most talent ever. First of all, she's only famous because of her sister. She's just another girl on the planet who's sister just happen to be a star(she is living proof that you can go to school and learn virtually nothing) Ashlee a.k.a lipsycker decied she wanted to let everyone know that she is not a dumb as her sister and had a tantrum untill the music business said she could be famous too.

I could care less if i see a 'piece' of you again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it 0 stars if I could!","review":"Yeah, at first, I though that this was gonna be a great album. Most of the songs are stupid. They have dumb lyrics, and her voice is very bad. Everyone knows, that she is only famous because of her sister Jessica Simpson. Now Jessica knows how sing! Ashlee Simpson sucks, literally! When she sang at the Orange Bowl, she was wearing this black cocatoo feather thing on her ass. She was really singing, but she was so bad, she got booed off the stage! I was like, well she sure deserves it! I watched the Ashlee Simpson show, and it was about her SNL deal, where she was caught lip-singing. She said that her voice was so raspy that she wasn't able to sing. Her voice was fine!!!!!!!! She didn't sound like she was sick or her throat hurt! She was screaming before she went on!!! Just goes to show you, that this is a total and complete FAKE!

REALLY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you would expect..","review":"When i first heard about Ashlee Simspon getting a record deal i was like whoa how did this happen?? well let me tell you, when \\"pieces of me\\" came out i fell in love with the song.

Her debut cd is beyond amazing everyone i know who has heard it loves it.. her sound is different and it works.. and for those who say she doesnt write her own lyrics.. check the song credits.. all of them say Ashlee Simpson.. i believe this cd might even do better than her sister's since jessica's album is making more success over remaking songs.. Autobiography is worth buying.., every song is perfect.. PERIOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good CD","review":"I listen to bands like STP, Pearl Jam, 311, Rush, etc., and I thought that this CD was entertaining.

I see many loyal fans commenting on either fighting out the ''haters'' or their comments are influenced by somehting other than the actual music. As a musician, I must say some of these songs really stink. Considering that she lips synch, she sucks as a singer more and its really bad for the music world. It lowers the standard for musician like the fact that everyone can lip synch but if anyone can actually sing(the rating is based on the songs alone otherwise I would give her a 1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin'!","review":"I love this album, she has all the throaty aspects of the great women of today's rock, Gwen Stefani, Courtney Love and others.

The album, however, is a horrible letdown. The only decent songs on it are Pieces of Me (#2) and possibly Better Off (#6). I think all the others are poorly conceived, poorly written, and poorly performed. I strongly advise you not to buy this--it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAVE THE SINGING TO YOUR SISTER!!","review":"Where should I start? This album is absolute garbage, which is funny because much of it sounds like she grew up listening to the actual band Garbage. Her singing abilities on this album are mediocre for lack of a better word. Her song writing skills are even worse! My only advice to this girl is to quickly abandon her dreams of being a musician and leave the singing to her elder sister!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You go Girl!","review":"Yeah Ashlee Simpson can rock. I hear she's trying to move forward to a different level now since her sister put great stuff which is alright for occasions. I wanna her ask her one day if she'll have a chance to incl. me as a special guest off her next album. Maybe I don't know. Anyway I love her to death and hopefully she'll put out 'nother one in the near future.Yep I seen her reality show on MTV and recently saw her do an interview on TRL which I love to watch occasionally. I had in my mind before or after her first CD was put out I may go buy just b/c I seen her do her acting on \\"7th Heaven\\" (which is my favorite show).Songs included I love are: Autobiography, Lala, Pieces of Me, Surrender, and so on and on.Can't wait to go pick it up.Big up to my girl w/ a wonderful talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aggggh!

It's \\"singers\\" like Ashlee that demean the existence of the other honest-to-God great singers like Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera, Beyonce, JoJo, Amy Lee, and Sarah McLachlan. Ashlee really needs to just stick to acting and hang up her rusted pipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"When I got the album, I knew I loved Pieces of Me, but I didn't know how much I would like the album as a whole. After listening to the whole album, I fell in love with it. It is a very enjoyable album and that is what counts in my opinion. My second favorite song on the album would be LaLa, but I love them all. If you enjoy her type of music, you shouldn't be disappointed. There may be others that are better vocalists at this time, but she can hold her own and this album is already one of my favorites of this year. I can't stop listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"well atleast your hair is nice..............................","review":"what can i say about your album?the lyrics are downright terrible.your voice is at best typical.the music sounds off the rack.If youre thinking about buying this, think again youre probably gonna be very disapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lightweight","review":"it's no seceret who has the Vocal skills of the family.Jessica has the Skills but didn't Hit like Ashlee. run of the mill material&songwriting through out.i feel this has novelty written all over it&Pretty much about as deep as Her sister's tv project.nothing really stands up but the right last name.but it's about Dollars&sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"I bought this the day it came out and exspected something different and good since \\"Pieces Of Me\\" is good,But I was wrong this album is just a waist of money \\"Lala\\" is just repetive and very annoying and \\"Shadow\\" is very very cheesy.This album is not good at all and is not worth to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...Why does Nepotism Rule the Industry?","review":"Umm, let me first address the person who wrote \\"just because you don't sound like Mariah doesn't mean you don't have a good voice.\\" I agree, but Ashlee Simpson CANNOT SING AT ALL. In EVERY SINGLE SONG on the CD, she is off-key for at LEAST half of the song. Her voice is way too nasal, and it sounds like she's screaming.If you've ever watched her show, you can see how she goes from sounding like crap in the studio, to average on her CD (which for her is quite a leap). Ahh the magic of the studio.I would give her credit for writing the songs, but they sound bad. What CAN this girl do well? Nothing. This CD is audio proof that you can do anything you want if you're related to a celebrity.Buy the CD if you want your ears assaulted. Otherwise, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"In my opinion there are only 2 really good songs here, Pieces Of Me and La La - if I could I would give 5 stars to those songs, zero stars to the rest of the cd. Her lyrics are not very meaningful, and after a while you get the idea that she is singing about the same thing over and over - oh wait, she is! Her popularity is fueled by her sister's success and her over exposure on MTV.

Then, the \\"talking\\" mechanism for the parrot would stick most of the time, so it would repeat part of the phrase and then \\"stick\\". Also, you had to be REALLY close for the bird to pick up your voice at all. I put in brand new batteries, thinking that might be the problem, but it made no difference. I was really disappointed as I had purchased one of these parrots locally about 15 years ago. The quality was great -- in fact, you could put the bird down and speak something from across the room, and it would repeat. Also seems like the original allowed you to say a longer phrase -- this version only allows a few words.

Both the French and Spanish versions have an uplifting musical accompaniments to splice the different sections, and both the French and Spanish versions each have two narrators/hosts/teachers who banter back and forth with each other to make the learning more fun and make the material more retainable. However, on the Italian version, there is only one narrator, and she is slow and deliberate, as if she's reading from a script and she constantly refers the listener back to the book. I could not keep my attention easily focused on the speaker because her speech was too slow. I also found the French and Spanish versions nice because I could use them in the car or while doing household chores.

Also Eleanor Rigby/Eleanor's Dream is a cool variation on the orginal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Obviously the reviewer for Amazon missed the whole point here, the album, as well as the movie are great for any Paul McCartney fan. The plot of the movie, at least to me, is irrelevant wether is good or bad; the reason I liked the movie is because I get to see Macca play his music, and the reason I like the CD is because he plays some Beatle tunes, and some new songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul At His Creative Peak","review":"The movie isn't so good. It's easy to see that Paul was going for something that would attain a cult status ... but the movie actually doesn't have enough music or enough pacing to make that team (Rocky Horror Pic Show might be short of dreadful, but you can dance to it and it moves at a dizzying pace). But the star of this vehicle is the music ... and it is terrific. Paul re-imagines some of The Beatles stuff and seamlessly blends his own stuff in. I don't agree with one reviewer who called the solo efforts 'tepid'. In fact, these songs showcase Paul at his creative and melodic peak. 'So Bad' is a stand-out, as is his medly. The absolute best is the disco-fied version of 'No More Lonely Nights' that thrums through the end credits ... it evokes Paul with Wings in the 70s, but adds that oh-so-special 80s take on the music. The movie is worth watching to hear the music. But all things being equal, just buy this terrific soundtrack and make your own movie in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats not to like?","review":"Ive had to buy this \\"album\\" three times now - two cassettes (one got stolen) and now the CD.

The remakes of Beatles classics are particularly offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Paul? Why?","review":"If it weren't for the three new songs on this disc, I'd probably give it ZERO stars. I mean, come on-- why did he think it would be a good idea to record new (WEAK) studio versions of Beatles' classics?? God bless Ringo for refusing to play on them. And WHY did he choose to re-record fluff like \\"So Bad\\" that came out just the previous year? At least there were three good new songs (FOUR counting the dance version of \\"no more lonely nights\\"). \\"No More Lonely Nights\\" was his best single in years, and \\"No Values\\" and \\"Not such a Bad Boy\\" represented his most convincing rock'n'roll since late-era Wings."},{"rating":"1","title":"no regards","review":"Paul has made some interesting works, other are not so and finally has created a few CDs really creepy. This one belongs to the last group. How come somebody recommend this work. First and foremost, there's just one song to remark \\"No More Lonely Nights\\". Second, most of the songs are covers (quite cheesy) of his'. Third, he had the nerve of making sloppy-cheesy covers of some Beatles' classics such as: \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"here, there and everywhere\\" that's unforgivable.

I began working my way through each lesson (one per week) in late fall and recently completed the last one. Now I follow Bill daily as he works his way through the entire form. It's almost like having one's own personal trainer. I particularly value his instructions on breathing. And if I wish to review any particular step, it's very easy to switch back to that lesson. It's clear that my initial hesitation was unnecessary. As a long time university professor, I am not easily impressed, but I consider Bill to be an excellent teacher.

Its not as pleasing as the scent of shampoos like Pantene but for a medical product it is all fine. The only thing I did not like is the price, and of course, even the 7 oz. bottle is pretty small.

In 2010, all you'll remember will be Lena Horne's \\"Stormy Weather\\", or Ella Fitzgerald's \\"You're My Thrill\\" or Billie Holiday's \\"You've Changed\\" - all originals from decades ago which you can buy NOW and HERE at one click on your mouse. Frankly, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joni past her prime","review":"Joni Mitchell was great in the past, but on Both Side's Now she proved to be a has been. Does anyone notice the similarity to Marianne Faithfull in her vocals?? On Both Side's Now, Joni trudges through jazz standards and murder's Etta James, \\"At Last\\" in the process. Joni Mitchell should have ended her career on a high note rather than killing her legendary status by releasing garbage such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could she?","review":"I love Joni Mitchell so I could not bring myself to give her zero stars. Yet I strongly dislike this album. What I loved about her music of the past was gone from the Both Sides Now. She is a singer and song writer so great that she did not need to over-orchestration on this cd. I thought her songs came across so much better with just her voice and an acoustic guitar. Plus most of the songs aren't even hers! If you loved songs like The Circle Game, California, and the old Both Sides Now, this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Buy This CD!","review":"This is no fluke, Joni has been working her way to this CD for a long time, she was SO READY to put this body of work together! Her Voice has matured and taken on new levels of depth, tone , emotion. I just saw her LIVE at the Chronicle Pavillion in Concord, Ca...second concert of her new tour, she had many of us in tears and we are talking JOYFUL tears here too. The bluesy, smokey jazz stylings will move you mightily. Joni can't lose with this one, I think a Grammy is long over due ..this one might take the cake..buy it..you'll see/ hear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERPIECE","review":"A lifetime of heart, and soul, and wisdom, and love, and cigarettes has recast Joni Mitchell's voice dramatically. The simple contrast between the young voice you remember and the one you hear here--especially on \\"Both Sides Now\\"-- is incredibly moving. These are blues arias, set to sublime arrangements played by full orchestra, and they go straight to the heart. This album is Art--and a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layered performance","review":"The first reaction I had to this CD was what that the orchestration was good but detracted from Joni's voice, then I realized it complimented Joni voice, and now I realize it adds a vital element to this album. The presentation of these classics must really be listened to over and over to discover the true versatility of the words and music. Whether listening to them while pre-occupied with something else or just closing your eyes and feeling the music these songs are really effective. The magic of the album is that these are extraordinary songs that have penetrated are souls from the voices of Ella, Frank, Dinah, and Billie yet they were sung as if they were written by Joni. These songs are so different from Joni that they really ARE Joni. A surprise that is so moving and delightful that I get excited that everytime I listen to it I will discover something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a dissapointment","review":"I am a big fan of Joni Mitchell. I loved the opportunity on this CD to hear how her voice has matured over the years. But, the musical accompanyment on every song is so bad that I cannot listen anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why is it that all aging folkies and rockers seem to think an album of 'standards' is some kind of right of passage - a requirement of sorts before they pack it in. Rod Stewart, Willie Nelson, Joni Mitchell et al et al. Enough, kids, stick to what you do best, at least when efforts like this is the best you can do. I'm a Mitchell fan, but this one is bad news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I thought by obeying the old adage of judging a Joni Mitchell CD by the cover,I'd be pleasantly surprised and inspired as I always have been by her work. It's quite a pity though, that her work after the 80's departed from the rich organic yet ingeniously simple form that put her on top.Even more of a shame about this collection,is how her own songs take an irreparable beating with breathtakingly lethargic syncopation in 'a case of you' and struggling throaty groans in 'both sides now'.This CD is nothing more than the dissapointing epitome of an airy, overpowering and quite frankly, immensely boring, milksop of a once great artist's flirt with an incompatible genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing to see Joni has come to this.","review":"This cd should have never been made. It's truly depressing to see such a creative icon from the past age so ungracefully, at least artistically. It sounds as if her performance was painful in the making as it is equally painful to listen to. The songs are forced, too slow and overly dramatic. It's as if she tried too hard to make another Blue. It simply does not work. Joni, have you not found happiness after all these years. Perk up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be worse","review":"This thing is bad. Very strange, half-hearted, vocals that wander around melodies without really singing them. I don't know whether Joni Mitchell can't carry a tune, or can't be bothered. Take a good look at that cover; it's an appropriate image for what's inside. If you like music that is bored, cynical, world weary, washed out, and used up, this CD is for you. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"I'm a big fan of Joni Mitchell,so I bought this DVD as soon as it was released.My biggest disapointment was that there is no video,just a still picture of one of her paintings with the music playing behind this still picture.You can save alot of money by just buying the audio cd,not the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go away","review":"I know all you folk fans thing that this woman is a legend, but certainly, what are you thinking?

I could drink a taste of this and I would still be on my feet! I have grown older with you darlin', your voice has grown into that fine vintage sound, and you have found your daughter, as I have found my daughters.You were always there for me, and I never knew why I felt so strongly about the lyrics that sustained me. I am so happy for your triumph, and this cd is a triumph for you! It is lush and marvelous, and your voice is so compelling. Be well, do more: we are listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joni Mitchell, time only makes her voice more beautiful","review":"This is a remarkable album. Mitchell's rich voice has never been more inflective or reflective. I immediately thought of Billie Holiday when I heard \\"The Thrill of You\\", and realized Joni had gone a step or two better than Billie. The last song, her inimitable \\"Both Sides Now\\", provides a husky vocal maturity that reinvents the song. An excellent choice for any old or new Joni Mitchell fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous gem","review":"I am not a fan of big band, pop jazz etc - but I am a big Joni fan - through the years - starting with Song to a Seagull. The first time I listened to this I was a little put off - see above - not a big fan of this genre. I played it a few more times to give it a chance..... and now I rate it five stars. This is a great listen. Her mature voice is so wonderful. So lush so beautiful. Give this one a chance to grow on you. Simply gorgeous, I'm sure I'll be listening to this one for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!","review":"Joni Mitchell comes to us as a \\"package\\" on her CDs - an inseparable entity that is singer/composer/lyricist/instrumentalist. The beauty of this album is that it shows us the \\"singer\\" part of that equation in isolation. The lush and exquisite orchestrations by Vince Mendozza combined with Joni's peerless voice create a stunning work. So many others have tried to do an album of standards in an orchestral setting, and have failed to carry it off. Joni has shown how it should be done. Interestingly, her 2 originals are, for me, the highlights of the CD. One final note: I had to take exception to a comment in an above review by Ward Lamb. He states that Joni is \\"an archetypal American in the Edward Hopper tradition\\". Surely Mr. Lamb must be aware that Joni is not American at all. She is Canadian, through and through. In fact, she's Canada's greatest treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live first, then judge it...","review":"I have to admit to approaching listening to a remake of \\"Both Sides Now\\" with a snort and an eye roll. The odious Baby Boomers still looking to recover past glories, I assumed. But I spent last night crying over my keyboard as I played the tune over and over again. Being \\"of an age\\" that remembers Joni Mitchell as was, I can only say that she's been \\"there,\\" done lots of music and life, and this CD shows it. She's become an alto sax with a story to tell of a life apparently richly lived and certainly deeply felt. And if that means anything to you, you will find this CD a pretty moving experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a few more listens ....","review":"At first, Carly Simon's (sorry!) Film Noir comes to mind; next, if you're really listening, you can hear hints of Billy Holiday, in the turn of a note .... Hard to believe it's Joni Mitchell. I keep buying her recordings and listening for some hints of her glory days, more melody, more singing. She seemed to be getting closer with Taming the Tiger, but there's still too much muttering and side-show spiel in her own songs. I've listened to Both Sides Now about three times (I only bought it today), but I'll have to spin it about 20 or thirty times before I have a handle on it. Nice that CDs don't wear out, otherwise all the pits would be melted off of Hejira ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Montovani on Acid","review":"This is really pretty horrible stuff. Joni tries to tackle some old standards and fails miserably. The backing is mostly overblown string arrangments that are brooding, pretentious and cloying. I don't know who would be interested in this recording. If you are a Joni fan, buy one of her old records. If you like old standards, buy the originals or albums of covers by stylists like LInda Ronstadt. More depressing than introspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment deluxe","review":"I adore this inimitable woman. And what a thrill to hear she'd (also) done a compilation of jazz classics. But what happened with the recording levels? One has to strain to listen to Joni above the crashing orchestra. I'm almost sorry I bought this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT A REAL FAN","review":"WELL NOT KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT LET ME TELL YOU.. THIS CD IS GREAT GREAT GREAT HAVE LISTENED TO IT 5 TIMES IN A ROW NOW AND NOT EVEN TIRED OF IT.

There is certainly nothing wrong with her voice. Unfortunately, the overblown orchestrations do nothing but get in the way of an otherwise darn fine collection of songs. If you recognize some of the classics on this CD as some of your all time favourites, you can find far superior renditions from any number of artists. Just a couple of more recent examples are Etta James version of 'You've Changed' and Johnny Adams'; 'Don't Go To Strangers'. Charging herself with the insurmaountable task of creating new 'standards', for songs that have already become standards by some pretty respected names in the music world (Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holliday . . .), one can only ask, why. I must conclude that this is one CD that Joni wanted to do for herself - if others enjoy it, that's fine. I'll pass. Nice cover art though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What a disappointment! I'm a long time fan of Joni's and this is probably her worst release, ever. Can I trade this CD with someone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble Sleeping?","review":"This is the album for you if you're an insomniac.

Fun to think about"},{"rating":"2","title":"When the great return to the simple, it is not in order to be simple","review":"Wow, on this album it is clear that Joni Mitchell has proven to herself that she has the right to go back to songs that are jazz standards. She has the right because she has worked at listening to music, at singing it, and at writing it for so long that she hears standards differently. This album is in fact an attempt, a very successful one, at setting these songs free again. I for one am immensely grateful that I get to hear things I have not heard before in these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both Sides Now","review":"Joni Mitchell is one of my favorites.

If you've never heard of this guy, I suggest you try \\"Affentheater\\" or \\"Radio Maria\\" first (both went to #1 in Germany).

However, some caveats. First, it is pretty noisy, not \\"I can't hear myself think\\" kind of noisy, but if it sits next to someone all day and gets heavily used, they will find it annoying. Second, our printers power supply shut down a week ago (about 4-5 weeks after we purchased it) and we are hoping to see a technician with a replacement part today. So we have been without the use of this printer for a week. Luckily we had a couple little inkjets scattered throughout the office that allowed us to get by.Finally, be careful when you order, because this item did not include the 250 sheet paper tray. I caught this just as I was about to order and added the paper tray for another $100 or so.

It might work okay in a small office with peer-to-peer networking, but in our corporate branch office it does not work well. I'm about ready to buy my own scanner out-of-pocket so I won't have to waste my time on this machine.It is noisy. The color and black cartridges are installed in a carousel. When you print a document with color, the carousel rotates for each cartridges, making a clunking noise. I'm glad it's down the hall a bit.

God Bless the Corps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't pigeonhole this as \\"military history\\"","review":"It would be a shame to classify this book as \\"military history,\\" since the term is bound to turn away some readers. Certainly this narrative of the lives of some members of the West Point class of 1966 follows them into combat, and Atkinson is a masterful writer in this genre. However, what is most interesting about this book is the way it describes the intersection---one might even say collision--of the values and education imparted by West Point with the rapidly changing culture of the sixties and seventies. In addition, Atkinson's examination of the lingering deleterious effects on the Army of an unpopular and unsuccessful war is enough to make one wonder what the consequences of the current unpopular war will be. This book, which often reads like a novel, ought to be in the hands of students, most of whom have little connection to the war in Iraq and little understanding of military life, unlike their sixties counterparts, who at least faced the draft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for military history buffs","review":"As usual Rick Atkinsons' writing was complete, insightful and poinient. He brought out the questions and problem of an entire generation of soldiers.

Additionally I spent one summer training the yearlings at West Point in hand to hand combat and patrolling. My life crossed and intermingled with the class of '66 throughout my four years of service.

As an ordinary drafted vet, myself, I was left back then with the impression that most West Point officers who came through during Vietnam never seriously thought they would ever get caught in a real war when they went after getting that free education at West Point. Maybe that is why this book tends to be very negative and discouraging. It is discouraging enough to tend to make you feel sorry for the people in the book. It is so negative and discouraging that, if I work for the admissions dept at West Point, no way do I encourage applicants to read this book ----- in fact, just the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter and Gloomy","review":"This book is a bitter and gloomy snapshot in time that unfairly presents West Point through the prism of the Vietnam War era. The Oct 26, 2003 review \\"A Reviewer From That Era\\", and the June 6, 2003 review \\"From an Ordinary Vet\\" are both right on the mark. This book ends up being quite off the mark. I don't wish to take anything away from Rick Atkinson who is a wonderful writer. But, judging officers, the military, and West Point by this book, and using this as a book to decide whether you are interested in attending West Point, is misleading and an unwise choice. If I were in Admissions at West Point, I certainly would not recommend this book. If I were teaching a course that is narrow in scope on the history of the Vietnam Era ... perhaps. It's way past time to put Vietnam aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Gray Line","review":"The book arrived very shortly after I ordered it.

But, to me, after all the great marketing hype and superlatives that drew me in, this book was boring. I give it a star for good writing and editing, but, those don't make a book interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a young man, one of the most influential books I've read.","review":"As a Senior in high school, cautiously examining what I wanted to do with my life, the content in \\"The Long Gray Line\\" was a primary factor that influenced my decision to accept an appointment to West Point and serve my country. The story of the noble, real life soldiers is inspiring and reveals the true character and resilience of people who were in some of the toughest situations that my parents' generation faced. I gained an understanding of the social pressures faced by that generation, especially the soldier who also faced social pressures from the American military world of ideals. It is a must read book for any young man or woman who shows a concern for our country or military."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best book I have ever read","review":"This is one excellent book. It is a must read for people who have been in the military and for that fact, anyone and everyone. This book starts with the Class of 1966 as the enter Westpoint. They start out as freshmen (I believe the term was plebes), the book takes the readers through the trials and tribulations of each of the main characters as they endure that first year. As the book progresses on you get to know each of the main characters as they experience school, romance, hard times, easy times, sad times and happy times. The book continues as they graduate from school and enter Vietnam. You experience the horror of war and the bond the forms with soldiers in combat. After Vietnam the reader will continue to follow the characters as they experience life after Vietnam. I was acutally hoping the book would not end. Being in the military I can relate to much of what the book was about. I highly suggest the book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The power of Flamenco","review":"Mr. Jacome's CD Motivacion is absolutely one of the most beautiful flamemco CDs in my collection!

It's really great. HOWEVER, the only problem is the support on the machine. I needed to get a new top for it because I dropped it and it cracked.

So although the product is excellent, I've never experienced worse customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged and Damaging","review":"I am now shopping for a unit to replace this one, which I have had less than a year. First time I used it, it damaged my countertops. One of the screws embedded in the plastic feed made contact with the countertop and made several scratches in my countertop (less than 2 years old). After that I had to set it on a towel to use it. More recently the plastic top broke. (It had been a super tight fit, and often hard to get on.) Considering I don't like it much anyway, and because I understand customer service is lacking, I thought I'd just replace it. My el-cheapo Black and Decker (under $20) lasted longer than this one.Still, it chopped OK, and handled liquids well, which I guess not all of them do. I did like the collection of blades, but, like others, could not get them to fit in the holder.

Please be advised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping very slow","review":"Was not happy at all with service. Ordered it from europro direct. They claimed it was shipped on Dec 11, 2003 after 3 weeks stated that I did not have it yet. They charge 16 dollars to sned a package from california to kentucky and send it the cheapest possible was for about half of what the actual shipping charges are. UPS is less than what we pay for shipping and the track it and get it across the country in 7 days. Hope if i finally receive it it works better than their customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid Broken - Can't Find Replacement","review":"The thing works great except for the lid broke and I need a new one. The little plastic piece that holds the prong from the blades fell out. It was cheaply made.I'm going to call the customer service number (800)798-7398 tomorrow and see if they will sell me a new one. I haven't used it that many time and washed it by hand so I don't know why it broke.If they send me a new one I'll update this review and post the number.

I would also like to mention that I offered to send the broken bowl back so they could see the crack, but was told no. That was in October and I still have not received the replacement.

The second season was just as good and even better than the first! I can't wait to get the next season on dvd. I am so addicted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than season 1","review":"Season two of Bones allows us to delve further into that unlikely attraction between \\"cocky\\" FBI Agent Booth and his tough-as-nails partner Dr. Brennan, which was only hinted at in the first season. We also get a glimpse into the past when the finale introduces us to Brennan's father, who may not be who he seems... Emily Deschanel is phenomenal as the socially-challenged (and often hilarious) Dr. Brennan, and she and David Boreanaz have amazing chemistry. It's wonderful to see their relationship unfold little by little, with each case they tackle. Can't wait for next season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as always","review":"\\"Bones\\" never disappoints. Another great season filled with great story lines, laugh-out-loud humor, and tears. Brennan and Booth are great opposite each other. This is one of the best 'buddy' shows of all time. If you're not watching \\"Bones,\\" you don't know what you're missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show!","review":"We stumbled on to Bones years after it started, but we love it. We are enjoying catching up on the years we missed by getting them from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some changes for the better this time","review":"This show got even better in its second season, with the arrival of the tough new Cam as the boss of the squints, the wonderful Stephen Fry appearing as Booth's psychiatrist, Angela and Hodgins falling in love, and wonderboy Zach being promoted and getting a new haircut in the process. The characters and the show are really coming into their own now. I look forward to season 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good second season","review":"I really like this season. Although I deeply miss the character of Dr. Goodman (and can't understand why he's not re-appearing), the character of Dr. Savoyen brings another dynamic into to team.

Other than that, a fine transaction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, lots of fun","review":"I hadn't watched Bones until I picked up the first season on DVD when I was looking for something different to watch. Now it's one of my favorite shows--much more fun than CSI, a little gross at times, but over all one of the best shows on the tube right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones Season 2","review":"After watching and really enjoying season One of Bones I couldn't wait for this one. In fact I even ordered the DVD well in advance. Dr. Temperence and Booth are wonderful, the Jeffersonian Institute has a new Boss who's really gets her hands dirty unlike the previous one who was mainly an administrator. The plots in each episode are wonderful with unexpected twists and sometimes shocking. If you liked Season 1 then you will love season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones season 2 better than the first!","review":"Absolutely wonderful!! LOVE Bones. . . season 2 is better than season 1!! Amazon had fast shipping and when there was an issue, they took care of it immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones is a classic","review":"I tried the book series but couldn't get into it-both before the tv Bones began and after watching it-they are so different.

Watch the show on FOX and get hooked as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"We quit watching half way through the boxed set due to boredom, irritatingly inconsistent story lines, lame character interactions, and never-ending rabbits pulled out of hats. Big, big disappointment after the good potential of season 1. The only high point, and it was a very high point, was the terrific Stephen Frye as Booth's FBI psychiatrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"well.....","review":"Emily Deschanel is good to look at. That's about the only possitive thing I can say about this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complete season","review":"While I enjoy the show, it is not a complete season as it states on the cover. It only has 21 of the 22 episodes. While I understand why the episode was not shown on network TV, there was no reason what so ever to leave it out of a \\"complete\\" set. I have no doubt that Fox will some day release a new \\"complete\\" set with all 22 episodes simply to make more money. For now, I feel like Fox has ripped me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Business","review":"I ordered this item around the 1st of November and the money was taken out of my checking account. I have been waiting and waiting for it to arrive. On December 8th I got a notification from Amazon that they were crediting my account and this item was not coming. No explanation on why this seller held on to my money since the first of November or why this item was suddenly not coming.

I ended up watching the whole thing over one weekend! It's the perfect installment for any fan of Bones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones-Season 2","review":"So we finally made it to season 2 after all the slow episodes of character development, we finally get the reward of really fascinating episodes. Other than the episodes getting better the only thing to really mention is that in this season each DVD is only one sided unlike the season one that I bought...which by the way I like it better as only one sided. I don't know why, maybe it is because they put the nice pictures on the front of each DVD. Either way Bones is a great show, and I recommend this set, it comes in one box, that has an open edge, but there is one DVD case for every 2 DVDs. Hope everyone enjoys their set as much as I do mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great forensic mysteries lightened by humour","review":"Bones mixes great forensic mysteries with humour which sets it apart from many of the detective shows currently on. Bones and Booth's chemistry is great and Emily Deschanel plays Bones' somewhat skewed personality well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review of Bones Series 2","review":"Good entertainment and one that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in forensic and crime seen investigations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Bones is one of the most clever shows on tv today. The scripts are witty and smart. There is no dumming down to the audience. The science is spot on and it holds your attention. The relationship between the characters is realistic and you like them all. The show is clever and can be quite macab at times. Utterly delicious. Maybe not for the squeemish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bones Season two","review":"Good series, I have not yet gotten to watching season two, but season one is a lot of fun. If you are a David Boreanz fan, you will like this series. I like it almost as much as the Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer series."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bones Season 2\\" better than ever!","review":"I loved this season of Bones even more than season one, as more of the cast are developing to fuller characters, with new subplots to keep things tied together, and more really cool forensics.Dr Brennan (Emily Deschanel) continues to struggle with her desire to feel normal emotional connection, while her intellect keeps her from exactly getting there, and while the chemical tension with her partner simmers under the surface. Thrown into the mix are new moral dilemmas due to her developing knowledge of her birth family, and shades of gray start to infiltrate her world of black and white. Can one be a moral (justified) killer? Etc. Forgiveness and love are examined in rather unique waysBones is very good TV, that I can enjoy with both my wife and my teens.So if you have already watched season one, get season two (but really, watch one first for the character development that is quite good) and have a marathon fun weekend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun show!","review":"Bones is a great TV show. Not like about 90% of the Trash on TV.. It is fun to watch, and keeps you going.. If you want a good TV show. THis is one to get!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT show!","review":"I've never really been a fan of those CSI- type shows because it never felt like it had enough of a personality. Those kinds of shows always made me feel kinda clueless about what they were talking about because everything sounded so technical. But this show is very different!! The characters do describe everything with the technical verbiage, but because of the character (Booth) played by David Boreanaz, everything is explained in layman's terms as well. Also, this show is very funny...not to mention filled with the sexual tension that keeps you coming back for more to see if Booth and Bones will ever get together.I HIGHLY recommend this show to anyone! You don't even really have to watch it from the beginning. Every episode can stand for itself and keep anyone entertained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy","review":"One of the DVD discs didn't play at all. Otherwise it was very good.

Naturally I was curious (but skeptical) to try chaser. I am happy to report that it works quite well for me. The difference is quite noticeable and I am headache free the next morning (this is after 3 times using it). I recommend it. The major drawback for me is the the pills are reasonably large and I have a hard time swallowing them. However, I have found that chewing them is tolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt liek it, try Beer neutralizer or xxx3 instead","review":"I tried chaser 3 times (just to make sure it wasnt my fault or an error) and it didnt work any of the three times. I decided to try 2 other products that I got samples of at a local bar, one was called xxx3 and the other was called Beer Neutralizer. They both worked, but I liked the beer neutralizer better becuase it prevented the hangover and it also has a carb blocker in it so I can drink regular beer instead of lite beers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great compilation of one of jazz's finest","review":"A UK compilation of some of Julie's finest material, \\"The Liberty Years\\" works as either an introduction to Ms. London or a lucky find to veteran fans, as a good share of the songs are from the out-of-print \\"Whatever Julie Wants.\\" Of course her chestnut \\"Cry Me a River\\" is included, as is \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy,\\" another song closely associated with Julie. Other rarely-heard Julie gems include a delightful \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,\\" the moody, wistful ballad \\"How Did He Look,\\" and a gorgeous reading of the classic \\"The End of a Love Affair.\\" This compilation also serves up two Bossa Nova treaures in \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" and the Antonio Carlos Jobim classic, \\"Desafinado.\\" So whether you're looking to discover a new favorite jazz singer or looking to expand your Julie London collection, \\"The Liberty Years\\" is a worthwhile, highly enjoyable purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft and Pretty Pink","review":"Rather Teddy bear like but cute and soft.

Most students have never even heard of the Dust Bowl and are pretty shocked and awed by this, especially the scenes about killing the jack rabbits and \\"Black Sunday\\".

I've read a lot of true crime books, but this one topped them all. He was very cold when it came to killing, which he did much of, but he also had limits as to who he would do. The book had me reading up into the night. Very good choice for those who like true crime reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Good book with a lot of interesting perspectives inadvertantly put in place to carry you along this animals journey of murder, betrayal, and misfortune. Whether or not everything the Iceman disclosed to the writer was actually true or not he undoubtedly murdered 5 people which has been proven, enough to make him an animal amongst sheeple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confessions of a Pathological Liar...","review":"Might be a more appropriate title. None of the claims are remotely credible. Were to believe his claims, Kuklinski is apparently responsible for thousands of murders. Also, the author has no idea how to put together a book and the redundancy is simply astounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer","review":"It shows the ultimate results of what happens when a child is continually, viciously beaten and berated by his father at the same time watching his mother and siblings beaten to the point of killing his brother. He gets no relief, even when he's away from home having to face a daily beating by other kids in the neighborhood. Is it any wonder that he spends the rest of his life finding different ways to torture and kill people. This book is not for the faint of heart or those having trouble sleeping for it will give you nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becomes increasingly less believable as you read it","review":"This book is a little schizophrenic as it can't decide if it wants to portray richard as a horrible monster or as a dexter-esque bad guy killing other bad guys. some parts of it seem pretty credible but some parts are completely implausible. not a bad read if you're stuck on an airplane or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little Credibility","review":"I bought \\"The Ice Man\\" because I had viewed the HBO documentary, which was truly chilling. I read this book once and gave it away. According to Richard Kuklinski, hardly a major killing took place in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s without his involvement. Among his incredible assertions are that he participated in the murders of Carmine Galante, Paul Castellano, and even Jimmy Hoffa. Had he been somewhat older, it wouldn't have surprised me had he stated that it was he, and not John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated President Lincoln. Since it's been some time since I've read this tome, my recollection of many of his allegations are somewhat hazy, but I do remember questioning many of them. Philip Carlo's writing is flawless and gripping, and although there's no doubt in my mind that Kuklinski was a \\"stone-cold killer,\\" his credibility, in my opinion, is somewhat debatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, Disappointing writing","review":"Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer is an interesting story. Here is a man with almost zero sense of right and wrong. Or, at least, a very skewed sense. The story really brings you in on how such a killer is created. The author, however, seems to be fascinated with Kuklinski physical features. His height and cheekbones are mentioned constantly throughout the book. Also, seemingly to accentuate a dramatic passage, the author uses sentences that are 4-5 words that go on for pages and pages. If you like true crime, you'll like this book. Just don't expect much in the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"This book is so badly written I couldn't even finish reading it! It is about 10x longer than it actually has to be.

If you want to know what goes on in the mind of a cold-blooded killer, this is the book. Starting with his childhood and ending with his death in prison, the author documents the murders Richard committed.He learned at an early age that if you kill it, the problem goes away. He practiced that truth throughout his entire life. Surprising was the fact that even he was troubled by how committing these grizzly murders didn't seem to bother him.One of the most interesting parts of the book is when he describes a hit in Detroit and how they disposed of the body. It was the contract hit on Jimmy Hoffa."},{"rating":"2","title":"mafiaman","review":"This is an excellent book, not one for the fainthearted or squeamish. It is the story of a man who is believed to have carried out more than 200 murders, many of them paid executions on behalf off the Mafia; others innocent bystanders killed on a whim.

Think about it logically. The victim would have thrashed and rolled and at the very LEAST would have moved out of the camera's view, and would probably also have knocked over the camera and lights.The subject is a liar, the author has zero credibility and the book isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BS Meter on High","review":"An entertaining if poorly written book. There are plenty of reviews explaining how there's no way this guy could have murdered half the people he claimed and I agree with them. Show us the cave with the rats.

There's also plenty of repetition. This could have been 20% shorter with ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars Plus!!!","review":"The Author of this book Phil Carlo is awesome. The mere fact that he was able to stomach spending over 240 hours with this unbelievably volatile killing machine is what is utterly amazing to me. Furthermore, his ability to relay the events he was told of is also a very impressive. I am sure this was not an easy feat for any person to put into words. Reading this book was like seeing a box of kittens on fire. You are peering through the split in your fingers, while covering your face, because it is so horrific, yet you feel compelled to look. That is how it felt to keep reading. (get a hold of yourself, its just an analogy). Read This!! You will never get a chance to be this close to the mind of a serial killer/mass murderer again.(unless you are one yourself, in which case dont read this, you might get some new ideas). Overall a great book. I think this is the best book Phil Carlo has written. That said, his other books were great too. Get them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer","review":"This book traces the life of a psychopath killer from childhood to death. It gives you an inside look into the probable causes of a psychopath beginning with childhood, but progresses beyond just killing. Richard Kuklinsky was the Dean of psychos who made killing a profitable business by hiring out to all of the Mafia families. Yet, he expresses compassion towards his family at times and would never kill a female or child.His study of death and experiments with killing will keep you on the edge.

In the book, Ice Man, you get a look at what made this icey, cold professional, number one and why so many people feared him. The book goes way beyond all the same old info that has been previously written on Mr. Kuklinski's exploits with the mob and of course the famous killer spray that he used. I couldn't put this book down, it was that good! But, I would have liked to have read what life was like for him in prison? Did anyone have to be dealt with his special talents? All in all, the book is worth every penny and you won't read the same old story of fancy gangsters and fast cars. Ice Man gives you guns, knives, rats, bats, bullets, and bombs! This book is definitely a book that one must own, and place in your personal library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, lies, lies...","review":"Kuklinski's wild fabrications about all the men he murdered have already been debunked by other reviewers and at various sites on the web. The man was, clearly, a pathological liar. Even so, his lunatic ravings could have been a good read if Philip Carlo were a better writer. The book is repetitious and amateurishly written. The creepiest thing about it is Carlo's infatuation with Kuklinski. His fawning over the killer's height, strength, cat-like grace, and high cheekbones made me want to hurl.Pass this one up. There are many better true crime books available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner and unbelievable scary report","review":"It is almost impossible to believe that there was ever such a person who really lived and performed all these evil deeds.

Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ice Man.","review":"Tremendous, tremendous read. Mr. Carlo is brilliant in defining who Richard Kuklinski was. He was both the most ruthless killer in modern times as well as a devoted family man with a heart of gold.Throughout this book, you neither have disdain nor admiration for Mr. Kuklinski. Instead, Mr. Carlo brings out what Richard Kuklinski actually was. A sadistic psychopath who was a genius at killing.After reading this gripping book, you will feel a chill in your bones upon the graphic detail on which how Richard Kuklinski murdered his \\"marks\\" will precision.Again, Mr Carlo does not emulate Mr. Kuklinski nor condone any of his actions.

The Ice Man did not dissapoint me and held my attention to the last page. I was able to understand why Richard Kuklinski became The Ice Man, he had a disturbing childhood which led him to murder. I was shocked by the murders that he committed and how Richard grew into a callous murderer, The Ice Man is a well deserved name for Richard. This book will not dissapoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Poop","review":"Shame on you,Phillip,for writing that Kuklinski had anything to do with Hoffas;Galantes;or Castellanos murders.Kuklinski may have said he participated in these hits;but you of all people should have known that this was B.S.These ridiculous claims made a lie of your whole book.After reading these claims,who knows what is fact or fiction.Too bad;it could have been a really interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst writing I've encountered in quite some time","review":"I won't even begin with the unreliability of what's presented here as fact, simply because it came from the killer's mouth, or the lack of evidence, or the absurd violin story of the killer's childhood, and how nothing was really actually his fault.I can't believe so many reviewers are saying this is \\"excellent writing\\", even those who fault the book for other reasons. Is this the first book you guys have read or something?The writing - dear God, the writing in this book. It is absolutely, utterly atrocious. The author goes way, WAY overboard with similies, every thing is cliche, and yes, fine, the guy has some knockout 'high nordic cheekbones.'

He's keen to establish his cred - he played in Southern boogie bands as a teenager, including a ZZ Top tribute outfit called Tres Hombres - and his album Private Radio (Lost Highway) certainly sounds good. That's due to producer Marty Stuart and the band of brothers he's hired (including keyboardist Barry Beckett). The great title fits the concept - his personal musical journey - but that's the problem. His songs are Southern gothic cliches, and as a singer he's a ham. He's trying so hard to be a tough, but twisted hombre. In \`Forever' a trucker calls his gal to declare his commitment - while wearing her pink panties. And his ode \`Angelina' should have stayed behind closed doors: \\"They said we'd never make it / Two crazy panthers on the prowl / They said we would only fake it for a while / But we just looked at them and growled.\\" To be quickly filed beside William Shatner's album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"I was really looking forward to this CD. I was so disappointed, that after two plays, it's been sitting in my CD wallet. There are a few good, faster tracks on the CD. Otherwise, I would have rated this a one. Billy Bob's trying way too hard to sound dark and brooding on the slow tracks, and it just doesn't work for him. I was literally rolling my eyes listening to track 1. Maybe he's been in Hollywood too long?

All of my friends whom I've roped into listening to this cd have come away surprised. Opinions differ regarding BBT's vocal ability (I think his voice is awesome), but everyone really liked the songs. Private Radio, the title cut, is my favorite. It reminds me of poetry you'd hear at a coffee house, wearing black-out wayfarers & a beret. All of the songs that he and either Marty Stewart or Dwight Yoakam, et al wrote are thought-provoking and wonderful. His spoken word short story is creepy and moody - I love it!This album is assuredly not your same old 'three chords & the truth' kind of country, but it is nevertheless a must-have for anybody who loves great, off the beaten track kind of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Roadkill of an Album","review":"The most overrated actor of his generation branches out to the music world with this, his debut album. You have been forewarned.Despite its utter incompetence, this album is strangely entertaining in a rubbernecking kind of way -- one is appalled, yet at the same time you can't take your ears away out of the total disbelief that BBT was ever allowed into a studio, much less that there was a record label that was actually willing enough to give it a release.

It is hard to doubt Thornton's sincerity, however the lyrics here are often very poor. These musicians and record folks should be ashamed of themselves when there are talented musicians out there who can write from the heart AND do so with a sense of mystery and inspiration.

The novel was more about the issues of the mother and less about establishing and maintaining a relationship with a daughter that she had not seen in 17 years. It was somewhat impractible to believe that this mother would give up the child she had raised for 8 months without a fight. Second, it was curious that it would take her 17 years to track her down. I did not find that the story maintained a consistent stream of conciousness and the author appeared to jump from one scene to another without intergrating the various themes. I failed to see the significance of some characters, such as Justin and the re-emergence of Jewel. I also found the novel to be incredibly stereotypical of blacks, whites, Jews, southerners etc. The stereotypes were perhaps the biggest disappointment. I would not purchase this book in hardcover. Wait for it in paperback or better yet, get in from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover tells all","review":"Whites are so naive about black culture.

HALF A HEART also deals with issues of the binds of blood and genealogy, but it is so frustrating in its obviousness and its bleak view of the perceptions of contemporary society on race (from policemen to wealthy Texans to its central character, a young black girl) that the novel is almost unreadable. Brown just doesn't tackle issues of race, economics, religion or education with any sort of poise. Her characters develop into horrific cliches, even as the novel, in its portrayal of a southern Jewish woman who had to abandon her black baby, at least on the surface, seems to transcend such banality. A long awaited novel that is a complete and utter disappointment. I concur with a previous reviewer who suggests Sue Miller's WHILE I WAS GONE instead, a novel that has its own problems (plot being one of them), but has an emotional weight that bears at least an ounce of truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"topical, yes, groundbreaking, no","review":"I didn't really understand why this white lady would abandon her child in the first place -- and for that matter, why the mixed-race Ronee, who had been raised in a black community, would be all that interested in white boys.

Some of Brown's earlier books were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"Ms. Brown is a more-than-competent writer and the premise of this novel is intriguing, but it disappoints on nearly every level; the storyline is tedious and the characters self-absorbed, annoying, and ultimately predictable. Most unforgivably, nearly every character or situation in the book disintegrates into stereotype. By the time I reached the chapter dealing with Ronnee's false arrest and incarceration, the circumstances felt so contrived I lost every bit of sympathy or interest.

It is definitely minimal - but not minimalism. It is sparse music. There are silent spaces, interrupted by flurries of almost random-sounding notes - like a still pond with occasional ripples. There's a Japanese quality in his approach to music, but it doesn't really sound Japanese. It's atonal music, I guess, but never harsh or ugly. It's actually surprisingly ear pleasing. You can put this on while cooking dinner and it won't drive you nuts. If you are not a huge fan of modern music, but listen to Phillip Glass now and then, here is a completely different style of modern music that I think you will enjoy. - Milo Ippolito"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but needs better marketing in the States","review":"Why don't more people in the States appreciate Neneh Cherry?

Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Book Cover","review":"Though you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, I purchased this book because I loved the title and the cover.The story was a long, sweet, and slooow romantic tale of Maya and Mykal. Before the love is unveiled, the deep pain and its scars must be revealed so that healing may begin. Perhaps there is no easy way to tell such a poignant story, so the author takes readers through an emotionally draining tale of soul searchers, soul robbers, and soul mates. The story is very important because there are women who need spiritual and emotional healing, but I was not touched by the way it was told. Finally, love prevails and finds its way into the hearts of two loving couples who have longed for true love but were too afraid to reach out and grasp it.I pray for supernatural healing for women who bear the emotional and physical wounds that Maya carried. In Jesus' Name. Amen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music!","review":"This is a great, and long overdue, effort from Todd Sharp. Todd has been the guitar behind many great moments in Rock 'n' Roll, including stints with Hall and Oates, and Rod Stewart. This CD shows off both Todd's songwriting ability as well as his great chops on guitar. The title track is a truly great song with a wonderful jam thrown in at the end that makes you wish AOR radio still existed so it would get some air play. The opener, 'I Believe in You' is another, yet different, example of Todd's talents as songwriter and performer. Todd is backed on this CD by Delbert McClinton's touring band, and they really cook on every tune (Todd is Delbert's guitar player, too). There are other great tunes on this CD that you just have to hear, but space here is limited. So... if you want to listen to something done from the heart, with great musicianship, get this CD!

This is disingenous at best, and intellectually dishonest at worst.If the author wants people to pay him so he can advertise for Mormonism, while he's allegedly presenting a reasoned and researched view on early Church development, say so up front.A peek into the Index will reveal about a dozen references to Mormonism, a few for Judaism, even fewer for Islam, and ZERO for Protestant or Catholic traditions.A quick googling of the author showed he's presented as a Mormon cult \\"apologist\\" and professional expert witness in courts cases.

Because of its scholarly basis, there are times it's tougher going than my normal bedside reading, but I would highly recommend it to any thinking Christian. In particular, I would recommend it to anyone who has wondered why some churches appear to grow while others can barely maintain their membership. It appears that human nature and proselytizing haven't changed over the ages. I'm giving a copy to my mainline Protestant pastor and passing my copy around to the friends who've all ready said they want to read it too. But I want it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"gee wiz, Mr. Science","review":"This book contains interesting speculations about the early history of Christianity, but I was put off by its pendantic use of a positivistic brand of sociological theory. Too often, the book uses generalizations from research among Mormons and other modern religious movements to arrive at conclusions about early Christianity, with inadequate regard to the cultural particularities of the ancient world. The author seems to think there are law-like regularities governing the behavior of religious movements that cut across time and cultures; if a proposition holds true in 20th Century America, then it must apply equally well to the societies of the Roman Empire. I find this approach unconvincing, at best. If I were an ancient historian, I'd be offended by the author's insinuation that he is bringing the insights of enlightened social \\"science\\" to a stodgy and unprogressive field of scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I purchased this book because I saw it referenced a handful of times in other books that I really enjoyed. So, I finally purchased the book and began reading it but was very disappointed. Mr. Stark uses \\"sociological analysis\\", which means poor statistics, a confusion between cause and effect that shows is misunderstanding of the issue, and neglects large amounts of Evangelical or Catholic scholarship. This book rings of academic arrogance and is not very useful to understand Christianity nor the rise of it. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Tools for the Historian","review":"I was a bit skeptical at first of Stark's proposed methodology: applying the results of modern sociological research to questions of early Christian History. But he employs this method in a very responsible way, using the sociology to generate an expectation and then checking that against the actual historical evidence to see if it is borne out. The result, I think are some real insights. Stark has done Christians a real service in helping them to understand the historical roots of their faith. It is also, I would submit, immensely practical for modern Christians to reflect on how the early Church thrived and grew in the midst of a pagan culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Piece of Electronics","review":"This electronic calendar did not last more than 8-10 months.

It looked ify, and then my daughter opened it tonight and it looks like it was used. Everytime you pass the game to the next player it sounds like BB's are rattling around in it (VERY annoying). The sound quality is pretty good, and it does require you to do some quick thinking which is good brain exercise. My son beat me at it twice, but I would have liked to have a much better quality product than a 2nd hand game for what I paid--almost $35. I was sold on this game because of the good reviews, but I am being honest here, so if you are considering it, perhaps put the money towards a new Wii game or something of that nature.

If you hang it from a mantle then the stocking holder had better be a strong one. Due to it's weight empty, it would be even heavier once Santa arrived on Christmas Eve.

There isn't one weak story in the bunch. Some of my favorites include Traditional Aryuvedic, Brit novelist Lesley Glaister's Silver Cowboy, and the editor's own Bakewell, Revisited, which made my breath catch in my throat. Szereto is a masterful prose writer in her own right, and her keen editorial eye for quality erotic storytelling is unrivaled by anyone else working in the genre. This is a truly superior anthology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumptuous erotic reading for intelligent minds!","review":"I adored the first Erotic Travel Tales, and I was thrilled when I read this one. Carefully edited by Mitzi Szereto, she assembles a brilliant cast of writers from all walks of literature, for a unique collection of erotic stories. This is not your run of the mill erotica anthology. The stories here transcend mere erotica, and stand on their own to rival the best of any mainstream or literary short story collections, and there are plenty of titillating thrills along the way. I can only hope that she has another volume of travel tales brewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best place for this book is in the trash bin","review":"I have read Joey Hill, Sylvia Day, Jaci Burton and Lacey Alexander books, which I enjoyed. I am hard pressed to find even one story in this collection that was worth my time to read.

I've purchased this item based on the picture and on the comments from the seller and ended up getting another version of this title, the one that has no video track.

It is very easy to setup the dvd on diff. quality modes, so if my vhs was very old and the quality wasn?t that good, then I was able to burn about 6 hours on one dvd with the same quality as the old one...Another plus nobody seems to have mentioned, I can burn directly from my tv! I am going on a long car trip, so I burned for my kids 6 hours of disney channel programming so that they could watch cartoons they hadn?t seen before!Why didn?t I give 5 stars? Well because the only thing missing is a way to create menus, titles, etc. from movies burned without the computer, maybe, if before finalizing I could do something with it in my computer, then I would give it 10 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, but is quirky","review":"It works well in its primary role of making the nightmarish job of transfering VCR to DVD fairly easy.

Then I tried several Sony brand DVD-Rs and they all play on my Sony VAIO notebook.Like other reviewers, I believe there is room for improvement - quality seems much less than original VHS tapes, 2\\" LCD window can use audio accompaniment, and there should be some flexibility allowing users to add title, menu, and 1st frame, as well as a little bit of editing.

It is the story of humble people taken advantage of for sake of profit in the harvesting of bananas for the Dole International Company. The harm that was knowingly done to individuals made sterile from plantation work and the family suffering caused, is very well documented in the film. The sad conclusion of this timely film is that the workers and their families to this day, have not been compensated even though the judgement in the US court was against the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, but it's almost a decade old","review":"Bruni and Burkett have written a thoughtful, probing book about the sexual abuse of children at the hands of clergy.

Diderot, who labeled himself the \\"enemy of God\\", was one of the writers whose works laid the basis for the bloody anti-Church French Revolution, and one wonders what writers like Bruni and Burkett are up to in foisting this unhistorical piece of fictional garbage on an unsuspecting public.The shame is on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for explosion history buffs","review":"This is a fun DVD for history and explosions buffs.

Wells' rough vocals are offset by Guy's smoother delivery, and everything fits beautifully.

It's too bad that Watson did not respond to Nova's request for an interview (as claimed in the piece). Watson's \\"The Structure of DNA\\" was never presented as a history -- it was a personal memoir, filled with impolitic observations that stunned Crick and others involved in the \\"race.\\" In some ways, Watson has done a service to Franklin, portraying her in such an unflattering and ungenerous way that legions have been motivated to provide a corrective view.

Ray Anderson of Chicago plays trombone with a ribald sense of humor, serving up great blasts and bleats along with more carefully-prepared lines of pure melody. Irish guitarist Christy Doran is just as likely to hit the distortion pedal for nasty power chords as he is to gently coax notes from an acoustic guitar.

As an exploration of a young woman's descent (ascent?) into sexual slavery, it is right up there with Pauline Réage's 'Story of O'. It's an equally shocking tale; but Carrie is sassier than O and you'll smile as well as cringe as you share her journey.

So I took it and read it. I have to admit, and as someone involved in the BDSM community as a submissive for over 3 years, it WAS a very good read. I truly did enjoy how the author conveyed the feelings of someone that is being exposed for the first time to BDSM. Like all erotic fiction, it still has its points of being slightly outlandish and other worldly in some of the scenes. It is fantasy after all lol, which is good in a book! It is more realistic than many a erotic BDSM fiction, I will give the author that and for that I do applaud.

Afterwards Carrie is taken to Europe and trained and prepped for the slave auctions, despite the fact that her training has been rather poor thanks to Jonathan being lazy.More or less the same reaction as with Safe Word, but this one is all told by Carrie.

For all of the emotional response that the main character had to all that she was going through, she could have been describing a visit to the post office or DMV. The author never really discussed WHY this woman would willingly allow herself to be enslaved, used, and abused; so it was hard to really care about what was going on.

There is no relationship whatsoever here, no happiness, barely any intercourse, for that matter! I immediately deleted this book from my Kindle after finishing it (which I finished just because I spent money on it and was HOPING for some sort of happiness or pleasure ANYWHERE in the book).

Compared to most, the setting is realistic and believable, the character's relatively well-developed and three-dimensional, the sex and domination accurate and colourfully depicted.

Works great in Lebanese cooking.As a hint to those who want a really thick product without having to strain, add organic powdered milk (not instant)with your starter.

That means it needs to be refrigerated. Too bad for me that the company shipped it from New York to New Mexico on the Friday before a holiday weekend. That means it was unrefrigerated for FOUR DAYS before my postal carrier even put it it my METAL mailbox. In New Mexico. Where it's 96 degrees in the shade. So this product is completely worthless.The funny part was that they included a big sticker on the box that said REFRIGERATED, plus an ice pack that had melted so long ago that it was actually hot. When you're shipping to New Mexico in August, a tiny ice pack isn't going to help.If it's not refrigerator temperature in your mailbox and your postal carrier's truck and your post office and all the way to New York, don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ideal introduction to the patenting process","review":"An impressive and \\"reader friendly\\" compendium of information and instruction Nolo's Patents For Beginners is the ideal introduction to the patenting process for novice inventors and entrepreneurs.

He wrote a number of delightful novels centering around the fox-hunting society in and about Durham, England; this was his last book, published posthumously, and among his best. Facey Romford is a confidence trickster who passes himself off as his wealthy namesake, using the other's stationery to pull off the switch. He becomes Master of the Hounds of the Heavyside Hunt, and from that vantage point we are privy to all kinds of characters and happenings. The novel ends with Facey and his new bride going to Australia, not in disgrace, as was hoped by all who knew him, but where his fortunes only increase and all is well. Surtees's humor is broad and ruthless, and his observations on what makes this society tick are keen and perceptive. The novel presents an entertaining look at the sporting side of Victorian England."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correct title name","review":"The correct title for this CD single is SIX TENDER MOMENTS.See the enlarged amazon image for details..."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad tangled wig","review":"This wig is a one time wear only.

It works, plain and simple. Other reviewers here complain about T-Gel's smell, but I actually prefer it to overly fruity or heavily-perfumed fragrances of other shampoos.I find this product to be particularly useful in the fall and winter months, as that is when it gets really cold outside and my skin dries up. This shampoo, if used as directed, will minimize the appearance of scalp flaking (unless you have a crazy serious skin condition.) But for the average person like me, this stuff works very well, and I don't even need to apply it every single day. I usually alternate between T-Gel and my regular shampoo, which really helps the bottle last a long time. I bought a 16oz bottle close to a year ago, and I've still got ~1/4 of the bottle left."},{"rating":"2","title":"only shampoo I like to use on my oily scalp","review":"if you have oily scalp, this shampoo is perfect (at least until oil builds back up in a few hours)Some people dont like the light scent; I personally like it.It doesnt make your hair feel gunky or creamy like some shampoos (head and shoulders)You can feel and touch your scalp it gets nice and dry after rinsing out.Good value now that costco has discountinued, I approve this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"new scent\\" is very different formula","review":"I've been using TGel shampoo for years, even though my doctor advised me I didn't have to. I like the original formula shampoo, the ingredients were nicely balanced for my hair, and my scalp didn't itch or flake.Now, with this \\"new scent\\" formula, the TGel shampoo is horrible. It makes my hair limp and without body. I can't do anything with it! Usually, my hair reacts that way when hair conditioner has been applied.My conclusion about the \\"new scent\\" is that the new formula has conditioner in it. I can't determine if there is a different scent than the original formula.I wouldn't have rated this any stars at all, but had to rate with at least one.Neutrogena has lost a long-time customer with this \\"new scent\\" product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't wait to get this","review":"I watched and loved the season 2 of Hawaii Five-0. It was great. Season three continues that tradition. The thing that makes this show cool (other than the theme music) is how angry Steve McGarrett gets.

I watch these on my upconverted Philips DVD player to view it on 1080 and it looks great. Watching the Monopoly Thief, one of my favorites was worth it.

Magnum PI really never made it like Hawaii Five-O. Sure, Hawaii Five-O and Magnum PI have something in common, they were both filmed in Hawaii. However, what makes Hawaii Five-O so successful, it's the writers, the story line, the opening theme, and the actors including Jack Lord who made the show so successful.

I watched it all the time on Cartoon Network and was disappointed when it was never on anymore. I think Phil Lamar does a great job with it. Season one was great and well worth the money.However...Season 2, in my opinion, was a bit of a let down. I only recognized the episode with the Scott's wife (so funny) and I could not even make it through disc one in a single sitting. I found the other episodes boring and to be over all much less visually impressive and well written than season one. I haven't watched disc 2 yet because I'm afraid it will be just as bad.

You can even test drive cars, which are out of your budget, prior to getting to purchase them later. The only thing I noticed is that all cars have manual transmissions installed in them, however your computer driver gets all the fun of shifting gears. In the real world, none of these cars is remotely fun to operate unless equipped with a manual transmission.The Island, which is suppose to resemble Hawaii, is almost endless taking about a few hours to completely round out and even after play the game for a few months crossing over the same area almost feels new again.Overall the game play is awesome and you can drive anywhere your vehicle will allow you to travel without sliding back down or over or into the water where you will be reset."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"Its a very good game, i liked it better than need for speeds in which u just play raceses such as,different race clubsin whhich u can become president,time race, eliminator raceses and many more.

John Cage is not a bad composer, in fact, he's written quite a few marvelous pieces, like his \\"Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano.\\" This is cutting-edge music that is taking risks with every note, and yet it is fantastically listenable.Unfortunately, \\"Litany for the Whale\\" doesn't share these characteristics. It is cutting-edge, certainly, and it takes a great deal of risks. But it isn't listenable. At times it's practically painful to listen to it, simply because it is so strange. Cage's twisted nihilistic philosophy is all to evident here. There is no real attempt to make it musical or listenable, and many attempts are made to make it unusual.John Cage has written good music.

Certainly Cage made some worthwhile philosophical points, but I consider it an insult to the CD that it was forced to have this garbage imprinted onto it.

Afraid of the possible health consequences, I learned too late after discarding the packaging. As a result, I can only throw it out. It is truly unusable and if I could have given this item zero stars, I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky button","review":"This carafe keeps beverages warm enough. The problem I'm having is the push button on the lid sticking in the open position. The instructions that accompanied the carafe address this issue, although they were written for a different model that has the push button on the top of the lid. Despite following these instructions the push button still sticks. To get the lid to close now after I'm done pouring I have to release the button and smack the top of the carafe. Very poor design in my opinion. I wouldn't buy another Zojirushi product based on this experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye Mr. Coffee","review":"After my Mr. Coffee fried I decided to try going back to manual drip. I picked up this carafe, the RSVP cone, some Melitta #6 filters, and some good local coffee ground on the fine side. I haven't looked back, and when Hurricane Irene hit we were the only family on the block who could make coffee for four days (with water heated on the gas grill). This carafe is handsome and keeps just shy of 4 mugs of coffee hot for a long time. We've had it for six months now and someone managed to break the little spring mechanism that opens and closes the spout, but this doesn't seem to matter. We just leave the spout open"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine is a lemon","review":"Unlike most of the buyers of this carafe, I found it to be a serious disappointment, thanks to a major design flaw. The open-and-close mechanism is a dud. After pushing the handle knob to \\"open,\\" what I get from the spout is little more than a trickle. Returning any product costing less than $25 is such a hassle that I'll just toss it and eventually buy another one, but a more expensive one from another manufacturer -- and keep my fingers crossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and useful","review":"I ordered these to use for a party. It was a lovely addition to my buffet table. It holds the coffee hot for several hours. I like the closed and open button. It makes it much easier to use than some of the other carafes I have had. My only thing is it does not keep it hot as long as a thermos but it is much more attractive"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carafe","review":"This thing was inexpensive and it keeps coffee steaming hot all day. Totally happy with the purchase after five months of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"On my way to the garbage can with my Zojirushi carafe, I decided to write a review. The pot keeps coffee hot for a long time, but it is so frustrating to close with the push-button feature that I have decided to just get rid of it. I agree that liquid accumulates in the lid--definitely unsanitary-- and I find that it doesn't pour well when it gets close to empty. The biggest problem is the push button. Once it is pushed to the open position, it may or may not close when pushed again. Guests have commented on this problem and I have managed until recently to close it with several thumb jabs. After trying to close it about twenty times yesterday, I gave up. The thing is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaw","review":"Terrific product with a major design flaw, which is the thumb lever to open/close. Previous reviews reported this problem, which I did not heed. After a year of use, I am throwing it away, which is a shame as it is excellent in all other respects. The thumb lever, a small, cheap component, is permanently frozen. The screw top cap will not open and close anymore without seriously banging the top of the cap. Switching to a standard, old fashioned, screw top thermos for the morning coffee. See my previous review for the 1.85 model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slick by half","review":"This carafe works okay to keep coffee hot and it looks nice enough. But there is a flaw in the lid. Functionally, it's effective -- just press a button to open the pour spout -- no unscrewing of the top needed. But to make this work, coffee has to flow through a plastic channel in the lid and cleaning that channel out is damn near impossible. You have to insert a long object (the end of a spoon or a pen) into the actuator on the lid, while holding the thing under running water; then, do the same thing while trying to shake the water out. If you don't do that, you'll find liquid remaining in the lid, long after you've used it (shake it and you'll hear the liquid move around)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie but not one to see with kids!","review":"This movie supposedly was supposed to be based on the book Animal Farm. It's parallel to the Russian Revolution and the idea of Communism being practiced in Russia, only that instead of Stalin, Lenin, Trotsky, etc., we get animals who, influenced by a speech given to them by a Berkshire boar named Old Major before his death, overthrow the humans on the farm, and set up a government called \\"Anamalism\\". However, just as Communism didn't work out, Anamalism didn't either, instead being dictated by a \\"superior\\" pig named Napoleon. At times during this movie, you feel like you want to punch the screen because it is so upseting and frusterating. Sometimes you want to laugh, other times, like when the hard working horse named Boxer dies or the massacure in which Napoleon executes many animals, you want to cry. An all in all great movie if you're over 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ministry of Truth version of Animal Farm.","review":"This isn't Animal Farm. It's more like if Winston Smith from 1984 tossed Animal Farm down the Memory Hole, and replaced it with a version the Ministry of Truth found more acceptable. Orwell's message was that the animals were as bad off under the pigs as they were under Mr. Jones. The movie, in a very Orwellian manner, negates this, and has the animals far worse off under the pigs than they ever were under Mr. Jones, and at the end, they realize that all they needed was better human masters. Orwell never repudiates Old Major's message, this movie explicitly does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful awful awful","review":"If you have read Animal Farm and are a fan of Orwells work, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It will annoy you, tick you off, and make you feel like you've wasted an hour and a half of your life. If I could give it ZERO stars, I would. It was a good half hour into the movie before anything was even a little accurate. It was as if they took a few bits from the actual book and just threw them in so they could say it was based on the book. It should have said in the credits \\"Very very very loosely based on Animal Farm by George Orwell\\" In fact, they never should have even given Orwell credit as inspiration for this at all, because it would embarrass him to have anything to do with this atrocity of a movie. This is one more movie to remind me that I should never see Hollywoods version of ANY book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great effects","review":"A good adaptation with excellent voice acting. BTW, the digital effects are predominantly by London effects house Cinesite Europe; Henson's Creature Shop made the animatronics. Unfortunately, the \\"Making Of\\" specials don't seem to cover this distinction..."},{"rating":"2","title":"New View of the Farm","review":"This is not a literal rendering of Orwell's great fable but an imaginative fanasty on it. I found it surprisingly moving and inventive. The animals, both in natual action and computerized enhancement, are well \\"directed\\". While the human sub plot is grafted to the animal main action in a somewhat gratutious fashion, this is very a minor factor in a very skilled production. The voice overs by great English actors, are delivered with sensitivity to the drama. You won't ever forget the clever parody of fawning Stalinistic documentaries. The musical score is extremely effective and affecting. The passionate negative reviews of this film are due,I would think, to one's passionate attachments to Orwell and expectations of a more literal (and less sentimental) visual embodiment of the book. On its own ground, this is a beautiful little movie. Try it and you may like it. And cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book was better...","review":"I know, that's what they always say. But _Animal Farm_ with a happy ending? That alone would be enough to turn me off, but this movie also suffers from a bit of a time dilation problem: the pigs become corrupt in about 15 seconds of screen time, rather than gradually as they do in the book. To top it off, this movie's direction is so heavy-handed it makes Orwell look like a master of subtlety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disappointment","review":"I use the book \\"Animal Farm\\" with my highschool freshmen in World History Class. For the last 20 years I then show the old, 1950 cartoon \\"Animal Farm\\"--which follows the book 100%. I thought it was great to have the movie redone in a more modern style, but alas and alack, this newer version does not follow the book and it totally inappropriate to show teenagers. Within the first 5 minutes a man and the wife of his neighbors are in bed with the bed shaking the walls and panting and screaming going on......why oh why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Farm (1999)","review":"Even though there were several pretty horses I did not like this at all. The leader of the farm, a pig, gets killed and this skull is placed on a stick (flies also) by the other ;animals. Animals are slaughtered and it shows the shadow of some people getting 'jiggy', plus the head board hitting the wall. I turned it off. My parents were shocked since it is rated \\"G\\"...but this could scare little kids and is not a \\"G\\" movie. I got it becasue I hoped it would be like the movie \\"Babe\\". It was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist Ruination of a Classic","review":"They destroyed Orwell. I can't believe it. These people actually destroyed that great author. Did they do it deliberately? I don't know. I'm still trying to figure that out.I think perhaps they did. After all, they completely altered the ending. I mean completely, 180 degrees, different from Orwell's pure and clear intention. There ought to be a law against that. Defamation, slander, anything.What if Orwell wasn't writing about Russian communism, persay, but rather, about the nature of totalitarianism in general (which the world and Russia and this country are NOT rid of, by the way!)? Have these myopic movie-makers never considered that? Obviously not.And they also made a trite, saccharine-sweet movie. Thus, they made the great Orwell seem trite.

First of all, I've heard of taking \\"liberties\\" with a book but this is ridiculous! Sex between Farmer Jones and the neighbor farmer's wife is not in the book, but sure is shown in the movie. I was shocked to see them rolling under the sheet as the headboard was \\"knocking against the wall\\". Utterly revolting and embarassing for me and my students. I expect better from Hallmark Entertainment, Family Home Entertainment, etc...Second, there is a \\"no rating\\" statement on the DVD - I'm angry about this and don't appreciate being taken advantage of. There was no warning about adult situations. It's a shame that one can't be truthful in advertising. Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents Beware","review":"I won't pretend to be an expert on George Orwell, but I am a parent. This video is the most shocking example of misleading packaging I have ever seen. This movie is packaged with words like \\"a family treasure\\" and \\"your whole family will squeal with delight\\". Nothing could be farther from the truth. This movie is a literal adaptation of an ADULT novel, and is not appropriate for children under 12. It is dark, violent, and requires an understanding of the message that Mr. Orwell was trying to send. The quality and value of the movie can be discussed and debated, but the only thing a parent needs to know is that it is NOT a movie for children. The marketing company should be taken to task for this abuse of trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"do yourself a favor and read the book!","review":"If you need to see a visual, then watch the cartoon version from the 50's. Granted, the endings are different in both movie versions i.e., the animals bringing Napoleon to justice in the cartoon and the sappy, [bad] ending to the 1999 film. The film had great potential, but moviegoers want to see a happy ending and that's what the 1999 film delivers. The cartoon is much darker and Napoleon actually looks evil. Plus there is too much focus on the humans in this move, which are hardly even mentioned in the book. Also, this movie totally missed the point of Animal Farm's underlying theme of the fall of communism. Well, I've yapped enough..just read the book or, if you must, see the cartoon. Avoid this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"To keep.","review":"Ustinov's speech I had to listen at least ten times. Worth buying just for the old major's speech. I have one comment on the changes from the original book. This is not exactly \\"Animal Farm\\" Orwell wrote. But the changes are not necessearily bad. The demise of old USSR and the new owners of the farm (new face of western capitalism)fit really well with the historical sequal.

After all, if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the book.","review":"Everyone is subjected to their own opinion. In my opinion, I truely dislike this movie. The book is highly more interesting. The characters only make noises and grunt. I NEVER fall asleep and enjoy almost every movie that I see, but this particular one... is terrible. I never had the best sleep in my life until that movie came along. The conclusion is slightly off of the book too. The writer omited a lot of stuff from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Adaptation...A Hard \\"Movie\\" To Pull Off","review":"Okay, for all those who are fans of the Orwell classic, you have to understand how difficult this tale is to bring to the big or small screen. We're dealing with talking animals relating to humans. This tale is too deep for the \\"movie public\\" and ANY movie will fall short for true purists.Taking it for what it is, it is an accurate depiction of the novel. The reviewer who didn't see Moses the Raven in the story must have watched a different film.It is really difficult to get people today to feel the horror of what Animal Farm represented when originally written. Take that and put it under the Hallmark label and it can be just plain confusing for those who haven't read the novel.I truly enjoyed this film. I reccomend it for all. Even if it is a little difficult to follow. Unlike the box says, it is NOT for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"If you're into a geeky read about the history and layout of Prospect Park, then this book is a great read.

He sets out by putting aside his pre tribulation, pre wrath, and pre millennial views instead seeking nothing but the truth from the scriptures; He also examines the history of the belief (this part is a must for reconstructionists). What ever you believe about the rapture; this is a must read book; it will challenged many assumptions and also strengthen others. I won't get into what Lindsey's conclusions are, I will let you find out that for yourselves. Let me just give this book Vanished Into Thin Air the highest possible recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than my money's worth!","review":"Well, to those of you who do not like this guy! Sorry, I am a die hard Lindsey fan! I love, especially on this subject someone who list other scholars viewpoints and with Scripture back up why he disagrees with that view and then goes on to list scripture to backup what his viewpoints are. If you care to take the time to study on your own to know why you believe what you do what could be better? I found this book different than the Rapture book previously published. The title mislead me for I figured this would be like the Rapture. But with this book I learned more about: Intrepretation, Elijah, the puritans, Abraham, Reconstructionist, Augustine, and on and on. So I felt I got more than my money's worth on this one! So sure, Keep em coming Hal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Hal Lindsey wrote another great book.

On British imports, several rare tracks have been released, but these are often hard to find. \\"In the Attic\\" rounds up these oddities. A few of the tracks were previously released on Eponymous and Dead Letter Office, but most are hard to find. Some of the tracks were previously unreleased for a reason, as they aren't as good as other R.E.M. recordings, but for a limited edition, if you are a serious R.E.M. fan, pick this up before it's too late, as it's a great way to avoid having to but expensive imports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!

Only challenge was rotating one of the existing bumper bracket nut washers that has a flange on it, which was positioned in the way, preventing a good seat of the hitch bracket to the truck frame. Was able to use Liquid Wrench and a socket wrench on its bolt which rotated the flanged washer when turning the bolt.

I was about to purchase all of the series...","review":"Thanks to the other reviewers for warning me about the edits that Paramount did to the series. I LOVE the Odd Couple and own Seasons 1 & 2 and wanted to purchase the rest of the seasons. I adore Jack Klugman and Tony Randall and their artistry in portraying Oscar and Felix. It's shameful what I hear happened with edits. Tsk, tsk. I removed the DVDs from my Cart because I refuse to purchase them in this condition. Thanks, everyone! PS Is there anything we could do (haha) to find DVD's of this series that are unedited?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic genius but beware Season 1.","review":"Well written with superb performances from Jack K., Tony R. and most of the supporting cast. Sure, it's an old series made for a US audience but the 70's styles and occasional US-specific gag does not diminish the real enjoyment and delights of this comic masterpiece. Beware Season 1. \\"The first season of the show was quite different from the ones that followed. It was filmed using only one camera, and used a laugh track instead of a studio audience. Many characters from the original play appeared in the show but, when the second season began, many were eliminated and the show filmed in front of a live studio audience with three cameras\\". Though the performances and writing are good, the absence of a live audience, the single camera and a laugh track do make the experience rather less joyous. Try starting with Season 2. By the time you have finished season 5, you may be so desperate to see more of Jack and Tony that Season 1's failings become unimportant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, in spite of edits","review":"While I agree with those who complain about the edits, I am still thrilled by this series of DVD's because the quality is great (I feel like I'm back in 1970, watching it \\"fresh\\") I can't remember the last time I was able to see a totally \\"uncut\\" version of these shows anyway...in syndication the stations cut them to shreds....so this is still far preferable.

My guess is that Paramount was too cheap to pay for the rights for the music. If so, give the rights to the Odd Couple BACK to Time Life! All you are doing is CHEATING true Odd Couple fans by editing some of the funniest moments from these episodes.One thing for certain, I am NOT rushing out to buy any more seasons until I am assured that I am purchasing FULL UN-EDITED episodes.If I wanted cut episodes, I could just wait till they are on TV Land or use my old VHStapes, and make my own DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"I can't even begin to explain the disappointent in this DVD set. Odd Couple fans have been waiting for decades for this series to be released on DVD. When they finally get around to it, they give us these inexcusable edited versions. I have counted at least five episodes with deleted, changed, or shortened scenes, due to someone (usually Felix) singing a few lines from a song. (\\"Sweet mystery of life\\" from 'The Odyssey Couple'; \\"Secluded Rondevoux\\" from 'Role Reversal'; \\"Sun in the morning..\\", from 'Murry who came to Dinner'; \\"Look for the Silver Lining\\" from 'The Odd Monks', and \\"Peg of my heart\\" from 'The Odd Couples')I think someone owes true fans of the series an explanation. Other than here, where can we register our complaints? The sad fact is, if we do, instead of correcting them, they will probably respond by not releasing the 4th and 5th seasons. Shame on Paramount!How sad.amp427"},{"rating":"1","title":"No more butchered episodes for me.","review":"There is a disclaimer on the box that warns that these episodes are edited; however, I was hoping they would be minimal as in the previous two releases. They are not minimal and many episodes are unwatchable for knowledgeable fans. I'm not in agreement with those who say that edited versions are better than nothing.

It is my favorite TV show of all time, and I have the first two seasons which were released in near perfect condition. However, the same isn't true for season three.Season three sees The Odd Couple butchered like never before. It's a shame that fans might never again see the episodes in their original form. As a big fan of classic TV, I feel like I've put up with this long enough. I bought season one of The Cosby Show and Roseanne -- both edited -- and all four edited seasons of ALF. I even went so far as to purchase WKRP. But this one takes the cake. There is no way I am putting down good money for an edited set of The Odd Couple.So long Oscar and Felix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some scenes were cut","review":"Well being a huge Odd Couple fan I was excited when Paramount released these DVDs.Also being a huge fan I was disappointed with the 3rd season DVD. I've noticed some scenes were deleted that were in when I would watch the show on TV. Scenes that were funny and added to the episode. I don't know why ANYTHING would be deleted from these DVD versions. I foolishly thought by purchasing the DVD I would be getting full uncut episodes. I understand that when old shows are aired in repeats they have to edit them a bit to allow for commercials. But in my opinion, and I'm sure this goes for all the other Odd Couple fans, We should get the ORIGINAL UNCUT episodes as they originally aired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Review Meant Only For The HARDCORE Fans Of This Great Show:","review":"Paramount,Viacom-the edits on this set are truly.......ARISTOPHANES !!!!Fans,DO NOT buy.

Harmon (Matthau) and Judge Bell (Harry Morgan) have been law partners for a period of time, but suddenly Judge Bell must leave to help his estranged daughter handle a delicate situation. The man who raped Judge Bell's daughter is back, and before you know it the Judge is accused of murdering this man. Harmon is on the spot to defend the Judge, but the situation seems out of control as Harmon is not allowed to let anyone know of the previous rape. The Judge's daughter doesn't want her son to know the truth about his real father. The Judge's life is in the hands of Harmon and the truth about who really killed the boy's father is becoming a true mystery. This is another great trial movie, and you can slip back into the late 1940's and remember when you were a kid at a great time to be an American."},{"rating":"2","title":"BELL and COBB are some of the best","review":"I had watched the three made-for-tv movies many years ago.

I became very intrigued and even bought and read the Ina Taylor biography. Her bizarre and mysterious death intrigued me almost as much as her life. Although there was no sign of struggle, and the inquest ruled her death an accident, I'm not entirely convinced that Edith died accidentally. I'm somewhat convinced that she may have committed suicide. Even if she couldn't swim, it's hard to believe that a woman can drown in 4 feet of water that close to shore unless she did it intentionally.This is an enchanting book full of nature illustrations by Edith Holden, with excerpts of poetry by great poets, and nature diary entries and observations by Edith, about about birds, insects, flowers, rural places she visited, that sort of thing. Very appealing for those with a nastalgia for country surroundings and the country life.David Rehakauthor of \\"A Young Girl's Crimes\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"should have spent the time on their own stuff","review":"just because you dig face to face doesnt mean youll like this. i rushed out to get it the day it came out and was rather dissapointed. i wasnt excepting the world from a cover disc... but hey, it is face to face. anyway, they cover cool songs, but dont cover them well. trever sounds off key in a bunch of these (hmmm check out the inxs track) and for the most part they are just plain hard to listen to. now, mind you, some are tasty like chesterfield king... but frank would be pissed about planet of sound. check this one out before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Draws You like a Moth to The Flame","review":"Besides the fact that this band does remind me a little bit of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the album album still stands out as its own minor masterpiece.

To be honest the moment the album begins you are drawn in, and i bet that this will turn out to be one of your favorite new releases. IT's got punk, alternative, and mostly genuine fuzzy guitar rock.

This is not a bad thing, however. The sinewy edge to the vocals make them very listenable, and the fact that the rhythm section is actually busting @$$ for this record is also a plus. It's essentially a dark and twisted bass-heavy rock record with definite punk influences. The keyboards add a mysterious touch on \\"Breathe, Breathe\\" and overall it's different enough that I would actually pay $12 for it at the band's merch tent.

After having to send back 2 machines for non-working functions or dents, I settled into my 3rd Zo and probably would have rated it a 5 in the first couple weeks.But....after a year, I'm not so ga-ga over the thing. Often my bread comes out uneven, as if one of the paddles isn't quite doing its job. Now I know to take a look part way through to make sure it's rising evenly. I also really check to make sure the paddles are seated well before starting a loaf. After baking, the blades are stuck in the loaf about 30 percent of the time.And yes, recipes are relatively unforgiving, so I also check to make sure the liquid/solid ratio looks right after some of the kneading process is done.It's a good machine, just not GREAT. Overall, I'm satisfied but not glowingly enthusiastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Bread, Lousy Durability","review":"This machine has made excellent bread for us, but within six months of buying it, the right clip holding the pan broke. We've limped along with one clip for a year now, since we could never get any information from Zojirushi about repair. The left clip is now giving up, causing us to wake in the middle of the night with the pan clattering around during the knead cycle. And since I'm complaining, the machine cooks at such a low temperature that it's been impossible to make a quick bread.I like the horizontal loaf, and I love our Zojirushi rice cooker, but the problems with the clips, the peeling paddles, and the awful customer service ensure that I won't buy another ZO product with moving parts.I'm currently researching other options, because we've grown to love fresh bread so."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK machine but watch out for the warranty","review":"We have used this machine about 3X per week for 7 months, when the paddles started leaking oil from around the seals; in addition to this, the paddles were scraping the bottom of the pan and wearing off the nonstick coating. We sent the pan to the authorized warranty service center; they say that this is not a manufacturing defect because the pan is \\"bent\\", and that we can buy a new pan for about [money], and new paddles at about [money] apiece. Let me say that we have never dropped the pan and have always been very careful with it, so I believe that if the pan is \\"bent\\", it came that way and therefore is a manufacturing defect. So much for the one year warranty.Until this point, we have been fairly happy with the machine. We like the horizontal loaf and the nice dough that we can get for homemade bread. The machine is extremely noisy, however. If I can find a comparable replacement, I will buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service and poor baking","review":"We have tried to use our breadmaker 3 times. After the first flop we called the customer service number. The person at the other end didn't seem to know much other than what other customers told him.The last loaf was not even done baking at the end of all of the cycles, so we put it in the oven. Of course the top had caved in during the process, but after baking it in our oven it did taste good.

I have found that no matter which crust selection (light, med or dark) I choose, the crust is invariable too light and almost not done on top. I have tried different bread recipes and used the troubleshooting section in the book to no avail. I called customer service and was told to leave the loaf in the machine for 10 minutes longer after the final beep sounds even though the book says the the loaf is best removed right after the signal. I am not happy with the results. For what I payed for this machine, the crust control should work! I will attempt to contact customer service again and see what they will do.

The crust control does not work at all; no matter which setting you use, you get dard crust on the side & bottom and barely light crust on the top. The bread doesn't taste that great either.

Panasonic rules!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my new breadmaker!","review":"I got the Zojirushi for Christmas and I have thoroughly enjoyed making fresh bread. I have not had any problems removing the bread from the pan as others have. Mine comes out easily and usually without the blades.

My only complaint is the noise...if you want fresh bread in the morning...make sure your kitchen is far from your bedrooms, otherwise the noise will keep you up early in the morning.

I chose Zojirushi after reading tons of positive reviews (I also liked the fact that it produces horizontal bread)...BIG MISTAKE!! The good thing about this product is that you can see what's going on inside as it makes your bread, but the quality of the bread is not as great as the Panasonic one. The crust control doesn't work; it gets very dark on the sides and on the bottom and the top doesn't get dark enough. Anyways, I returned this after baking a couple of loaves and confirming my disappointment, and I bought a newer version of the Panasonic one instead. It makes great bread.

I adore the cinnamon raisin bread and adding sweet goodies into my bread mix for breakfast. If it is done right, the loaf will taste very good. Prepared mixes from the grocery store are not as good as if you mix the ingredients together yourself. I recommend sifting store-bought mixes first. Sometimes the loafs come out looking like they could have used a little more mixing, and may be a little uneven.

After 6 loaves of bread, one of the paddles stopped turning due to an internal problem in the motor. We returned the breadmaker ... for a free replacement. The replacement machine started making loud clanking noises after the third loaf of bread. I can understand that we might get one defective machine, but two in a row makes me think the company has a serious problem with quality control. We returned the second machine for a refund and will not purchase this or any other Zojirushi product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knocking clattering breadmaker","review":"I previously owned a Zojirushi breadmaker for many years, and it was a fine product. It finally wore out and I purchased a new Zojirushi. What a mistake!!! It knocks and clatters when it kneads like it is going to fall apart and I suspect it will at some time. I contacted Zojirushi and they sent new locking springs for the breadpan but it made no difference. I use their recipe like they say and the bread flour but it still knocks and clatters. I will be returning this breadmaker for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is my second \\"Z\\" machine. My first, I wore out making an average of one loaf of bread a day for the past 10 years. Almost always had excellent results. Am disappointed in this new one as it is extremely noisey and the loaf size is very inconsistent -- even when using the same recipe from the book. Most of the time, the bread is higher on one end than the other.On the positive side: bread is easier to toast. Slices from the old machine (verticle loaf) didn't fit most toasters. This bread does -- especially when you toast from the 'short' end.All in all, I'm not sure I'd have spent the money on this except that I had had good experience with the verticle model. Heard too many horror stories about other machines 'wondering' when kneading to try something else.Also find it frustrating that there is no direct website to Zojirushi Corp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding results!","review":"This is the first breadmaker we have ever owned. We bought it because I needed a way to make low-sodium bread. This machine has far exceeded any expectations we had. So far we've made several loaves of bread, several cakes, and pizza dough. All turned out perfect, and it is often exceedingly difficult to turn out baked goods of this quality at 5500 feet. Also, it is extremely easy to clean -- another plus. The machine comes with an instructional video which is worth watching once, and the instructions are clear in the manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the ultimate breadmaker","review":"I have gone through 3 less [spendy] breadmakers over the last 5 years. A year ago I thought I would go for the better highly recommended Zojirushi. It coast twice the typical maker. The old addage \\"You get what you pay for\\" seems to hold true for all but breadmakers. Even though I had never heard of this brand, it had all the ammenities that I wanted. After only using it a dozen times or more, the last 6 attempts eneded in failure. The bread will not rise. I have tried using various yeasts and recipes and still the bread will not rise. Mecanically, all the parts are holding up except for this problem. I will attempt to get some satisfation from the company's service center."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting situation","review":"Our Zojirushi bread machine is a dream. However, getting it wasn't. It oritinated in NC, was sent to a facility in NJ, then sent to somewhere in IL, where it was returned to NJ to be delivered to us in NY City. The delivery took about 3 weeks, not the advertised \\"about 5 business days\\". The item was packed in an egg crate, not its original box. The machine was dented in the back and some items were missing. The seller replaced the original color manual with an illegible b/w copy. I complained to the seller, who did send a partial refund for the missing items, offer to take back the dented machine and gave me the URL for the owner's manual, which I was able to print up. With all that, the machine works extremely well and is easy to clean and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival","review":"Read all the reviews and thought this model was the best. After receiving the breadmaker, reading the directions and setting it up, we fired it up and waited for our bread. After an hour, we took a peek and noticed that the ingredients weren't mixed. Further investigation determined that the gearing driving the kneading paddles didn't move. Unsat for a brand new machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reliability","review":"After using this machine occasionally for two years, all of the bread fell and was a solid mess after baking. The dough would rise to the top of the machine and then fall. This happened with every recipe and variety. Zojirushi was not help. They stated if the machine was two years old, to take it in for repair. I took it in for repair and am told the electronic panel will have to be replaced for a cost of $115.00. I did not pay much more than that for the machine. I did not get my money's worth from this breadmaker. It's sad when it costs as much to repair a product as the original cost. Are these machines only good for two years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zojirushi BBCC-V20 breadmaker","review":"Purchasing this breadmaker, the fourth one in my breadmaker experience, was a serious mistake. While the finish inside and out is very fine, and it has lots of bells and whistles, every loaf I've made in this machine has been \\"captured\\" in the pan. That is, it cannot be slipped, pried, or shaken loose without virtually destroying the loaf, because the beater bars bake into the loaf like cement. Sometimes, the beater bars come loose from the pan and come out with the loaf, and then have to be pried out. Usually they rip the bottom of the loaf apart. I'm going to take drastic action and throw this(Korean made)Zojirushi before I waste more money on bread mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Short Life For a Breadmaker","review":"This is such a disappointment- this machine is so wonderful at first, it makes fantastic bread and other goodies. It made homemade pizza a breeze. I just loved it- but within weeks, the paddles started to peel and rust, despite meticulous cleaning and drying. I returned the first machine, but the second one had the same problem. And now, sixteen months later- my machine is dead. It just stopped working, and of course the warranty is up. So now I am faced with a choice- do I try this machine again, despite it's expense? Or do I attempt to find another machine that can do all that this one promises? I am hoping to find a different machine with a longer life, though I'm not sure any of them out there are as great as this one is in it's first few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"This is my second bread machine...I had a Panasonic vertical loaf and wanted a horizontal loaf. Read the reviews, bought the ZO. Big mistake. As with other folks, the clamp on the right side broke. Could not get Zojirushi's Customer Service to return my calls. Called an authorized dealer, paid $20 to get the whole bottom part when I just needed the clamp. Replaced the clamp and thought that would solve my largest problem, which is that the loaves never come out even, always lower on one side. Also, sometimes the loaf is coarse and dense, other times it is perfect, except lower on one side. I have tried it in various locations throughout my kitchen and the results are never the same. Very inconsistent. I have never gotten a perfect loaf with a recipe other than the basic loaf from the book. Very limiting. Will never buy another Zojirushi product of any kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mechanical problems","review":"This is the second review I have posted for this product. The first was shortly after I received it and was complimentary. I do like the bread this machine turns out, but this expensive a machine should last more than 15 months. I had initial problems with the pan clips and now, after the warranty has expired, one of the paddles has quit working. After reading the other reviews, I suspect there is a problem with a belt. I am not going to return the machine. I can buy another, less expensive, brand for the postage cost. If my husband can't fix the Zo, I will buy a cheaper one. This expensive a machine should last for years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"At first it worked OK, then problems. Trying to reach customer service on their 800 is impossible. Try dialing the number before you purcahse to verify my statement. Even though I had the machine for only 5 weeks, I still was required to send back for warrenty service, postage paid. Then they returned it to me saying everything was OK, that a small amount of crust that I had left on the shaft caused the problem. Of course, that was ridiculus, so I am stuck with a defective machine. They don't honor their warrenty or answer their telephone help line. BEWARE."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"I was desperate for a new breadmaker when our local Great Harvest Bakery closed down (*sniff*). This breadmaker has been a huge disappointment for me. The bread is substantially worse than the last breadmaker I owned (an old DAK). It comes out with the crust too hard and all the flavor baked out of the bread. There does not seem to be an adjustment for crust darkness for the wheat bread setting, the setting I use the most. I tried all the standard ingredients plus a variety of specialty flours to get a good tasting loaf, all with disappointing results. The breadmaker also seems to really struggle with bread recipes from other breadmaker cookbooks--rarely working on the first try. (There is a handy adjustment chart in the instructions.)The one good part--The breadmaker does make pretty good bread if you use it to make the dough and then bake in your own oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Zojirushi breadmaker doesn't mix well.","review":"I have a Zojirushi breadmaker and it does not mix well at all whenever I make bread.

I bought one for a friend, and, since she liked making bread by hand, for her, I would rate it one star.Conclusion: any piece of machinery has pluses and minuses, even a simple egg timer takes practice before you can calibrate it and know how to use it just right.

The machine makes good bread. However, after three months of usage (2 loaves/week and 1 dough/week) the belt of one of the paddles broke. It has to be repaired and I am responsible for the cost of shipping both to and from the repair...I don't expect this unlooked for added cost and inconvenience from a high end machine so soon after purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream Machine","review":"This is my 2nd breadmaker. The previous one made a vertical 'chef's hat' loaf that was always rather unappealling. But more than that, the results were inconsistent. I always love home baked bread but was giving up on using a machine because I could never tell how things would turn out. Not true with this beauty. Two mixing paddles seem to mix everything better, and the loaves are beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. It has been a joy to make bread again, so I highly recommend this machine, especially to those who may have had a bad experience with other brands. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Communication","review":"My machine quit working after 3 weeks and I called (as they suggest in their literature) to get the address of nearest service center.

Based on Consumer Reports, etc. I purchased the Zojiruski BBCC-V20. What a big mistake! The loaves always stick to the pan because they are too brown on the bottom while they are too pale on the top. Adjusting the crust color doesn't help. The machine is very loud while operating, and includes an \\"add ingredients\\" beeping sequence that is entirely too long and very annoying. I'm sending the Zojirushi back and ordering replacement parts for my worn out Panosonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Name in Quality","review":"I've read reports of nonstick surfaces being ruined, though it didn't happen to me I've found replacement parts available through one of the links provided by the Zojirushi web site.

I own a Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker, hot water dispenser and a grill by Zo and can't say enough about the quality and design of these appliances. A number of respected consumer services rates this bread maker the best or among the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"BBCC-V20","review":"I bought this bread machine for a christmas gift 2 years ago. The bread that came out of it was hard and dense. The machine came back to me to see if I would have any luck with it. I have tried countlees recipies, including the ones in your book. But the bread is just heavy and the crust is dark 1/4 inch thick. I tried all the setting and various amounts of flour, different types of flour, different yeast, different temperatures of water. You name it, I have tried it. Finally, I have a friend who makes bread from a Williams and Sonoma machine. It is soft and the bread rises so high, it pushes the lid up. I tried the exact same recipie in my machine and I got a hard piece of burnt flour. I am not at all pleased with this machine, especially for the amount of money I paid for it. I was thinking of selling it a garage sale, but I don't want anybody else to be as disappointed as I am. I am sorry to say that I will not buy another Zojirushi product again.Thank youPeter Goettl"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality- No response from manufacturer.","review":"I am very disappointed with the Z0 V-20. I purchased the unit approximately 18 months ago. I made bread about once a week, except for a 2 month period when we moved to another home. The bread maker did an excellent job of making bread, however the gear box was extremely noisy during the mixing process. The main problem was the bread pan and blades. The coating on the blades came off and the blades did not fit snuggly on the drive spindle. The bread pan began to leak about 6 months ago and recently the blades were scraping metal off the bottom of the pan. Discovered the pan was warped!! Sent a message to the Service Center in Commerce, CA. No response!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Zojirushi works (pretty) quietly away and makes very good bread. Only difficulty is separating baked loaf from the two paddles, but this is a very minor issue. This is our second bread machine, the old one was first generation R2D2 clone who gave up its life in the service of yeast, but Zojirushi is much better, quieter, and stores easily in a cabinet. Don't hesitate: buy this one, even if it is from Korea. In fact, buy now, because unfortunately there may not be a Korea much longer!

After about two years of moderate use, the machine's lubricant leaks into the dough around the paddles (I believe it is food grade lubricant, but who wants bluish-grey bread?). The paddles have worn the bucket surface down to bare metal. I went through the regular channels with the company, but got only an email back with prices for new bucket and paddles - .... This may have been a particular group or run of machines - but they aren't worth the money if it only lasts two years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Shortly after the unit went out of warranty, it started overcooking the sides and bottom of the loaf, leaving the top barely cooked. Read other negative reviews, this is a common problem with all Z models. At the same time, the bottom bent up around one of the blades, causing the paddle to scrape the pan down to bare metal, adding nonstick coating particles to my bread. I could literally see grey areas in the dough where it had been stained by the nonstick coating and metal. Had to throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good machine, could get better","review":"I bought my Zojirushi 3 weeks ago. So far, I have been satisfied with it, except for: (1) the quantities in the recipes didn't work as expected, but the good thing about this machine is that you can open the lid at any time and add liquid or flour to obtain the right consistency; (2) the crust does not darken evenly. But, I have been able to get a nice loaf every time, as long as I check the dough for adding liquid or flour. And that's the reason why I feel this machine could still be improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable","review":"This replaced another bread machine that didn't last 6 months.

One can appreciate the title without ever seeing the 60 minute movie itself, and the impact of Floyd Crosby's Hawaiian location photography has been greatly diminished by Alpha's poor transfer, which looks to be from a pretty good print but has been transferred to DVD with the brightness up much too high, making the few night scenes easier to watch than the many daytime shots. That leaves only the opening sequence, a suspenseful nighttime dockside robbery, nicely staged and edited with no dialogue.

We go through peas so much in my house with my child and this is the only way we are going to buy them from now on. The box is very compact and I just remove the top and leave stored them right in the box. It saves a ton of room in the kitchen, rather than having them tipping over in the cupboard.One surprising thing we also discovered is that our cat who has a low appetite loves this simple pea baby food too. It has been healthy for my baby and a real treat for my pet. Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-destructing airpot","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers who complained that this airpot is too fragile.

I wont order it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this 3 liter airpot!","review":"I am very happy that I purchased this air pot. Not only does it hold two full pots of coffee, it keeps it piping hot for hours and hours.

Excellent product, I am glad that I bought it and wish that I had found it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass lined is best","review":"This is the fourth airpot we've had and it is surprisingly good, an improved design all the way around.

Justine Shapiro states that it is VERY VERY EXPENSIVE to travel in Argenitna. It was back then when the video was made, mostly in 1997, but now after the devaluation in 2001 Argentina is considered one of the most inexpensive travel destination in the world.It was shot in 2004 and contains the latest information for tourists, such as the CURRENT price of hotels, food, etc.If you are interested in visiting Argentina and really want to know how it is NOW I recommend you consider the \\"Best of Buenos Aires\\" video on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"too gorey for average travelers","review":"I bought this DVD as a gift for my parents, hoping to entice them to visit my us after we move to Argentina this summer. I was surprised when they told me that the show had completely turned their stomachs with vivid portrayals of killing and gutting a cow, ripping off it's hide and opening the stomach to show what's inside. The host also brands a cow, and you hear it moaning as you watch her, in shock, asking herself WHY she had ever agreed to do such a thing. I think this would be a fine video to watch for \\"documentary\\" entertainment, but if you are trying to convince the average 70 year old traveler (or anyone who is not gung-ho on livestock) to go to Argentina for a holiday, this is NOT the DVD to choose! We're going to look for another, more \\"travel-friendly\\" program to show to the rest of the family instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"before 2001!","review":"This video was made before 2001 and the economic crash, so they keep talking about how expensive it all is.

Compton writes a good clean story, and this is no exception. It's unfortunate that Compton died when he did, because I antipated a lot more from him. Fortunately, we have now Kirby Jonas, whom critics call the New Louis L'Amour. His books are clean, not graphically violent, and the swearing is minimal. Louis L'AMour would be proud to see his name applied to Kirby Jonas. If you read L'Amour, COmpton, and Jonas, you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A smart romantic comedy with good acting","review":"I don't understand why this movie didn't get better reviews when it first came out. It has some really big-name actors who are fun to watch onscreen but also really good at their craft -- Marissa Tomei, Hugh Jackman, Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear, and Ellen Barkin.One thing I particularly like about this love story is that it doesn't follow the typical romantic comedy story arc. The girl is the one who kinda messes up and has to apologize and admit that she is wrong -- something that almost NEVER happens! (And I'm a girl! But I like romantic stories that are fair to both sexes!)There's only one reason I didn't give this movie five stars, and that's because I don't like sex scenes, which aren't terribly graphic in this movie, but . . . I just don't prefer them. It would've been a better movie had they left that part out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on leadership as well as communication","review":"I first came across this book in shelved in the back of the bookstore with all those other useless self-improvement books. I was expecting another simple guide with commonplace advice (practice your speech before you give it, avoid the ums and ahs). Inside, however, I was pleasantly surprised to find an intelligent discussion not just of speaking skills but also communication of all forms. In fact, I found its points on leadership to be more insightful than most other management books I read.

It's music from today's jazz clubs - little places in brooklyn and san francisco - not fossilized Giants.There's a free track at their home website (a full track, not the amazon little clip).

This is poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsanitary","review":"The lid on this model has several places where water or condensation can collect and breed mold or bacteria. It cannot be washed and dried thoroughly due to the poor design. The push button on the lid seems gimmicky and easily breakable.

It kept my coffee at a temp I didn't need to reheat for 8 hours. Unfortunately, about 10 days ago, I dropped the unit and broke the glass liner. I immediately came to Amazon and ordered a new one. I received the unit this past Monday and must report that I am extremely disappointed. Even when I, as usual, preheat the interior of the unit with hot water, it keeps my coffee hot enough to drink for maximum of 2 hours. The lid doesn't seem to fit as tightly as the lid on my original unit and the unit seems lighter in weight which means the thickness of the glass liner has been reduced. After reading some other reviews on this carafe, I may as well forget contacting the manufacturer as they appear to ignore bad news. Guess I will have to shop for another brand. Money down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"start leaking air after 2 months use","review":"I am writing this review after 1 year of purchase.The first 2 months,maybe 3,was good.

I'm not sure who's fault it is, but somebody goofed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Designed Carafe","review":"As others have noted, the design of the lid is very problematic, making it basically impossible to keep clean and eventually leading to jamming of the mechanism. That alone is a major design flaw. In addition, the design of the chamber makes pouring the coffee without spilling a challenge. When pouring the last couple of cups of coffee, you have to tip the carafe up quite a bit. This leads to coffee coming out of the top of the lid as well as the spout. If you take the lid off to pour, then you have to be really careful to watch out for the tipping point where the coffee just rushes over the lip and soaks the counter top. We hate this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but not quite.","review":"This carafe is attractive, holds a lot and keeps stuff hot for quite some time, but the pop-out open/close valve is faulty. It will open, but is hard to close as it sticks. The solution is to wiggle the cap a bit and the close button pops back out, but it's more hassle than it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"8 am to 6 pm???","review":"I read the reviews for this thermal carafe, and now I wonder if they were being paid to write that. I do not have a problem the the button sticking, yet. I bought it for my mother and she was ecstatic, until 11 AM. At 8 AM she poured boiling water into it and left it there untouched. At 11 AM she felt like another pot of tea but when she poured it out, it was only warm and you can't make tea with warm water. My mother doesn't lie, but she also can't drink anything hotter than warm, so I had to test it myself. I was so convinced by the person whose coffee was hot from 8 PM until 6 AM, but when I poured boiling water into it at 9 AM, it was already lukewarm 3 hours later. I do not recommend this for anyone who likes hot liquids, but it's great for those who like warm liquids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Coffee","review":"I received this as a Father's day gift. I use a carafe everyday to keep coffee fresh. This carafe has a nice swivel bottom, push button dispenser and large capacity. The first time I used it after 3hrs the coffee was room temp. I emptied it and refilled it the next morning and low and behold 3 hrs later it was cold again. This product is nothing but a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like","review":"I returned the carafe because it was difficult to open the lid.I have arthritis in my hand and liked the idea of pushing a buttonto dispense coffee, but you have to get the coffee in the carafebefore you can push the button, which was also difficult to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky Open Close Mechanism","review":"Bought this carage in November 2007. This carafe worked wonderfully for approximately 1.5 years. After eighteen months the sping loaded open/close mechanism began to stick in the open position. It is now extremely difficult to make the open/close mechanism move from open to close. Note that the mechanism must be in the closed position in order to take the screw-off top off for cleaning purposes. This carafe's ability to maintain coffee at an extremely hot temperature for extended period is excellent. Unfortunately, the sticky open close mechanism now renders this carage as virtually useless. I would expect more than an 18-month lifespan out of a $40 carafe. Perhaps they should dump the spring loading and just go a simpled unscrew to open and tighten to close procedure. As with another comment on Amazon.com I can find no info on any type of warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Carafe Ever!","review":"This is the best carafe I've ever used. It holds almost a whole pot of coffee and it opens with a push button, not unscrewing which always left me wondering if I had it open far enough. It also has a swivel base so you can get to the handle easily even if it's not facing you. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was shattered when it arrived.","review":"This item arrived, and when I opened the box, glass shards were everywhere.

Never grow tired of hearing On The Road Again or Goin' Up The Country and Bullfrog Blues is fun. There are NO bad takes on this CD. This is a group of musicians who seem to really jell together in their playing and this collection from several of their albums gives you a starting point to what albums will be next on the list.

It's got to be a classic, right? Think again. Sure there are one or two good haiku to be found in the collection, and Grey Wolf Press includes enough supporting material to add context and some pith to the purchase, but this book is really for the die-hard Gotta-Have-It-All-Right-Down-To-The-Laundry-Lists-fans of beatdom.

Anyone who is a teacher will root for Berenger's character as gets the students in line. Of course, it's exaggerated, but actually, the point is made that perhaps the problem with education today is that students are in classrooms with no discipline.

Some appliances are damaged more from voltage sags as opposed to spikes and flat screen TV's and monitors are among those. So far, I own two of these units and I recommend them. Another bit of advice: A voltage regulator is not necessarily a UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply)and not all UPS's are voltage regulators.

Mckenzies score is melodic, pastoral, emotional and beautiful music to support the drama of The Lost Child. There are numerous solos with harp, cello, piano, classical guitar, flute, oboe, and clarinet; often with underlying muted strings. The Indian ethnic music is subtle, yet present in the wood flute playing the mother's weaving theme (track #7).It is just one many scores by the composer that echo the same beautiful music. Mckenzie writes from his heart and doesn't miss with every cue with his music on this warm, lovely piece. It is a score I have listened to many times and am always emotionally affected by it in a positive way. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaing and Peaceful","review":"First heard Mark's work on Pandora. Everytime they played a song from Saving Sara Cain, I would look up to see what was playing. Rented the movie and bought the soundtrack. Some of the best music today is coming from movie sound tracks. The Lost Child is another good example of this. The Lost Chil soundtrack is so peaceful. It is so relaxful that I go to sleep by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic but expensive shipping","review":"This was perfect for what we wanted it for - we had a Harry Potter party and used it to make pumpkin juice.

It was amazing and opened up a new realm of thought for me. The second time I read it when I was 20 years old and it made me think of other things in my life.. Iread the book the third time when I was 28 and I was amaized that every time I read it I pick up new thoughts, new ideas, etc. So, now I am looking forward to my \\"new age\\" to read it again. Without too much of the disclosure, the story line is great plus a bonus is very deep but light philosophical context. Anyone can relate to the story and thoughts that this book provokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beacon on the path of enlightenment.","review":"This story was recommended to me recently, and after reading it, I heartedly concur. If you are lost, longing for meaning, feel the calling of a higher power; read this book. It has inspired me to new levels of consciousness and awareness, as well as appreciation of life and wonder. Hesse captures deep rooted feelings of lonliness and self-exile, and eventual calm as he portrays this childhood/adolescence.Read the book. And then read it again. I have found new and continuing pleasure in Hermann Hesse. I also was inspired to re read \\"Steppenwolf\\" by Hesse. Another wonderful work of similar quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel is a very provakative and in depth story!","review":"I really enjoyed the change this novel brought to my thinking. I didn't use to think too deeply now I question everything. I liked the ideas and the imagery that Hesse portrays to the reader. If you want another book that will turn you inside out with your beliefs in god read, Letter from the Earth, By Mark Twain. I know he doesn't sound like a fascinating writer but that story is ... well read it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible edition of a great novel...","review":"While I was unpacking books after a recent move, I put aside a few oldies but goodies to add to my spring reading list. Some favorite titles had somehow \\"disappeared\\" over the past 20 or 30 years. When I realized Demian was among the missing, I picked up this paperback. What a mess-terpiece! This edition averages over one typo per page!! Skip this overpriced, carelessly produced \\"tome\\" at all costs. Don't support a publisher that handles classics so haphazardly. Personally, I will avoid HarperPerennial like dog poop in the park. Any out-of-work proofreaders out there? Apply now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jewel of German Thought","review":"Ah yes, what can one say about this tiny, often unrecognized gem among the numerous works of Hermann Hesse? i read this about a year ago, and was captivated by its gripping story-telling and highly philosophical insight. After reading this, one may feel confused or even slightly depressed, as it raises more stinging questions than it gives illuminating answers, but that certain brand of mystical existentialism is common to Hesse's work, and indeed is its most memorable \\"feeling\\". Well, it is less dour than \\"Steppenwolf\\", though less inspiring than \\"Siddhartha\\"(naturally!), but in one sense it may be a great introduction to Herr Hesse's novels. i would recomend it for that purpose, as it is the shortest of the four works of his i've read (the fourth being \\"Narcissus and Goldmund\\", which does drag on..), and it really is rather good."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK EVER","review":"This is a great book. It is so deep, and filled with multiple meanings that to get the most out of it, you should probably read it ten times. (I am on my fourth read.) Just read it. And see for yourself. It will change your thinking patterns and way of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but self-indulgent and rather ill-conceived","review":"Despite its enduring popularity, this novel is certainly not among Hesse's best. The author's painful, overriding preoccupation with his own emotions (which in novels like Narcissus and Goldmund and Siddartha is transformed into high art) here becomes blatant, self-indulgent, adolescent, and ultimately rather irritating. The novel starts out promisingly and provides some very powerful images, but after a few chapters it begins to degenerate into outright silliness. The ending is especially unconvicing, suggesting that Hesse had trouble leading his story to a conclusion. Those with highly introspective temperaments like Hesse's might enjoy the novel, and those with a special interest in the author would do well to study it, but the same themes it develops are treated much much more satisfyingly in other of his novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't do it","review":"I tried to read it. No luck. I almost finished it. But every time I picked it up I felt like I was punishing myself. Why force my way through a book that is so . .. . boring? I think I was hoping the end would twist the whole thing around. Maybe it does. But the more I read, the less faith I had in the book to be interesting.What is wrong with it? All it offers is the charm of the main character. If the main character had charm, that would keep me reading. But he didn't.It reads sort of like a tract for some sort of progressive, new-ageish, neo-pagan, pluralistic spirituality. The main character discovers some sort of ancient ultimate truth that only he and a few other people are gifted enough to realize. It is reminiscent of the spirituality of some of the Modernists, particularly Yeats.All I can say is the book was too boring to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Banal","review":"In his exhausting attempts to find religious mysticism Hesse has managed another seminal work of boredom. Like in Siddhartha what starts off as a good little story (by the way what happened with Franz Kromer?) deteriorates quickly as Hesse tries to explain the unknown. The book then draws on insipidly and concludes in banality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think this book is very insightful","review":"I think this book is about a guy falling in love with his friend's mom, correct? You can't just rule your life out of your society as the Essenes did in the 1st century. If you want to find yourself, you should find it among your fellow companions, not some guy who says he has Cain's mark on his head. And as a Christian, I really can't understand why people think this book is insightful. I'd rather read more valuable novels that gives me inspiration in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality printing","review":"Don't buy this version of the book. The printing quality is terrible. The preview is misleading because it links to the Perennial edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-shattering and confusing. A revelation","review":"'Demian' is one of the most insightful books I've read recently and certainly one of the best novels by Hesse. Perhaps it is not as thoroughly satisfying as 'The Glass Bead Game' or 'Siddhartha' - there are some weaker points in the book (I myself dislike the ending), but Hesse explores ideas that are rather innovative and truly fascinating.In 'Demian' Hesse delves into the importance of coincidences in finding the Self. Only there is nothing coincidental about these coincidences, it is all really the unfolding of the Way. Random things mean much more than the logical ones - that is one of the cornestones of Hesse's philosophy. Chaos is harmony.The search for the Self is a common theme of Hesse's works, and his approach here is highly interesting and thought-inducing. In order to fully understand this book one would have to read some Jung (particularly 'Memories, Dreams, Reflections') and Nietzsche. However, that's only a suggestion, not a requirement..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy publisher","review":"My wife is teaching this novel in German and ordered this so I could read it in English. There are some problems with this edition. The publisher, BN Publishing, does not list a city or location of publication. An internet search for BN publishing and a visit to their website reveals no information about who they are. They publish all kinds of works, mostly nonfiction. This edition of Demian has no introduction, and the translator is not identified. This and the lack of a publisher location make the edition useless for academic work because it can not be properly referenced. I can't say this with certainty, but I suspect the publisher is reprinting a translation for which the copyright has expired and is not crediting the translator. We sent the book back and are planning to purchase the Dover German-English edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strange, but intriguing ride","review":"I recently read this novel. It took me about a day and a half to finish it. I must say it was really a unique masterpiece! If someone was to ask me to give a brief summary, there is no way that I could do it, the whole novel is important. It's dark in it's own way, too. and different from anything that I have every read... It's truly a strange, but intriguing ride..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW, I cant even explain","review":"The title of my review is correct, I cant even explain. Not only how good this book was, but how deep it was. This book is definately one that made me think A LOT. Most people just pass it off as some story of frustrated adolescence, that is wrong. If you want that go read Catcher In The Rye, or A Seperate Peace. But this is way more than just that, this is more of mentality and human nature, it is about what drives people to do what they do and how people search and chase pipe dreams and about things that our feeble minds can not even wrap around. If you think you are smart( and I know you do if you are reading this review), you really need to know that you are stupid and every smart person you know is stupid. If you read this book you will realize what I mean, every person will make something different of this book, but in truth this book is a great work of imagination and symbolism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"I read this book in school and fell in love with it.

But I was wrong. It is very much worth reading and I recommend it to anyone who loves Hesse and to anyone who hates Hesse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still chewing","review":"Not what I was expecting at all. Demian was my first and only (so far) introduction to Hesse. It's a great outpouring of ideas and existentialism, but I have to admit at times it was a bit too dry for my taste. I guess I was expecting more of a story. If I'd been prepared for what is mostly a loose framework for a philosophy, I could have surrendered myself to it more readily.Overall, I'm still mulling over everything I read in it, and I think I will be for a long long time. I give it 4 stars instead of five because it comes across as a novel but reads like an essay. As an essay on the human condition I'd give it a 5.Regardless, you need to read this if you've ever wondered about your place in the universe, whether good and evil really exist, and why you feel a little different from those around you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insights Into a Human Soul Are Not Enough","review":"I was somewhat dissapointed in 'Demian.' I had never read Hesse before and I was prepared to really enjoy this book. I thought that it started off well but the middle was very boring and the end was too weird for words. I finished the book not because I was curious but because I can't stand not to finish a book. It wasn't complete rubbish but there are better psychology/philosophy books out there. Read 'Siddhartha' instead, that is Hesse at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amazing start but progressively dissapointing","review":"The first chapter of this book was so good. Hesse writes about the character's childhood with such rich reflection and prose. People just don't write like this today. He's so in touch with his surroundings, his emotions, his inner self. After that it becomes less compelling tormented navel gazing. Sinclair, the main character idealizes his boyhood friend who has this odd and completely ridiculous take on a few Bible stories. So, he's a boy who marches to the beat of his own drum, how romantic (you get the picture) and eventually meets his friends mother. It then goes down into trivial mysticism. The family are like theosophists. No compelling take on anything. the book talks a lot about ones 'Fate'. Compared to some heavy and enjoyable literature along this vein, I found this drivel. I will try some other Hesse though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud!!! Do not be fooled!","review":"Crap product - bag burst with only 14 lbs turkey in it...water everywhere.

Why does a novel like this merit praise? It has ridiculously unlikable characters, including a flatulent old lady who likes to vandalize the town, a bitchy teenaged single mother with smelly feet, and a woman who in her unmitigated selfishness causes her husband's suicide after she aborts his baby. It had virtually zero plot, it had a dozen missed opportunities for using set-ups that practically fall into the author's lap (witch's graves in a 17th century graveyard??? how cool is that? but what's he do with it? almost nothing!) and it ends with this impossible compromise among its main figures that left me wondering if anyone was buying it. I truly dislike this book, as I guess you can tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potboiler masquerading as serious literature.","review":"Why do men think they can get into women's heads?If you want to read a bad try at the above, read\\"Beachcombing.\\" The title should give you a hintof the pretentiousness of this small novel. Three womenare thrown together on a ship (floating - get it?)that is moored to land (disconnected from reality - what an original metaphor). One is senile, one is stupid, and the last is a grieving widow archaeologist (trying to understand the past, in case you didn't figure it out). There are moments of witty one-liners, but for the most part the book reads somewhere between a sailing manual, archaeological report, and story of three one-dimensional women. I'd love to see this plot redesigned by a sensitive woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality","review":"I was excited about the price and color choices, but this product is cheap.

The daughter in this book didn't really have the money to continue to give her father the medication anyway and I wonder if she was really rich if she would have been so quick to stop her father's treatment or even looked into what he was getting.The plot is not really original but it could have been so much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for adults","review":"HN-Zyme Prime restored my ability to enjoy normal foods in healthy portions.

I wanted a light pair of shoes that worked when I needed to get in the water (on this trip it was just to fly fish for trout) but also were comfortable and cool when I took off my boots at the end of the day's trail. In addition, I wanted soles that were thick enough to walk in rocky terrain as I made my way back and forth between the lakes I was fishing and did other walking around each day's campsite. I found these shoes fully satisfied those needs. One negative is that they have very little gripping power when they are wet and you are walking on dry, rough terrain. They also take longer to dry out than I would have liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speedo Hydro XP = PAIN","review":"I bought these shoes brand new a few weeks ago, and wore them at Splashin' Safari water park earlier today for the first time. Big mistake! Within the first 30 minutes I developed a huge blister above both heals do to the hard mesh friction rubbing agianst my skin. Speedo did a really poor job on the construction of these shoes. They need to go back to the drawing board. Why put such a hard material in the shoe heal for god's sake?! It's a water shoe! You don't wear socks with them! The bottom line here is that the Speedo XP's are like wearing a cheese grater strapped to your heal. I'm done with water shoes. I'll stick to wearing my sandals in the water. They're a lot more comfortable. I've never had a whole lot of luck with water shoes anyway, and this pair was definitely no exception.

Years later I bought a CD of The Use of Ashes and found it was just as good as I remembered it - a great album indeed and Tom Rapp's voice iconic. My memory of Balaklava was that it was more of the same and so must also be great, right?Wrong unfortunately - it is an interesting album, as is 'One Nation Underground' (these two albums making up the content of the Complete Esp-Disk Recordings)but nowhere near as good as 'The Use of Ashes'.So unless you are a very keen fan, or like curiosities or are studying the music of the 60's & 70's I just wouldn't bother.P.S.

Never having seen the original I can't comment on how it differs from the longer version, but the editing was ok & the story flowed & made sense.What was disturbing was the self-serving narrative taken from Bonanno's writing, that portrays him as a sensitive, honorable, decent, patriotic, religious & family man, whose was basically a businessman running the family business. There is nowhere any willingness to fess up to what he really was: a thug.The movie did give interesting insights into the real-life of the mafia."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks!","review":"This Joe Bannano bio is a waste of a movie. First of all, it is highly unbleivable. Yes, I understand that the Mafia legend is one of sophisticated influence over many historic 20th centurary events, and while there may be some level of truth to these assertions, little has been proven to the level this movie would have you believe. In addition, it is boring as a movie in and of itself. I only found out through other reviews that the original version was 4 hours long. Perhaps, that would have made for a more coherent and enjoyable picture, however as is, I would not recomend a purcahse of this video.pickledjoe"},{"rating":"1","title":"BPA!!!","review":"Consider purchasing a different product, this juice is contained in plastic #7, one known for BPA and is widely told to avoid, especially for babies!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They should be ashamed","review":"#7 plastic bottles contain BPA.

Sure he has had his major hits such as Right Here Waiting,Now and Forever,and Hold Onto the Nights(which are all on this CD.) But it's sad that you really don't hear much about him anymore. I would rate him up there with the greats like Billy Joel,Sting,and even Elton John. Marx is a great song-writer and can play the piano and guitar beautiful which are displayed on many of the tracks on this album. The out-standing tracks on here in my opinion are Hold onto the Nights,Don't Mean Nothing,and Right Here Waiting. Right Here Waiting is Marx's signture song which I'm sure everyone has heard one time or another. It is also probably the best ballad on the eighties. So,if you are a big music fan and enjoy soft-rock,you have not lived until you hear this.

Those are the ones customers want, not something made in the 2000s. This is a pure money grab by WB. People who don't know any better will end up buying this only to be extremely disappointed.On top of all the classic Looney Tunes yet to be released, what's WB waiting for with the balance of the classic Popeye cartoons?

By no means a weak or boring record, but at the same time not an album that will transport you to another universe, this record is front to back solid songs. This record doesn't really break any new ground, or excel in any certain way, but like every release he's ever put out, is still a must-have. On the plus-side, Cedric makes more than a couple vocal contributions on this record, he's always welcome voice on anything in my book. Because of that, I would suggest this is one of the first if not the first Omar solo record a Volta fan indulges in, since its not a very long shot from what'd you'd expect with them, although more toned down and is more straight forward rock; like a non-metal Bedlam in some ways, which is how I refer to the Bedlam, as the Volta's take on a metal record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust Mop heads","review":"I thought I was getting the Bona brand mop head.

We bought a Bunn commercial-grade coffee-maker and to complete the project I needed two airpots. I selected the Zojirushi airpots because of the high ratings here on Amazon. My choice was further supported by local coffee roasters who provide our office with coffee. Unfortunately the Zojirushi airpots were so poorly packaged that the interior glass lining shattered in transit. I opened the Amazon box and the moment I lifted the airpot boxes I could hear the tell-tale tinkling of glass shards. Because I was working on a deadline and I needed the airpots ASAP I just I bought 2-1/2 Liter Peacock Airpots directly from the coffee roaster.

The book overwhelmingly uses melodies for learning, as opposed to chords. In fact, chords basically get only a brief mention at the end of the book. I'm sure this is because the mandolin does often carry the melody, but I was surprised, because Bay's \\"You Can Teach Yourself Mandolin\\" video begins with, you guessed it, chords. This book will improve your note reading abilities, as tablature is rarely used. A CD would be very helpful for hearing the pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classical","review":"This course is meant for the lover of classical music. It starts with explaining the classical music notation. This increases the difficulty for beginners: you have to learn the classical notation and also learn to play the mandolin.

We get a little exercise singing and dancing to the songs, and my kids learn about sharing at the same time.Mandy Patinkin, who also stars in A Princess Bride as the person looking for the six-fingered man, does a wonderful job playing the mean-old Huxley. I love the eyebrows! As the bugs suggest, he might want to take a weed wacker to them.An equally well-done Sesame Street movie similar to this one is Follow That Bird. If you like this movie, you will probably like that one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"this movie was great, my son of 2 loves it very much and it was very entertaining to even my husband and myself"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for the very young","review":"We bought this video because my 2 and a half year old is a huge Elmo fan. The opening song, \\"together forever\\" is great as is the scene in the laundrymat, ala STOMP. But then my son gets completely turned off. In fact when Elmo gets sucked into Grouchland, my son got scared. The bad guy is really mean to Elmo and we never get past the first 10 minutes or so of this movie before my son leaves the room. What a disappointment. I think that this is a movie for older children, unlike most of the other Sesame DVDs that we have. As I read other reviews, the very positive ones are from older kids. We will see if my son changes his mind when he is a bit older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed with Caution","review":"Our 16 month old son loves \\"The Best of Elmo\\" and whenever Elmo is on Sesame Street he tunes right in. We bought this DVD with high anticipation and ended up returning it.He had ZERO interest in this video, and neither did his parents. He may have been too young for this particular Elmo DVD, which is why I suggest you proceed with caution. In my opinion, it's for ages 3+ and maybe 4+."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 17 Month Old Cried!! :(","review":"We popped this movie in and my little guy sat down to watch it... he usually doesn't sit still for more than a few minutes of television - but he loves Elmo, so he sat and watched until the Mean Huxley took Elmo's Blanket. At this point he broke out into tears - He's only 17 months... but I would guess many children could react this way. I had to fast forward the movie to the part where Elmo got his blanket back before he stopped crying. Now he asks to take HIS blanket out of his crib when he gets up - he never did this before watching the movie.I don't reccommend it to little ones who might get frightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becareful! May not be suitable for toddlers.","review":"I thought this movie would be a lot of fun for my 2 year old who loves Elmo. I was having fun watching it in the beginning, and wish I could have seen the entire movie. However, about 15 minutes through Elmo encounters a \\"scary\\" helicoptor, and a villian who takes away his blanket. My daughter burst into tears. I could only console her by skipping to the end to show that Elmo got his blanket back. Two weeks after viewing she is still talking about the scary helicoptor and mean man. She, of course, would not let me put the movie in again, no matter how I assured her it was just silly and not scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scary for some children","review":"I bought this movie for my daughter when she was 2 1/2. She has always loved Elmo. We did not make it through the first few minutes because she was in hysterics when elmo was loosing his blanket. I recently tried it again now that she is 4 and she still can't handle the stress of this movie. I think that she just identifies with Elmo so much and she is just so worried about him. She litterly sobbed and called out Elmo's name. I am sure it is fine for some kids... but not if your child is very sensitive like mine. I will be giving this movie away. She has never had a reaction like this to any other movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good kids movie!!","review":"I watch this movie with my younger brother and I saw a man half naked stealing little kids toys. This movie teaches kids to spit,steal,and fight. They also put all Elmos friends in jail for asking for help. It showed a man touching things that belonged to other people and saying they were now his. When I was little I walked out of theater crying. I would not recommened this to kids of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty, Gross Out \\"Humor\\" Avoid.","review":"This movie is full of disgusting belching and farting, a queen actting like she's having an orgasm when the audience goes 'pplllhh' and more. If you are okay with your child watching this, by all means buy it. I'll have to admitt my 20 month old liked this movie, but Im affraid it is going to 'get lost' somewhere. A shame too, as the movie starts out really cute. It is IMHO an insult to the previous muppet movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"yonnie loves this movie","review":"I choose this movie because of my grandson.

Elmo loves his blanket and wants it all to himself. He gets separated from it and then pursues his blanket into Grouchland where he encounters selfish Huxley who also loves Elmo's blanket.

He has hours of fun with it. I would purchase more in the future.Cindy D"},{"rating":"2","title":"15 month old loves it","review":"I've read other reviews and, yes, the garbage queen does get to excited by \\"rasberries.\\" I blame that on bad direction and I really don't think it's suppose to be inappropriate, nor do I think it will scar my child. The movie does a good job of slowing things down when they may be getting too intense (enter Bert and Ernie). Also, Elmo is quick to realize that new situations might be suprising at first but soon learns it's fun. He does far more laughing at new adventures than screaming. My child loves this movie and I think it's appropriate. Compared to a Disney movie (Nemo comes to mind), this is far more gentle and encouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son and I love this move","review":"I find it odd that there are even 1 star reviews for this wonderful movie! It's easy for my son to watch and I don't find annoying after watching it 3 times in one day. The songs are wonderful. The length of time is perfect. And the story behind it is perfect because my three year old is having sharing issues. I love the actors as well and my son loves to watch this first thing in the morning. I am so happy to have found this movie at the grocery store for only a few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my 2 year olds favorites","review":"We had received this DVD as a gift when my daughter was around 18 mos. old, at that time she was a bit too young for it and it wouldn't hold her attention. Right around the 2 year old mark, we tried it again and she LOVED it. She must've watched this DVD everyday for about a month, she's a bit older now and it's no longer her favorite but every once in awhile she'll still ask for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good DVD","review":"This is a fun film to watch even if you aren't wearing diapers while you do. I bought this for my daughter and if it were VHS it would have been eaten by the VCR by now because it has been played so much.Kids love Elmo, and rightfully so. Elmo is pretty cool, especially if you are under 5 years old. However, adults can enjoy this film too. The Sesame Street characters are in their best form, and there are enough subtle adult jokes to keep you giggling.The only reason I don't give Elmo 5 stars is that the film is in Pan And Scan and is not available widescreen. My daughter watches Muppets from Space and Stuart Little widescreen, so I am not sure why Elmo isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"Our 2 year-old daughter adores Elmo like just about every other toddler I know. This movie is fun for any Elmo fan and our daughter enjoys it quite a bit. I must say, however, that I don't feel the film is quite up to the high standard of the best Sesame Street work. \\"Elmo Saves Christmas\\", for example, is more entertaining and well-written. And the songs in \\"Grouchland\\" aren't particularly memorable or touching like the earlier Sesame classics of Joe Raposo, etc. The film is, however, better than 99 percent of the children's videos out there and I'd definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a winner in our house.","review":"My 3 year old son likes Elmo but, he absolutely hates this video. When he asks to watch a video, he specifically states, \\"but not Grouchland.\\" His Mother and I found it to be mildly entertaining for adults (unlike that horrible Thomas and the Magic Railroad which, of course, my son loves). Maybe, as he gets older, he will like it. That is, if he will ever let us put it on again."},{"rating":"1","title":"too scarey for a 1yr old","review":"I should have watched this first before popping it into the car dvd player...about 15-20 minutes into it she started crying and saying NO NO ELMO NO!

We have a couple other Elmo videos that we love, not this one though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your kids will cry","review":"2 of my kids watched this. my daughter is 2 and my son is 5. they both cried hysterically when elmo lost his blankie. it's too traumatic for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Elmo, hate this movie","review":"My 2 year old adores Elmo but gets bored with this movie after just a few minutes. I can't stand it either. We've tried to watch it more than once and still don't know if Elmo ever gets his blanket back because it's so boring we can't finish it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mean-spirited messages for young children","review":"Just past Sesame Street is a world of garbage, jails, peril and fear. Elmo searches for his beloved blankie in a hostile land ruled by a sadistic adult who delights in his misery. Despite feeble attempts to reassure its innocent audience, this movie is essentially abusive even to kids who may enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Scary!! (even for brave kids)","review":"This video was purchased for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas by his Grandma. She even bought a VHS version for her house so he could watch it at either place. The sole reason she selected this video was because of the title character. Yes, my son is a full fledged member of the ELMO fan club, like many children his age are. We soon found out that Grandma wasted her money...BIG TIME. The movie is a bit strange to say the least, and a little on the psychadelic side. The most disturbing part is when the \\"evil\\" character arrives in Grouchland via helicopter. This is when my son BEGS me to turn it off and says \\"It scares me, mommy.\\" (while covering his ears) It didn't take us long to figure out that this was not the video for him!! It was heartbreaking when I saw the fear in his little face. With the typical daredevil little boy personality, we were surprised at his reaction and both Grandma and I wished we had previewed the video before we let him watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This is the best Elmo DVD Movie I have seen yet. My two year old and I watch it at least once a day. She has started to memorize some of the movie and is trying to sing some of the songs. It is a really great movie! I have just ordered CinderElmo and Elmo Saves X-Mas hoping that they are as good as this one. I really don't think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT movie","review":"We have enjoyed this movie as a family and I just orderd this along iwth a blue blanket for my youngest nephew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Community and cooperation","review":"Children absorb and learn values and behaviors from many sources as they enter into the larger world. This delightful adventure teaches Elmo the importance of sharing, community, cooperation, and friendships. He navigates his way through scary and unfamiliar territory gathering a cohort of new friends who overcome a selfish person. Because the content might frighten some children, Bert and Ernie occasionally interrupt the action to talk about possible fears. I began watching this story with my nephew when he was not quite three. It remained his favorite for several years. Familiarity with Sesame Street, although not essential, is helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad moral","review":"Who doesn't love Elmo?! Everyone loves Elmo. Well, As a parent, I saw a selfish Elmo that cared only for himself and hurt others and cause much pain. This is a terrible movie for kids to learn from. No one even addressed the selfishness that got Elmo in grouchland in the first place. Not a good thing for kids to watch. Poor movie from Sesame Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down!","review":"I bought this movie for my 3 yr old son with high expectations. We love Elmo! Well, the whole blankie thing didn't go over very well and caused tons of 'blankie problems'. I found it very loud too. I didn't think it was the best 3 yr. old Elmo flick. Maybe for a little older age. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie for toddlers","review":"My 2 year old loved this movie when we got it for him. He still loves it to date and cries to watch it. Ever since he claims everything to be his, he uses the words mine, me, I a lot. There are also other words that he learned from the movie, like greedy, stupid and more. I do not think that this is the best movie for a little child. I read some reviews of kids who got scared and upset for elmo losing his blankie. My son is almost 2.5 years and I am trying hard to get the idea of \\"Mine\\" out of his head, he wants everything to be his own, funny but frustrating sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I Thought About Elmo in Grouchland","review":"It was the worst movie I had ever seen in my life. I saw it at the movies with a friend and my mom. It was so bad that we left before it was even half over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't make it through 10 minutes","review":"My two year old son is an avid Elmo watcher. He can't get enough of the furry red guy. This movie seemed like a natural to add to our growing DVD children's collection. That's why I was completely shocked that my son was \\"traumatized\\" by this story. Elmo's blanket gets torn when he is reluctant to share with his friend. This scene sent my son into hysterics. Elmo's blankie happened to look exactly like my son's and we had to locate his blankie and make sure it was okay. Once he was calmed down I continued the movie. The following scene shows Elmo's blanket falling into Oscar's can and subsequently being sucked through a \\"do not open\\" door. My normally outgoing, and well adjusted son broke into shrieks once again. That's where we ended the movie. My son has no attachment to a bottle or pacifier, but he loves his blankie. The content of this movie may be too upsetting for a child with a similar love object."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"My Daughter may need therapy after viewing this hectic mess! I am being facetious but, she is almost two years old and one of her first words was Elmo. After seeing him mad, falling down, and yelling at his friends, we had to play an Elmo music DVD to ensure that he was OK. I do not recommend this for young children, especially those who live in homes where chaos is not the norm. She simply was not used to all the activity displayed here. My Daughter is not timid - she is quite the opposite but, she would cry out Elmo's name at every scene that showed Elmo in a compromising situation, not knowing if he was upset or hurt. Actually, I'm not sure if this film is good for older children either, based on what I've seen. 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmo Rules!","review":"I am the mother of an 18-month-old daughter who is an absolute Elmo nut! We saw this movie in the theater and it was the first time she has sat still for more than five minutes since she was a very small baby. She hardly even blinked during the entire 73 minutes of the movie. Excellent movie and I would recommend it to all parents of children who love Elmo."},{"rating":"2","title":"More for older children!","review":"My 11 month old got this DVD when she was 8 months old. She loves to watch Sesame Street and started really being interested in watching these types of programs around 7 months of age. We have bought many different DVD's (123 Count with me... Do the Alphabet) and she really likes them. But she still seems to lose interest in this one almost from the start. I think it is ment for children that are at least 4 years old and up it is more like a movie then a 1/2 hour program! I know she will grow into it but I would not recommend it for very young kids"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining and teaches children to share","review":"My 16-month-old son has been addicted to this movie since I purchased it 3 weeks ago. He will ask for it and will watch it several times a day if I let him. I love to watch him watch the movie & see his face light up when his favorite parts are on. He enjoys the musical numbers which, with Vanessa Williams and Mandy Patinkin performing, are absolutely top-notch.The \\"moral lesson\\" in this movie is the importance of sharing and not being selfish. My son is an only child so sharing isn't high on his priority list. It might just be hopeful thinking on my part but I do believe he has gotten better at sharing since he started watching this movie.I don't find the movie annoying in the least like many other children's videos/shows. And, while I don't condone using the TV as a babysitter, when there's something I absolutely have to get done around the house, I can ask him if he wants to watch Elmo and he will RUN to the sofa & not move while it's playing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Together Forever","review":"What a movie! What a monster! I tell you, you've got to love that Elmo; he's sooo cute! So what if I am a 16 y/o male, that doesn't mean you can't stop loving kids stuff. Elmo and Big Bird are two of my favorite characters on Sesame Street. Mandy Patinkin, I feel, did a great job in this movie as Huxley. And Vanessa Williams... whoo! She needs no introduction. She was wonderful as the Queen of Trash. This is truly a movie that I would treasure forever. If you weren't able to see it in the theater, don't be sad. THE ADVENTURES OF ELMO IN GROUCHLAND is coming to video, so miss out on a copy.\\"Together Forever, The World Seems Fine. We Never Would Ever Leave You Behind.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Inappropriate for Elmo Crowd - Stay Away!","review":"I rented this for my 4 year old based on other Elmo videos he had enjoyed. Bad move! Other parents, beware!This movie takes a main character aimed at 4 year olds and plunks him down in a script aimed squarely at 8 or 9 year olds, full of very scary situations and offensive language. My son was frightened by many scenes, including ones where the villain stole Elmo's blanket, mocked him, locked him in a dark cave, etc., for what would have been almost an hour of scary, unfunny storyline if I hadn't fast-forwarded to the end.I think the editors realized the issue, because they have Bert and Ernie as \\"audience\\" interrupt multiple times to say not to worry, that Elmo is going to be OK... which did not work at all with my son.Very disappointing considering how wonderful the rest of the Sesame Street videos are. I'd rate it minus stars if Amazon allowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"My son loves, Elmo. This is my second purchase of this dvd.

I was a little leery in regards to the gore and violence portrayed in the preview. What I found in this film was so much more. There are many interesting aspects and dynamics in this film. I typically cringe at any acts of violence, but the revenge at the end of the film was quite sweet. It's been a while since I have seen a film that kept me on the edge of my seat. Great complexity, great acting and great writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really kind of silly","review":"I'm really surprised at the reviews that take so much time to analyze this film - character development, plot devices, etc. All I could come out with is \\"where is Alexander's southern accent?\\" I understand that he's Swedish and does a rockin' mid-west American no accent accent. But I'm from Georgia. I know that if you're that deep in South, you're gonna have an accent. Spoilers! And what's this crap about you don't understand southern daddies and southern daughters. Of course she'd know how to shoot a gun. And clean a gun. And take one apart and put it back together. Good grief.

It is full of idiotic elements. For example, the \\"hunters\\" go deer hunting at noon, by strolling casually around through the woods, looking for bucks that just stand around, waiting to be shot. The sheriff asks for the \\"registration\\"--for a hunting rifle?, in Mississippi?? The evil rednecks spend their time cruising around, standing in the bed of a pickup truck, with deer horns on the grill, of course. I loved the car that explodes in a huge ball of fire, after being hit by a single bullet (I guess from an RPG launcher that looks like a rifle). Obviously the makers of this silly movie are clueless about the South, guns, and hunting, and probably are as wimpy as the title character. Too bad the Marsden character wasn't the one to get a bear trap on the head. This movie does a great disservice to the Dustin Hoffman original. Forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Killing of another Classic","review":"I don't know what's worse : being forced to watch this movie without the possibility of fast forwarding (I saw it in theater), or being forced to watch it, while thinking of the original one...

I don't know why... but they do. Hollywood portrays southerners as ignorant, stupid, racist, murderous, gang-rapists, no less. I wonder if Hollywood had tried to malign some other group particularly a minority group, with the same wanton maliciousness and vengeance it uses to malign southerners, if this movie would be tolerated and its creators not ostracized and pilloried?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Brake for Remakes","review":"Add \\"Straw Dogs\\" to the list of films remade by Hollywood in an effort to -- well, make more money off a known commodity.This film represents an earnest effort, I guess, and one can appreciate the idea of moving the class warfare from England to America's Bayou Country.Unfortunately, James Marsden is no Dustin Hoffman, and director Rod Lurie is no Sam Peckinpah. The only person who brings anything noteworthy to this new effort is the explosive and ever watchable James Woods, playing an angry and alcoholic Southern football coach whose daughter winds up being the victim of a developmentally challenged young man.\\"Straw Dogs\\" is a powerful drama, to be sure, an inflammatory mix of violence, sex, and conflict between a community and its \\"others,\\" but it was made in 1971 by Sam Peckinpah, and that is the version you should see.

I was surprised by how good it was. Friends with me also enjoyed seeing this film. Solid thriller type of story with a couple better than average acting performances from James Woods, Alexander Skarsgard, Dom Purcell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit on the convoluted side","review":"For me this version didn't compare favorably to the original. Beware: Spoiler ahead... What really bothered me about this movie was Kate Bosworth's character's behavior. First off, exposing herself to the rednecks didn't make much sense. Her not telling her husband about the rapes. And immediately after being raped insisting on going to the ballgame..because \\"that's what they do in this town\\"??? Absolutely made no sense to me. She would have been completely traumatized and would have insisted on getting the hell out of there as soon as possible....AFTER reporting their crimes to authorities. Just didn't ring true for me.Then there was that side story of the retarded man. It was unnecessary, thus for me, made the entire build up in the tension unplausible. The problems leading to the climax didn't even involve the main characters. And did I miss it or what happened to the retarded man?Oh well, those are my two cents for what they are worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic - Every Left Wing Stereotype of the South You Can Imagine","review":"I guess if you're from the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Brookline, MA or Berkley, CA, you may like this movie because it will confirm every negative stereotype you've ever had about Southerners. Guns and hunting? Bad. Southerners? Stupid, lazy, hillbilly, redneck racists who drink excessively, attack women and children, kill black sheriffs, and even have the audacity to be skeptical of global warming! Yes, there's a global warming line!The person who wrote the screenplay for this film, and those persons who were responsible for making it have all the subtlety and intelligence of slugs.If you watch this film and ask for your 90 minutes back, don't blame the folks who gave it a 1-star review here."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked this movie","review":"this movie was very good.it had several twists and turns.i do how ever like alexander skarsgard better as eric in true blood.being a vampire suits him better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"If you want to watch Straw Dogs, watch the original.

Shame on James and Kate for being in such a degrading and horrific production!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stray Dogs","review":"Sorry, but this isn't a patch on the original. I had at least some hopes for this but very little paid off. I suppose if your idea of red neck culture is to combine football, religion, sex, and hunting, this may be your film, but it just doesn't have anything new to say and the impact of the sex and violence in the original far exceeds anything in this. There's a reason this didn't do all that much box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Turgid Remake","review":"This is one of those movies where you keep thinking, \\"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon\\" Long, slow, boring build-up to an unsatisfactory jump-cut violent revenge conclusion. The original Straw Dogs was sensational for its time, but now it's dated.The acting here is phoned in. There is absolutely no chemistry between Marsden and Bosworth. Alexander Sarsgard tries his best to carry the movie, but he can't manage it all on his own. And it's sad to see the great James Woods chewing up the scenery as a drunken, crazed, over-the-hill high-school football coach.The whole point of Straw Dogs is supposed to be the gory climax, but even here, the film falls short. If you want to see a really compelling revenge movie, rent \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"The story line started off interesting but later turned into a story about lies and secrets. There was no real grounds for the start of the movie just the assumption that Kate Bosworth returned home with her new husband. It was obvious that she left for some reason in the first place. She appeared to tempt the men sexually. Later two the men returned to rape her which was an unexpected event to the audience. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring as fok","review":"this movie is boring as fok. the action took the entire movie to arrive. total dissapointement i did not like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your precious time","review":"I am sorry Kate Bosworth has to be a part of this film - what a train wreck.

Save your money and watch the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly violent","review":"I guess this 2011 film has an antecedent in the old days and is some sort of update, but even so, why is this form of ultra violence considered entertainment for modern day human beings? What is the redeeming social value here? This is kind of a mishmash of the usual hillbilly redneck violence crossed with unsuspecting snobs from the big city. The results are sadistic and almost unwatchable at times. The grand finale is the expected blood bath you know is coming almost from the first frame. Kate Bosworth alone makes it unclear where she is going, seeming at times to despise her educated Hollywood hubby and still crave the attention of her Neanderthalic high school quarterback boyfriend.

Stick with 32-bit","review":"I don't know why these types of cards are still on the market--they are old, slow, and obsolete. Instead, search for 32-bit Cardbus adapters such as the ones made by Viking, Delkin, or Lexar, which are many times faster but not much more expensive. And, they fit in the same PC card slot on most laptops made in the last decade. The 32-bit cards I have used are even a bit faster than USB 2.0 and Firewire.You can spot 32-bit cards by the gold strip at the top of the card. No gold strip? Then prepare to wait an hour or more for your data to transfer, while your laptop is brought to its knees. The old silver cards may be fine for storing and playing mp3s, or may be needed for laptops made more than 10 years ago, but any large amount of data--such as GBs of photos or video-- will take quite a while to copy over.

The reason for doing so -- yes, I admit it was rather warped logic, if even logic at all -- was that once I had all those accessories, I just would feel forced to buy the new saw. You can see the duality, right? Part of me wanted that saw BAD, and part of me did not want to spend the money.Anyway, once I purchased the saw (see my review elsewhere on Amazon.com), I installed the dust collector bag and started using it. Before too long it developed a tear that grew increasingly larger. Because this saw is advertised as being a contractor's tool, then it should be of a quality to support that. Not just the saw, but its accessories should be, too. A heavier gauge fabric or a different material altogether for this bag would have been appropriate. Sorry Bosch, I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's designed to do.","review":"Here's the deal, this is a table saw. It makes sawdust. The hole on the back by the power cord is a sawdust exhaust port. If you have a dust collector, by all means plug a vacuum hose into that port and it may even collect all the dust. I do not have a dust collector, this means the exhaust port throws sawdust a good 7 feet or so out the back of the saw. Adding this collector bag now means I only have to sweep up directly under the saw, not under the saw and an arc 7 feet out away from the saw. To me it's absolutely worth it, but it won't replace a several hundred or thousand dollar dust collection system."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very effective as a dust collector","review":"I picked up this bag when I purchased the Bosch 4000 table saw. I was hoping to avoid using a vaccuum attachment on the job site. I quickly found that if I was serious about containing saw dust, I had to ditch this collection bag. It collected maybe half the dust, if that. If you have the power to run both the saw and a vaccuum attachment, do it, and leave the bag for when you can work outside or you can unplug the saw and vaccuum up the mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I bother?","review":"Don't do it!

This bag, instead of collecting dust, impedes the flow of waste material and makes more of a mess in the shop than running the saw without the bag. It will collect some material, but far more material is blown up from the saw and into the work space when the bag is attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch Bag","review":"Simple to put on.

This dust collection bag only captures 50% or less of the dust coming off the Bosch table saw. It's not really worth the money. The table saw just doesn't build up enough air pressure to force much of the dust into the bag.A much better, although more expensive, solution is a shop vacuum connected toThe Dust Deputy($89.99) and aniVac Automated Vacuum Switch($48.95) (both sold on Amazon).The Dust Deputycaptures about 99% of the stuff that normally goes into the vacuum which saves on filters or frequent messy emptying, and theiVac Automated Vacuum Switchlets you simply turn on the saw so that the vacuum turns on and off automatically.

Bag will clog if cutting wet material. bag lays on ground, so if ground is wet, it's a mess.

Clean up is a requirement and I was hoping this bag would at least help with containing the pile of sawdust that my bosch table creates. It does not. In fact, the bag will catch about a 1/3 or less and then because you have covered the exhaust hole, the sawdust will then blow back thru the blade opening into your face, even with the blade barely exposed over your material. This blow back of course causes a dust cloud around the saw. Its faster to clean up a large pile of sawdust on the ground from the exhaust hole than cleaning up a 5' area all around the saw from that dust cloud created by using the bag. It looks nice and is big enough, but doesnt do the job at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money & just hook your shop vac up","review":"While a great concept, this dust collection bag proved of little worth to my dust collection efforts.

The Bosch table saw that the bag attaches to is great, the bag is not! When ripping a 2 X 4 the chips just plug up in the bottom of the saw as there is not enough flow into the bag. The bag also plugged up at the next job when I was just doing general cross cut work in poplar and oak. Probably need to purchase one of those canister type dust collectors. Save your money and dont buy this Bosch accessory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the $10","review":"i thought i would use this for the small quick cuts but once you attach the bag, the saw blows the chips into the bag (ok so far) BUT the pressure that builds up because the air doesnt escape out of the bag as fast as it is blown in causes the chips to blow back up through the saw blade opening right into your face (and all around you too). i measured the dust i had to clean up vs the dust collected and it did seem to get about 50% of the sawdust (very rough/unscientific measurement) but at that point i had to go through the exact same amount of effort to clean up the dust that blew out of the machine.not worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Addition","review":"I have looked at these bags for years and never pulled the trigger to get one. Yeah it doesn't work like a full dust collector but being a contractor and knowing the mess that a table saw makes in someones driveway, this is worth it. It doesn't get all of the dust but it really helps with the mounds of dust that can be created in a day of ripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bag Works as Expected","review":"This is a simple bag that's about 12\\" by 30\\" inches or so with a wire clip that goes around the dust port. It works pretty well in that everything expelled from the dust port goes into the bag, which is emptied by just shaking the sawdust out through the same opening.All together it catches about 80 percent of the sawdust - about what one would expect. The cloth is a thin synthetic and there is no zipper or velcro to make it easier to empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Not worth the price you ask? It's only $11.00. True. Don't waste your $11.00. Instead plug a shop vac into the exhaust port of the table saw. The small exhaust port gets jammed easily and if that happens, forget collecting any dust in the bag. If the exhaust port stays clear, then I'd say I collect about 10% of the dust produced. Especially with MDF. What a mess!! I built a moble stand for the saw and folding stand so I push the whole thing out into the drive way and use it out there because of the mess it makes inside the garage.The saw is great and I'm very happy with it. I gave it 4 or 5 five stars in my review of the saw itself. But this collection bag is pointless. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.Until I get my dust collector for all my tools, I use this bag on my DeWalt 2-speed planer where it works great. I empty it frequently, but that's a planer for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Three","review":"The 4000K must rank way up there with the world's greatest sawdust dispersing tools. My Dust Collector was tried and failed. It is now gathering dust (pun intended). It is a nice thing to look at and seems to fit OK, but you wouldn't want to depend on it. I can't be certain with actual efficiency rating, but I'd be shocked if you could prove it captured even half the sawdust. Get a REAL dust extractor with enough vacuum to suck the paint off the tablesaw stand, and you will be sure to collect 90% of the saw's by-product. The other 10% will be up your nose unless you wear a paper mask. :-) But real men eat sawdust, don't they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Sorry, First this bag is not as large as it looks, rather small in fact. In fact it doesn't look like the picture posted at all. It did come in a Bosh package but I can't immagine Bosch would put out this product. The sawdust gets clogged in the neck of the bag and the dust starts blowing back from the blade. I know it is difficult to collect sawdust from a table saw but this just isn't the solution. It can be a pain in the neck but just keep your shop vac attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"Like tits on a bull.

The Gospel of John was well directed, well photographed and presented God's Word with the honor and glory it deserves. The Acts of the Apostles was filmed very cheaply, the direction and the \\"special effects\\" were terrible, the acting was rotten. Too much added to the actual text. Using Luke to narrate the passages that the director did not want to shoot takes away from the power of the scriptures.The kids in my class spent more time giggling and laughing at what was shown on screen than learning God's Word. Hard to blame them though when the crowds presented act like they are in a Monte Python movie. The movie was intended to be an enrichment for our high school aged Bible study class. It was disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly directed presentation","review":"Very poorly directed.

Total flop. I looked around the room and not one of my students was engaged at all. I was so disappointed.I have no problem with the dialogue being verbatim with the NIV version of the Bible. In fact, I would prefer it that way. However, portions that were ripe for dramatization - e.g. the account of Ananias and Sapphira - were mundane, as they were dramatized only by Luke telling the story to others that were on a ship with him.I am sorry to say if you are looking to use this as an opportunity to see Scripture come to life after studying it - especially for teens - you should probably look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The acting is awful and will put one to sleep.

I was hoping for the recreation of the events of the book of Acts to be realistic enough to use it as a teaching tool. Unfortunately, the rather wooden acting by those playing the character parts dampened my desire to use it. The video does faithfully follow the NIV text which is helpful, but the unconvincing dialogue by actors renders it unusable as a tool to bring the text to life.

One beautiful afternoon, while reading it on my porch, I literally could not put it down. It could be a life changing book. I will be recommending this to my book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and educational","review":"As a 50ish woman who has dabbled with the self-sufficient life (organic farm with goats and all the rest of the critters in my mid 30's) I found this book extremely readable and thoughtworthy. Though I still expouse less consumerism here in an urban setting and as an environmentalist, I sometimes lose sight of my goals as the author does in Manhatten. I also liked her approach or what she learned from her friend Margaret - what she learned at the nubble, she could apply in all aspects of her life. And in all places, whether it is the city or the back country. On my book club list of must reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the TOP of my Favorites List!","review":"Not much to say here except that I loved this book from beginning to end and have since been on a quest for books just like it. If any one knows of others in this class, please point me to them.At midlife myself, I've treasured coming alongside Shulman through this more relaxed, quiet season of her life. I find she's still totally empowered as a woman, but in a completely different way - not the vocal feminist of younger years. A take-away quote from pg. 158 attributed to George Sands that's become one of my favorite is, \\"The day I buried my youth I became 20-years younger.\\" Good food for thought.After completing \\"Drinking the Rain\\" I found myself intersted in her homelife away from the beach so I quickly followed it up with her \\"To Love What Is\\", another book I enjoyed but for different reasons.I wouldn't sell my copy of Drinking for any price. Merely seeing it rest on my nightstand fills me with hope and reassurance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time","review":"This book drones on and on about eating plants and clams from nature. The author seems to think that because she was a feminist activist she made some significant world contribution. She must repeat her feminist affiliation a dozen times. By the time you get 40-50 pages into the book you start praying it will get better. Huge paragraphs of lists of wild plants that she eats on an island off the coast of Maine. About as exciting to read as an ancestral tree. 100 pages later no improvement. People get directed to this book searching for meaning in midlife, age group 40-55. Save your time. This is a snore. Time better used: \\"The Art of Effortless Living\\" by Ingrid Bacci."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!","review":"Drinking the Rain did not leave me thirsting for more. Alix Shulman's subtle male-bashing and her forlorn nostalgia for the \\"failed\\" women's movement tarnished this book. Her quest for solitude did not leave her with an epiphany or any great enlightenment. She remained, at book's end, not very much different from the middle-aged woman who journeys to a remote island in Maine to lead a rustic, uncomplicated life. For this she is to admired; no running water, no electricity, a cantankerous gas-fueled refrigerator and a autodidactic living off the land (and sea). She never reaches Gurdieff's \\"long thought\\". Shulman hides from the reader, offering somewhat brittle comments in lieu of insight. Her record as an \\"activist\\" has given that word a new definition, \\"someone who feels passionately about a subject, talks it to death and ultimately does nothing about it.\\" Shulman seems incapable of taking the truly courageous next step, which is to tell us what she's learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is sort of disappointing","review":"There are not that many pictures and it doesnt really tell me anything I couldn't have found out on the internet. It is 256 pages, but it's BIG print and a lot of it is Episode guide stuff. I was unhappy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a cash-in book","review":"This has been on my shelf for a long time - probably bought it when new (or near-new, it has a remainder mark), finally got around to reading it. Half-decent profile of Gellar & Whedon, poor profiles of the rest of the cast, middling episode guide. The author gets annoyed whenever an episode resembles the X-Files (these are usually due to foreshadowing for season 3's big bad, The Mayor, which hadn't aired at the time). As noted in other reviews, back third is mostly profiles of other shows and movies that starred vampires, which is of only minor interest. Cash-in book; hope someone made a bunch of money to justify its existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clip job, all filler.","review":"It's a good thing this book is out of print. It's pretty bad - full of innaccuracies and it reads like the author assembled a lot of the information from bits and pieces of magazine articles. Also, fully a quarter of it has nothing to do with Buffy at all. It feels like the author ran out of relevant material and just added in a bunch of junk to fill it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for all Buffy fans","review":"This book does, in a great way sum up all episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer from \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" too \\"Becoming, part II\\". Also, it contains a thorough biography of mrs. Gellar's acting career from her first appearance on \\"Invasion of Privacy\\" to todays Buffy, I Know What You did Last Summer and \\"Scream 2\\". In doing so it gives all Sarah Michelle Gellar fans all the knowledge they need aout their Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book was alright","review":"This wasn't the best buffy book, but it did have some picturesi've never seen before and it had an okay biography on Sarah. thebaack of the book is all about ohter vampire and sci-fi books and shows though, i didnt even read that whole part, it sucked. but the rest of the book was pretty cool, since it was about the hottest woman on Earth of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest rock and roll album ever made","review":"okay, so here goes. Dillinger Four have destroyed me with every single song they have ever put out. They never get boring, they never run out of clever ideas and somehow they seem to sound like a literal explosion of energy and passion on every note. Seriously, if you think you've heard something powerful by a punk band then pick this up, it'll knock you on your [behind]. Everything these guys have ever done was, is, and forever shall be part of the history of rock music, whether they ever get recognized for it or not. This band is almost TOO intense. I can't say enough about D4, really. This is their best, but get everything else too. You heard it here, kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Bought this album based on the strong showing on Rock Against Bush II. Too bad I cannot return it and get something else.The music is good enough, but the vocals are weak and completely masked by bad mixing. Sad, I like to hear what they are saying...Doubtful this will get much more play, after the 3 listens it has already gotten. If you want something really good, go get GC5 or the Hudson Falcons...Scott"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This cd is amazing, it blends catchy pop-punk with hardcore guitars and vocals. Every song on this cd is great. I have had this cd for a long time now and it still is played very frequently. I also like their new album just as much as i like this.

This is Wonderful!","review":"Mazzy Star's Hope Sandavol is sort of like a female Johnny Cash on some strange trippy drug. It is strange and wonderful music. \\"Among My Swan\\" is Mazzy Star's best and very solid all the way through. Great Stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"Among my swan is my favorite, Mazzy album aswell one of my all time favs.The album is a mix of dreamy and almost delusional vocals mumbling beautiful poetic lyrics and smooth smoky melodies that are hard to explain. their music is like a ghostly breeze that you can quite point out."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE PLAIN RECORDINGS 180g VINYL REISSUE","review":"This is a wonderful, tripped out album, one of my all-time favorites. But anyone looking for a copy on vinyl, I urge you to seek out an original pressing. Plain Recordings continue to churn out the most poorly pressed vinyl reissues ever -- I've seen 3 different copies of this particular album and they all had off-center holes, dents and bubbles in the vinyl, ridiculous amounts of surface noise from the first play, and dynamic ranges low enough to suggest they'd been mastered from 16-bit digital sources rather than the original analog tapes. Don't waste your money; avoid this pressing like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gloom without the doom","review":"I recently heard the last track on Mazzy Star's \\"Among My Swan,\\" the superbly sad \\"Look on Down From the Bridge,\\" used in a funeral scene on an episode of \\"The Sopranos\\" and was blown away by the perfect selection of imagery and music. \\"Bridge\\" is like much of the album, which establishes a somber and lonely mood early on and continues it throughout. Hope Sandoval's deep and emotive voice is perfect for the material, the best of which also includes \\"Cry, Cry,\\" \\"Flowers in December\\" and \\"Still Cold,\\" all of which sound exactly as you might expect they would from their titles. There's nothing apocalyptic about the gloom on this album, just a whole lot of sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other stuff to check out","review":"I am a huge fan of catchy, quiet yet melodic folk/pop. If you enjoy this album then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:1) What's Next To The Moon by Mark Kozelek2) Paper Dolls And Paper Plates by Fear Of Commitment3) So Tonight That I Might See by Mazz Star4) Songs About Leaving by Carissa's Wierd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among my favorites.","review":"I find all three Mazzy Star albums to be equally wonderful. \\"So Tonight That I May See\\" was their most popular, it's the one with \\"Fade Into You\\". Personally their debut \\"She Hangs Brightly\\" was always the best to me, but \\"Among My Swan\\" may change that. This album is so simultaneously morbid yet beautiful, it could almost bring a 33 year old guy to tears. If I had to suggest three albums for dark and rainy days, this would easily be one of them. The back cover photo even has an umbrella on it. I truly enjoy every track here, whether it's \\"Rhymes Of An Hour\\" or \\"Roseblood\\", they're all moving. Any or all of their albums I recommend. Hope Sandoval's solo album \\"Bavarian Fruit Bread\\" is a treasure as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decepcionante","review":"I had high hopes when I bought this CD; unfortunately, they weren't realized. I'm not familiar with Miguel Rios, but I like Ana Belen's singing, and I was hoping to hear some good Spanish versions of the Brecht/Weill songs. The adaptations of the texts aren't bad; it's the arrangements I can't abide - they all remind me of Bobby Darin's execrable, jazzy version of \\"Mack the Knife.\\" If you like that sort of thing, then this CD might be for you, but if you want to hear a good interpretation in the original spirit of Brecht and Weill, listen instead to Dagmar Krause's \\"Supply and Demand.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid double!","review":"Vladimir Ashkenazy has impressed me a lot with these recordings along with Scriabin's Sonatas. I think the highlights on this Chopin's collection are Sonatas 1,2,3 and the Fantasie in F minor more than 24 Etudes which are played greatly especially the Revolutionary (possibly one of the best i've ever listened to) though there are other pianist more impressive than Ashkenazy such as Boris Berezovsky, Juana Zayas, Nikolai Lugansky, Andrei Gavrilov and the young Jean Frederic Neuburger just to name a few. But the 3 Sonatas and the Fantasie are performend marvellously. Also the quality of the sound recording is really high. This is a splendid double!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 volume set to keep your coffee table from floating","review":"This is a 2 volume set of large (approx 8 x 10 x 1 each) books on Morgan Dollars in which mr Hager proposes a new grading standard for Morgan Dollars called 'Accugrade' It appears that 'Accugrade' never caught on with the general public as an 'Accugrade MS65' coin usually sells for MUCH less than a 'PCGS MS65 coin' to a knowledgable buyer.

I find that it does a poor job of keeping coffee warm after a couple hours, especially if you do not fill the bottle completely up to the top. After 6-8 hours, coffee takes on an odd taste.Though I prewarmed the bottle with hot tap water, the effectiveness of keeping coffee warm didn't change. If I have to preheat the bottle with boiling water, I'd be getting to the point of doing too much work to have warm coffee!!If you use the cap as a drinking cup, you'll lose heat as the pouring spout is made completely out of plastic. Warmth can be felt coming through the top of the bottle.The outside of the bottle does start to get warm after a while.The spout is neat, but is it really worth an additional $10-$20 over other types of vacuum bottles (e.g. thermos brand twist spout)? I'd say no.I recommend cheaper alternatives. Not happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit.","review":"This was a perfect fit on my 99 venture van.

I would have expected a few more tacks on a \\"best of\\" CD, but the ones they have are excellent.

Buy this if you are interested in getting a sample, and then search out their other albums, like TWICE SHY, the live album STAGE, and the acoustic SAIL AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger lurks","review":"This zero clearance insert is flimsy to the point of being dangerous. Particularly true if cutting anything narrow. The insert caves in against the blade, and it's just asking for trouble. Everything else I have ever used by Bosch -- including the table saw -- is amazingly superior to this piece of junk. It surprises me that they would compromise in so critical an area."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"The price is low, but I can't recommend it. The metal plates for the pawls to glide on fell off (one before it arrived), and the plastic is really flimsy. I bought a nice one from Woodcraft for several times the price, but it was well worth it. If you aren't sure you need a zero clearance insert, you can start with the Bosch, but you are better off applying the money to a good one. Making your own out of plywood is another option. I like the saw, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"zero clearance insert for Bosh table Saw","review":"I did not realize the insert was plastic. At times The insert can be partialy pushed up by the saw blade. The insert that came with the saw is made of metal or aluminum and has some weight to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero tolerance insert","review":"In my opinion, it is best to make your own zero tolerance plate out of some MDF or similar material.

It will work but is not what I was expecting when I ordered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great on big pieces, so so on small ones","review":"For pieces under 8\\", if you're pressing down on the workpiece, the zero-clearance insert has some give to it. It's just not sturdy enough to hold the piece up. For large pieces that are continuously also supported by the table, this is fine, but for small things, well, I've moved to using a table saw sled. At some point, I'll cut new zero clearance inserts out of hardwood; this is one of those things that's best done yourself, but if you don't have a thickness planer, this is certainly something to buy.Updating my review: this is a piece of crap. Make one yourself out of wood using the original as a template. I just wasted an hour of making a cutting board; the last pieces were a 2\\" wide rip, and the lack of support on the bottom caused the pieces to vibrate and be very miscut. *!@$!$!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch Insert","review":"This insert works ok but it does flex. If you are at the end of a board and cutting say a rabbet (where you don't cut all the way through the board) and you don't have the table on both sides of the insert to support the board when you press down the insert will deflect down and cause you to cut alittle deeper. Other than that it works ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the Bosch standard","review":"I own and use a number of Bosch tools and I've been thrilled with quality of construction and design in each of them (4000 table saw, bosch colt palm router, bosch 3/8\\" drill).Which is why I am completely surprised at the terrible quality of these insert plates. They are made of very thin, very flimsy plastic. If you push down on them they will bend. On thin workpieces this means your cut-line can get screwed up if you provide too much (and I'm not talking about a lot) downward pressure! For a product that is supposed to improve the quality of your cuts, these inserts are a failure.I would not buy these plates. If you need a zero clearance insert I think your best option is to make your own which is, unfortunately, rather difficult for this particular saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy...","review":"This was a waste of money. The plastic it's made from is cheap and flimsy. If you put any downward pressure on your material as you push it through the saw the insert deflects and your material gets caught on the lip between the table and the insert. Threw it right in the garbage and made my own from Baltic birch plywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"One accessory you can do without","review":"This zero clearance insert is made entirely of cheap thin plastic. It's nowhere near flat and flexes with the slightest pressure. When you talk about a zero clearance insert, you expect something that's flat and rigid. It is impossible to level the insert with the table because it is so flimsy and not flat to begin with. I don't know what they were thinking when they designed it...Or if they were thinking at all.Anyways, pass this one up. I'm very dissatisfied with it. It' s just plain useless. Don't get me wrong. I love my other Bosch tools. They're great but someone seriously dropped the ball on this one. I just hope that Bosch (or someone else) corrects the problem and makes a zero clearance insert that's worthy of their name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Bosch","review":"This thing is a toy. It has no place on a saw as well designed as the TS 4000.Pros- It is red.Cons-It is about as rigid as a blade of grass.It is molded from material that is about as thin as a blade of grass.It is impossible to make it level with your table because it flexes every time a board touches it.Every time my saw starts, it catches a tiny sliver of the insert edge.Bottom line- The best use for this thing might be as a template to make your own out of ply. Love my 4000. But, this insert is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"As stated in a few other reviews, a waste of money. Plastic is flexible and does not provide support for small pieces. Make you own from 1/4\\" plywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking support","review":"The insert is made of plastic and when you raise the blade to cut through the insert it cuts it in half leaving very little support when you run material over it. Because it's made of plastic it flexes downward as you run the material being cut over it. This item should be made of metal like the other inserts and have the plastic insert only where the blade comes through. This would provide for better support"},{"rating":"1","title":"No support","review":"It is easy enough to use, but i is made of thin plastic, which offers no suport once cut. It is impossible to level with the table due to the inherent flex in the material. You are better off making your own from wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"I love the saw (though I recommend replacing the stock blade immediately with a quality blade, try a Forrest Woodworker II, you'll think you were using a top-of-the-line cabinet saw), but this insert is a worthless piece of junk. Cheap, flexible plastic that doesn't stay flat and bends easily with any pressure on it. The support it provides is so flimsy I expect it crosses the line into dangerous. The saw is so great it really deserves to have respectable accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"This insert is supposed to minimize the blade clearance. It does do that. However when you start using it on a regular basis, you find the end of the insert bends downward depending on your material being cut, especially smaller material, resulting in uneven cuts. The adjustment screws do not compensate the leveling of the insert very well because the insert is not stiff or rigid! Hope Bosch changes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Useless","review":"It is a mystery to me, how Bosch can make such a fine table saw such as the 4100 and then come up with a POC like this insert. It is a flimsy thin piece that melts when you try to raise the blade to cut the kerf. It throws little melted chunks of red plastic all over the shop. If you try to use it as advertised it cracks. Save your money and buy the PW948 insert here on Amazon and sold by Peachtree for $16.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instructions should be better","review":"The product fits okay but is difficult to get flush with the table. This saw comes with a riving knife and (as I discovered) you have to remove it or move it out of the way in order to raise the blade to make the zero clearance insert. The instructions should have said this - in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this to cut small pieces of wood precisely. The deflection was a problem. The normal insert has some as well (but less) which complicates the squaring of the blade process. I had the trouble of the normal insert marking my wood with its red paint, so I thought this might be better. It's much flimsier and comes with mounting screws to keep it in place. (It doesn't pop in and out like the factory insert). I have a crap blade I use to cut normal wood and a nice Freud blade for my more delicate work. So the idea of having to add the extra steps to remove the plate (and find a philips head driver) to replace the blade just doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and \\"doughy\\" tasting","review":"I was extremely dissapointed in this item.

I like to dip my cookies in milk or a cup of tea and when you do, an awful lot of fat appears on the top of the liquid. You cant eat more than a couple of these without serious guilt.As you chew, a weird slimy texture coats your tongue. I wondered if i had bitten into a mollusc of some kind but its the xanthum gum. If you add too much, you are left with this weird unctuous shitake mushroom slug texture.

I used lock tite when assembling the saw which I hope will solve this problem. I looked the closely at the Dewalt, Bosch and Portet Cable all two to three hundred dollars more before buying this saw. I was disappointed with the use of plastic gearing and decided the Delta was a better value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend this saw based on 2-amp difference","review":"I bought the exact same saw except that it was a 13 amp (v. 15 amp) model, check out the specs. It felt cheap coming out of the box -- thin plastic everywhere they could put it, the guard fench (the only thing protecting you) is a miserable design which comes lose on a regular basis (you find yourself fighting to hold the saw together while you're cutting). Maybe some folks have found this to be an acceptable tool for the price, but I recommend against it. If you're not going to buy a replacement in the next 3 years, it is probably worth the extra $100 bucks to buy a brand that makes solid product. You'll end up using it much more instead of sadly reverting to your circular hand saw.In contrast with Delta's low end equiptment, I have had great experience with DeWalt and Makita models -- both are, however, in a slightly higher price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run now!","review":"I've had this machine for 3-years. Unless you just want to rip 2x4's for framing, run away from this purchase. The motor is good, but that's only positive bit of news about this saw.The miter slots are a joke. The included gauge has about 3/16\\" of slop in them, and no other gauges on the market fit it either. The throat plate stinks too. Forget making a zero-clearance insert, because the table top is so poorly designed that you can only use a steel throat plate. Plan on building sleds for any cross-cutting you want to do.Don't even get me started on the fence which I bent while bolting a sacrificial fence on it the very first day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"I bought this saw about 6 weeks ago to replace an ancient Craftsman. I wanted to use it a while before forming an opinion and my opinion is...spend the extra money and buy a real saw.This saw is basically a toy. It has a plastic housing and that right there should tell you about the quality. The fence is questionable at best, it doesn't stay where you lock it and it and the miter gauge doesn't even come close to fitting the slot. For [what I paid]I wasn't expecting a whole lot but just a little accuracy would've been nice. What a disappointing purchase. I guess in order to get a decent saw you need to spend at least twice the amount of this saw...now I just gotta find someone to buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a little more and get a good saw.","review":"I should have spent another 100 bucks and bought a better quality saw. No such thing as a bargin! The Delta 10\\" table saw is a poorly made product produced in Tiawan. Out of the box the blade needed adjustment. The adjustment mechanism is hard to reach. I had to max out the adjustment to square the blade. The table top does not have grooves or lines to align the fence. The fence moves a 1/16\\" when I tighten it. I have to measure from blade to fence for every cut. The motor vibrates when cutting any board thicker then 1 1/2\\" resulting in an uneven cut. Even if you're a beginner looking for an entry level saw...don't buy this saw. You'll be frustrated. A good carpenter doesn't blame his tools...but with this poorly designed and made saw I'll make an exception. I regret buying this saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"I've owned this saw for a year. The price of this saw is its main appeal. It's also portable.However, it has many drawbacks. The miter slot is loose and inaccurate. Attaching a wooden fence to the miter gauge amplifies the problem. The saw is very loud, you'll need ear plugs to use it for an extended period of time. The fence is quite poor, and pains must taken to ensure it's parallel to the blade after every adjustment. Ensuring the blade is parallel to the table is also a frequent activity, as it frequently moves after use. The blade guard is also lousy requiring, as with all other parts on this saw, frequent adjustment.Overall, this is a cheap saw that can be used with some success if you understand the limitations and have a lot of patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Up for a Contractor Saw!","review":"I initially gave this saw 5 stars. Not sure what I was smoking that day. After using this saw for about a month, I got so sick of the small table and terrible fence that I went out and purchased a contractor saw. It was the best decision that I made. I've been using it for over 6 months and love the size of the table. I lost about [price] selling this one used. I guess this one would be ok for the very occasional woodworker, but if you get addicted to wwing like me, then you will wish you had a bigger saw very quickly.

It does not have any chord progressions nor arpeggios, like most of the other Berlin School records have - just eerie notes with eerie, dissonant intervals. As there is basically no structure, the music should be very ambient in nature. Unfortunately it was not the type of ambient I was looking for (invigorating or relaxing).

It is bright red, making it easy to locate when you set it somewhere, and mine required no adjusting to make it flush with the saw table surface--it has four set screws to adjust the height. No one could beat Amazon's price of $9.74 and since I ordered it with the saw there were no taxes or shipping expenses. I ordered it on January 30, Amazon quoted a delivery by February 14, and I received it before February 10. This accessory works great and you really must have it if you are going to do any dado work with your Bosch saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bosch Dado Insert BAD FIT","review":"Unfortunatly this unit is slightly misformed.

Schreker isn't a well-known composer, and this certainly has much to do with growing anti-Semitism in Austria at the time. He is mostly known for his operas (like \\"Die Gezeichneten\\"), but this CD proves that he was also a gifted songwriter.Most of the songs address the subjects of love, love lost and death, especially the death of children, which calls Mahler to mind. Each song is carefully constructed in the manner of Schubert with the harmonic progressions typical of early German modernist composers.The audio quality is perfectly acceptable with both voice and piano coming through clearly.One of the CD's gems is \\"Das hungernde Kind,\\" based on a text from \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn,\\" a source that Mahler used very frequently.If you like the music of Gustav Mahler, Johannes Brahms, Franz Schubert and Alexander von Zemlinsky, I thoroughly recommend this CD.

This book is the least erotic book I have ever read. One reviewer said it took a day and a half to read. Is that person learning disabled? This book is short and BORING. Absolutely nothing erotic about it. The sex scenes were practically clinical in their descriptions. \\"She had three orgasms.\\" What a joke!!!! I would never buy another book by this author.

I have had conversations with people about said book and truly believe girls who are sluts, but some one you can bring home to mom, would save numerous marriages. Not to be hypocritical, but if guys acted this way a bit it would probably make things better in a relationship.I highly recommend this smart and erotic smut for any one who enjoys new and exciting stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Enough said.","review":"First off, this book is small. Its not a novel by any means, and I finished reading it (I finish what I start, but wish I wouldnt have here) in about an hour. All of the characters are of course \\"Gorgeous\\" and men \\"huge\\" etc. THe main character gets put through all the paces, starting off with a lesbian scenario, then a \\"hugely endowed\\" stranger, then an interacial gang rape, then a bukkake, then a mystery party etc etc etc. It seems like the writer threw in one idea to make sure any reader was happy (at least once). So if you want a lesbian scene- you got one. If you like interracial-you got one. But again, everyone is built perfectly and the men are oversized. All I can say is it bored me to tears, did not turn me on at all, and seemed written just to cover any angle a reader may like.

This book is little more than a re-write of the manual, and is a waste of money.Worse, it isn't even a good re-write. The book suffers from a problem that too many software books have: it assumes that the reader has never seen a modern piece of software. Does anyone *really* need instruction on \\"Navigating the Menu Bar\\"? (pp. 29 - 42) If you need to be told how to open and close files with the file menu, you're already way out of your league and need to get a basic Windows/MacOS book. The first 100 pages of the book are so much wasted paper.Unfortunately, the subsequent 500 pages aren't much better. Instructions are poorly designed and disjointed -- and there are errors throughout the book.

This truly is a feminine art and Ms. Mor conveys its spirit beautifully. Buy it and you will refer to it again and again even when you move into intermediate status, as a basic refresher.

This is pure magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Indeed","review":"\\"Heyday\\" has been one of my favourite albums for at least seventeen years now. It's an album of rich, shimmering images, conveyed on music that is at once complex, elegant, and mesmerising. \\"Heyday\\" was also written and recorded in Australia and captures the feel of our warm, dreamy summers. Not for nothing are the tracks \\"Myrrh\\" and \\"Tantalised\\" so named. This is the aural equivalent of lying on your couch on a long summer evening watching the light fade, burning incense and imagining tales of far away.I make the journey of listening to this album every six months ago and it is always fresh. I'm always dismayed that reviewers spend so much time talking about \\"Starfish\\". It may be better known, and possibly musically more advanced, but I find it colder and it doesn't draw me in the same way. \\"Heyday\\" is softer, richer, and more inspiring.

From pure pop, to dance, to gospel styled ballads, to reggae. All the bases are covered, in a way that only a band like Culture Club could pull off.

The low height setting of the Delta stand makes it somewhat easier to shift from storage to the work stand and then elevate the stand along with the tool to a desired work height.The hold-down bolt design is a bit difficult to utilize and, hence, encourages use of the tools with out bolting them to the stand.

After about a month of daily use on the job the locking mechanism has started to fail. The little lever you pull to unlock the system to fold the stand has stopped working. I removed the plastic cover over the mechanism, and found it to be very poorly designed. It seemed like it was thrown together as an afterthought, with odd springs and too many moving parts.

Yes you do have to align the mounts prior to mounting the saw but this was easily done. This table is sturdy and a bit heavy but I'm using it for house projects and not transporting it so it fits my needs.

After several calls to delta and numerous efforts to clearly communicate what part was defective ... I finally talked to someone who was able to get the part to me.The release mechanism is a weak design and hangs up or doesn't release well.3 stars taken off due to defective quality control, bad Delta support, and Delta not honoring their rebate.The stand is very sturdy when upright and compact when folded and able to handle whatever equipment I install on it.It is heavy, so loading and unloading it on a regular basis is ill advised.

However, I didn't find this book to be as fun or fast-paced as the other books. The book seemed to drag along. Madison seemed a bit overly obsessed with the \\"Crime Time\\" show, and Crime Time's host, Major deMille.

The only watch out I would give is that the plastic lock shaft turn piece thing on the bottom is easy to deform if you just try to push one side of it (like with a small screwdriver) so always open & close with a pair of needle nose pliers.That being said...HOW IN GOD'S NAME DO YOU PUT THE AMMONIA REMOVING MEDIA / CHARCOAL SUBSTRATE IN THIS GODFORSAKEN THING?Seriously though. The way the inner inlet tube projects relative to the rod that turns and locks it closed makes it impossible to keep one end open to put the substrate in without pushing the plastic mesh out of the guides that hold it in place? I am tempted just to cut a little 'door' in the plastic mesh and then just zip tie it closed after I fill it up.Surely I am doing something wrong. The Magnum 350 canister filter didn't have any instructions with it (bought used) so any help would be greatly appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insight into Zapata and Steinbeck","review":"This was an interesting read. A good part of it is the screenplay itself, but that was indicated in the description so there were no surprises in that respect. It was nice to see Steinbeck writing down his thoughts about Mexico and his opinion of Zapata and the revolution. I enjoyed that very much. I recommend this book to anyone interested in writing screenplays or anyone who is a student of Steinbeck or the Mexican Revolution. It is a shame to learn that Viva Zapata was not made the way Steinbeck wanted, and it could have been a great film instead of just a so-so film. I with they'd have given Steinbeck free reign and gotten John Huston to direct. That would have been a film up there with The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, alas, that didn't happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical introduction","review":"I found the extensive introductory material more informative than the script itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation","review":"I am glad that the title of the album is So far... the best of Sinead O'Connor. I hope there will be plenty more albums in the future. I normally don't go for greatest hit cd's but most of her music I had on bought cassettes and wanted a cd of her music, so I could listen to it in my car. Plus they were wearing out. I still think \\"The last day of our aquaintance\\" and \\"Troy\\" are still powerful after all this time. I tend to perfer her Irish influenced songs Like, \\"He moved through the fair\\" and \\"Foggy dew\\" that she performs on the Chieftain's album and wish they had been included. But, I was happy to hear \\"You made me the thief of your heart\\" From In the name of the father. I didn't like her \\"Am I not your girl?\\" cd so I could live without the \\"Don't cry for me Argentina\\" but overall it gives you a chance to see the diverseness of Sinead's music. It's a definate must have especially for new Sinead fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"you made me cold, and you made me hard","review":"Have to buy this one, because it contains \\"You Made Me The Thief Of Your Heart,\\" O'Connor's most powerful and most exact expression of familial devastation.

I was pleasantly surprised at how beautifully written and performed her music is. While \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" is her most famous song, there are so many better tunes on this compilation. I'm almost tempted to go out and buy all of her previous CDs. It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking back to see ahead...","review":"Sinéad O'Connor has finally had a 'best of' compilation released. However, this is no ordinary 'greatest hits' collection, for if it were, the cost of so many discs would be phenomonal! She has been through so much during her life, and this is so obviously apparent through her music. Her unique, powerful voice alone conveys emotion as if it were really happening to you. The famous 'Nothing Compares 2 U' thankfully brought her music to public attention, yet her attempts to simply be an individual brought the number of listeners down. It is with great joy that this album has been released, that people may see what they've been missing. This album represents all the aspects of her musical career *so far*, and is a good basis to see what goodness is to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful compilation of a very complex artist. It represents a very diverse array of emotions; it's an experience. There are also very obvious and strong connections between the music from this album and her experiences in Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Collection","review":"Given the fact that Sinead hasn't had a radio hit since 1990 (I believe), this \\"greatest hits\\" collection is amazing. I haven't really followed Sinead religiously, except for a couple of albums. This CD has it all. The songs showcase Sinead's unique vocals as well as her writing talents. It's a shame she faded from the public. Whether it's from the media or through her own fault, her low key presence has caused many to miss out on some great music.A+++"},{"rating":"2","title":"a review","review":"I love her and her music.

Carrie Fisher beautifully brings us the inside of Hollywood through a web of humor, drugs, relationships, 'Hollywood Party Terror', and much more.The plot centers on a 30-year-old actress named Susan Vale, and follows her challenges as she overcomes her drug addiction, gets back into the swing of things, and finally falls in love- although her 'unstable' being forbids her from admitting it.I absolutely adored 'Postcards'! A must-read!*long live Carrie Fisher*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out slow, doesn't go anywhere","review":"This is one of those books that I felt obligated to finish, because I had read the first half. The book follows a chronically depressed character from boring engagement to boring engagement, and occasionally wanders off into random thoughts about how awful life is. Maybe I'm missing something important in the novel, but I pretty much doubt it. Definitely not worth the time invested to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the hype","review":"I found this book very boring and pointless. I kept hoping that the story would pick up or the ending would be exciting but I was left unimpressed. Many new characters and story lines were introduced in each new chapter, yet they never went anywhere. The novel was written well, but left me uninterested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not in the Hollywood scene BUT...","review":"Taylor Weston, A reviewerI could swear that other than the glitz and glamour this book was written from personal experiences i have had. Ms Fisher shines through in this wonderfully written, poignant account at life. A remarkable Actress...even better writer.I also recommend Nightmares Echo and Bastard Out Of Carolina because of the style of writing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy like a Tipsy Fox","review":"This book is an extremely clever, witty, and hilarious look into the horrors of addiction. Loosely autobiographical, Carrie Fisher uses the fictional character of Susanne Vale to tell the tale. The book recounts the trials and tribulations of achieving movie stardom, managing a love life, and orchestrating and supporting a monumental addiction to pills, powders, and booze. In and out of various rehabs, Fisher recounts a grab-bag of off-beat insights and asides from a cavalcade of kooky friends and acquaintances. Very soon the reader wonders how could so talented a person become so deeply disturbed, yet this is the aim of addiction recovery philosophy. If the genes and the behavior are properly aligned, then dependence and obsession can occur in the most perfect of lives. Fans of the book should most definitely check out the 1990 film starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreams","review":"By far the best Grace Slick sounds on any of her solo cds. Everyone seems to think Manhole is her best but I disagree. On Dreams her voice sounds stronger and clearer....as if she really cared what it sounded like. On Manhole she sounds ok but doesn't sound as if she really cared how it sounded, she was busy with the Jefferson Starship at the time also, so solo ventures or LPs with Kantner/Freiberg just seemed like something to do because they asked her? She was expected to help ? Anyway, if you love Slick, her voice, her writing....ANYTHING with her on it is worth it...to me anyway...but Dreams is all Grace and very special.

With the understanding that no book could condense the entirety of the Talmud into a small volume and maintain the full discourses on the expounding of jewish law, this is as close as I've found on the subject. I am told the Talmud can be a book that you can study for a lifetime. This book as the \\"Everyman's Talmud\\" is not the Talmud of the rabbinical godal but a short summation of an exhaustive study and can give you quite a feel for the fullness of the work. As a christian I hope this has given me a more complete view of rabbinical law. I feel it has, and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please do not beleive \\"Beth\\"","review":"I have not read the book yet, but I feel compelled to write in that the ideas posted here by Beth are completely false. Jewish ideas and teachings consider all life to be precious. Jewish teachings revolve around compassion for all life including Jews, non-Jews, animals (many of the kosher laws protect animals from suffering), plants, etc. The religion teaches to do acts of kindness, to study Torah (The Bible) in order to acheive personal growth, and to pray to the one G-d, the creator of the universe.

It is not true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyman's Talmud","review":"This is the answer to trying to \\"read\\" Talmud. It's clear, brief, and explains what was being said.

It shows how meticulous the Jewish rabbis were in their study and exegeting of the Tanakh. It is apparent that these sages took the commandment of the Lord to Joshua to heart (Joshua 1:8). Abraham Cohen does an excellent job in organinzing material and backing up his words with many quotes from the rabbinic writings. For me as a gentile believer in the Jewish Messiah Yeshua it challenges me to study the word of God. However it saddens me to see this detailed of study but to see the Jewish people miss the revelation of Yeshua as Messiah. I recommend this book to anyone interested in a basic understanding of what the Rabbinic traditions teaches. \\"Hear Oh Israel the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\\" Duet. 6:4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starting Point","review":"If You can't afford the hundreds of dollars to purchase or the hundreds of hours to peruse the entire Talmud, this book is for you. It is well constructed with key passages referenced and in most case the most prominent teachings have been explained thoroughly. It is, however, a readers digest version of the complete ancient work and some areas of thought are left lacking. I am just beginning my exegetical study of this book and have found it quite enlightening thus far...I look forward to my time of study in it regularly as I use it to supplement my study of the ancient Holy Scriptures, the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful analysis of the life and times of a young Atwood","review":"This intriguing book tells about the early life of Margaret Atwood in great detail, and then skims through the last couple of decades. Rosemary Sullivan has done a remarkable job of recreating the '40's, '50's, '60's and '70's, and how they influenced (and eventually were influenced by!) Canada's #1 writer. Having interviewed Atwood, many of her friends and associates, ex-husband and present husband, and also using contemporary correspondence, Sullivan seems to have an authentic understanding of how Atwood developed into such an amazing, prolific writer. Always respectful, Sullivan keeps her focus on what in Atwood's life is relevant to her as a writer. This is a very intelligently written biography, with an incredible amount of research and very astute analyses, and should be a satisfying read for any fan of Margaret Atwood's, without feeling like you have invaded her privacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, works well.","review":"As is common, Japanese manufacturing has highly refined this product -- the handles on the inner pot may look awkward, but they remain cool and make it easy to move with two hands instead of using a loose loop handle.

The insulation (4.77L version, there is a smaller one) is rated to keep the inner pot at 160 (F) for six hours.I cannot confirm that rating, but during my first trial dish I found the contents to be still very hot after a couple of hours.

The album definitely reflects music from an earlier time - there's no disco or hard rock however. Most of the songs are simple, yet beautiful, sung from the heart. Cocciante's voice can be a bit harsh at times but usually his voice matches the music quite well. He is accompanied mainly by piano. I wouldn't recommend this album to everyone, but if you're sick of the same old stuff (with overdone instrumentals, pretentious lyrics, etc) this album may be a pleasant surprize."},{"rating":"2","title":"HeatGear keeps you COOL!","review":"This tight fitting undershirt has been very good for wearing under my sleeveless baseball/softball jersey this summer. I've worn it two weeks so far. Very light-weight and when the breeze blows it feels very COOL, almost like you don't have the extra shirt on. I'm assuming it does this by wicking the moisture away from your skin and helping it to evaporate, but that's the technical stuff the brand can tell you about. Overall I've given it 4 stars.

The liklihood of error from mistakenly acceepting false equivalences seemed to me the root of almost all the problems that stumped or misled the really talented, often brilliant, and skilled people I helped. This is the first book I have read that made me feel the author had 'been' there or at least caught 'how it was' to be at the heart of solving such puzzles.

The latter follow hot on the heals of the B Minor mass (BMV 232) and are especially welcome.Herreweghe is one of my favorite Baroque conductors, finding, as he does, a vitality and vibrancy in his period instrumentation. The musicians and soloists of the Ghent-based Collegium are of uniformly fine quality and the recording is up to Virgin's excellent standards.If you own Herreweghe's stunning version of the Mass in B Minor, buy this.

I am not a 'foodie,' so can't discuss the finer points of the rice it makes. I just know that I like it. I only make white rice, and follow the directions (except I've never rinsed - didn't realize I was supposed to, and haven't noticed any problem with cooking or clean up or taste, so why bother).FYI It's conceivable that the model number has changed since I bought it, but my 10 cup rice cooker looks exactly like this one - same lid, same controls, same steamer basket.

I finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice, and had brown rice \\"measurements\\" which are different than for regular white rice. I am disappointed. First of all, the manual recommends NOT using the \\"keep warm\\" function when using brown rice. This means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over. This defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker. But even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly. It does not. It is either too wet & mushy, or too dry and burnt. We have been unable to cook a proper batch yet, after much experimentation with slightly more or less water, and using 3 different types of brown rice.

The result is one of the most powerful antiwar statements ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"This...is nuclear war.\\"","review":"This riveting documentary shows a frightening \\"what if?\\" scenario revealing what would result from nuclear war with Russia. It focuses mainly on one town in England, showing how the effects from a nuclear missile strike would destroy the population and how anarchy and chaos would result. The grainy footage is shocking at times but isn't nearly as overpowering as it must have been in 1967. Nevertheless, the narration reveals facts that are still frightening today, making me very thankful that the Soviet Union no longer exists (although the threat of nuclear war unfortunately DOES still exists). \\"The War Game\\" is brutally honest and gripping entertainment, a chilling view of how close the world came to destroying itself at the height of the Cold War. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as interesting as I thought","review":"I had thought that this would of been a decent quality docu-drama since it had the backing of the BBC.

You will encounter Goncharov's amazingly drawn characters as if they were real people: the pathologically lethargic but lovable Oblomov; Zakhar, his loyal servant and Sancho Panza; Stolz, his super-organized, energetic, yet affectionate German friend; and the poignantly sweet Olga.Don't miss the chance to devour this Russian classic in fresh, crunchy English. It's a great read!Oblomov"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oblomov","review":"I received my copy of \\"Oblomov\\"(Classic Reprint) and was disgusted to find that this \\"translation\\" is actually a grossly abridged version of the work. It was NOT presented as such online and I was only alerted to this fact when I compared the size to a copy of a recently translated version of \\"Oblomov\\" that had many more words. Further research revealed the truth of the matter.Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!","review":"Our 11th grade teacher made us read this book for our Russian literature class. I absolutely loved it! It has a little bit of everything for everyone. What a marvelous, heart-rending novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: May be abridged","review":"Be careful if you're ordering this for a class or a formal setting. I ordered the one published by \\"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (December 20, 2012).\\" Sat down to start reading it for my Russian literature class and realized my copy was a lot smaller than my professor's. This version is heavily abridged!! Make sure the copy you're ordering is closer to 500 pages than 200. I had to go to the public library to get a copy.If you're just curious about the basic plot of the book, the abridged version may be appropriate for you.I'm about 200 pages into the David Magarshack translation (Penguin edition published Sept. 2005), and I love the novel so far. It would get a great review if I had ordered that copy originally."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great.","review":"The book itself really wasn't designed that well, the cover art was all stretched and grainy and looked like something that had been copied and pasted from Google,not that it really is a problem since you mustn't judge a book by its cover etc. But it is however a bit unpleasant to the eye and could easily be fixed if the publishers hadn't been lazy.That being said, I think a lot of boys in today's society could relate to the under-achieving Oblomov, who spends all day in his bed. The story really doesn't advance very much and it is a bit unusual in a book where the main character doesn't move from his bed at all. But Oblomov still remains an important work of fiction and it is an interesting read, i would definitely recommend it if you enjoy books from the Russian gold-age or enjoy authors such as Leo Tolstoy and Dostoevsky."},{"rating":"2","title":"a warning against laziness","review":"oblomov is a guy who never quite manages to do anything. he has great difficulties managing to do anything. finally a friend manages to convince Oblomov that he must be active, otherwise he will never escape his laziness. the psychology in the story is great. the plot is always simple, perhaps too slowly progressing. there is much humour in this book. the characters are truly believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Follow-up!","review":"I just loved Ms. Bielski's other two books, so I was excited to find a follow-up to Chicago Haunts. As a local, I really enjoy hearing the ghostly lore of places I know, and Ms. Bielski does not disappoint! This book has some great little (and not-so-little) legends. I grew up right by the farmland that later became the Kraft Foods complex and I always wondered about that little cemetary smack in the middle of it! Now I know! (Now if I could just find out about that lone headstone that used to be on the north side of Willow Road just west of Shermer Road before it was a subdivision...) Anyway, If you like to read about the strange little haunted history of backyard Chicago, this is definetly for you! It is right on track with Ms. Bielski's other great two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO THE PUBLISHER OF THIS BOOK BELOW","review":"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion concerning what they read. Amazon.com graciously allows these opinions to be viewed online. The joke that concludes the first book is mocking and demeaning and was meant to be such! The only \\" believing \\" found in this author's books are of her own theories and write-off explanations. However many aspects that the author uses to examine the parapsychology of the great city of Chicago....her conclusions are only within the closed minded framework of folklore and myth. People who have had paranormal experiences in their lives do not share that view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\" Windy City Ghosts \\" instead","review":"This second book is even worse than the first, after her first book-which she ends with a cheap booze joke that mocks the whole field of Parapsychology-Mrs Bielski is contacted by many people in the Chicago area who describe their paranormal experiences to her, only to have them whitewashed as folklore or myth. Mrs Bielski's whole problem is, her mind is so filled with materialistic philosophy she can't even understand human feeling when she sees it. Resurrection Mary is far more real than this phony. If you want your money worth of this book, take it with you to the toilet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"An all time favorite for any child. Fun and always changing story.

They're easy to use and a snap to change. If you wish, the cartridge can be used numerous times by simply following the cleaning instructions on the box that the filter comes in. Personally, I prefer to use the filter for two weeks, replace it with a new one and dispose of the old filter cartridge. It would virtually be impossible to find a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Air Cleaner","review":"I bought this air cleaner based on the many reviews posted here.

The AFS-1000B, its replacement model, has a maximum air flow of 1044 CFM, a significant difference.I'd like to know which model Amazon.com is actually selling at $219.99.

It may pump out a lot of air, but it vibrates. I mounted it to my basement ceiling and I could feel it vibrate in my living room floor above it. I exchanged it for another one and it did the same thing so I returned it.I've seen an older model run and it didn't have this problem.I just bought a JDS 750-ER and it is much smoother and quieter. I think the overall build quality is a little better and it has a third rear filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the shop.","review":"Unit arrived in perfect working order. I was skeptical.... It's also very quiet and easy to install in any position. The remote control is a great feature, especially with the variable timer function. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Air Filter","review":"The JET is a worthwhile investment and performs as promised: my shop already is cleaner. I will likely get the washable pre-filter when the time comes. A minor inconvenience is that the remote only works from the side of the machine where the control panel is. Otherwise, I'm happy with the JET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good air filtering system","review":"I have not mounted this yet, but don't forsee any problems doing so. Going to use short sections of chain to keep it high enough not to do cranial damage while working in the shop.While it has not been mounted, it has been extensively used. My shop is 25 x 25 x 8, maybe a little large for this unit, but it does a fantastic job keeping the dust particles out of air. I do a lot of work with 1 x 4 and 1 x 6 pine, cross cutting with a 80 tooth blade makes for some fine dust as does cutting dado's with my router table in the same. There is a definate air current in my enclosed shop when I am running this unit and coupled with my Delta dust collector, keeps the dust to a minimum.Very nice unit, the remote works as well as I expected it to. Overall, this has been a great purchase, I breathe much easier out in the shop with or without a respirator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wouldn't be without it now that I have it","review":"This device keeps the majority of dust from settling on everything in my shop. It works great. I don't think I would want to do without the timer and multiple speeds. I usually keep the remote near the door. When I walk in I turn the unit on, when I leave I set the timer for 2 hrs. I usually keep it on low unless I'm freehand routing, then turn it to med. High is more noisy, so I reserve it for MDF.The reason I only gave 4 stars is that it came dented and looked to be a little warped (i.e. out of square) from the factory. The fit of the main filter is also a little suspect. It looks like it is too small so they just added some extra thick foam around the edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had a bumpin the road.","review":"I opened up the box and took out the shipping stops. I plugged it in it vibrated so bad it almost walked off the work bench. Turned out that it had been damaged in shipping, returned to the factory and re-shipped to me without being checked over. I was able to find a local service center and with a little help from them I re-trued the squirrel cage which was running eccentric on the motor shaft. Now it is hanging in my shop and doing a great job of collecting sawdust. Just don't set the timer and shut it off either manually or with the remote. When the original time elapses it will turn itself back on and run until you figure it out and go shut it off again. Let the timer run out and all will be well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any shop","review":"This is a well built, well crafted unit. It is quiet, yet moves a ton of air. No woodshop should be without one of these units. When I ran this unit, using the built-in timer, it scrubbed the air in my shop in just a few hours. It was if I opened all the windows in my shop to air it out. I knew that it removed the harmful dust particles - the shop smelled fresh and clean.Well worth the price - priceless for the health benefits. Do not hesitate to get one of these for your shop. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"jet air filter","review":"This filter has done an excellent job in my small woodworking shop. It is relatively quite and even on low has been able to do the job. The timer feature is really nice. It installed very easly and was able to be installed on the ceiling with little additional prep. I am pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Filtration System","review":"This unit is more powerful than the words or picture describe. I have it suspended from the floor joyces in the basement and it truly cleans the air quickly. Well constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moves the air","review":"Performs well at either of the 3 speeds. Clears the dust in the air out of my shop (40' x 28' x 8') with no issues. The LED lights are not very good and seeing them is difficult, but who really cares? You can hear the 3 speeds well enough to know where you are at. The audio beeps are loud enough to hear so you know when you are changing the speed or turning it off. Easy to install, but you should have two people to lift and get it into the final install position on the ceiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Air Cleaner is Excellent","review":"I received my Jet Air cleaner in excellent condition. Unit is very quiet and has many advantages over other brands. It has a variety of mounting options (suspended from ceiling, tight against ceiling, or portable with the built in handles.) Three speed motor with remote control is nice when unit is mounted to the ceiling. timer feature is great when I want the unit to turn off automatically 2, 4, or 8 hours after I leave the shop. Standard sized filter means I don't have to pay inflated prices for replacement filters. Overall, a great product with lots of nice features and a great price. An air cleaner is an air cleaner. Don't settle for an over priced featureless model that forces you to keep buying their filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I appreciate the Jet Air Filtration System","review":"I installed the Jet System in my garage that I'm using for a wood working shop. My ceiling is 9 ft.so used my own bracket to install the unit 7 ft. above the floor. The system works great and clears the air and keeps it clean as I'm using a lathe and sanders. I really like the remote for I'm in my 80's and can't climb to change the speed or runing time. I seldom use the hour set time for I can turn off the unit as soon as I leave the work area. The air is already clean and to leave it run additional time just takes more electricity. My garage is 24 ft.square and I haven't yet had to run the unit on high. I wished I had installed the unit before I injured my lungs with wood dust. I definately recommend the product to keep the air clean.I also use a Trend Air Shield Pro to minimize my health risk from dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent unit, if you can get one to arrive in one piece.!!!","review":"All I can tell you about this unit is this. It will most likely arrive with the fan slightly off center from getting banged around by the lovely people at Fed-Ex. I have had Amazon replace it twice for me before I decided to purchase it elsewhere, and I still got it with this Fan issue. In a nutshell, when this fan is slightly out of alligment it will make this unit vibrate like a washing machine with all the clothes on one side.... Very frustrating, and I would not purchase this unit from Amazon....."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll wish you had asked for it for Christmas","review":"When I got this, I at first wasn't impressed. After I stained an armoire while this unit was running with the charcoal filter, I wished I had had it for years. When sanding and preparing for finishing, it is great because it will pick up the fine particles in the air. When finishing it eats the vapors with the charcoal filter. It is also good when painting, or doing spring cleaning in an enclosed space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another D.O.A.","review":"When I was considering purchasing an air cleaner, I looked at the customer reviews on the Delta 850CFM unit, the JDS 750CFM unit, and this Jet 650CFM model. The Jet won, mostly on innovative features (variable speed, remote control & electrostatic filter). I was however, concerned about the quality of the Jet. First because of one of the Amazon customer reviewers said he received this item Dead On Arrival and second because Jet quality can be quite erratic in my experience. Well, chaulk up another D.O.A. for the boys at Jet and for the same reason as the other guy. The machine's fan will not rotate at the 2 slower speeds. When you hit high speed, it sounds like a jumbo jet. Not good. I'm not taking any chances with further quality problems so this is going back PERMANENTLY. I will get the JDS 750je model as that is always said to be a high quality unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent air filter","review":"I have been using a Jet AFS-1000b in my long shop for some months now.I find it does a great job of filtering the air without too much noise. Particularly at low speed it is there to be heard, but not obtrusive. Seems to move plenty of air.I mounted it from the ceiling with chains and eye bolts. It moves a wee bit when turning it on or off, but nothing to fuss over. I like the relatively low weight of it for lugging it up there. And of course the remote.Today at Lowes I measured up 3M Filtrete 1x12x24 filters and they seemed to be close, so I bought a few. And they fit great. Snug, but they do not bend at all. And these are not inexpensive filters, but they do filter quite well. I bought the higher filter rating version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wood working is much more pleasant","review":"I waffled between a duct collection system with hoses and this one. I wanted the host based system, but they are single purpose machines and a bit pricey for me as a hobbyist.I landed on the jet system because I get sinus issue with airborne saw dust and I didn't want dust circulating throughout the house. I couldn't be happier. I mounted the unit to the ceiling basement which is under my living room. In the basement, the unit is quite quiet and it really moves the air. In the room above, there is a slight hum but it's not loud.It cleans the air really well. I have been using my circular saw and hand power planer, both with a dust bags, and the airborne dust is much reduced. I can get away without a mask and there is saw dust on the horizontal surfaces away from my work. I also do karate work outs in the basement which kicked up concrete dust, but the Jet picks that up too.Definitely a good purchase and when I get a host system, I'll be dust free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible QC on the fan","review":"Another example of fine Chinese craftsmanship. The impeller on the fan was not perpendicular to the fan motor shaft; therefore, the thing vibrated like crazy due to the wobble. I ended up taking the entire assembly apart and truing the impeller myself, which took most of the vibration and excess noise out the unit. It sure seems like there should be better quality control, it makes me wonder how high the quality of the components are that I can't see. I imagine it will do an adequate job of filtering the dust in my shop though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Air Filtration system","review":"This is a great air filtration system for the typical garage workshop. Operation is fairly quiet, especially at low speeds and the reusable inner filter is an added bonus. Washable outer filters are available for this product too. The removal of typical airbourne workshop dust from sanding and cutting is very effective. The remote control unit makes for easy and convenient operation.The only issue I have found is that mounting to the ceiling is very tricky unless you have a couple of extra hands available. The unit is bulky and fairly heavy - around 65lbs. Also, it would have been good to have a certain amount of adjustabilty with the mounting brackets to help align with my ceiling joists.Aside from that, I give this 4 out of 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"My workshop is in my 1 car garage and with all the power tools going a lot of dust is kicked up. The first night I put the JET AFS-1000B Air Filtration System in use I set it on Medium for 4 hours and when I came back in the morning it was like I was standing in someone else's shop. The shop smelled clean and fresh for the first time since I moved in my table saw. The unit is easy to use with the remote control and the only pet peeve I have is that the timer cannot be adjusted from the control panel on the unit, beyond that it's a great unit. If you work with wood you need to have one of these units running in your shop, Period!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of fan wobble","review":"Out of the box, it looked great... until I plugged it in that is. I'm sure this product works great when you get one that isn't assembled with a bent motor mount. When I plugged it in, the fan started wobbling. It was rubbing against the metal frame as it started to spin. I thought it was going to fly apart as it started speeding up. I unplugged it and found that the motor mount inside was bent so that it was mounted at an angle. I called WMH support and they tried to ask me if I wanted them to send a new fan part. First of all, I don't need just the fan blade when it is the motor mount that it broken. Second, I'm not about to try to take this apart and fix it when I just got it. You would think that they would send a new replacement, but that hasn't happened yet. Just cross your fingers that your's doesn't come with the same type of problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor reliability","review":"This thing does the job when it works. After 2 weeks in the shop after light use, the timer stopped working. They mailed me a new board which took about 30 minutes to replace and still the timer does not work. So I have had the thing about six weeks and it only functioned properly for 2 weeks. I am waiting their next move. I give them one more chance and if it still isn't repaired then it goes back and I demand a refund. This is not a complicated unit. Why cant they get it right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"AFS-1000B has a timer defect","review":"I purchased the AFS-1000B, tested out the unit, seemed fine. Went into my shop the next day and it was running even though I had turned it off.

Jet sent me a new board, I installed it, same thing. So I returned it for another AFS-1000B. Same thing happens. This one is going back in the box and being returned and I'm now shopping for a unit that works properly and isn't possessed.Contact Jet before you buy to see if this has been corrected.

You can't put the driver bits directly in the \\"quick-change\\" chuck. You have to use a 1-1/2\\" extender. So, once the Bosch chuck is in your drill's chuck and the extender is in and the bit is finally in there is a huge amount of play. I measured 3/32\\" side to side play, and I didn't have to use a dial indicator. I just held the extender against a ruler, put my thumb on the end of the bit, and wobbled it. There is also at least 5 degrees of rotational play meaning stops and starts will be all over the place.Bosch should be ashamed of themselves for making it, and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling it.

(Which works very well.) If you don't, you will get harder rice, which does not keep as well for reheating, than I like. So I am still working out how to cook rice to achieve separated grains (American style).Overall the quality of the cooked rice is very, very good. You can add ingredients to the rice before cooking. Operating the applicance is easy.

I actually held a rag above the cover for a while so the counter didn't get messed up. When the cooker clicked off, the rice was not completely cooked, probably because too much water had vented out as steam.

Some of the water comes out of the vent hole on top of the lid (I'm not even sure why this hole is needed because the last rice cooker I had didn't have a vent hole and it worked perfect for 20 years).

The Elliot Smith tracks are the obvious selling points, and they are strong songs indeed, but the rest of the selections also fare well; the underrated Jeb Loy Nichols (check out the album he did with Ian Gomm), a great track by the Waterboys, classics from Gerry Rafferty and Al Green, balanced by more rockier tunes from the Dandy Warhols and Luscious Jackson. And that Andru Donalds track is a keeper too. For my tastes, the least memorable parts are the instrumental passages by Danny Elfman, but even those bits contribute to the pleasant flow of the album.

Everything I'm describing happened within the span of three months.Even if the thermometer worked, it's just not an enjoyable product to use. The buttons feel gummy and you have to push hard to get them to respond. Your target temperature options are limited to a handful of pre-sets and there doesn't seem to be a way to set a custom temperature alarm if you're heating something to a degree other than the normal temperature of beef, lamb, pork chicken or fish.

The only bright spot to the collection are the two remixes of Firecracker which stick close to the original melody and add updated beats, which by now sound dated anyway.

(The Pac Man itself was a little too round, the sound was off...something was amiss, yet many didn't notice. If you were a true afficianado, you noticed). Well, this fake one is the one that's shipped with this unit. And it's just as disappointing as it used to be. It's not the real pac man.Also, the Rally X \\"radar screen\\" that was in the lower right in the real game is overlayed on top of the actual driving screen.

Except for the complaints I have been hearing about the controls for Ms. Pacman. This first version should be redone if it wants the real arcade fanatic to buy it.

Bosconian is the worst offender. I was going to buy this gadget just because it had Bosconian, which was one of my favorite games when I was a kid. However, when I finally found a place that had one connected to a TV, I discovered that it was a console version! It had no speech, the ships were out of scale (the bases weren't huge compared to ships), the sound effects were weak, and (as I recall) it didn't even have squadron bonuses or mystery ships. Although I played Pac-Man briefly, I was disappointed by it as well.If this toy was re-released with emulated versions of the original ROMs instead of the console versions, I would definitely buy it and give it 4 or 5 stars, because it would be a true sample of arcade history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the Arcade version","review":"It seems all the TV games have a flaw or two, but the Pac Man and Ms. Pac Man TV games are both not worth buying.Pac Man by ToyMax is nothing like the arcade version. The sounds are way off, and the PAC MAN is a GIANT and so are the ghosts. Also the patterns that used to work do not work in this poorly converted game. If you are expecting a Pac Man like the arcade, DO NOT BUY. If you just want to play Pac Man that is similar to the arcade then you might like it. The joystick seems to be made pretty good on this Pac Man by ToyMax, unlike Ms. Pac Man which the joystick will break in a matter of days or weeks.It depends on whether you want a Pac Man like the Arcade or not, if you are expecting anything similar to the arcade DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast for Kids!!!","review":"My only real complaint is that the game is way way too difficult to play.

My kids have lost interest, and so have I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great revisit","review":"I have to give Namco credit; this is a great toy. It brings me back to the day of the famous Atari 2600. In regards to fun, this is a lot of fun. The only problem with this game system is its durability. I have bought three already. They work great for a while, then all of the sudden they begin to display static. They are very hard to find if not shopping online. Thanks again, and hopefully customers reviews will help improve the durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 days!!!","review":"Just got this for Christmas. The kids have been playing with it for the last two days and now the picture is messed up. It has all sorts of noise on it and you can't even see what you are doing. Total play time before it broke was probably about 12 hours. Will be trying to get a replacement since the kids love it. Hopefully, that one will last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!","review":"This game is awsome! It has these five classic games on it: Packman (fun), DigDug (even more fun),Rally x(somewhat fun) ,Galaxain (really cool) and Boscanian (my personal favroite.) I never really knew how much fun it was to go back to the time where arcades had joy sticks to move th charatcher around with."},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy rocks!!!!","review":"Now I'm playing this more than PS2!The games that I like the most are PacMan, DidDug, and Rally X.If you want to take a blast to the past, than you will want to get this toy. Like I said, This toy rocks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Game runs too fast","review":"Beware. The games are all perfectly identical to the arcade, but the console runs all the games about 50% too fast. As a result you can barely get past the first screen in any of the games. This makes it pretty much worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still want one!!!","review":"I bought one of these little wonders for myself at Target shortly before Christmas 2003. I got it home, plugged it in and it played beautifully EXCEPT that the joystick would not respond to turn right in ANY game. Disappointed, I brought the game back to Target for a replacement and they were sold out. I tried over and over again (over the course of three weeks) at several Target stores in my area and they were ALL SOLD OUT! Finally, I had to give up on the idea of replacing it and just turned it in for a refund. Toymax obviously has a hit on their hands since I don't think most stores can keep this thing in stock. Lots of fun and less quarters than I spent in my teens in the '80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent games!!","review":"All five games are great and fun to play! Sounds and graphics compare very well to the originals. Nothing to complain about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for the 20/30-somethings out there","review":"I received this game as a gift a little over a week ago and haven't tired of it yet. Pac-man is the only game on this joystick that I played a lot as a kid and from what I remember this version is identical. It requires 4 AA batteries and does not come with them so be sure to have some fresh batteries on hand. When I first hooked this up it didn't work because I didn't have a new set of batteries. I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the location of the reset button (it's very easy to accidentally reset your game) and because there is not a two player option. Other than that it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I received my MsPacman 5in1 game yesterday, and decided to play pole position first. After about 2 races and no harsh treatment at all, the whole game went squiggley and then didn't work when you would turn the yellow knob left or right(kinda like a steering wheel for the racing game). the controller seems to work for the other games, but it's really not even worth 20 bucks. The mspacman game is a cheap knockoff, nothing like the original. The sounds are terrible. I'm going to shop for an original old atari, that would be a lot better than this piece of garbage. I even bought the other 10 in 1 atari-style controller, and that is garbage too. what a waste. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY OF THESE. TRUST ME! They need to be built better. I'm not even a little kid who might be rough on it, I was just trying to see if they'd be like originals from when I was growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Idea Ever Cheapest Parts","review":"I'm glad to see that people think the same way I do. Lately I have become this huge arcade fan. I found this used at thrift store and I must admit I was pretty impressed the games look almost exactly like the arcade versions. I have played this thing for hours apon hours and I am addicted. However, even after the having it a few weaks I can tell the joystick is breaking with every play. Ok I understand that not everything is perfect it couldn't be, but this product has a less durable joystick than my atari! Thats the huge disappointment I think, Namco please fix the joystick. However, unlike the rest of you I bought mine for 10.00 dollars and I collect pac-man so at least it is a cool display piece when mine breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think this is cool because Namco never actually did this, but you can actually play games from Namco by pluging in the T.V. and just play.

It does not play an iPod as the alarm, so using it as a bedside alarm stinks.The adapter for the Nano is total junk. It does not fit in the slot at all without major modification and even then it will not allow a Nano user to plug it in.As stated prior, the connecter is poor. It distorts with the smallest movement of the ipod, so surfing through songs while on the dock should not be done. If you wish to surf, then I suggest one uses the aux input on the back. The clock does come with a cord to plug an audio device into it.The saving grace of this unit is the sound. Its good, not great, but good. I also like the seperate batteries for clock and speakers. This way one can change the batteries for the speakers without resetting the clock and alarm."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Don't Buy this...

The sound is great for low volume playing. I haven't had any problems with static or feedback and I have used it GENTLY for a total of THREE times.

I should have just made the plunge and spent more for a JBL unit, which I will do now. This product is NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This was exactly what I was looking for: a thin unit with iPod dock and radio that could take up a small amount of counter space in the kitchen. What I got: a unit with atrocious radio reception and a left speaker that wouldn't work when the iPod was plugged in. I own an Emerson CD Radio that I've had for years with no problems so needless to say I was disappointed when I received this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Hiss!","review":"Got 3 of these at a store grand opening for under $20 each.

It also lacks features I'd like, including sleeping and waking to an iPod. Took it back and bought an iHome instead.Word to the wise: If you can, try out a unit before you buy it. Bring your iPod to Best Buy and plug it into the dock. It'll save a lot of hassle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a piece of junk. I bought one for my son, 1 week later the on/off button stuck and broke. Sent it back, got a new one and on month after the new one came, the radio stopped working and the buttons eventually did as well. So I'm stuck with a non-working, non-returnable piece of junk. I will never buy another Emerson product. I went and bought an iHome product and he loves it, and yes, it still works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK!","review":"Well in fact piece of junk is giving it a compliment. Bought one this weekend, and the buttons already have stopped working, and I have to hit them several times simply to get any output at all, if you want to call a constant hissing sound output. I can not even listen to it at work (which is what I intended because the sound is so distracting and the piercing screech is mind numbing. DO NOT BUY!!!!

As soon as I powered it up again with this Makita 192598-2 1222 I remembered why I bought the drill in the first place. Super price on this battery, too.

Do not buy it.It lacks an on/off switch, but, more imporantly, it makes a terrible mess of the device and the area around it when you cook rice in it. It is nearly as easy to cook rice and much easier to clean if you use a pot with water than to use this device.You will be very unhappy if you buy this cooker. I have used it once and will never use it again--except as a door stop. There are other, genuinely useful rice cookers available here for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for small family","review":"This is the 3rd rice cooker I have purchased and by far the best. We are only two people who enjoy rice, not an army, so this little devil does the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"Unless you are planning to serve the rice right after it is done cooking, this product is not good. I used this product for a year already, when I was away from home. First of all, it does not keep the rice warm once it is done cooking. Once it starts to cool, the water vapor in the condenses and water will soak into the rice, making it soggy. However, another one of their rice cookers has worked really well for my family: Zojirushi NSRNC-18A Automatic Rice Cooker and Warmer with Floral Imprint. This rice cooker is great, leaving my rice moist and warm. It lasted for almost 10 years and is still in great working condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I was looking for a small an inexpensive cooker and found this one about a year ago. I've used it 5 times and never got one grain of rice that I would eat or serve to my son. I've played with the ratios of water and rice. Each time the rice is just mush. Then there is the mess that it leaves behind. The lid pops up and the steam leaks out the sides leaving a nasty mess behind. Do not buy this.Find a cooker with a real lid that snaps closed. I've had good luck with a National in the past and regret trying to save a buck on this awful product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Going Strong!","review":"I purchased this item several years ago, and it is still going strong. Now, this isn't a fancy rice cooker with bells and whistles, but for my household is suits us perfectly. We have only two mouths to feed and a small kitchen (storage is an issue) so, this relatively small rice cooker works well for us. It cooks the rice quickly and while you do have to pay a small amount of attention to it (once the rice is done, the light goes off and you have to leave the lid on for about 10 minutes before fluffing...if you forget, the rice can come out soggy) it delivers perfect rice for two! A million times easier than trying to cook rice on the stove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple & Convenient","review":"We have used our steamer for the last 6 months. It's quick, easy to clean and consistent. The best advice I have read, used, and would give is in regards to rice selection and preparation. We buy Basamati rice from a mediterranean market and it is superb. Rinse 3-4 times and cook using equal parts with water. Our kids, parents and entire family really enjoy the rice this cooker makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps it simple.","review":"I just cooked my first pot of brown rice in my new 3-cup Zojirushi and it came out perfectly. So perfectly that I forgot I was eating brown rice. This rice cooker is very basic and simple to use and I anticipate using it several times a week.Yes, there are other rice cookers with lots of bells and whistles but if you are cooking rice just a few times a week for one or two people (light eaters), this cooker should do the trick.Yes, the spout does create a small amount of spurt but it's not a big deal to clean that up... and much better than the spill over burnt pot you can often get while cooking rice on a stove top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad lid, inferior design","review":"I purchased two of these (large size and smaller one) for my family in the US. I use it when I am home for a visit. I have never been able to use this cooker w/o it spraying water all over my countertop. In short, I regret the purchase.I now live in Tokyo and realize that Zojirushi is just pushing an inferior product on the US market. You cannot even purchase a thin-lid rice cooker here, especially one w/ a blowhole in it that lets turns the cooker into a steady spray of boiling rice water every time it is used. Not good.If you are serious about cooking rice often, and not having to clean up your kitchen after each use, I suggest that you invest a little more and get a better designed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be","review":"First off, it does not keep the rice warm, according to the owner's manual. Second, I defy anyone over 35 to read -- or find -- the measurement markers on the rice tin. I purchased it for my mother who lives alone. Very disappointing. You can find the same qualities in a 14.99 rice cooker/steamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful item","review":"I use this rice cooker on a regular basis.

We purchased this thinking it would cook rice much faster than other methods. Technically, the machine does cook the rice in less than 20 minutes - HOWEVER - the machine takes about 30 minutes to warm up before it starts cooking the rice. So, total time is around 45-50 minutes. We are pleased with the quality of the rice. It turns out consistently good rice. Be advised, the scoop that comes with this is marked at 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 measurements. We logically thought that these measurements referred to a cup. However, if you check you will see that the measurements are smaller than a cup. We had to experiment with the water to rice ratio, but now that we have that down, the rice turns out great. It also keeps the rice warm for a long time, which is nice. Overall, I would recommend this machine to people who are serious rice eaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"I love this Cooker, perfect Rice every time, easy to clean, and if you set the timer a nice time saver, it only saves time that way because it takes about 45 min for the rice to be done. Go to a Vietnamese Store and buy Jasmine Rice for 6.99$ 25lbs and this thing will pay off in no time. Nice handle and spatula holder makes it great to take to a cook out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got Debussy?","review":"What a nice collection of Debussy-- for so little money!

It's a little too atmospheric. Maybe it'll grow on me. Very spacey --which isn't a bad thing! I just don't see the Portishead or Massive Attack comparisons. It's more like Morcheeba. And Morcheeba I can take in small doses -- not enough for a whole album's worth. \\"Falling\\" is a definite standout, but it's five songs in. \\"Future\\" features a large string sound over soaring vocals and a little Portishead scratching in the middle -- nice. But it's overall a very, very sleepy album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This book is unbelievably boring. I had expected to have a Rainbow Fish story as well as some counting games. There is no story. Each page only asks \\"How many of Color X do you see?\\" It progresses in order through the numbers (1, then 2, etc.). You then can do some other counting activities.

As so often does, time broke them apart. Now they have a second chance, or at least that is how it seems.

So frequently, women think that once they get married they will be happy. Or their life will come together in marriage...SO not TRUE!Robin Jones Gunn uses Shelly to explain the truth that a relationship with Christ should come before any other relationship.

My Jeep is garaged and only has 30,000 miles on it in 5 years. Within a year of installing this guard (which is a bear, getting the bolts to line up) the paint started chipping off. I started touching it up using Rustoleum paint but the chipped areas kept getting larger and larger. Recently very large sheets of paint have been coming off so I'm looking at removing the guard, stripping it down, treating any rust and totally refinishing it. This time I'll be using Rustoleum primer and finish coat(s). I would suggest any buyer of this guard refinish it before installing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta 22-680 planer shipped without 50-654 stand","review":"Delta introduced a this 3hp 15\\" planer to catch up to its Tiawanese look alikes.

By the time I had 300 or so board feet run through the planer, the switch had broke; the height control lock failed to lock the head at a fixed depth of cut; and the 3 hp motor had burned up. On top of these problems the CSA approval label on it was put on it without authorization from CSA. (I checked with CSA!)

It is particularly convenient for 'steel cut' oatmeal. This is the best oatmeal and is not processed as rolled oats are. I measure the ingredients in the evening and set the timer and I have hot steel cut oatmeal ready when I get up in the morning.

For this amount of money, it's ridiculous not to have a spatula holder. Second, the rice takes twice as long to cook (40 minutes instead of 20). Third, although I make only 2 cups of rice at a time, the cooker is really too small. Because 2 cups of rice, when cooked, takes up almost all of the space in the cooker, it is difficult to fluff up the rice when it's done. My mother said a 3-cup rice cooker was not a good idea.

Books like \\"The Polish Officer\\" and \\"Kingdom of Shadows\\" are worthy of the highest praise but in this latest effort the plot is a recycled one; the action is thin; the use of recurrent characters has now reached joke proportions. Please, Mr Furst, either get back your interest in this series or move on to something that engages your considerable talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Foreign Correspondent","review":"A good, quick, easy read. Although several issues are left unresolved at the end, I understand the spy game is just that way with few clear victories. Therefore, Furst is realisic in not having all the \\"i's\\" dotted and all the \\"t's\\" crossed.As always his writing style is crisp; has an energetic rhythm; and is suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let us help you, Alan--if Random House won't","review":"I have to agree with everyone who found The Foreign Correspondent a listless rehashing of increasingly shopworn characters and effects. Carlo is Casson without the freshness or depth. The scene at Henninger's, featuring protagonists of earlier and better novels, is a joke on the reader. Doesn't Furst have an editor? Or does his ms. go straight to the printer? Here's an idea: if Random House can't afford to provide Furst with an editor's advice, why not show the draft of his next novel to 20 typical readers? I'm sure the result of such a process would be a book in keeping with what we all know Furst is capable of. What do you say, Alan?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please say the book contract is complete?","review":"This book is yet another lazily plotted Furst disappointment and it joins the last two in return-to-seller. Reading it, you get the impression that old research pieces are reviewed for re-use and then cobbled together in a haphazard sequence of non-events. Where is the writer of the earlier books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really want to like this book ...","review":"but I don't think I'll waste more time on it. 50 pages to go and I still don't care enough about the characters. It was my first Furst novel. I may or may not give another one a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and lacks of depth","review":"The charaters are very thinly defined. The relationships between people are stretched and unconvincing. Nobody in the novel is really engaging. Furst also failed to give any unique prospect of the society during that era. It is a disappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Furst - but not my last.","review":"This was my introduction to Furst's novels, and it was satisfying. Based on the other reviews, I should have started with Night Soldiers, but I'll try it next. I was impressed with the detail presented in this novel, although I can't personally judge its accuracy. It did give me a good sense of the time and the place, and what it might have been like to be an exile in Paris then. The book definitely conveys the uncertainty, risks, anxiety, and sacrifice associated with being an exile, involved in a resistance movement, on the eve of war, and it made me wonder how I might handle that. The author is truly good at characterization, and as others have said he is strong on the description of scenes and atmosphere. I did not, however, find it \\"gripping\\"; in fact, it moved slowly for me. The book will appeal to those who like Paris, those who are interested in WWII, those who like mysteries and spy novels, and those who appreciate good writing - in short, a broad audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance to the Music of Time","review":"All Furst's alluring skills are on offer here.Returning to pre-war Paris his palette rich portraits of people and places rise off the page. Each new novel is revealed as part of a larger mosaic. Together they are forming a Dance to the Music of Time. Revealing an era through a series of side long glances. You read for the pleasures on each page. At ease with an author consumately in command of his craft.Furst lives and breathes the old adage...the less that is more."},{"rating":"1","title":"a novelette","review":"I have read all of Furst's books numerous times, but this one is a real disappointment. It is more of a sketch of a story than a story. In all of his war novels, the characters drift realistically through love, hunger, and housing problems while doing their part in fighting against totalitarianism. The difference in this book is that drifting dominates while any effort at plot development or the building of suspense is completely abandoned. I'll wait for the next one to come out in paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly disappointed","review":"I really wanted to like this book, after reading reviews in the WSJ and the LA Times. And pre-war Europe was my fave epoch.But Furst doesn't deliver. He violates that first commandment of writing, \\"Show, don't tell.\\" He tells, and tells, and tells. Carlo has no unrevealed nuance.I kept reading to find out the traitor in the Liberazione circle - and when it is revealed, so what?Yes, the period detail is lush, excruciatingly so. Carlo goes to Spain, Carlo goes to Berlin, to Prague, to Genoa. Again, so what?The love scenes are clumsy, the sentence fragments are annoying.I'll not bother to read any more Furst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and Shallow","review":"A short and shallow effort, lacking the thought and imagination of most of Mr. Furst's previous efforts. Maybe he should try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting story","review":"My daughter and I read this aloud all the way through in one sitting since we couldn't put it down. What a lovely sweet and inspiring story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relatively uniformative.","review":"Despite the number of pages, this book does not go into much detail. The GIMP Visual Quickstart Guide by Davis is a vastly better introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Overview","review":"Although it doesn't cover everything that the Gimp is cabable of, it does what it's name says. It goes through almost all the plugins and gives you a good example of each one that you may not have seen before. Worth it for people who know a good deal about Gimp, but are feeling a little stuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book !","review":"If you are looking for something complete DO NOT BUY this book. You will regret that, belive me. Try to read instead \\"Gimp User Manual\\" by K. Kylander & O Kylander (which is shipped for example in the package labeled \\"gimpman\\" on SUSE distributions). You'll find everything there from how to compile and install a plug-in to how to use and write scripts, really everything"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds great","review":"I have owned several versions of the classic record and can not believe how great it sounds being newly remasstered. I do not have much to say about the songs, you already know how great they are, and if you don't, than buy this CD NOW! The Church are one of the most underated bands of all time, so this is a great place to start if you are new to the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Bible Movies!","review":"The Visual Bible - Matthew is a superb production. Using the actual Biblical text as the script, there is no tendency to restate the content. The text is the script. Bruce Marchiano's portrayal of Jesus is inspired. You will never be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy,Joy and more Joy","review":"Reading In the Footsteps of Jesus was such a eye opening experience. To really see Jesus in a way I hadn't looked at him before. He was so happy , loving and compassionate, no wonder people wanted to follow him. Nowing he can not only be my savior but my friend too. I highly recommend this book and the Mathew tapes to anyone. Specialy to those who think Jesus is stern and stiff and never gets his hand dirty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"REAL\\" Jesus","review":"This film reveals a Jesus far different than the serious and detached version one usually sees in other films. In this four hour, word-for-word, account of \\"Matthew\\", Bruce Marchiano remarkably portrays Jesus as who He was - a first century Jewish man...compassionate...loving...giving...sorrowful...joyful...REAL! Even his appearance was \\"real\\" - weather beaten...slightly dirty tunic...hair flying. I highly recommend this film - you'll fall in love with this Jesus. I understand that Bruce has plans to produce \\"The Gospel According to John\\" but needs support - I hope he gets it because we need another film as \\"real\\" and as good as \\"Matthew\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This video series was instrumental in my coming to Christ for the first time in my life! After seeing these I could no longer deny Jesus' love! Instead of the fire & brimstone God I always heard about growing up, this video shows Jesus as the joyful & loving God that I now *KNOW* HE is! Bruce Marchiano's portryal of Jesus touched my heart so deeply I wish I could thank him personally.Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Bible is very INSPIRING","review":"My love for Jesus Christ has grown even more after I watched this video. It touched me how Jesus was portrayed as a happy, outgoing type of guy. The 4 Video series did an excellent job of copying the Matthew Gospel word for word. God Bless the makers of the video, and God Bless Bruce for an excellent job of portraying the Son of Man as a caring teacher, loving master, and a merciful savior. Take my words for it, this video is very inspiraitonal, you will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful with this one","review":"Do not confuse this single tape with the 4 tape box set put out by Visual Bible. It is not the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matthew","review":"If you purchase this DVD, you should also purchase the book, \\"In The Footsteps of Jesus\\" or the cassettes It explains how the movie was made, but a warning - keep tissues close at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Gospel of John","review":"I agree with other reviews that this film has an irreverent Jesus who makes me uncomfortable watching it. Henry Cusick is absolutely excellent in The Gospel of John, so order that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is the first Visual Bible presentation we've seen and we are quite impressed with the way Matthew presents Jesus as a happy, friendly person. It also helps to see the words of the Bible acted out. It helps to plant it firmly in one's memory.The only downside is that there is a defect in the first disk and I'm going to contact Amazon to find out how to get it replaced.In any case, I would highly recommend this presentation to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Visual Bible - Matthew is a film that stuck to the word of the Bible verbatim. They told to story of Jesus using the scriptures and nothing else. It really helps you see the true Bible without all the interruptions that cloud the issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired!","review":"I concur with the other reviewers that the other movies portray a Jesus that I in particular would not care to get to know. Even the \\"Jesus\\" movie by Campus Crusade that has been translated into hundreds of languages is just not much of a movie.This one draws you in and it's too bad that *it* was not around before the aforementioned Jesus movie otherwise it may have gotten more exposure. I agree that it's pricey but I think Christians should start making better productions; sometimes that costs more especially when the viewer base is not that broad. The upcoming \\"Left Behind\\" has a $17 million budget which in Hollywood wouldn't buy you Tom Cruise let alone the rest of the movie.We're going the right direction with this kind of quality production. I plan to order Bruce's \\"Footsteps of Jesus\\" which of the 31 reviewers ALL 31 have given 5 stars--never seen this on Amazon!Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Nicholas Cage Doing Stand-up Comedy?","review":"Watching Bruce Marchiano, with his forced syrupy smile, is like a Nicholas Cage comedy act. Hard to imagine or just plain creepy? Which is more believable: Marchiano's Jesus hopping around with a \\"plank in the eye\\" while everyone laughs at him, or Nicholas Cage doing anything funny? Ponder this while wondering if you really care and you will see why you should decide to pass on this movie -- it is just wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"The Gospels of John was amazing. Jesus of Nazareth was great. This DVD sucked. The acting was bad & with no feelings or emotions expressed. It was similar to watching an auto book (if you could imagine that). The movie follows the Gospels of Matthew word by word. That's the only reason I gave it even 1 star. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend this version. It might bore you to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"It brings the scripture to life","review":"In our Sunday School class we will watch 2-3 chapters, and then discuss what we saw.

So I returned its. I'm not sure what else to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"There have been many movies about the life of Jesus, and many men have tried their best to portray Him. Bruce Marciano has managed to find the joy, tenderness and compassion that we all know our Lord has, and get it across on the screen. Great narrative of the Book of Matthew!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this","review":"Just love this movie. So very loving and moving and so well put together. Sensational, brings you so close to Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Waste of Money","review":"I purchased this DVD after watching the new Gospel of John, thinking it might be of similar quality. There is no comparison. The Jesus in the Gospel of John has the air about him of the Son of God, Kingly and Regal, yet a man of sympathy. The Jesus of this video strikes you as a happy-go-lucky American funny guy, part used car salesman and part favorite uncle. This Jesus goes about hugging and kissing people and giving his disciples \\"Dutch\\" rubs. Needless to say, we didn't get very far into this before giving up. The Bible says that Jesus spoke as one \\"having authority\\". Not this Jesus. This Jesus might be the Jesus of the average American's imagination, not the Jesus of the Bible. I am sorry I couldn't rate it any lower than one star.Added November 11, 2011 - I am currently in the process of a study on the Sermon on the Mount, \\"Blessed are they that Mourn\\". This study has reinforced my thoughts on this video and its failure in presenting the biblical Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This is a low budget production, not in the same league as the Gospel of John. I don't find it helpful for classroom use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"We occasionally use this DVD at our church for a scripture reference instead of a power point slide. The video quality isn't the best, but the acting is good. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Bible story on DVD","review":"This is just one of the many purchases i have made for Biblical stories and they seem to get better all the time. This version sticks to the Gospel of Matthew almost one hundred percent. Color, scenery and costumes are beautiful. If your interested in the Bible at all do not hesitate to purchase this DVD. After we have watched the DVDs we lend them to our friends. They enjoy them as much as we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent!!!!!!","review":"although jesus and his apostles were all colormen, i love this dvd because it speak the truth from the bible, which is a huge blessing, iam bless to watch this maginificent piece at the sametime as im typing my reviews, it's a wonderful, and great piece, strictly from the bible with the scriptures on the bottom right corner of the screen, \\"jehovah our heavenly father, the alpha and omega of my life, bless these wonderful people who have the great pleasures and the sacifices of making this dvd to come to life and for saving some souls and to yolk the holy spirits and the flesh and blood togerther in the name of sweet blood of jesus christ AMEN\\"...thank you amazon for having this faboulous dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"We loved it!","review":"We both loved this film - it brought Matthews account to LIFE! We watched it the night before our baptisms...the crucifixion is an especially haunting scene that helps to realise how horrific an ordeal it must have been for our Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matthew","review":"The actor-if you can call him that- Bruce Marcianno, is HORRIBLE ruins the whole gospel. He is like a Jesus on LSD. His imitation of Jesus is blasphemous. Can't recommend any film that has him in it to my unsaved friends or family. Shame they did not use the same cast as the gospel of John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"This film is as bad as The Gospel of John is good. I fully understand why viewers would be attracted to the smiley Jesus who is always touching and kissing people; there could be a certain charm to that but for the fact that the man playing Jesus has virtually no acting ability and delivers the texts in a flat accent with oddly placed emotional inflections. Hard to believe that this film was made by the same production group that had seen fit to cast Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus (albeit after this laughable mess of a film, and thank God they did) Overall, it looks like someone's bad home movie combined with the typical Cheese Whiz costumes and overacting that are the stock-in-trade of the majority of Jesus flicks. I am glad I saw The Gospel of John first or else I might never have tried it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea...poor acting.","review":"As much as I would like to recommend this movie, I have to admit it is not one of the best movies of Jesus life. It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word, which is, at times, a useful tool.That said, the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.If you what the best Jesus movie ever done, nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.The two other parts to this series, Acts and John, are done very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing disc one","review":"when the DVD arrived I opened it in great anticipation of watching it right away. unfortunately I cannot.. as it is a two disc DVD set and disc one is MISSING. only disc two arrived???? the package was sealed, so now I cannot return this purchase.

I wouldn't go quite so far as that, but he certainly has an evocative, if sometimes difficult to follow prose style, that one will either find very annoying or very gratifying, depending how well you get into his groove.This novel or novella is quite good. Vollman depicts a very gritty, grimy, and sometimes gross Tenderloin district in San Francisco known for it's prostitutes, strip clubs, and other nefarious goings on. The story is about Jimmy, a low life, down and out, alcoholic who is in love with a prostitute named Gloria. The catch is Jimmy is so addled by the end of the novel we never really know whether Gloria is real or a figment of Jimmy's imagination. In some ways Gloria is an amalgamation of a number of street girls that Jimmy congregates with.

Songs like this one make it hard to remain cynical about love.The rest of the album doesn't have a single weak song either. \\"Simply Beautiful\\" is quite likely the most delicate song ever put on wax.

The screenplay shows in a very close way, the dark years of our history, when democracy was just a dream. Norma Aleandro and Hector Alteiro are simply perfect in their roles and the music of Atilio Stampone is oustanding. The first (and by the moment, the only) Oscar for Best Foreing Language Film, to Argentina. I'm really proud that people around the world could appreciate this magnificent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"An very good movie, a bad DVD","review":"This movie addressed a painful issue to many Argentinans, the dissapearances during the military regime. Aleandro's excellent acting, the films story, how it evolves, the tragedy behind the emotions, the tragedy of chosing between existing bliss and justice, and a touchy subject, is very much worthwhile viewing, and maintains actuality to this day, with the outstanding reconciliations of societies like Argentina and Chile with the dissapearences and genocide of people opposed to the dictatorships, or who simply had different points of view. It is a pity that the DVD images are not well reproduced, some work could have been done to improve them through existing technology, and I was shocked to see a DVD that reproduces the subtitle in the movie, and does not allow you to take the subtitles off. Studios have to think more globally and be less US centric, and give us, who speak several languages, the option to take off or put on the subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stroll through the history of our species.","review":"Blueprints is just what the title says. A look at how evolution performed its magic work, on our species and others. While I started reading this book knowing what evolution was, I left it knowing how it works. Taking you from the first scientific investigation of the relations of species, through to the discovery of DNA, Maitland Edey and Donald Johanson clearly and easily walk you through time. The concepts are explained simply and succinctly, in an entertaining style that often includes humorous incidents as the world of science lurched toward our current level of understanding. I would recommend this book to anyone, including students, who wishes to experience the evolution of evolution"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource!","review":"Don't worry if you are not a science-oriented person! This is a great resource for anyone interested in evolution, dna and natural selection. The book is almost a dialogue between the authors and each topic's history, growth and purpose is given in everyday language and images. If you are a scientist, you will still find this a valuable tool, especially if you've ever tried to explain some of these issues to non-scientists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought on Amazon, but not what they said it was!!","review":"The information says 250 ft.

This is very much a bootleg recording, as regards the sound quality. In fact both concerts sound just like rubbish, which is a shame, because the first tracks are excellent. One can more or less guess that Mrs. Ayler, Peacock and Murray are playing at the top of their games. Listening to this album is just like walking in the mist.

Well... only two tracks really add significant extra material (\\"Hubbin' It\\" and \\"Corine, Corina\\"). The four or five other tracks that are changed from the first CD usually have only a tacked-on intro of vocal doo-wops by Ray and Co. Worst remix is on the intro to \\"Yearning.\\" The tricky key-shifted loop is jarring in a western swing context. Overall you'll get 4 and a half more minutes of music on this CD. So, maybe it's not a great \\"dance remix\\" effort, but damn these tracks still swing! And \\"Corine\\" is actually a pretty good expanded track. I also think the mix has a bit more bass and some brightening on top. Liner notes don't provide any extra info. Ray, if I could make a suggestion: next time drop \\"Got a Letter\\" with its lame sentimentality and give the band some room to kick a bit more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"The CD was in poor condition - not good and certainly not Very Good, as advertised.

The usual female coming of age story of first experiences with womanhood and the opposite sex and how to tame them and man's eternal struggle with the voracious beast within that wants to \\"eat\\" blossoming females. i could go on, but i think you get the point. the screenplay was actually written by famed author angela carter who deals with such subjects as children's fairy tales and adult \\"fairy tales\\" of sexual politics. in the end, what difference does it make? either you become a wolf yourself or become the prey. either way you're dammmmmmnnnnneeddd....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb movie","review":"I purchased this movie because of a good review, but it must have been written by the makers of the movie. The acting is poor and the story line is so stupid. I can't even imagine why someone would think it was a great movie, much less to think about watching it more than once. Next Monday I'll be donating it to the Goodwill. A waste of my money. Don't buy it!!! You'll be wasting yours, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely concept, poor execution","review":"The concept of lycanthropy as a metaphor for sexual initiation is an interesting one, full of implications to keep a graduate student writing for days on end. Unfortunately, this film fails to adapt the concept smoothly, and its jarring visuals (really, could we not find even a couple of wolves for shooting, instead of using Belgian sheepdogs?!) undermine its attempts at real art.In the end, I couldn't decide if the confused scripting was a comment on the conflicting and tangled mythology of sex presented to most adolescents, or if it were simply a conflicting and tangled screenplay. In the end, it failed to move me.With its intriguing premise, it should have been better than it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have left it in the '80s","review":"I guess I've been spoilt by great special effects in movies in the decades since this film was made but even that reasoning can not excuse the poor story-line - a jumble of dreams and realities (although I'm not sure there were any realities in it). I really wished I hadn't bought it because now I have a DVD I know I will never ever watch again and could never bring myself to recommend or pass on to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Werewolf Movie Ever","review":"This is possibly the greatest werewolf movie ever made. I wouldn't call it horror, too cerebrel for that.

Sarah Patterson is the hormonally driven lead facing puberty and predatory men. A dangerous mix. Angela Lansbury is startling as the story-telling grandmother. David Warner is the sympathetic woodsman dad. Weird, wonderful and genuinely horrifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chilling Fairtytale","review":"An under-rated film that gets better with each viewing. This isn't your parent's version of Little Red Riding Hood.Filled with dark imagery and sexual tension, director Neil Jordan takes you on a journey to a place where the real monsters walk on two legs and wear a human face.Special note should be made of Angela Lansbury's performance as the Grandmother; a woman who is definitely more than she seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could've seen it in the theaters!","review":"One of my all time favorites is this beautiful gem of a movie that gets better every time i see it. And i have seen it plenty of times, believe me! I wish i couldve seen it in the theatres. i am sure when this was released it did not get the attention it deserved!Its about a young girl Rosaleen(excellantly played by Sarah Patterson) who dreams of a fantasy world of werewolves and witches. Her Grandma Angela Lansbury tells her these tales to warn her away from men but of course she doesnt listen. And one night comes knocking on Granny's door wondering who's inside....This movie has beautiful scenery, a beautiful score by George Fenton, excellant direction, and great FX. The end where fantasy and reality meet is quite a twist. If you have not seen this gem see it and give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granny is wolfy, too!","review":"Elements of every fairy tale you've ever heard are woven into this quirky, masterful story of the wolves who are \\"hairy on the inside\\". Sexual themes (but not much violence) make this film unsuitable for children under 13, but you won't see too much nudity or explicit sex. It's highly symbolic.Little Red Riding Hood learns that Granny is much more than a helpless old lady, and the wolf is not so powerful that they can't defeat him. In fact, the wolves that run through the forest in this fantasy are much better than some of the people who hunt them down. You never know what's going to happen next. Some of the sequences seem out of place and apropos of nothing, but the film as a whole tells a basic moral story that can benefit our ailing society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but hard to hear","review":"I like this movie better each time I see it. It is a slow-moving lush creepy dream of a story based on Angela Carter's The Bloody Chamber. Its werewolves are very fake, which I think is intentional. It's really a coming-of-age story.The DVD however has the same problemas my old video copy: I have trouble hearing all the dialogue: the voices are very soft and the music very loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric visual and musical beauty beyond comparison...","review":"I was amazed when I first saw this film in the mid-1980s. This film captured my heart and touched on that fantasy world atmosphere I've envisioned since I was a child more so than any other film I've ever seen. The Company Of Wolves is a sort of glamourised, horrific telling of the tale, Little Red Riding Hood. The casting, the lighting, the camera angles, the beautiful dream world atmosphere, the special effects, and the old world-style of story telling is remarkable. This film has a passionate soul. Equally remarkable and integral is George Fenton's fantastic impressionist/romantic musical score to the film.If you are a fan of well-made, intelligent horror films, and/or of atmospheric fantasy films like, for example, \\"Legend\\", you'll simply fall in love with this buried and thoroughly underrated gem of a film by Neil Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book - NOT FROM THIS PUBLISHER, THOUGH!!","review":"I purchased this book in paperback - I can't comment on any other versions - and there are SO many spelling, punctuation and publishing errors it is almost impossible to read.

Where the band remains the same, there is a subtle jazzier sound with a few saxaphone solos thrown in to boot. At the same time the compositions sound less complex if not less sophisticated. There is little resembling their classic recordings (Darwin, Io Sono Nato Libero) but it is not too far removed from Come In Ultima Cena. With perhaps much more of an emphasis on briefer and less complex compositions (8 in all). Still, this is still quite a progressive work which is surprising given that most prog bands were abandoning the scene in droves by the late 70's(see Genesis, Yes, Strawbs and PFM for some examples). At this point the band was still maturing nicely. Francesco de Giacommo is present and is in fine voice. Perhaps not essential but still highly recommended..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canto Di Primavera","review":"The album's title sounds somewhat like a veal entree in an Italian ristorante, the contents is quite close to it too. Some instrumental passages are reminiscent of the group's early years and suggest that the former mastery is hiding behind the mediocrity of the music. A couple of exuberant songs (the title track inclusive) are variations on themes of a little shepherd girls' choir, the rest is outright boring, best when used for an acupuncture session, highly recommended for the occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written out of history - an eye opener","review":"I am fairly knowledgeable in Jewish history and yet was amazed at the documented histories of orthodox women in such diverse roles as Talmudic authorities and heads of Orthodox Yeshivas.

I thought I scored by picking up a used one for around $26. Not so much. The original list price was $12.95. For that, it's not so bad. There's very little text and the photos are abundant but not terribly impressive. The vintage pictures of the Connie in commercial service are basically not-terribly-good reproductions of the famous shots we've all seen before. (i.e. the cover shot). The rest are photos that presumably the author took himself fairly recently of restored / derelict Connies at Pima and other places. Also, there's an over-concentration, (in my opinion), on military variants, possibly because of the availability of photo subjects.

Anyone who has looked at Germany from the outside, or lived there as a foreigner, will find a little of themselves in Mr. Fisher's book.

I didn't get it. While the passages giving individual accounts were interesting and well-written, the passages taking a broader look at the country brought the term \\"hatchet job\\" to mind. They read as if the author had decided before starting what he wanted to find and chose to disregard, or at least gloss over, anything which didn't fit in with that. There was also a language mistake which wholly invalidated an important part of the chapter on racism. A pity really, as there are points worth making on this subject.

Usually I can get my head around complex sentence structures, but Haynes' writing is a joke. Where was his editor in all of this?I'd say don't bother with this book, even if you're willing to slog through the pedantic and error-filled paragraphs. His minimal use of documentation and his embarrassing lack of understanding of Shakespeare, on whom he relies hugely to outline his concepts, will just madden the serious researcher and confuse the casual reader.

Still boring? Definitely. A dry translation of each line into its literal dictionary meaning makes for awkward, stilted prose and dull reading. These side-by-sides are all the same - except for one:William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet Uncensored. Whatever it is, this one is definitely not boring.

Secondly, he has to milk the cow and lay the hay down. Robert lost his freind Pinky, a pig and he felt bad. He had to eat him and he didn't even cry! He just cared for his father then cause he knew his father was going to die soon. It almost made me cry!! I liked the book a lot and i give it a four in half star rating because the author explains to you how evertything happens. There are so many lessons I learned and we learned the birth/death situations. Their is lots of humor in the book like when Rob has nothing on and the cow is dragging him around in prickles. I hope more people will read the book and will have mixed emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day No Pigs Would Die by: Adam L. 19861","review":"I encourage many people to read this book. It tells a story about a boy who gets brought up different form kids today. His dad always told him that hard work will get you far. His dad was never gentile with him either. The only thing he ever owned was a pig. It is a humourous as well as a depressing story. It talks about the family being in hardships. The only thing they were really rich in was their love for one another. The family pig farms for a living and don't get out much. Until oneday when the son enters his pig in the fair.

The book practically put me to sleep and if I wasn't forced to read it I wouldn't have. The characters were very boring and there was too much conversation. There was a lot of blood and gore in this book such as when the characters slaughtered Pinky. \\"His privates were alert and ready too breed her\\". This quote was about two pigs breeding and I think this part was unnecessary. On the plus side, this book did have a few humorous parts. An example is, when Rob goes to a fair and doesn't know what a pervert is, so he tries to find one. The book \\"A Day No Pigs Would Die\\" was not the worst book I've ever read, but it surely wasn't the greatest. Because the subject of the book was definitely not something I'm interested in, I probably would not recommend it to any of my friends. Two Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Day No Books Should Sell","review":"I disliked the book A Day No Pigs would die because of the extremely slow pace. The content was boring.

Robert also builds a friendship with his dad.Although this book was touching, it was also extremely disgusting. I personally did not like this book very much because of so much animal cruelty and it was such an easy book. As a 9th grader, I think this book should not be assigned for reading because it's point less and not challenging at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Paper and Time","review":"I think this book is a very bad book. It in no way what so ever interests me. Some of the scenes are down right disgusting. I don't recommend this, in fact I hope no body else reads this book for they're own sake. This book has stomach-turning scenes and is no age groups should read this. Some of these gruesome scenes are when Samson is trying to breed Pinky. It goes into great detail saying \\"the blood ran down her leg\\" and other phrases you may never want to hear. The book was very slow-paced and what I have learned from this book I will never use in my entire lifetime. The book was slow paced because it never really got interesting and it wasn't something you always felt like reading and hated when it ended.

Not only was the book boring, (it was about a family of hillbillies, if that gives you any idea), but gruesome too, and I'm not sure it was appropriate for our age reading. For instance, the book intensely describes the mating of two pigs. \\"His privates were alert and ready to breed her.\\" This was not necessary in the writing of this book and only made me want to put the book down (and I would have had I not been forced to continue by my teacher). And as if the book was not boring enough with it's main characters hillbillies, the author had to write chapters upon chapters of more or less nothing but playing with frogs and pigs. As you can probably tell from my writing tone, I would never recommend this book and have very good reason not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book I have ever thrown away","review":"This book was fraught with inaccuracies (who has ever heard of a Shaker family? they're celibate!) and gruesome scenes, starting in the first chapter.

The book was very annoying with the bad grammar and all the bad content. There was no reason for all the graphic content. I couldn't make it through the last two chapters without crying and cringing. It was a terrible book. I still don't see why the father died and why they had to kill the pig. On the back of the book it says- \\"Reading this book is like sipping hot cider in front of a crackling potbellied stove. Every page is suffused with wit and charm and glowing with warmth.\\" Whoever wrote this must hate sitting in front of a crackling fire sipping hot cider because this was the WORST BOOK EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!

I found this book anthing but that. It has graphic violent descriptions that add nothing to the factually weak story of a so called \\"Shaker family\\". I would never recommend this book to anyone. As an adult I found it disturbing-as a parent of a young avid reader I am now even more aware of not judging a book by its cover or at least the words on the cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrriing!","review":"I gave this novel, \\"A Day No Pigs Would Die\\", one star. The reason I did so, is because I thought this was a terrible book. The writer, Robert Peck, wrote this story using very graphic details, and with a very \\"intense\\" word choice. Basically, the story was about a boy and his pig, growing up on a farm. However, the story's nasty details really make the peaceful setting a lot gorier. An example was the murder of Pinky, Robert's pig. Another is when they try to breed Pinky. My last example is the birth of Bob, Aprons baby cow. If the choice were up to me, I would not recommend this story to ANYBODY! It is far too gory, nasty, and horrific to be worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring and Very Depressing","review":"Peck's A DAY NO PIGS WOULD DIE was extremely boring at first, and wasn't very enjoyable. It was very depressing and it seemed absolutely pointless after a while. Can't the author even make up names???? And everything had the simple excuse, \\"You're a man.\\" If anything sad happened, it was because you were a man. Very boring and very depressing, I give it 2 stars because it shows you how bad your life COULD BE and the struggle of it if you haven't experienced it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a good book except the death of Pinky","review":"I was reading this book for school, and I came to the part of slaughtering the pet pig, Pinky.I read this part and I feel that it was too descriptive and now it is causing me to have some thoughts about being a vegeterian.The story was interesting to learn about the Shakers' way of life, and although I do understand that slaughtering animals puts food on the table, I still think that that particular description could have been more left to the readers imagination. Why did the Author name the book \\"A Day No Pigs Would Die,\\" with a virtual blow-by-blow description of the slaughter itself?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a extermely boring and dull book.","review":"I don't recommend this book to others. This book starts very fast past and then winds down. At first the language that it is spoken in is extermely hard to understand. It opens as the boy skips school and is wandering and finds his neighbors cow about to give birth. Then he sees that she is having problems and tries to help her. If want your sanity don't read it. I am only reading this book because it is a school assignment. Give this book two stars is being very generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in teaching old time values!","review":"I have used this book for several years in my classroom of lower level students as a novel unit in which I created my own materials and projects. This book has taught my students alot about how life used to be and how young adults looked up to their parents and the work that they did to earn a living. Also, to show my students how much neighbors helping neighbors was so important in those times. Many of the students had never even heard about such values that were held in those days.

I liked the book because it was realistic, funny, and suspenseful. I didn't want to put down the book. The characters were \\"down to earth.\\"The best part of the book was when the boy and his pig got to go to the fair with the neighbors. The pig got the best behaved pig blue ribbon. The worst part was when the grandfather died. Nobody in the family was sad or at least they didn't seem like it because nobody cried.The most vivid thing to me was the setting and the climax. The setting was so descriptive. I could imagine a farm and a house on a rolling plain. I could also imagine the fields, cows, chickens, and the inside of the house. The climax's were very descriptive! I could imagine the fair, the weasel and the dog fighting in a barrel, the boy getting chased by a bull, and last but not least the grandfather dead in his wooden coffin."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.","review":"This was a great book. I got hooked on to it very easily since the first page. Why? It has everything- love, friendship, drama, suspense, and surprises on every page. The first time I saw this book, I was sure that I wasn't going to read it- it had a dumb title. But I found out that the good books always have the most weirdest titles. It talks about the life of a Vermont farm boy on the verge of manhood and his struggles. Good job, Robert N.Peck!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Beef Is About Pork.","review":"Characters in conflict is what moves a story along. The conflict, or \\"beef,\\" in this book is about a young boy's pet pig. The story develops this way:Boy saves neighbor's calf. Grateful neighbor gifts boy a piglet. Boy makes pet of pig. Boy's strict father frowns on gift. Boy's father butchers pigs for a living. Now that's conflict.This somber, touching book describes Shaker farm life in New England, and provides an excellent exploration of the relationship between father and son. Its apparent beef may be about pork, but underlying that is a sophisticated coming-of-age essay. Definitely worth a look. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why make young readers' lives more miserable than they already are?","review":"Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of \\"Life sucks and then you die\\"?What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great and exciting.","review":"This novel by Robert Newton Peck was great.

What could that person have been thinking when he/she wrote that review???A DAY NO PIGS WOULD DIE may be an honest assessment of farming and animal husbandry in the 1930s, but it's one of the most horrifying books I read in 1973. I was eleven, in junior high, and I literally thought I was going to throw up by the end of the last chapter. The only positive thing that came from my reading A DAY NO PIGS WOULD DIE is that it reaffirmed my respect for all living creatures, and made me a lifelong animal-rights supporter."},{"rating":"2","title":"6th Grader's Review","review":"A Day No Pigs Would Die is about a twelve year old boy named Rob who finds his neighbor's cow and helps it give birth. Rob's neighbor is grateful and gives Rob a baby pig in return. The book tells of their great adventures and their friendship, creating unforgettable, sad and happy moments. Rob is a very determined and caring boy who is rather quiet. He works on the farm with his dad and learns what it takes to be a farmer.This story makes you feel incredibly emotional and sad the way Peck tells about what hard times he goes through.Although it is a very moving, deep and fabulous book, the description of how he's feeling and what is around him is very brief. People who enjoy leisurely and slow, sad books would enjoy this wonderfully weaved story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice for any reading.","review":"Dear Parents,The book A day No Pigs Shall Die should not be on any reading list. I do not recommend it. I mean to the point that when child #2 was supposed to read that book at her Christian school; I said I would take her out of class for that section and she could flunk.This book is a nightmare maker. Child #1 (My oldest daughter) read the book and I was shocked that any school would have it on any reading list. Especially a Christian school! It is a cheap attempt to get middle school boys to show emotion. It flat out wrongly depicts Shaker life and faith, chronicles an adulterous affair and graphically retells the slaughter of a loved pet. Let alone the rape scene.

I liked the way it got more vivid and more interesting as you read further to the end. Personally, I like horror or comedy books and even though this one was sad it was still a book I will always remember. It really shows how easily pleased and upset children can be. Being a teenager myself, I can picture myslef in the little boys place and I think I would act the way he did in certain situations. I would recomend this book to any animal lover of any age. I think this book shows people that a human's connection and love with any animal is irreplacable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is Informative But Short.","review":"I thought that the book A Day No Pigs Would Die was a good book by the author Robert Newton. I don't read a lot and I thought that it was a good book for middle school students and up. It has content that I would have considered unusual or uncomfortable two or three years earlier. Robert Peck, the main character of the book goes through many changes over the course of this book (one year) and eventually becomes a man. This book contains little bits comedy, like in a part of the book when Rob goes to a fair with his neighbors and it shows his innocence, or with his vocabulary. Finally the story is has a large amount of thinking to it, you have to wonder what is going to happen in the next chapter. I chose four stars because this book informs me about the life of a shaker boy on a farm and how it is exciting and boring at the same time! If you like to read informative books than I recommend this book to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with an open mind","review":"Reader: AGJ from MarylandThe book, A Day No Pigs Would Die, is only a so-so book. Robert Peck, the author, fails to expand on character and leaves much to be desired when it comes to plot. There is no particular plot. Peck just seems to randomly stick chapters in the novel. Most of the characters are under developed. Apart from Rob, the pig and his father are the only characters. The book was needlessly violent and graphic. Many animals fall victim to the author's violent tendencies. However, the author does get his point across. \\" Hear me God...it's hell to be poor.\\"(p.134) The point is: growing up is tough on everybody. My point is: this book is not for everybody. Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day No Pigs Would Die","review":"This delightful little novel is about a 13 year old country boy. In the first few chapters of the book nothing really happens that is to exciting. Rob the name of the main character in the book, receives a baby pig as a present for helping to birth a calf. But near the end of the book the setting in the book starts to change. Rob, now best friends with his pet pig, realizes that to save the farm he must let his dad slaughter his one and only friend Pinky, his pet pig. Once this happens the book starts to get interesting. Unfortunately his father dies and Rob realizes that he will need to take over the family farm. The book really doesn't get interesting until the last few chapters of the book; but in the end reading the whole book makes it worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Day no Pigs Would Die","review":"We gave the book \\"A Day no Pigs Would Die\\" two stars because it's really hard to follow, because of all the old fasion terminology. In some places it was funny, such as when Pinky wassearching for frogs, and a crawfish pinched Pinky on the snout and Rob had to pull it off and fling it back in to the stream.

Which is EXACTLY what I did. When I read the part where he butchers the poor pig, I literally tore the book apart and threw it in my trashcan with tears streaming down my face.I'm not going to preach about animal rights on here because I believe everyone has the right to their own opinion, but I will warn animal lovers and people who don't eat meat to stay far away from this book.

That being said, this book was not well written or interesting and I found it very offensive. The overwhelming theme of animal cruelty was too much for me.

It is about a twelve year Shaker boy who has helped a cow have her calf and is rewarded a young pig. It takes place in the 1930's when Calvin Coolidge was president in the town of Learning, Vermont.Robert and his pig, Pinky, are growing up together. He takes Pinky to Rutland Fair and Pinky wins best behaved pig. Robert's father's cousin was their neighbor's maid. She comitted suicide. Fall comes, apples are bad, and Robert's father can't shoot a deer. Robert's father is on the verge of dying.They try to breed Pinky several times, but no babies. Robert's father lives through the winter and dies in the spring. After the night they bury him, Robert says goodnight to his father.

The main charactor is Robert Newton Peck. He is a twelve year Shaker. The boy gets a pig for heping deliver a baby calf. The story takes place in Learning,Vermont. The story was written about seventy years ago. The authors first novel was A Day No Pigs Would Die. Robert doesn't like to get in trouble or do chores. When Robert gets cut up, his mother has to sew him up. Robert's father would usually fuss, but he doesn't.If I were to rate this book, I would give it five stars. To understand it, you would have to read the book. It's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life on the frontlines.","review":"This book illustrates what many Americans have experienced growing up on the farm. Life can be both brutal, and gentle. Peck has done a good job showing how close death really is to those not insulated from it as we are. I think that this is a good book to read to the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every minute","review":"What an eye opener for this generation! Welcome to the Shaker tradition of plain, earthy, reason. No frills. Where a man's word is second to his deed. I found this novel to be inspiring and humbling. Nowadays, we take so much for granted! Here is a family who earns or makes everything they have, and is gracious enough to consider themselves rich. Indeed they are - rich in faith, love, dignity, integrity, and community.This is an important coming of age novel for many reasons. Robert Peck has to face challenges that many Young Adult readers face: increased responsibility, the wanting of worldly possessions, and death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insensitivity Glorified","review":"I kept turning pages waiting for Robert's epiphany -- the moment he would realize the obscene cruelty of his family's way of life and take a stand against it. Instead, he comes to fully embrace it, to glorify it, without ever realizing that other paths are even possible. While the book has some literary merit, the message is morally unacceptable. The ability to repress compassion is NOT a virtue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that glorifies animal cruelty","review":"I'd give this book zero stars if I could. It sends a message that \\"growing up\\" involves butchering pets. There is also dog abuse and a nasty pig rape scene. And this book is assigned to children? We should teach children to respect and care for animals. This book graphically depicts harming and in one case murdering pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sharing book","review":"Adults and kids can share this book's values and story and talk about them together.

Not a dry eye here for the last dozen or more pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it.","review":"Though I'm sure there are many people out there who would enjoy this book, I am not one of them. I found this book to be one of the books I have enjoyed the least out of all the books I have ever read. The author was extremely too elaborate when it came to birth and death scenes, and if sad stories depress you, stay away from this one. The plot was not thought out enough, and at times the young boy in the story seemed to be way too ignorant for a boy his age."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Day No Pigs Would Die\\"","review":"Reader: ~Sara~Arnold, MarylandI thought the book \\"A Day No Pigs Would Die\\" was a waste of paper. First, the book was really graphic. There are several scenes in the book, which makes me disrespect farmers. Specifically, when they weaseled hussy. Also when they tried to breed Pinky, and when they slaughtered Pinky. Second, the words were hard to comprehend since they had poor grammar. Third, the book is not realistic for teens today and it doesn't appeal to them. I feel this way because the book takes place on a farm which no one now a day lives on and kids can't grasp the concept. In conclusion, I think that this book should have been printed about 60 years ago to have any success."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it was a pointless, dumb book - read Redwall instead","review":"It was a sad, sick, gross, depressing, ugly, totally pointless book.

I don't reccomend this book to any reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I used it to prop open my door","review":"This was a horrible book. The book was slow and it was disgusting. An example of this was when peck slaughtered Pinkey, and how rob kissed his bloody hand. Or when they described Hussey after she came out of the barrel. There is no information in the book that I will ever use in my life. The family in the book was \\"shakers\\" so why did they have children? That's really dumb. They were just a bunch of slack-jaws. The dialogue was odd and it was hard to understand. It was hard tolerate the book and its bad language after the first chapters. It was defenatly not a page-turner. And in what society do you save a cow and get a pig in return?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book","review":"It is not exciting at all.

Robert peck, the author, is telling the story of his life. I just hope his life really isn't as boring as the book. Although the book has some humorous parts like when his pants are ripped off by briar bushes, there are many disgusting and inappropriate parts like in chapter 13. Before our class read this book, I heard from other classes how graphic some parts in this book were. Also, this book does not have much of a plot. Robert's ideas are just thrown out in an un-organized way. I think that Robert should have had a professional writer, write down the events in Robert's life. I do not recommend this book for any ages to read. This book definitely does not keep your attention and is the slowest book I have ever read...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz...","review":"I would not recommend \\" A Day No Pigs Would Die\\" For many reasons. The book was about a shaker boy and a year of his life, as he gradually becomes a man. First this book has a very loose plot and many chapters were completely irrelevant to the plot and theme of growing up. I have to admit however; a few scenes were mildly amusing. The book itself has no clear audience intended. It seems to be written for a younger audience but some scenes are much too graphic and very disgusting. The book has a slow non-exciting plot. The entire book is boring and very lackluster. The ending leaves you asking too many questions and very little closure. There is no lesson learned from this book and is just a waist of time. I would only recommend this book to schools that are interested in killing of massive amounts of students by boring them to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was HORRIBLE!","review":"I would never recomend this book to anybody. There are numerous affaris, deaths, and the boy has to kill his pet. Who would wnat to read this garbage. I was forced to read it in school and I could barley make it through on page withough cringing! Do not waste your money on this book! I wouldn't even give this book 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time to Read","review":"The only good thing I can think to say for this book is that the writing is appealing. However, the scale of the misinformation on Shakers and farm life that this book includes is frankly astonishing. Why did Robert Newton Peck decide to include the bit about the family being Shakers? Moreover, why couldn't he have taken five minutes to research Shaker customs?Honestly, forget the \\"inappropriate content\\" in this book- it's marketing fabrication as realistic fiction.I suppose teachers think it helps us to get a sense of a different style of speaking. (Actually, my friend and I both noticed that the grammar gets noticably better in the course of the book for no apparent reason.)If you value your time, don't read it. If someone, such as your teacher or parent, is forcing you to read it, protest loudly. This book is a sheer waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Review","review":"I had to read this book for school and I really don't reccomend it.

It had some details I didn't really need to read. I thought it was too bloody, for example when they killed hussy and when they killed Pinky, it said, \\"the ground beneath our feet was spotted with hot pig blood. I think that some of the conversations didn't need to be included. Rob was talking to his father about a fence that is one example of a conversation. I also think it was too descriptive. I really hated this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Day No Pigs Would Die","review":"Robert Newton Peck's book, A Day No Pigs Would Die, is a great book for all ages. There are many enjoyable and unpleasant parts in the book. When Pinky, the pig, won the blue ribbon for the best-behaved pig was an enjoyable scene. When Pinky won the award, Robert, Pinky's owner, was very proud of himself for his work he had put into Pinky, and he was proud of Pinky for winning the prize. From the novel,I learned that one should always take care for a pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK","review":"I absolutely hated this book. We had to read it in school and I had a hard time finishing it because it was so boring. That is odd for me because I absolutely love to read. If you ask me this book has a poor storyline. Why would anyone want a pet pig, they should have bought him a dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to come with a warning for graphic content","review":"This book gave me nightmares as an adult. If you are a parent with a sensitive child or teen, especially one who is an animal lover, you need to know that this book contains graphic detail about animal killings. I am surprised that some schools are requiring students to read this book. Although I'm not advocating banning the book, educators should know better than to force students to read it. I agree with some of the young people who have written reviews stating that this book is horrifying. Tragic is one thing; brutal is another. The story could have been told effectively without creating gruesome images that overshadowed the plot. The author crossed the line with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day No Pigs Would Die","review":"This book was great. I wish I could read this over and over, well I do. Well, this book had a lot of neat stuff in it. I enjoyed it very much.

I found the book incredibly touching and it really helped define who I was as a person. I was always an animal lover and I'm glad at an early age I defined how important the life of an animal actually was to me. Although, it may be a bit much for a 7 year old. While I probably would have become a vegetarian eventually anyway, after reading this book I stopped eating meat and started campaigning for \\"Pig Peace\\" all through elementary school. I ended up studying zoology in college and still haven't eaten meat now 20 plus years later.All in all though, this was a great and emotional story. While, it may have been a lot for me to handle as a young child, it's a honest story of life. I'm very glad to have read it and wonder if my own story would be different without having the exposure."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring, and not a fun book, adults would appreciate it","review":"I thought it was depressing and pointless. my mom read it and liked it and appreciated it more because she is older. i dont like sad books.

My son was sickened by this book, I would like to warn all parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had no emotions for the characters in this book.","review":"Although I admire Robert Pecks's effort, I was not satisfied with this book. I hardly felt any emotions for the characters, and I had to force myself to finish the book. There is no definite plotline-- the entire book is like a journal that the main character wrote. There were hardly any significant events, and I do not think the Shaker way of life was portrayed in its true sense. After the climax, the main character suddenly matures from a foolish boy to a well respected man. I find this unbelievable, and I do not think that the book developed itself evenly, if at all. My last comment is the fact that this book is so uneventful, it leaves unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Day No Pigs WOuld Die Book Review","review":"This is a story about a boy named Robert Peck and his pig named Pinky who live on a farm in Vermont.

The scene about \\"weazeling the dog\\" and \\"breeding(or should I say raping) the barren pig were too much for me to stomach, let alone my 12 year old daughter. Needless to say, my daughter will not be finishing this book. Parents beware of this book if your youngsters are reading it at school. Please ask!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for kids","review":"This book is disgusting. The fact that it's foisted upon 6th graders is a real curiousity to me. My daughter was forced to read this book when she was 11 and could barely make it through. The teacher seemed to delight in her uncomfortableness with the book. I may be old fashioned, but this is not an appropriate coming of age book for children. The sex and the violence are just too graphic! If you have a sensitive child avoid this book if you can. If your teacher assigns it pen her down on what redeeming value it has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book but not without it's faults","review":"A Day No Pigs Would Die is a great book. You'll love it unless you don't like to read, or you can't stand being depressed by a story. The story itself I really won't go into though so I don't ruin it for you as the reader. My other problem that i had with this book is that I couldn't feel much for the characters in the book. It's possible though that since they are very different from myself that it was hard to relate to myself to them to make the reading experience more enjoyable. This book is great though, you won't regret buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book was excellent-I couldn't put it down!

Our heroes are captured on a medieval planet where it turns out the locals have telekinetic powers. Lacking such powers, our heroes are regarded as inferior \\"witlings\\".Vinge, as usual, writes well and has thought things through in interesting ways. Conservation of momentum causes interesting limits (and also interesting capabilities) for telekinesis. For example, it is cheap to move between points at the same longitude and opposite latitude. So the Summer kingdom has a single Imperial palace split between the hemispheres, and the Winter kingdom has annual migrations from North pole to South pole.Not \\"A Fire Upon the Deep\\", but that's a very high bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating world; excellent ideas","review":"Vinge describes a world in which teleportation is an everyday reality --he and clears up all the little details of plausibility which other writers were too lazy or uninformed to bother with.

It has white lights on the front, lights on the bottom light up the base and rear blue lights for the engines. The sound effects are thunder, crashing waves and the whine of the engines as the ship takes off. The lights stay on until you press the button again. It would be a shame to leave the ship boxed up.I got this on sale and was quite pleased with it even though I'm not a huge fan of the movie. Well, the blu-ray is nicely done too, and worth watching a few times.I'd give it five stars if the movie was better and the regular price of this version wasn't so expensive.

Maybe it did but I wouldn't know. I didn't read the novel. I was just interested in visual effects and the fact that it was a super hero movie. So I figured what the heck.

I would have liked to know more. It seemed compressed to me.2. Male frontal nudity in several scenes. I'd like someone to explain to me how that helped the plot/storyline.I saw this movie with a few friends who are less critical than I am and one of them asked afterwards if this movie warranted a \\"What The ----?\\".
