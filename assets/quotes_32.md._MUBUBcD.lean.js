I love this meditation book, and have found it very helpful. I love the book and CD combo. My only complaint, and it's not really a complaint, is that, at first, his meditation, was to me, a bit disruptive. When you try to meditate with him, it took me a time or too to get completely comfortable with his voice and allow it to be relaxing to me as well, but it wasn't that big of deal, just different.I almost gave this five stars, and maybe it deserves that instead of the four I attributed to it, because I have found it a very helpful meditation (especially because I've never meditated before - it's great for beginners)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyer does it for me so I loved this product","review":"I have been a Dyer fan for years, starting with his first book Your Erroneous Zones.

I think the seller should stop advertising the book as being sold with CD if there is no CD. False advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing & basically a waste of money","review":"Wayne Dwyer takes an entire book to spell out what could be explained in one or two paragraphs and then reiterates it again twice in the CD for the spiritually very slow.

What I wasn't prepared for at all was the heavy God the Father, Christianized focus of the CD. I don't see myself as a child of some male parent in the sky. The word \\"father\\" is not one of comfort for me and does not speak of co-creation, it speaks of the dominiation and exclusion I felt in my experiences with Patriarical religion. Dyer would have been better off not giving an omnipotent being a sex or suggesting a traditional \\"human\\" role for him.If the focus wasn't bad enough, his reading was just plain boring. I can read the lord's prayer on my own. I have a problem with people who sell CD's created from material which is in the public domain.

If anyone reading this comes away thinking that the book is about genuine meditation then they've unfortunately been duped. It is full of new age psycho babble and techniques that have very little to do with the heart of real meditation, but little else.

If you want to buy body kouros test it out someplace first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body Kouros = class","review":"Body Kouros is an excellent fragrance for fall/winter months. I say that because the fragrance is warming and a bit heavy. There is an almost edible smell to Body Kouros which makes it irrisistable. It lasts all day on my skin which is another great thing about it. It's strong enough so that only a little is needed. If you like Joop or Rochas then you'll like Body Kouros because they are all similar.

It is, in essence, a re-hash of the familiar food pyramid guidelines that advise low-fat, low-protein and high-carbohydrate diets, organized around specific cancers. The scientific basis, if there is one, relates to epidemiologic studies of cancer risk. It might be helpful to someone who is trying to reduce their risk of various cancers by altering their dietary habits, but I doubt if this book has much more to offer than most of what has been published on that topic over the past several years. It has no scientific grounding for those who already have cancer, and may in fact suggest dietary patterns that would undermine the nutritional needs of those who are already in treatment, when fats and proteins may be friends. For someone undergoing cancer treatment, or in recovery from that ordeal, it has very little to offer that the hand-outs in your doctor's office don't already tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"palm beach finest","review":"YES SUAVE SMOOTH IS ONE OF PALM BEACH FINEST.

Unfortunately, the rest of this album doesn't live up to that promise. \\"Wrong Again\\" has grown on me, and a couple of the other songs are pretty, but \\"Happy Girl\\" just annoys me (like that way too perky co-worker way too early in the morning), and most of the album is completely forgettable. Maybe it's just because I grew up on the rock side of the tracks, but Evolution strikes me as rather anemic . . . she'd be better off avoiding the unoriginal and mild-mannered tracks here and concentrating on songs like \\"Broken Wing\\" and \\"Wild Angels\\" that allow her fabulous voice to do its thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an example of a true \\"Artist\\"","review":"She puts her whole heart and sole into her music.

That is what Martina McBride's powerful voice does to me. Not only has she chosen beautiful, intellegent songs for this album (an evolution from past works) she knows exactly how to interpret them. Yes, she can belt out a chorus like no one else, like on \\"Be That Way\\" and \\"A Broken Wing\\" but she shows wonderful range and lets the song tell the story as in \\"Wrong Again\\" and \\"Whatever You Say\\". Her ballad cross-over \\"Valentine\\" proves that this country singer can not be stereotyped and stands in a class by herself. I would highly reccommend this cd to anyone who likes to feel their music in the pit of their stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I originally bought this CD because of Broken Wing. I had seen her perfom the song on a music awards program and the hair literally stood up on the back of my neck! And while I do play Broken Wing over and over and over, Wrong Again, Whatever You Say, Happy Girl, and Valentine are standouts, as well. Truly a keeper!For true diehard fans, her White Christmas CD is a treasure. If you don't have it, don't walk, run to the store and pick it up. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Music At Its Best","review":"Martina McBride may have the best voice in country music. This album is truly awesome, and much better than her current album \\"Emotion.\\" \\"Whatever You Say\\" is just a tremendous song and really showcases her voice.

I also recommend her first two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martina McExcellent!","review":"There are a number of great voices in Country music today, and Martina McBride is one of them. In her brand new album, \\"Evolution\\", McBride's voice sores through the rafters on such belters as \\"A Broken Wing\\", and \\"Whatever You Say\\". But McBride isn't just a BIG voice. She can sing very sweetly as well, and turns in an excellent performance of \\"Valentine\\", the gorgeous ballad of true love.With \\"Evolution\\", Martina McBride shows everyone in the Music industry today that big voices can come in small packages. Bravo, Martina! A top-notch performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is really true and makes an impression on you!","review":"Well, first I would like to state that this album really is an honest and true album that touches one personally. With songs to help you with loved ones(\\"Valentine\\"), breakups such as(\\"Still Holding On\\"), and (\\"Wrong Again\\"), they really emphasize on what is really taking place. Martina McBride can really bring out a certain dillema in one's life and express it with her lyrics and makes a person really understand. This C.D. has given me a chance to use each song personally and has helped me learn in life. No other album has really done that and that is why its so awesome! To live the life with heartache or enjoyment really helps you understand alot of things after you listen to Martina McBrid'e Evolution. I really pressure others to go out and buy this C.D. cause nothing seems to be better out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album","review":"I loved this album.

It has pretty bad range and a small clip size (I recommend getting a speed loader, makes loading a lot faster and easier.)The gun has pretty high velocity for the range, very light and looks AWSOME with the silencer (which by the way doesn't silence anything, it's just for looks.) Overall, I would not recommend this gun.

Especially with Blanchard and Jane Monheit's rendering of \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\". It may be respectful to follow the obvious template when doing another composer's music (as witness Brian Setzer's dead-on treatment of Prima's \\"Jump Jive an' Wail\\") but not when you're doing a whole album of that same composer. So Blanchard and Monheit make it impossible to listen to that old McHugh standard with half an ear when they switch it from quasi-Dixieland swing to a groove-oriented piece a la Brubeck, Zawinul or (even though we know him more by his voice) Connick Jr. The instrument that defines this pattern, of course, is the piano, but that's nothing new--Blanchard has always been great at writing and arranging for instruments not his own.

Also, the organizationm of the book, which is broken down by year, makes it hard to follow events that lasted multiple years. (lawsuits, product development cycles, etc.) It's a decent book if you're doing research, or if you're a hard core video game history fanatic, but otherwise I wouldn't reccomend it.

We mounted a pair in the rennaissance center and with the 21X optical zoom, we were quite impressed with the clarity and ease of operation. All functions on the cameras worked as advertised, to the point where we stopped thinking about whether or not the cameras were going to work.We also used a set of the cameras in some mobile units with comms back to the ops center. They worked great there as well. In those instances, we mounted the cameras on tripods inside the vehicles and everything was pretty much plug-n-play.For the price, I think we certainly got a good value for the money and we continue to use these cameras for other operations.Setup was easy and we didn't run into anything where we found ourself wanting more - except maybe for some way to add IR illuminators, but nothing one would expect to be integrated into the camera anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"Never have I waited with such anticipation for a cd as I have this one...Well worth the wait...he just keeps getting better."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"HIGH MILEAGE\\"","review":"This is one of the better CD's that I have bought.

The video is standard format with surround stereo for both English and Japanese audio sadly there aren't much extras mostly advertisement for some of the Naruto games but thats it.

Good movie to watch if you need a lift in mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I'm a huge fan of Katherine Heigl and watched this to see her. I was so disappointed! This movie is so bad that it could literally ruin a good actors career. I like movies that start out good, and this one does that, but it goes downhill so fast after the first 20 minutes that it's barely watchable. I almost quit a few times but wanted to see what happened when she found out that she married a killer. It was ridiculous how quickly she took it all in stride, even though at first she acted like she was going to leave him. Tom Selleck and Catherine O'Hara are MUCH too good for this flop, too. Don't waste your time.And, all those people who are supposedly \\"trained killers\\"? They certainly are terrible shots! When the lead characters are running out in the wide open with machine guns blasting away at them, they don't even get touched. and yet she hits people with one shot even though she's never shot a gun before? Just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twist at the end saved it from one star","review":"I was not expecting very much from this movie. And I did not get very much!

She's easy on the eyes and yet acts like she's attainable by any Joe Shmoe. (Knocked Up) This film, though it has an interesting premise, is super-boring. Not even Heigl's personality can raise it above it's snooze-fest status. And she makes an awful team with Ashton Kutcher. He needs to stick with side roles a la That 70s Show, cause he's certainly not leading man worthy.The one positive attribute to the movie are some of the scenic shots of Europe. It made me want to go on vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lame plot, but it's a funny movie.","review":"I admit, the movie had some great laughs.

What was supposed to be a plot twist ends up just muddying up the story and sapping all the energy out of the ending. Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher have decent chemistry, and there are flashes of it everywhere. But the scene when they finally begin working together (done effectively in Mr and Mrs Smith) lasts only about a minute here. In a lightweight fluff film like this, the predictable ending would have probably been better. As it is, seems a waste of all that star power. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light hearted, funny, and nothing too serious","review":"Sometimes I like to relax and watch a movie that really doesn't require any thinking. This movie fits the bill. Yes, it is totally unrealistic but that is kind of the point.

It is a nice romantic, but not too mushy for the guys, comedy with a little spy action thriller thrown in and a little bit of a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to NOT watch this film = do anything else.","review":"It occurred to my astute friend as we sat before the first 10 minutes of \\"Killers\\", that Ashton Kutcher is indeed a failed experiment subject created by the government to envelope Kermit the Frog in human skin. As he flopped on set and clumsily murmured his lines to a Miss Piggy impersonator (katherine heigl), it became quite apparent his stuffing may burst through any moment to reveal a more deserving (though admittedly inanimate) actor . Instead a flimsy bag of flesh stumbles at the feet of this \\"action/romantic/comedy/advertisement/ movie\\", and pitifully begs us to endure the malignant side effects of watching Ashton and Katherine pretend to act like they are actors. The only redeeming moments are manifested by Catherine O'Hara who seems to be acting like an alcoholic, though in fact merely became one while enduring the making of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Ashton Kutcher is not so great of an actor.

I realized after watching about five minutes of it that it's another vehicle for Ashton Kutcher to go shirtless and play the role of an irresistible hunk who can have sex with anybody he wants to because he's so well endowed and adorable. Even though he is physically attractive his personality and ego cancel it out. He's a terrible actor, the script is awful. Produced by Kutcher, it's a piece of nothing.Katherine Heigel's role is pathetic. She plays a one dimensional character who functions basically to drool over Kutcher.

Heigl could have been a welcomed eye candy, but she was covered from head to foot like a nun at all times. Oh, and she had that stupid little laugh... but I wrote about that stupid little laugh already. It was a stupid movie, made even stupider 'cause of her stupid little laugh. Kutcher was too young to be what he was supposed to be in this stupid little movie. In his favor he didn't have any stupid little laugh, which earned him the one point. Tom Selleck was lost in this stupid little movie. He was like, oh, well, they cast me here and I'll ride the stupidity the best way possible.

Mr. A. Kutcher is STILL pretty much playing Kelso (\\"That 70s Show\\") and never for a second did I believe him as a pro killer. Ms. Kat H shows just how limited her acting range is.

Boy was I wrong. It felt like a low budget party with all Ashton Kutcher's actor and comedy friends. Something of an impromptu skit with no production value whatsoever. The cast was miscast and the majority of actors just muddled through their terrible lines and select acting parts. Even the car chase scenes were lame, who can mess up a car chase now days? I found myself wishing they would catch and kill Ashton's charater and put him out of his misery. How can they produce such dribble? I throught that movie was a contest for who could perform the worst, and there were many in this movie that meet that bar. What was the deal with Catherine O'Hara?

To respond to the previous review: I agree that the title of the book, and even the introduction make the book sound like it teaches manipulation. But it does not. Flip past the first few pages, and it will teach you to understand where other people are coming from. I've found personality typing really does help me to have more compassion and patience with people who are different from me.

It provides insight (albeit limited) into the underlying causes for different personality types but is soooo generic that it really has no real world applicability.

So, while I find them useful and will buy them again when I have a need, I'm not sure what type of cord you would use to fit 8' in there. One other thing, because they are made for stacking, there is a nodule on the bottom of each, meant to be inserted into the top of another.

I can't imagine how it has gotten so many good reviews. I almost can't believe Fern Michael's wrote it. The characters are completely one dimensional, the plot makes no sense, and the whole thing is riddled with inconsistancies. The worst though, is the dialogue. Completely unrealistic. Very dissappointed. I kept holding out, hoping it would get better, but gave up about halfway through. This is first book that I was so fed up with, that I wasn't able to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read!!","review":"It does not happen often that I read a book and find it utterly boring. I found myself skipping pages, trying to see ahead and hoping that it would get better. The book description says that these are childhood best friends, it seemed to me like they were childhood enemies. I did not like any of the characters in the book, Callie especially is so selfish and unlikable. The rest don't fare too well either, Brie and Sela spend their time either quarreling or dwelling in self pity and Bode is so insecure that it gets sickening, after a while I even started disliking Mama Pearl. I made myself finish this book just because I had paid for it, otherwise, I would have thrown it away. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad \\"Yesterday\\" is gone.","review":"A very juvenile story. At first I loved Mama Pearl, but towards the end I wasn't sure.

From the very beginning I was wondering, is this just me or is this a really silly story. I had a very hard time believing thirteen and fourteen year olds could support a home and people in it with a newspaper route. The dialogue between the friends was very unrealistic, and so was there behavior. I really don't think a top cop, who is now FBI, would go around threatening to use her gun every time she didn't get her way. I could go on and on with the strange behavior, but all in all I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad story with a happy ending!","review":"This was a difficult book to get through. It was sad, sad, sad with a little angst thrown in. Sad books make me sad and I was sad for three-fourths of the book. It was well written, although Ms. Michaels does tend to ramble on her single dialogs. They don't flow naturally. It was an interesting story and I fell in love with Pearl and cried when she [ALERT: SPOILER] died. The last 100 pages, the characters got their individual acts together and moved from 'yesterday' to today and looked forward (for the first time) to the future. would I recommend this book? Only if you want to be SAD for most of the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash and Burn","review":"The premise of the novel is a promising one: Brie, Bode, Sela and Callie are four best friends brought up together to think of one another as siblings under the watchful eye of Mama Pearl. They all meet back up as Callie plans the wedding of the century to the affluent Wyn. The set up of the story goes off beautifully and drew me in... but then the story crashed and burned. There are far too many holes in this story and the stories that are completed are so unreal it cheapens the story even more. I would reccomend that one should borrow this novel, as I did, rather than pay for it.Oh and why oh why does Fern switch from Bode to Bawdey? I don't know why but this was one thing that really bothered me the most!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I thought this book was horrendous. There were no especially likable characters, with the possible exception of Hatch. The thing was so long winded it was hard to keep track of people.

Juxtaposed guitar riffs swirl around relentlessly heavy, pounding drums and absolutely brutal vocals (it seems as if Muhammed had a medical dictionary handy when he wrote the lyrics) seem all the more impressive when it is realized that this masterpiece was the uncompromising result of one man's vision.

Some of the other reviews might be more informative if you are planning on building, because I am not a carpenter. It was interesting reading about the various woods, the pros and cons of the different kinds. The book if full of tips for building that are also helpful to the buyer. The chapter on building drawers, talked about how they are joined, various fronts and what can go wrong. A really major part that was missing from this section, that even I as a novice noticed, was the drawer glides information (what should you use (lower bottom, side slides, metal vs wood)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short on details","review":"This book is very vague.

I was thrilled to find a qualified woodworking author that uses production techniques such as pocket hole joints and brads as apposed to dovetails and mortise and tenon for the bulk of the joinery. Schmidt's workmanship speaks for itself. I wanted to build beautiful and durable kitchen cabinets not museum pieces.

Excellent training sequences, some of the best I've ever seen anywhere. And by the end of the movie, Gordon Liu is a solid fighter. His kung-fu is excellent and there is some good history in the shaolin training methods. There could have been a little more in the fight scene department, but definetly a classic for the training scenes alone. The fight scenes are great, it's just that they are a little short. Gordon Liu has become one of my favorite martial artists and if you really want to see him shine, pick up: \\"Fists of the White Lotus\\" and \\"Shaolin Challenges Ninja\\" 5 stars each and 2 of the best kung-fu movies ever.

But that was the point...He needed to impress upon us the fact that most movie martial arts were bogus. He didn't want us to end up in a real life situation and try to \\"Chuck Norris\\" somebody and get ourselves hurt.In the case of this video, he wanted to show us what real life training and practice could do, but with a \\"Aren't you glad you don't have to train like *that*?\\" attitude.This remains my favorite Kung Fu movie of all time.

This camera has no limit on the video length, like most do.Also, go to the Kodak site and compare the Video Size and Frames Per Second (fps) with other cameras and you'll see they don't compare.For the price, I think you'd have a hard time finding a 5 MP camera as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"kodak easy share-with dock","review":"Camera was purchased for my 70 year old father.

I contacted Kodak and sent it in for repair under warrantee. After several weeks, Kodak contacted me a stated that the camera was not repairable and that the damage was not covered under warrantee. The stated that the problem was due to liquid damage and that if I wanted the damaged camera back I was going to have to pay them to return it.This camera was never exposed to any liquid (at least not after I purchased it). I can't believe a company like Kodak would operate like this. I did a little research and found out that this power problem is common with this camera and yet they are trying to tell me that I am responsible, not their poor quality. They did state that they would be willing to give me a little discount on a new Kodak camera. WHAT A SCAM! I will never buy another product from this company. Stay away from this camera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodak Will Never Get Another Dime From Me","review":"I bought this camera and have taken literally a handful of pictures with it. At first I was just disappointed because my Canon was stolen and thought that a Kodak with an extra MP would be moving up, because it wasnt! The quality of the picture was horrible! Then I decided to try the video recording only to have the thing turn off on me and, like one of the users before me found out, it refused to turn back on! The light would turn on, the screen would turn green and then,... shut off. I am extremly disappointed and a long time customer now searching else where. This is the worst camera on the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Kodak","review":"I had high hopes for this camera. I have had around 15 digital cameras.

Exposure was seldom correct. the flash will not go off at less than 24 inches. I was not able to get a usable picture of my computer's mouse because of this flash problem.

If you have ever read or studies Travell's work - then you need to see this book.The biggest problem with this book is that it is not widely available - I have contacted Dr. Laws to get a copy - I strongly recommend you do the same.

This is the most complete prenatal that I could find - more nutrients and higher percentages of nutrients than anything else I researched, including the prenatals that my ob prescribed to me. I really appreciate that Solgar does not use any preservatives, corn, sugar, wheat, yeast, or dyes in this product. Even though you have to take four fairly large pills per day for this, per the dosing instructions, I have never felt queasy or nauseous after taking this, even in the morning-sickness phase of my pregnancy (I take all four right after dinner).Unrelated to this product - I also take a b complex, fish oil, D, and additional folic acid supplement (which I also took for a long time before conception). This combination seems to be working very well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another","review":"After taking these prenatal vitamins for a couple of weeks, I'm looking to switch brands.

Conveniently, they put that little fact on the opposite side of the label from the nutrition facts. Luckily I saw it before I took them, but I am out the cost of the entire bottle.

This morning I happened to notice that the 800 mg is per serving - which is 4 giant pills a day! Even my \\"One a Day\\" vitamins have 400 mg in just one vitamin!

The instrumentals are outstanding, especially Green Eyes - a truly beautiful piece of music. Getting the full meaning of Gypsy takes several listenings, and when you 'get it', it is astounding. John O'Dreams is charming. This isn't the best version of Outside Track - that's the live version on Summer Lightning - and American Jerusalem is pretty overwrought.

The fleece material is strong and not prone to tearing, and the supports keep their shape fairly well even when driving them into thicker soils. I would have given this five stars if it were just a bit larger: the broccoli has now grown too big to fit under the fleece tunnel. As they approached getting too big, it was sometimes difficult to get the fleece off the plants without tangling it up in itself, since I was paying more attention to not damaging the young plants. Overall, though, a very handy way to cover and protect smaller crops (a row of strawberry plants would be ideal)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of poetry","review":"I can't recall the number of copies of this book that I have purchased. My own autographed copy remains a constant on my bedside table, doggeared, starred, and underlined. It is filled with the lovely, quiet poems of Wendell Berry, a true genius in the crafting of words. These poems, compiled over many years of Sunday walks (thus the Sabbath Poems), harken to the quieter side of life. The inevitable changing of seasons, places, and people. We all need a little space for thinking. Berry reminds us of who we are and why we're here. In a quiet way. Buy this book for yourself.

This is THE reason fiction writers should not write explanatory prose - they can't write clearly, coherently, or concisely. I was assigned this book for a creative writing class, and still do not know what the heck these people are talking about. I'm sure these people are very smart and have great information, but they're just bad writers.

In many ways than not, the book starts with you then says forget it here's a plan to just go and get it, whether you are that type of person or not. The success stories are great, but if you are not developed enough of who you are and use the book as a stepping stone, then you're probably going to rethink this approach.

Nielsen is very funny in a different way than usual for him, as an absent minded businessman, always thinking of making a profit (he comes up with the title idea), seeming oblivious of the consequences. Along with the humor the story gradually becomes more of a heartwarming drama, so I recommend this film for families to watch together - get some laughs if nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"To little information about Regions","review":"The movie would not work in my DVD player as it was the wrong Region.

You will not be dissapointed to own or listen to this album in front of any of your friends, family memebers, or complete strangers.

They had just released their album Dear 23. They signed our cds and took out their guitars and played a wonderful acoustic show that I'll never forget. I knew some but not all of their songs back then. The ones I didn't know were from Failure. I looked and finally bought it. It was by far my favorite of the group. I don't like most of their recent stuff, but Failure and Dear 23 will always be my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT!","review":"Failure is without question the best CD release in a very long time.

I hope there are more published. I appreciate the fine photographs, the brief and informative descriptions.

The great shots, the missed opportunities and the strategy that is competitive golf. A triumphant Tiger Woods, in the end, talks about focus and the singlemindedness it takes to win at Augusta, and, particularly interesting, he describes some of the shots he used in critical situations that ended up working out just the way he had practiced them in anticipation of being in the exact situation during the tourney. Fascinating stuff from a brilliant golfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but poor quality.","review":"I thought the coverage of the tourney was great and the full post interview was interesting, would've like some more players thoughts I guess though.

This is truly a valuable first-hand account, at least for the record of religious anthropology.Some flaky spiritual 'teachings' get mixed in too, of course, which arent necessarily worth believing, such as:\\"The point I'm getting to is that it takes one hundred thousand prostrations to get one good one.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring Tale of a Spiritual Journey","review":"This is really a great book and one that I would recommend to anyone interested in devotional spirituality, especially Hindu and Buddhist.

I learned to play the dotara, not an ektara as he mistakenly calls it, from listening to his chants. And I read his book, wondering if he might not be an undiognosed bi-polar individual. I too wrote of my life, battle with the bottle, gurus, time in India and prison, and the self-forgiveness necessary to forgive myself for the life I created inStill Singing, Somehow. I agree with most all of the reviewers here, but still this book is like no other and well worth reading.

Reading the book will lead you to your own conclusions.I thought it was a lot of fun and I ate the book up in a day or two. But I really found the denouement muddled.

As a fan since the release of Picture Book (1985) and seeing them live at the Beacon in New York City, Simply Red can do no wrong as far as I am concerned. Having everything they have released on CD and just as much on the original vinyl they originally released their sound on.

One more salute to Mick and the boys still Holding Back the Years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slice of history","review":"While inevitably much of this book is dated - it was written in 1961, as jazz was reaching a crest - that's also one of its strengths. Hentoff's account of the 1960 Newport Jazz Festival riots is fresh and indignant; his peek at recording dates by Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis (for Sketches of Spain!) are fascinating; and though his profiles of Mingus and Davis don't reveal any surprises, the ones for Count Basie, John Lewis, and Ornette Coleman are engrossing. It's too bad that the prediction he made in the new introduction from the 70s that rock n' roll fans would turn to jazz in disillusionment never came to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED THIS BOOK","review":"I was really excited to get my hands on this book because I am a REALLY BIG Prince fan, and it turned out to be one of the most dissapointing things I have ever read about Prince. The person who wrote this book, Michelangelo Matos, did a really bad job, he messed up some of the facts in the book and a lot of it is written in a way that is snobby, like he is trying to be extra smart but you can tell he really isn't. And also, the author writes more about himself in the book then Prince, like I care about Michelangelo's life! I wanted to read more about Prince and more about what went into this album but there wasn't enough of that and the way the songs are described is kind of stupid. It doesn't make me understand Prince or the album any more. I think Michelangelo Matos wrote this book to try to impress his friends, not to actually write a good, interesting books for Prince fans. That's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the research?","review":"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. This book lacks anything inregards to research. As the previous reviews have pointed out, Ireally didn't expect this book to be about the author and what hewas doing at the time of \\"Sign of the Times\\" release. I wasn'tvery happy. And while I'm at it, I'd like to quickly educate oneof the previous reviewers on this book: Robert D. Johnson. He saidhe was \\"just getting into Prince\\" Where have you been the last 20+years or so? And did you actually say one of Prince's parents waswhite? Your research is worse than the author of this book. Justto set the record straight, the Nelson family is all black. Oh, in case you didn't know, that's Prince's real last name... You havealot to learn my friend... Michael"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy pass...","review":"I'm actually sorry I read this book. I don't honestly believe the author loves the source material as much as he mentions repeatedly during the autobiographical first half of this publication. His actual song-by-song dissection of the album is a big, pompus 'MEH' and super bummed me out. I do, on the other hand, feel good about having properly recycled Michaelangelo Matos' self-indulgent pamphlet along with the Sunday paper and my small collection of empty toilet paper tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want My Money Back","review":"I have read at least 20 books in the 33 1/3 series and this was definatley the worst one. I agree with the people who said its more about writer, Michelangelo, than about Prince. I think the Seth guy who wrote that other review got paid off by the writer to write what he did, because this book is not like a discussion about Prince with your best friend but about some guy I don't care about's life, and then a bunch of stuff about Prince that didn't make sense as if he didn't even listen to the album really. Dosen't matter though because I looked up the Seth guys writing and he's an even more horrible music writer than Michelangelo. Anyways, whatever, the point is there are lots of other better books in this series to spend your money on, this one was a waste of time and $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste!","review":"I can't even give this 1 star, but since we're not allowed to give less...I remember very well the day i came across it in a book store quite by accident. I snatched it up so fast, my wife almost hit the floor trying to duck out of my way! Imagine my disappointment upon finding out it was basically one man's life story that surrounded the release of this album on cassette, when i actually thought (hoped?) it told the story of the MAKING of this landmark album, you know, how the songs developed, who was involved, what year he began the songs, etc. That would have been interesting. At least more interesting than the misconstrued lyrics the author wrote about.For the record, Prince does not sing \\"Honey if you LET me, i just might do something rash...\\" in \\"Strange Relationship.\\" The lyric is \\"Honey if you LEFT me...\\" for those of you who learned the lyrics listening to the cassette."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it AT ALL!","review":"I found the characters stilted and unbelievable. These are supposed to be \\"REAL\\" people?It is just my opinion but my copy goes up for sale today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"For Sherlock fans like me I'm a Sherlock fan. This is good.

VERY WELL DONE. THERE ARE FOUR CASES INCLDED IN THE 2 DISC SET.VERY MUCH IN KEEPING WITH THE STYLE DOYLE USES TO CREATE THE HOLMES STORIES LATER IN HIS CAREER. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DR. BELL AND DOYLE IS DEEPENED WITH EACH CASE. VERY ENJOYABLE.. RECOMMEND IT TO ALL HOLMES FANS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pilot...Poor DVD...","review":"It is too bad that the same people who did the rest of the programme (Murder Rooms) didn't do the pilot for the show (Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle). Why? Because they, at least, get the aspect ratio right. BFS doesn't seem to have (this is sad since the transfer looks pretty good). Murder Rooms was a wonderful programme and it deserves better than this (it almost looks like a 4:3/1:33:1 stretched a bit given the slim black bars at the top and bottom). For those of you with an all region DVD player cross your fingers that a British edition at a reasonable cost appears (in the correct aspect ratio) sometime in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely Dull ...","review":"I've been looking forward to watch these features. And I was rather disapointed, even if the d��cor is superb, the acting fine and the mystery well written... The dialogues are boring, some scenes are meant to be funny, exciting or whatever - but you can see the machinery of the screenwriter - This whole series is just a weak 'ersatz' for the real stuff (Poirot, Holmes, Morse, ...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent entertainment","review":"I am a keen reader of the Holmes stories and a admirer of Ian Richardson, whose acting I thoroughly enjoyed watching the \\"House of Cards\\" triology. The stories on this DVD are much darker then the Holmes stories and one shouldn't watch them when feeling depressed. However, there are some really funny scenes, for example, when Doyle's pompous former anatomy professor is reading the riot act to a journalist in \\"The Kingdom of Bones.\\" The atmosphere, the writing and the superb acting make this one of the favourite DVDs in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Much better than the movie. The seller provided super service. On time in my tablet in no time at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun & fast read","review":"The free sample portion of the book is a good representation of the speed and pace with which the author Stephen Hunter takes us through the many twists and turns in this fast paced thriller. For many of you who have seen the movie adapted from this book, the book's details and nuances are quite satisfying, removing much of the \\"hollywood-ized\\" feel that there was too much left on the editing floor when the movie went through it's final cut. And for those of you who didn't see the movie, while the story is fast paced, Mr. Hunter never leaves you wanting for details. The author's ability to paint a vivid scene in the reader's mind but not getting bogged down is one of the reasons this book is so hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books of all time","review":"I read a lot of books, and Point of Impact remains one of the best fiction books I've ever read. I must have read this book 20 times, going back in it to read the main parts over and over again. You don't need to be a gun nut to read this book, the characters and action alone are enough to hook you.To be honest, I stopped reading Stephen Hunter's later books after one or two failed attempts to recapture the magic of this book. All the later novels, despite being written as prequals to this, seem like spinoffs from a successful tv show and never as good as the original. Day before Midnight was excellent but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to read the best, this is it","review":"This book was my first experience several years ago reading Stephen Hunter, and I was hooked. I've read them all since, and as much as I look forward to a new Hunter book, Point of Impact is hard to beat. If you haven't read Stephen Hunter, you're missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plot","review":"I read a lot of action/adventure books, and Stephen Hunter is one of the best in the business. Point of Impact is probably his best work. The characters are believable, and sympathetic. The plot is clever, and not at all predictable. There are many unexpected plot twists, and the book is so compelling, I could hardly put it down. I rarely read books more than once, but I have read, and thoroughly enjoyed this one three times. The author has clearly done his research with respct to firearms and the Marine Corps Sniper Program. Everything about the book was beliveable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very satifyingly read!!!","review":"This one is actually the best work of Hunter. His first novel(?) The Master Sniper turned out to be flawed with unripened scenario and writing tech. But not this one as well as its two sequels, DIRTY WHITE BOYS and BLACK LIGHT. All three had proved that the real mature Hunter is finally arrived! Readers who could enjoy this book greatly should also check out and purchase from Amazon.com several other books fromin the same genre: WHITE STAR by James Thayer--like Bob Lee Swagger's nickname, the hero in W/S was named WHITE STAR by his deadly enemy; SHADOW OVER BABYLON by David Mason(an English weapry expert), there is a great sniper in this book too; SNIPER'S MOON by Carson Stroud, a V/N veteran sniper turned N.Y. cop; POINT OF IMPACT, by Jack Curtis. Plus the old THE MASTER SNIPER, I think the readers would feel quite satsified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sniper Book","review":"Better than the movie - in fact, little similarity to the movie. A really good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This might be an older book but don't let that stop you. It's story line is as modern as today. Mr. Hunter must be clairvoyant. Bob Lee, a bad attitude, and a scoped bolt action rifle will never get old. So many of the scenes from this book should have been in the movie. They would have become cinematic classics. Start here and read them all. The stories will all meld together and make you appreciate Mr. Hunter's talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gunny Moes them Down","review":"Arguably the best book I've read in 2007. The movie follows the main story line, although a decade or two behind. The movie was great, the book was better. It was full of action/suspense from cover to cover. I was impressed with Hunter's writing and will definitely get the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollercoaster ride of a novel","review":"Now, that's what I call a thriller. I have read Tom Clancy novels and thrown them across the room unfinished in disgust at the turgid writing style, appalling characterisation and laughably half-baked philosophising. But this... First, it is well written and plotted. Second, one actually likes the hero, who is honourable, tough, resourceful and intelligent. And it has a visceral appeal that keeps you turning the pages. I lent the book to four people, each of whom loved it (though one was furious with me as he got so engrossed in it that he missed half a football game with his favourite team rather than put it down.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"SPECTACULAR!!!!!!!!!","review":"Stephen Hunter is the best thrill writer in the world. I have read five of his books, and amazingly, they were all outstanding. He is one of the few authors that I've seen who has been able to create multiple books using the same character and make all the stories differ completely.Point of Impact is the best book he's written, along with Dirty White Boys.Hunter has inspired me to begin writing books myself. Look for \\"The Dysfunctional Family\\" within two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snappy - but infantile","review":"There's no doubt that the pace of this revenge story cracks along, and that the dialogue is smooth and snappy.Unfortunately there is no insight into the psychological effects of murder upon those who are asked to kill. In fact, there is one passage where the dehumanisation of those who are being picked off by the novel's hero is so pronounced, I wondered how he would retain my empathy.This book feeds into the dangerous attitude that addressing the ghosts of one's past demands the use of controlled and effective violence. This is a fantasy which of course lead to sequels for Hunter, but certainly no peace for his hero.I suspect Hunter's an extremely intelligent author and could easily display more insight; but would it bring him as much success?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read almost all of the reviews of this book and was very excited about reading it. I'm on page100 and so far NOTHING has happened. I've exhusted all authors I like such as Pollock, ludlum,land Cussler and Cornwell. I'm just glad I didn't buy more of Hunter. How can approx.50 people be right and 1 disappointed. I don't know. But I do know if you like action don't read or try to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Lee Swagger a murderer???","review":"\\"Point of Impact\\" is one of my favorite books and I have read all of Stephen Hunters earlier and later works. They are not all gems for those of you who haven't read them but they are pretty good.I have been waiting for this movie for years. In the late 1990's the project was supposed to star Tommy Lee Jones but that movie never got made. This movie is pretty faithful to the book with updating for modern times. However, the ending is out of left field and a terrible conclusion. Perhaps this is because through all of the other books about Bob Lee and his father, never once did I feel ashamed of their behavior as I did watching this ending. Shame on Stephen Hunter for allowing this to happen to his story."},{"rating":"1","title":"LACKED IMPACT","review":"I thought the book was very BLAH and BORING. The writing was cut rate to say the least. FLAT. Monotone. One dimensional. What characters? What action? What story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great!","review":"This is one of the best books I ever read. Once I got going, I just couldn't stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time","review":"I had run out of authors so checked to see what other buyers of my favourite authors were buying and came up with Stephen Hunter. Lot of technical talk on guns and bullets but still kept me (who knows next to nothing about guns) enthralled.I really enjoyed the book and look forward to reading Sniper which I also picked up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of Impact, Stephen Hunter","review":"My first Bob Lee Swagger. I was amazed by the reality of the action, close combat described the way it happens. I went looking for more Bob Lee Swagger books. It was as close as I was going to get with the experiences of other vets through the words of a writer, through the actions of a fictional character; a character who represented all of those who were in combat. Vets are not easy to talk to, they don't want to talk about what troubles them and why they hide out, and don't vent their feelings until they explode; then they hide again and drive those they know and love away from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action thriller","review":"\\"\\"No!\\" he yelled, \\"get back,\\" and the bullet came from so long away it arrived a full second before its own sound. It drilled Donny in the chest and tunneled to his spine. He was dead before he collapsed against Bob and lay across him that long morning.\\" This is one of the thousands of thrilling moments through out the book. The book is about a man named Bob lee Swagger who is a former marksman for the United States Army who was forced to retire after he was injured in battle and his partner and friend died. This book keeps you hooked from the time you pick it up, from its thrilling action packed pages to its depressing political system. I would recommend this book to all teenagers and adults who like chase novels. This book is a lot better then the movie. It has a lot more details and a lot more action pages then the movie. This has been one of the greatest novels I have read and encourage you to the read the first chapter because i know you will be instantly hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridgement not well done","review":"If you loved the movie - actually, I should say if you SAW the movie because if you did then you loved it! - and you want to read the book or listen to it, I strongly suggest you stay away from this abridgement. The UNabridged version is better than the movie, and that is saying a LOT, but this audio abridgment is difficult to follow and is way too jumpy due to the details they cut for this abridgment."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sharpshooter with an attitude..","review":"'Point of Impact' is definitely the sort of book for those who subscribe to Guns & Ammo. It's a intricate assassination thriller involving sharpshooters who can shoot a fly 1000 yards out. What we have is copious discussion on the intricacies of guns/rifles and ammo, and the techniques needed to excel at being a sharpshooter, or for the wickedly inclined, a sniper. The story is not quite believable, actually not even close, but the author writes with such exuberance and the characterizations are great. I found the uber machismo banter to be a bit tiresome; this certainly ain't \\"chick lit\\". Yet overall there is much to enjoy here.Bottom line: a wild ride for NRA crowd with enough goodies for pacifists to enjoy. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of Impact- HITS THE MARK","review":"Point of ImpactThis book is the screenplay for the movie \\"Shooter\\". I first read the book about twelve years ago, it was so superb that it stuck with me. I was convinced that it was the basis for the very exciting movie, after some resaearch online, I was proven right. I read on average of three books a month and \\"Point of Impact\\" is on my top five ever. Bob Lee swagger uses his most accurate shots in the climactic courtroom scene, and the reader is left grinning and wanting a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW... Before going to the movies, READ IT FIRST","review":"When I saw the trailer, I felt it was like another fugitive clome movie. But I was curious about the sniper story, so I got a copy and started reading. Boy, this book got my 100% attention!!How much attention?? Well, let me say that as I kept reading and flipping pages, I lost track of time that I needed to sleep!!! I was reading til 3am. Has very good detail on the weapons and didn't waste too many pages on putting too much detail like Clancy and other authors. We are all grown ups to get some of the details in our minds.Will surely watch the movie, but I got a feeling is gonna give audience a Fugitive type of movie instead of Bob's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband liked the ballistics","review":"I ordered this title to give my husband a break from the literary and artst-craftsy material I usually provide - and it worked. He enjoyed the \\"gun\\" descriptions which I didn't understand, and the fast-moving story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book I've ever read twice!","review":"I'm as far from a gun nut as a person can be, but I could not wait to get to bed each night to read. This is by far the best book I have ever read. It is also the only book I have ever read twice, enjoying it as much the second time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first book I read all the way through!","review":"Stephen Hunter is the best author that I have ever read. His use of Bob Lee was gripping and thrilling. It's a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why aren't books edited anyone?","review":"Repairman Jack, in the novel I just finished, grabbed a Stephen Hunter book to read in the airport. I checked Hunter out in Amazon and bough the first four Bob Lee Swagger books. They arrived yesterday evening. I am about halfway though the first one, Point of Impact, and ran across this interesting line on page 290:...the smell of dust and gas filled his ears...Why aren't books edited anyone? This is a Bantam book, not some fly-by-night, publish-on-demand company. I can ignore the grammar errors and comma splices, but this is so bad I laughed aloud and woke my wife. I'll heal, but I won't read this in bed anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Falling Apart","review":"Once I got used to the fact my new paperback was falling apart it was a good read. It was not in the condition it was supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point if Impact","review":"Stephen Hunter knows his stuff. Excellent book with plenty of action. If you trend toward Clancy, Child, Bell and Flynn read this author. One of my pet peeves is reading authors that think they know more than they do about firearms and tactical situations. I immediately lose interest when there is a lack credibility. Not so with Hunter. Hunter weaves a plausible story, believable reluctant hero (Swagger), credible characters with his expertise in firearms and tactics. One of the best books I have read and I have and will read more of his works.I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Loc revisited","review":"After re-reading this novel more than a dozen times, I've found only one glaring error - An Loc was in III Corps - the nearest mountain was Nui Ba Ra.

Like all the readers before me, this one gets you hooked from the very beginning and won't let go. Can't wait for the movie. The only thing I didn't like, was all the bad language. I think the characters could have been just as believable without so much cursing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of Impact","review":"I read the hardcover book, and thought Stephen Hunter did a great job. The audio book was great. Better than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of Impact","review":"The book, as usual, is more gratifying than the movie - which was itself pretty entertaining. Bob Lee Swagger is the kind of no-nonsense man of action you want at your side in a gunfight - especially when you can keep the bad guys at 1,000 yards. He proves that \\"simple\\" doesn't mean \\"stupid\\" by unraveling a very carefully woven net of conspiracy while being true to his principles. The \\"gun stuff\\" is a plus, as the details are just as accurate as Swagger's aim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"One of the best stories I've ever read since The Day of the Jackal (Frederick Forsyth) and The Bourne Identity (Robert Ludlum). Hunter definitely belongs to the elite class of adventure writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book-- you'll read until your eyes blur","review":"A page turner. great characters, exciting plot, twists and turns, takes your breath and leaves you smiling. I wish someone would make a movie from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Fiction Book of all Time!","review":"I've read this book no less than fifteen times. I love it! Read it, you'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"The plot is complex and interesting without being confusing, the characters are all fascinating and, except for Bob Lee, believable (how do you make it through a 500 page guys-with-guns novel and only get shot twice?). But believable or not, I still loved him. The action is neither so spread out that the book falters, nor is it all saved for the climax making for an overly long read. Furthermore, the technical detail actually improves the action, rather than slowing it down. The mystery (\\"Rom Do\\" and all that) is wondefully intelligent and beautifully solved. If you don't at least TRY to read this book, you're nuts. And after you're done this one he's got about five more crazy books for you to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter's Best!","review":"This book is in the running for the best novel I have ever read. I have read it three times already, and I rarely reread novels. After loaning it to a friend his wife complained to me that he did not sleep until he had finished the book! After this I devoured all of Hunter's other works, but still set this one above the rest. The technical information on sniping is superb. Hunter sets you up for the climax and reels you in. If you give out any information on the content or plot of this book to someone before they read it, shame on you! An important lesson from the book (you fill in the blanks!) is: One thing you must never do to a good ol' boy from the hills of ________ is to ____ his ___. Now you just have to read it to figure that out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read many times over","review":"Stephen Hunter is my go to guy. Action and adventure and long range shooting. His character Bob Lee might be my favorite protagonist of all time. This first book marks the beginning of a wonderful series, though this will always be my favorite of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love of Guns","review":"Stephen Hunter never hides his passion and incredible knowledge for guns, and that's probablya good thing. It matches his gun-loving protagonist, Bob Lee Swagger. POINT OF IMPACT, madeinto the movie SHOOTER with major revisions, has its moments. The plot is easy to follow, and Hunter's prose isbetter than average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unparallelled Writing Skill","review":"Anyone who has read Stephen Hunter's novels know they are in for a good read, and this book is no exception. Having barely escaped an Assassination plot supposedly aimed at the President of the United States, Bob Lee Swagger (the hero of the story), is now the target of a Nation Wide manhunt. His only allies is are lady he just met and a frowned upon FBI agent.This book was a phenomenal read. The gun facts are very accurate and detailed. Many books I have read make the Hero out to be an invincible person with no flaws, which is not the case with this book. \\"Bob the Nailer\\" has his own flaws to deal with, which makes the book an even better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"I really enjoyed the film adaptation \\"Shooter\\". It was interesting to see where the film deviated from the book as well as when it followed the book closely. The book was paced well, with plenty of turns and action to keep me looking for more.

It was a gift and the recipient loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Condition","review":"This book arrived quickly but in a little less than the condition that was advertised.

I read Hot Springs and learned all about Bob Lee's pappy, Earl. He was a very unlikeable character, a grim, efficient killer with serious psychological, social and alcohol problems.Like father, like son - Bob Lee is perhaps the deadliest shot on the planet, but he isn't someone I can even remotely empathize with.When I read a novel, I sometimes find I can't put it down. With Point of Impact, I set it aside for nearly a week, and finally picked it back up just to see how it ended. I enjoyed the (mostly) accurate firearms details, but the plot is a joke. The only reason I gave the book two stars instead of one is that Hunter is a gun nut and obviously loves rifles. I think he needs to learn how to set up a half way believable plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book cover not as advertised","review":"This book is a fantastic read, I know this because I read it recently on holiday. I ordered another book because I managed to get suncream on it(the book isn't mine) so upon researching another I found that some books had a different front cover. I chose this one because I wanted an exact replacement and it has the same cover advertised.

I believe one of the prior reviews is correct in saying that the unit overheats.

This book just glossed over the act of the hero meeting then bedding the heroine,who is pretty much being forced into either submitting to the tradition, or being cast out by her family and made a servant. This is not what makes for an enjoyable story to me and I just quit in disgust.Not recommended-2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great escape","review":"Enjoyed this film many times over.

The print itself is only fair, but the video stopped functioning at several points and needed to be advanced manually. The synchronization of lip movement and sound was constantly poor.

I had high hopes for this Legend edition (and not because of the colorization), but it turns out this is an edited version, which makes it utterly useless to me. I'm not even particularly fond of this film; I've always considered it one of the team's lesser efforts. But I'm a completist, so it's a must for my collection. The wait for the definitive DVD release continues..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I remembered","review":"1st, the picture is terrible. There were many times when I could barely make out the faces of Laurel and Hardy. I have several other Laurel and Hardy films, and this is by far the worst in this regard. It is nearly unwatchable--certainly less than I would expect of a \\"remastered\\" film. 2nd, I seem to remember an entire sequence from when I originaly saw this movie many, many years ago that is not part of this cut. It was that sequence that I remember thinking was the funniest when I was a boy, so I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF THEIR GREATEST","review":"I was quite disappointed when I first viewed this film.Inspite of the impressive openning and closing credits,where L&H are seen in cartoon form,Oliver's beautiful musical number of\\"Shine On Harvest Moon\\",and the climactic airplane scene,the film is not one of their funniest.I personally find the film somewhat depressing somehow.Definetly not one of their better films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not their best- need more Roach shorts!","review":"This DVD has a great quality print of a good L&H film, plus some rarities and oddities all collected in one place.

Let's see 'em!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Laughs is Not Enough","review":"I tried so hard to love this movie, but in all honesty, I thought it was painfully unfunny. I laughed twice - first when Ollie tells Stan that without him \\"people would stare at you and wonder what you are - and I wouldn't be here to tell them\\" and last at the very end when Ollie is reincarnated as a horse with a mustache and a hat. To be fair, I admit that I also smiled once to see Ollie's coy flirtation with the innkeeper's daughter.Apart from that, the film was only interesting for its surprising bleakness at the beginning - there was something compelling about watching Ollie, suicidally depressed, decide that Stan too must die.All in all, I was bored. The boys try hard to be funny but the material just isn't up to it. Two laughs is not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WENT WRONG??","review":"Based on the excellent \`March of the Wooden Soldiers' from LEGEND films, I was looking forward to this release of \`Flying Deuces'.

This version from KINO is from a 35mm positive release print of the Astor re-issue. It does NOT have opening titles from a 16mm print as some people have stated. The entire print is from a 35mm transfer. Some folks have been spoiled with computer \\"restoration\\" which is a joke. I do have one complaint. The transfer is done at a speed of 1.4 which is about 26 frames per second. This does not affect the film, but it does affect the running time. Deuces runs 69 minutes, however the KINO version is only 65 minutes. Why would they do that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent picture quality","review":"I don't know what some complainers are talking about.

This antenna provides good coverage through a wall. The big problem is that it is a directional antenna - which means it only works in the one direction it is pointed. I have to swivel it to point it at direction I am at. Still its nice to have 4 to 5 bars when the antenna is pointed at you. I point it at my study when I am at work there and then shift it towards the living room area when I am done with work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"I have bought this with the hopes of getting to use are cells in the front room.

I went from in the back of my house where the main base is. 3/5 bars to 0 bars, and could not use our cell phones. I put the old antenna back on and work.

Do not buy this game unless you are willing to spend an hour putting it together and figuring out how to play it. And while you're doing that, your child(ren) will be whining about it taking so long. I was doing okay until it came time to put the two stickers on the spinning wheel. The directions for this part were incredibly confusing, and the directions for how to play the game were about the same. I also couldn't believe that I had to put stickers on the die (first time for everything!). That said, once we FINALLY figured it all out, my daughter loves it. I think it's the \\"secret\\" aspect of the game she enjoys -- pick three things out of the box without peeking and look for your match to your princess w/o showing anyone else the card to win the game.

It was given to me by a friend for my 8 year old and 41/2 year old daughter. It was a little hard for my four year old to understand. But my 8 year old enjoyed it and so did I.

The concept is great, the game goes fast, and it's very enjoyable. I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll wish for a better game","review":"This is a cute concept but poorly designed. The instructions are confusing; we have to wing it on a few of the rules. The game board and spinner are flimsy.

The game is so complicated and so devoid of fun that we have never finished it, and whenever we play it, everyone ends up unhappy.

Lots of threads about it in the forums on the company website.3. Not enough character races, creatures, upgrades, etc. The way the population limit works kind of sucks.4. You get premade champions and you don't get to create your own (so much for the RPG aspect of the game).5.

The next day I bought a can of expanding foam by Evercoat, this is the stuff I have used before that always provides excellent results. It comes out easily, expands well, and can be easily cut/shaped/worked after it has fully cured and hardened. The only drawback is each applicator straw and can is single use due to the nature of the foam expanding when exposed to the moisture in the air.

It contains several short stories written with a somewhat different style from each other and the stories are a rich collection of sophisticated words. Some keywords have a description just like in a dictionary, so one can learn the meaning of those keywords by reading their description as well as its context in the story. There are also exercises that use the keywords, which help the reader retain the keywords in his/her mind.

I'm amazed, in fact, that anyone would recommend this version. Olivier is very good as James Tyrone, but the other actors give weak performances, and the camerawork lacks any creativity. Katharine Hepburn and Jason Robards are excellent in the Lumet version, and there are numerous interesting staging and cinematic choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Days Journey Review","review":"Long Days Journey Into Night was the classic struggle about man battling with his fate. I thought the movie was alright, but not really my kind of flick. For drama lovers it would probably be a little better. It lacked any real action or entertainment from my point of view, but kept my interest somewhat. The acting was very good, however the plot was very depressing and sad, it's not a very uplifting movie whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instructional Package","review":"I don't yet have this, so I'm not writing a review.

I appreciated the ideas, but the stories themselves (they are much too short and simplistic to even be called novellas) left much to be desired in the way of character and plot development. It was as if each author started out with a grand idea and then their spouse called them in for dinner - so they quickly solved the problem with a hectic and quick climax, and then abruptly ended the plot.Try Star Trek: Vanguard instead (if you like action, adventure, complex but still understandable and interesting plot lines, intriguing characters, and explorations of morality and science)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Great book if you're a fan of the \\"Star Trek Universe\\".

But I didn't find the stories engaging. Written as an anthology with a continuing cast and a common history there is a nice try at developing characters as the stories go along, but I didn't find the characters paricularly striking or original.What really irritated me was that when I finally started to get into a story, the last one, 'Interphase', about attempting to recover the Defiant from the TOS episode the Tholian Web it suddenly stopped (with a cliff hanger) and says it will be continued in the NEXT volume. I'd like to see how it turns out but I wasn't impressed enough by the other stories in this volume to buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad first-person shooter","review":"This game is strictly a VERY poor arcade shooter.

The cinematography and action falls very much in line with these classics. What makes My Young Auntie special is that it stars a woman and is very much a comedy. I can't help but rave about the star. She had a very difficult role, as she had to be both young and insecure, but still a great fighter and strong leader. She did both very well, and the movie was a success. Though I usually don't care too much about special features, I was very impressed with those on this set. They brough back a number of cast and crew, and provided a very good insight into the actual movie. I was very surprised how much fun this movie was, and can't recomend it enough. Give it a try!

So Vatelle is a typically sad story.That is why I didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, oh so boring...","review":"Half an hour into the movie, I honestly was bored to tears and nearly cringed at this entire film. The only thing that's good about this film is the visuals, but flashy visuals don't mean anything if there's not a story. After just 20 minutes I got tired of watching the actors do nothing more but turn up their noses in snobbery and trying to acquire a French accent, which is not the least bit natural or believable. And Uma Thurman is absolutely boring and lackluster. In general, Vatel was boring. Even if there was an actual story, i wouldn't even care to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugely Enjoyable and Evocative Drama","review":"What an enjoyable and well conceived film!Set in the reign of Louis XIV of France this film perfectly evokes the era and skillfully draws one into the paranoia, intrigue and sycophancy of the king's circle; the eye of the storm around which all of 17th century France rotates.Excellent star turns from Gerard Depardieu, Uma Thurman and Tim Roth working through a great script by Tom Stoppard with strong visual direction and lavish design to create an absorbing and rewarding film. I won't give the story line away but there is romance, intrigue and skullduggery aplenty!This film will transport you to another era and immerse you in the ambiance of the court of the \\"Sun King\\". A very classy and enjoyable experience and wholeheartedly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great art direction, little else","review":"Gerard Depardieu plays a steward of a French Prince who must win the favor of King Louis IV by lavishing him with amazingly extravagant banquets. Uma Thurman and Tim Roth join Depardieu in sleepwalking through their uninspiring performances, delivered in English despite being based on actual events in French history. The art direction during the banquets is very impressive, but there is little else of interest in this tale of aristocratic decadence and trickery. The only extra on the DVD is a very short piece supposedly (but hardly actually) about the film's costumes. This is one DVD that could definitely benefit from the typical extras such as a commentary track to help us get a notion as to why the film was ever produced. Fans of period costume pieces should watch ones with more substance such as Moulin Rouge, Shakespeare in Love, or Rob Roy."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY low-calorie dieting","review":"The book has excellent information, but I am leary about her plan of 1,000 calories.

Apparently to be the lead character in one of Roberts' books you need to be extremely FOUL MOUTHED, otherwise you just can't possibly be taken seriously. (As a former officer in the US Navy, I can tell Ms. Roberts that a woman officer, cop or military, is addressed as Ma'am, or her rank, not Sir, as her equally boring sidekick addresses Dallas. So much for Roberts' knowledge of any female holding rank in the military or police.) I am appalled at the many 10s that this piece of garbage got.

Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews by presumably respectable critics on the inside cover of this supposedly adult book. Going to the Sun is nothing more than a Judy Blume book in disguise, and the disguise is a thin one. Despite a few interesting moments, the best of which is a somewhat graphic account of the lead character's ex-boyfriend being eaten by a bear, the novel concerns itself with the preadolescent preoccupations of a pancreatically-challenged \\"woman\\" riding her bicycle to Alaska. Her inner-dialogue has all the depth of a diatribe between a 13 year-old and a poster of Leif Garrett. More than one page is devoted to the availability of suitable underwear.

I gave the author a LOT of slack hoping for a thoughtful, enlightening denouement from someone who clearly is an accomplished writer as well as the parent of a diabetic.I will not spoil the book in case someone wants to read it, but suffice it to say that I felt betrayed and disgusted by the ending.

Think they're milking fans not releasing a studio album. The sonics on opaline were not very good either, they must need a new tech. Great live albums would be Dave Matthews Live in Chicago, Sarah McLachlan Mirror Ball, etc. Live from flow state was nothing near the quality, AND it was expensive, more the the new Dave Matthews CD Some Devil which actually came with 2 cd's; one live. Far better investment.

I think that most people expected the film to be a traditionalrescue film. That is what I expected.Suddenly the plot thickens and we get a new twist to the film. But wait, there is still anothertwist at the end. It is similar to Shutter Island. I think that anyone who is a fan of Vivica Fox will enjoy this film. One F bomband a tastefully done sex scene. It would probably be rated PG-13. It is not a spooky film. It deals with the mind and how a shockingtraumatic experience can affect a persons mind and their perception of reality.

But, the DVD set is absolutely horrendous when it comes to playback quality. The picture quality is worse than a good VHS copy! The color is faded on a lot, and there seems to be some problems with syncing voice and picture on some episodes.

Non-stop action is fine if you're playing a 'Street-Fighter' arcade machine, but it doesn't make for a thrilling film.The wafer-thin plot involves maniac M.Bison holding hostages and demanding a lot of ransom money. So it's up to a lot of cardboard cut-outs with muscle to battle their way to the rescue. What this means is a lot of fighting and action with barely two words of dialogue.Will you recognize any of the characters from the video games in this film? You probably won't, as they look nothing like them. The pathetic attempt to bring Blanka to the movie screen is especially laughable.A total waste of time, though at least it's marginally better than that trashy animated abomination which is 'Sonic the Hedgehog:The Movie'."},{"rating":"1","title":"High definition?

I have no idea, why the company put it on Blu Ray. It's the worth Blu Ray ever, some scenes look awfully grain, I thought there was a problem with the LCD. I like this movie, because Raul Julia is in it. He was a great actor. This was it's last movie, he was already terrible ill, during this one. I'm going to keep it.

Bottom Line... they should have gotten some okay, brown headed, American actor to play Ryu. Not a black haired Asian. And what about Ken he is a complete retard in this movie and he doesn't have long blond hair.PS. They should make a new movie that has present day special effects and a deeper less cheesy storyline.

Raul Julia who was diagnosed with some sort of cancer was clearly noticable he wasn\`t up to the task as usually is and probbaly did this film for the sheer thrill of it.

Instead of hiring great fighters and getting some great fight choreography, they decided to add a \\"bad guy trying to take over the world concept.\\"Street Fighter video game also had many charcters, and instead of just using maybe 8 of the characters, like Mortal Kombat the movie did, they decided to squeeze as many characters into the movie as they could.

A few days ago, I remembered back to this movie, and I remembered how much I had loved it as a kid, so I went and bought it. Unfortunaltly when I watched it, my reaction was VERY different from the one I had six years ago. I probably enjoyed the movie so much at the time because I was young and I didn't know how to critique movies. Well, now, six years later, this is my opinion, if you want a true blue authentic Street Fighter movie, go rent, or even buy, Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie. Or even better, buy the unedited Japanese version with English subtitle.

If you saw Mortal Kombat the movie and then saw Street Fighter you would know what I am talking about. First of all the special effects were cheap. There was a part when Chun Li pulled a knife on Ken. You could see the knife bend! The fight scenes could have been choreographed much better. I have to say i was also disappointed with the story line and dialogue. The characters had no depth and were cheesy. Bison was played by this skinny old guy. Gee was it hard to figure out who would win? The heavily muscled Guile or the sickly looking Bison? If your really looking for spectacular fight scenes and a story line true to the game i suggest checking Street Fighter II: The animated movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad movie","review":"Over a third of the reviewers gave this film the lowest possible rating and more than half gave it the lowest two ratings. While I prefer to be kind, I think that the film deserves the lowest rating. The film is silly without being funny. The actors act as if they were characters in a children's comic book. They are heavy-handed and dress in foolish costumes. It is clear that the story and the acting is not meant to be taken seriously. The dialogue is ridiculous. Near the end of the film one of the bad guys tells his comrade that their leader is a bad guy. He says that he only worked for him because he was paid. The other reacts: You mean the general is a bad guy? You mean you were paid? This dialogue persuades him to change sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good!!!!!!","review":"This movie is on my all time worst list. It quite possibly had some of the worst acting i've ever seen by Jean Claude and the rest of the cast. It seemed as if the casting director just put anyone he owed a favor to in parts to fufill favors he owed. The script was cheesy, even for a chidrens movie and the final fight seen didnt help the movies cause either. Guile faced off with M. Bison in one of the worst fighting sequences ive ever seen. In a corny manner, they used their signature moves and off course Guile won as the building as about to blow up. Although i was only 10 when the movie came out, i was able to recognize pure crap when i saw it. My recommendation is to not buy it. Instead, try one of the animated video if you havent already done so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you want a Comedy - God aweful otherwise.","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed this movie because it made me laugh on many occasions. i came to watch this movie expecting an action thriller, but left knowing that this was a comedy, no matter what the original intention was; Case and point - Chun Li decides to sneak into the morgue to take a look at Guiles body to decide if he's really dead. the problem is is taht its 4PM in the afternoon and she is in full black and trying to sneak around. no one notices her untill she takes off her ski mask. pure comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!","review":"I know it was probably meant to be a spoof of Street Fighter II but it wasn't even that funny!

I played the Super NES version of the game and the movie's plot doesn't match the plot from the video game. What were the writers thinking?! This has got to be Jean-Claude Van Damme and Ming-Na Wen's most embarassing film that they ever acted in! One star for action and another for fighting but it does not give you much of the action movie experience. If you want to see a real action movie, try watching James Bond movies, The Rock, Gladiator, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or The Matrix. Those can give you real action other than this almost horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Campy, Ordinary, and Surrounded by Tackiness","review":"This movie was at times campy (especially scenes with Bison), the writing was lame (who can forget the line \\"I'm going to kick that son of a b**** Bison's a** so hard that the next Bison wannabe will feel it\\" which was included in a scene involving a cheap inspirational speech), the action was predictable (there's wasn't enough hand-to-hand combat and when the movie got there, it was ordinary along with the plot which is basically a story about rescuing hostages). To go along with that, the movie is at times surrounded by cheapness. Blanka's make-up work sort of reminded me of the live action Incredible Hulk t.v. series, and somebody must have thought that arcade game controls on Bison's hover craft would be a cheap joke but to me it was just tacky."},{"rating":"1","title":"wheres the bucket at","review":"jesus who ever has been giving this film 5 stars must be on crack this was the most worst Martial Arts action film I ever saw, this makes Mortal Kombat Anihilation seem better"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a total loss","review":"<Every year, a oscar-worthy movie comes along that renews our faith in the American spirit and makes us want to stand up for what we believe in.> This isn't one of them!It's not the action sequences or the acting that bothered me. It was the plot; a military showdown between Col. Guile (Van Damme)and Gen. Bison (Raul Julia). Maybe if it were an actual street fighter tournament hosted by Bison, maybe it could've been better. It would certainly put Van Damme in his element. But like I said, it wasn't a total loss. The ziggers in the movie were hilarious, it had a popular cast and Raul Julia portrays a tryanical madman very well. If you have cable, you can see it on USA or the SCI-FI channel.

DVDs scrath just as badly as CDs, and there's nothing that can protect you collection from careless younger siblings intent on taking your fragile CD and DVD collection.

Then somebody got the bright (and highly profitable) idea to make a cartoon out of it. The movie was an attempt to make both the young cartoon fans and the teenage comic book fans happy, and although this enterprise would seem doomed to fail, for the most part, it works. The Turtles' voices are good, the animatronic bodies by Jim Henson's Creature Shop are frankly incredible, Judith Hoag is good enough and Elias Koteas is very good, and the action scenes are better than some I've seen in 'real' action flicks. A solid and very watchable movie, with some very funny lines.

Surprisingly, my parents liked the movie and its two sequels.The 1990 movie is the closest that resembles the comics, except for the part of April being a reporter. The costumes done by the Jim Henson Company are better looking than most CGI special effects that are used in most movies today. This was my first true introduction of Casey Jones, who was hardly used in the animated series (I'm not counting the 2003 series). The only thing I disliked was Shredder's costume as it looked to fake.

We found that we were spending round after round rolling the dice, unable to further ourselves in the game. We all had determined the hidden item, but could not progress further- either because of lack of treasure or financial requirements. The game has a \\"trading mechanism\\", but there seemed to be little or no incentive. The first hour of the game was fun, collecting treasures and discoving the cards. The remainder of the game, over 3 hours, was bland. We were very disappointed with the game overall.If you plan on buying this game, it could be fun with altered rules. Our group (4 adults) found that we were so unimpressed with the game that we were unwilling to invest our time in it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"I was really looking forward to receiving this game and was very disappointed once I got it. The pages and pages of rules and exceptions were not organized and were very confusing and complicated. I don't mind taking the time to learn a new game, but entire topics were missing and we would have to make up many rules as we played. Too much emphasis on pictures, symbols and the 'story' and not enough on the basics of a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"mike's comments","review":"I found wadjet to be rather irritating to play. There are just too many trivial tasks and writing that you need to perform for each turn. There is not much challenge or thinking involved in it (once you have read the incredibly detailed instructions) - just mindless repetition of tasks.In addition, if you try to play with 2 or 3 players then the logistics do not work very well and you end up with too many cards in the wrong plaaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck.","review":"Hi, i'm from nashville and have been a fan of the teen idols for a while, but since they found this new singer, they suck and they broke up soon after.

The book scares me!","review":"I read the book when it was first published in 1983, and I was absolutely blown away with Mr. Bamford's detailed knowledge of the NSA and related intelligence-gathering methods of that time. At the time the book was published, I had been working in this area for the Navy and I found this book filled with (among many other things) knowledge regarding satellite intelligence capability (at the time) which -- well, frankly, I was surprised to see some of it in this book. That's why I'm astounded at some of the content.I recommend it whole-heartedly to anyone who's interested in observing how the U.S. intelligence community (according to Mr. Bamford) conducted (and, I might suggest, still conducts) its affairs. I can't wait to read his new book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few interesting facts buried in a mass of acronyms","review":"A pretty dry read, one for the conspiracy theorists only, I feel. Perhaps the NSA got to this author too, since after the first 100 pages we had already been introduced to about 150 acronyms, plenty of mini-biographies of the many NSA staffers involved and virtually no interesting facts. A recent article in the IHT said that the amount of intercepts each day could fit into a block 20 yards wide and 10 yards high. If you imagine how much must have been produced since the early 1950s it is very disappointing to find none of it in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bamford's Puzzle Palace","review":"This was an interesting beginning book about the history and background of the National Security Agency, especially in light of the very damaging leak about the secret surveillance program ordered by President George W. Bush. The only problem is that this book is a bit dated, so it's hard to know how similar the early '80s Puzzle Palace compares with that of the early 21st Century NSA. What's clear is the NSA has been a special creature of the government, created by executive order and really not beholden to Congress like other agencies. I recommend people read this and Bamford's other book about the NSA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A must read if you are interested in the capabilites of our government to monitor communications.

I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's \`Angels and Demons.'

Spending several years working in the government section and having intimate knowledge of the inner workings at the NSA a significantly large portion of this book is fantasy.The earlier history portion of the book is very factual but if you are looking to gain insight on how the government \\"spies\\" on private citizens you won't find it in this title. You can get better entertainment value by watching MI-5."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only comprehsenive study of the NSA, but poorly written.","review":"If you want information on the NSA, this is one of the few books you'll find. So, in a sense, you have no choice but to read this book and the sequel. Unfortunately, Bamford needs to learn how to write. Chapters are chaotic. Miscellaneous information is peppered throughout. Run-on sentences and poor choice of verb tenses are only some of the grammatical problems that make this a difficult read. The book is a rough draft. In addition, although Bamford tries to be \\"objective\\", it seems clear that he wouldn't have obtained this information if he was critical of the NSA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatty Arbuckle's the man!","review":"I bought this DVD set for my friend who was writing a paper about Fatty Arbuckle in her college class.

It was an accidental find on my part, and I've tried to share the book with as many people as possible ever since. The plot has been described well enough already, so I won't go into details. If you love old movies or would love a glimpse into what life was like after WW2, then you'll thoroughly enjoy this book.

Thanks to Ricci I always preferred the Guarnerius del Gesu 1734 rather than the well know Stradivarius sound.This album contains a very special selection that talks by itself about his overwhelming technique and voluptuous lyricism.His approach about two of his most beloved composers, Paganini and Sarasate are simply illuminating. But the sound talks better than any other compliment.

I discovered this book purely by accident, and accident is the best description I can muster for this amateurish drivel. The character development never quite came through though you could tell that the author seemed to love them somewhat. Maybe he was to connected to the characters instead of letting them develop along with the plot line. The story could have had it's moments, but always seemed to be overshadowed by the author's need to appear intelligent rather than simply telling the story. Based on the reviews I read, I was expecting more but my suggestion would be for Walzak to take a few classes before making a second attempt.

For Default to succeed and even prosper they must branch out and find their music rythm and this can only be done by cutting the apron strings to Nickelback.As to this album, it is a pleasant and strong release with a number of great songs such as Taking My Life Away, Without You and All She Wrote. On this version of the album a bonus track of the acoustic version of Let You Down is included. This is an enhanced edition CD and if you pop it into the CD-ROM will give you additional multimedia to view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elocation Review","review":"I bought this Default CD first then went back to Amazon and purchased the rest of their collection. Default is a dynamic group with lyrics that you can understand and relate to. Nickelback's lead singer Chad Kroeger played a large part in the succession of this band. If ever you have an opportunity to see them in concert I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus","review":"As an African American, I don't really listen to rock.

If U dont just take my word for it, take theirs. The new album is really so rocking. Default is a band that isnt all about being phony, they are just straight ahead rockers. The first album blew me away, and their second has done that AND MORE! I cant beleive that they were able to improve on their first, but they did! I mean, Just listen to it. Its so versitile, its got so many types of music to it; grunge, metal, rock, blues, eveyrthing! Need I say more? DEFAULT ROCKS! They are my favorite band, and if u listen to this cd, Im sure they will become yours! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Default with Default","review":"The first album the fall out is the best CD from this band! the new CD Elocation is weak and full of ballady love songs, the first CD had a lot of love songs on it but the whole tone was different giving them a completly new sound as usual Dallas's voice is great but by hearing the first CD you expect better from them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm impressed...the guys did us proud","review":"I was hesitant about the new Default album. I thought: how are they gonna surpass \\"the fallout\\"? When i bought \\"elocation\\" on November 25, i was in for a great surprise. \\"Elocation\\" is an amazing album. It is much more edgy and hard rock! I was really impressed with Dallas voice, it seems to me that it has matured. If you listen to track number 11, you hear what i'm talking about. Jeremy does an amazing job on the guitar, wow! Dave sounds great on bass and Danny rocks at drums! I recommend that everyone get this album. It rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Follow-Up","review":"It is very difficult to follow-up a debut album that sells a million copies and has great success with a hit like \\"Wasting My Time\\". However, Default has done it very well! \\"Elocation\\" is a great mix of upbeat rock with powerful rock ballads. \\"(Taking My) Life Away\\" was instantly my favorite song on the first listen. \\"Who Followed Who\\", \\"Throw It All Away\\" & \\"Movin' On\\" are also stand out tracks but this one doesn't have much of a weak spot at all! It looks like Default is ready to prove they are here to stay & I for one am glad! Great cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been done before!","review":"Default's second cd was a big disappointment. I assumed most bands get better with time, unfortuately Default keeps pumping out the same old. Why do these one hit wonder bands expect people to buy their cd instead of downloading the one or two good songs they have. This band and many others better try harder to make an album where every song is a potential single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defaults New Cd","review":"Just when we were getting ready for the start of December, Default comes out with a new cd to make everything go crazy. The new cd called \\"Elocation\\" delivers exactly what its name stands for. When you listen to it you depart from the usual state, an ecstasy. Hearing the loud bass of Dave Benedict sounds to the rocking voice of Dallas Smith, every second makes your heart beat faster. Danny Craig delivers serious beats to the wild styles of Jeremy Hora. A must have cd for those into any type of music. Default makes sure everyone can enjoy their cd and they proved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow up album","review":"Elocation is a great follow up album to The Fallout. Default is taking their talents to an even higher level. Anyone who liked the first one MUST HAVE this one as well.

Pick it up today....you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"default-elocation","review":"default has a brand new cd out, and i love it! this albulm has a different feel to it than the fallout, there is more of a mix of songs, i think for a second album it is a great follow up, they included a jeff buckley cover which sounds awesome, and after listening to the album, everyone should check out the band live, the new songs sound even better live!! the boys put on an amazing show, i would recommend checking them out"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would know trust me!!!!","review":"Great product.

Save your money or buy something else. It is a lame collection of cover tunes that George didn't even play rhythm on.

Overall, you get what you pay for.... it's a good cheap tube but not as long as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"A jumpy, misguided attempt at a medical novel.","review":"As a medical student, I've spent an awful lot of time in similar situations as the characters of this book, and I must say that the author describes them poorly. The story is less believable than it could be. It lacks the necessary explanation and description for the way the characters interact. Another major problem is that the story jumps around violently and the characters flip sides too quickly. The problems found in the begining resolve way too easily in the end. It's almost as if the author and editor were rushed to get this novel done. This idea is supported by the glaring spelling errors I found while reading. Not that I'm perfect and never misspell words, but it helps to show that the effort put into this novel was less than it should be. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writing but disappointing realism","review":"I was looking for a book on the lines of \\"House of God\\" with the comedic irreverence that had me laughing most of the way through the book. I didn't find it in this one. The characters were almost too real. If I weren't a nurse in amajor teaching hospital (not Bellevue!!) I would be nervous about entering one. I think what the author is trying to imply is the uncertainty facing a new intern at the beginning of July. However it is written too much like a personal journal. It was sad and ludicrous at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"size large 34 - 42?","review":"wow this jock is loose, lets be honest this jock is more like a 40 to a 42 sized waist easily. the quality is not great and the leg straps seam to dig in where they attach to the belt on the jock. the pouch is plenty roomy. i would not buy this again not at 6 bucks not even for 2 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time!","review":"I'm really surprised this movie didn't have a better storyline.

It is a new release of the Spanish Gambit.The Second Saladin is being Re-released in 1998 and is a great book. I read the book-Tapestry of Spies cover to cover over a period of a week.Usally I read A Hunter book in 2 days at most ,burning out my eyes,but this book is Hunter's attempt to write your typical high school english class novel.It is slow,with characters who come and go,plots that end without any resolution,and just seems nowhere near as focused as the usual Hunter book.I guess that it does give you a feel for Spain in the civil war,but it is a mood book and not the type of book that people expect when they buy Stephen Hunter.The book resembles a classic but as Mark Twain said -A Classic is a book that everybody praises but nobody reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one - wait for his next book","review":"Unlike the other Stephen Hunter books which I picked up and couldn't put down, this one I put down and couldn't pick up. Finally, on a long business trip, this was the last bit of reading material I had left.In this book, there are too many characters and plots going on at the same time, and none are handled well. There are bits in the book that have no relevence later, and I wonder why they were added except to increase word count.I do not recommend that you buy this book. Instead, buy \\"Hot Spring\\" or like me, wait until it is released in paperback, as I thoroughly enjoyed the series about Earl and Bob Lee Swagger"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-paced, enough blind curves, overall an enjoyable read","review":"Hunter is a bit of a crazy but he is a helluva writer.

The Second Saladin was already sitting on my bookshelf!!! only on the inside title page does it say that this was previously called The Second Saladin. how betrayed i felt. maybe you cant find the original anymore but at least give the new one the same title as before so as to not mislead and in my opinion betray people like me. if the book is by one of my favorite authors and i havent read it--- boom i buy it without reading the back and all the other junk. so i give my first 1 to a book on account of the deceit i felt involved with this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't rush to read this one.","review":"Hunter's other books, like _The Master Sniper_ and _Dirty White Boys_, are incredible. But if you're a fan, don't run out (or click) and buy this one until you've worked through everything else he's done. It's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunter can and has done better.","review":"I have read several books by Stephen Hunter and I fear this is the worst. It did not grab me by the throat and cause me to not want to put it down as some of his others have. I stayed confused a big part of the time and really did not want to finish it but his other books had been so good I kept thinking it would better. I feel now that I wasted my time. Robert Flory, I suppose is the hero but it could be Julian Raines. So many people and so many things going on. The ending was really no surprise. Everybody has bad days or weeks, I guess or hope, this has been a rare bad write for Stephen Hunter. If this is a first read for Hunter it may be your last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give the man a break!!","review":"I think alot of people don't realise that this was Hunter's first attempt at a fiction novel. Granted it is not half as good as his next few books such as The Day Before Midnight but every writer has to start somewhere and it would be wrong for people to judge him on his first effort.The book is fine if you haven't read other Hunter books but if you are already a fan about to read this book, \\"Cut the man some slack!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"Excellent service, timely shipping.

Many other companies sell products that are meant to exfoliate, but once you buy it, you find that they are basically lotions with a few granules mixed in - this is the only product I have found that actually SCRUBS when you need deep cleaning.

He leaves the idea that something other than a reasonable explanation can be found for the plot of this book. You keep thinking maybe it is not of this world explanation but then when it all comes together you almost wish it could have been something other than a human behind the horror going on. He is absolutely the best and keeps you turning the pages quicker and quicker to find out if he stops the deed from being done. I wish people were more aware of Mr. Land's books.

Some holes might be a little at the microphone but no big deal. Dropped my phone once and it gave cushion to the fall. Thank god.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent case for AT&T Note","review":"I originally bought this case for my Note to use while I waited for Body Glove to come out with a version for the Note. I had one of theirs for my Captivate and loved it. After using this case for a few days, there is no need to wait on Body Glove. I love this case! Its snug, but the fit is perfect. The cut outs fit well, and although at first I didn't think I'd like the covered volume and power rockers, I've come to like them because I've noticed I have fewer problems accidentally hitting the volume like I did without the case. It looks nice, and feels great in the hand. No more being paranoid about dropping my phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"It's better than expected. It is lightweight, thin, durable and flexible. The right and left sides are grippy so you feel that you have a good hold on the phone. The back is also grippy but not overly-so. It also provides for a raised edge around the screen so you can set the phone face-down on a flat surface and avoid scratches. The charging port cutout is large enough for my charging cable without having to remove the case from the phone. The stylus is little harder to get to with the case in place, but not too bad. The power and volume rockers are completely covered by the case and are easy to operate (easier than I thought they would be). The 3.5mm headset port cutout is large enough to allow the headset supplied with the phone to be easily plugged-in without obstruction. The case doesn't seem to cut down on wi-fi reception/transmission. I have no complaints about the case, whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case with one annoying feature","review":"As others pointed out, the case fits snug but is easy on/off. There is a knurling finish along the sides for a good grip, and the matte finish on the back is smooth enough that it slides in and out of a pant pocket easily. Another unexpected bonus is that the volume rocker is not exposed. Before buying the case, I found that I was always adjusting the volume inadvertently. The cover makes it a bit less sensitive.The only minor fault I have with the case is a small protrusion with two holes on the back bottom right, which I presume is for attaching a lanyard or stylus tether. The bump only sticks out a 1/16\\" or so, but it is enough to cause the device to rock (and make a tapping noise) when used on a flat hard surface. I have no use for a lanyard, so I removed the bump using a Dremel tool and a small cone sander. Others may find the attachment point to be a plus.. Either way the case is a bargain at $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes phone hot but fits perfectly","review":"Call me native but I did not expect for it to cause the phone to heat up so much. After, about 10 minutes of phone activity the phone was noticeably hotter.The cutout for the micro-usb was a little small to solidly connect the Samsung OEM usb cable. It needs a small amount of trimming so the cable can sit flush against the phone.Overall, for the price being charged I knew I couldn't expect much. Coming for an Otterbox Defender case for my other phone, the DuoSuit provides on the minimumal protection against bumps and low-level drops. But considering the Galaxy Note is such a large, thin phone I will be surprised if any cases will be able to provide adequate protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"very clean look","review":"looks clean and stylish. however I am not a big fan of the power button cover. sometimes I have a hard time to find it or feel it without looking. maybe that is just my case. also it is very slim. I don't know whether it will give any protection or not.nonetheless I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case :)","review":"I got this for my International Galaxy note N7000 and it fits great. I would recommend buying a screen protector with it as well. It works great to protect your phone and it looks great as well.My phone is white so it makes the case look like a lighter blue, I think it's a really pretty color and I love it. It's see through so I put some fortunes from fortune cookies to show through on the back for fun.But just be warned that the product picture is of the \\"blue\\" galaxy note phone, so if you have a white one the case will appear lighter in color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boxwave Cover","review":"Simple idea executed well.

It's a little heftier than I would like and the outside buttons on the phone are a little more difficult to depress than is ideal.

The surface of the case makes the phone easier to grip and, therefore, less likely for it to slip from your hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But false advertising","review":"The case is nice. My only problems are the camera portion cover is too big and the color is way off from there picture. The color of the actual unit is like a light baby blue. Almost like a kids color.

As well as the buttons are a bit difficult to depress in the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice snug fit","review":"The case is perfect for the Galaxy Note (I'm using the AT&T; variant).

I have 3 different style USB cables, and none of them could seat entirely in the socket with this case (the cables would work and allow me to connect/charge my phone, but if you bumped anything, the cable would fall out).

Mason sometimes veers wildly from the original French. However, the Introduction to the volume is so well-reasoned that I became convinced that this is a very fine, thoughtful piece of work.

After reading all the positive reviews, I was hopeful that Rejex would help prevent the brake dust from building up so quickly. Sadly, I noticed no improvement over a quality wax. Rejex is easy to use and is at least as good as conventional wax at keeping bug jerky and other contaminants from sticking to the front of the car. Unfortunately, brake dust remains a problem. The best defense I've found to brake dust on the wheels is Armor All wheel protectant. The Armor All product works much better than wax or Rejex, but it is expensive and only effective for a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great listening, soothing","review":"The Kora (African harp) and the Balafon (wooden xylophone) go well together and this is an excellent listening CD.

But what happens when a demon lurks behind that pretty face, and especially a mantis demon! And we all know what a mantis does after mating! Naraku has shown before that he has no compunctions about killing innocents to get the Shikon Jewel, but in this 10th volume, he sinks to new lows. After commanding a resurrected Kohaku to murder an entire village of innocent people to draw Inuyasha and company into a trap, his next mission is to kill our heroes. Including his own sister!After a lackluster first episode, the other two shows on this disk aspire to very deep emotional territory. How do you kill your own brother? Do you betray your friends in order to save even a shadow of him? And the theme of using loved ones against each other especially hits a chord with Inuyasha, who was mistakenly accused of betraying the woman he loved, thanks to Naraku's imposture. Excellent show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They show these eps over and over on Cartoon Network","review":"Inuyasha: Vol. 10: Scars of Battle contains three episodes, the last two I have seen repeated endlessly on Cartoon Network.

They involve the surprising return of Kohaku, Sango the Demonslayer's younger brother who died. The evil Naraku has brought Kohaku back to life as a slave. Naraku blackmails Sango into stealing Tetsusaiga from Inuyasha and giving it to Naraku in exchange for \\"eternal life\\" for Sango's tormented brother.Extras include a little line art and a so-called \\"video game promo.\\" However, none of the video game is shown, only clips from the first episodes of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A crowd pleaser","review":"Though my taste in Amine tends to go away from what is aired on tv b/c they are often very bubblegummy, Inuyasha is a great exception, though its not really a must see for hard core violence junkies but there's enough action in it to keep everyone entwined.

Carson at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. In this study, Kostenberger asks the question \\"how are the missions of Jesus and the disciples related?\\" (pg 3). He then relates this issue to practical theology vis-��-vis the debate between incarnational ecclesiology and representational ecclesiology. He seeks to argue that the incarnational model diminishes the unique work of Jesus because he is the only life giver (pg 4). Thus, he argues that the missions of Jesus and the disciples should not be unduly equated.Chapter two is especially helpful as he discusses methodology for doing word studies for biblical theology. This can be applied to any biblical issue.There are, unfortunately, some un-translated German quotations but most readers will be able to understand his thesis and data. He also interacts heavily with Greek in chapter 2 and in various places throughout the book.

The details of everyday life in the lovely Dinotopia are quite eye-filling and breathtaking, ranging from a wooden puppet serving as a foster mother to new hatchlings to the simply stunning ariel views of those glorious castles proudly standing upon very craggy mountains as you fly by on a pterosaurus-shaped hang-guider!

She married a wealthy rival of her old beau who had him killed while she was pregnant with the younger man's child. Now the child is a teenager and mute. She begins exhibiting strange behavior and scary things start happening at the drive-in and Ruby is convinced her old lover has come back for her. The supernatural is played up well and there is no shortage of shocks. A lot of good moments and an overall creepiness pervade the film directed by Curtis Harrington. Piper Laurie gives another full-barreled performance as Ruby--still beautiful but half-deranged by alcohol and memories. Her blood red costume at the end is a knockout. VCI has done well with this on DVD. It deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruby runs blood red !!!.","review":"A great horror film from 1977.

After having installation problems, I experienced a system slow down but everything else appeared to work fine. I soon discovered I was unable to defrag without conflicting with Windows XP system tools. After running Norton's defrag tool, I actually had a higher percentage defragmentation than I had before I ran the defragmenter.

I have also upgraded to most of the versions. Starting with version 2000, I noticed the lack of control over the software. In other words, the program tries to take over the functions automatically, sometimes making the wrong decision, specially in the case of the Norton System Doctor or Win Doctor.This version is the worst. It almost prevents you from using it manually. In addition, Symantec removed certain features from the previous versions, such as the Benchmark from the System Information module.In my opinion, if you own either version 2000 or 2001, DO NOT GET this version, specially if you are a technician. NOTE: (you will need version 2001 only if you run Windows 2000). If you have never used Norton's before, then you won't notice the differences. However, I recommend making a backup of all you system files before you even install this program. Do not rely on GOBACK alone !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad, not quite ready for WindowsXP","review":"This was a great program before Microsoft introduced WindowsXP. Works great in Windows 98. In WindowsXP you will find some of the Norton's Utility functions provided under Windows 98 missing when running WindowsXP. In fact, I think even $39.95 is too much for what amounts to little more than a virus checker.All you get besides the virus checker under WindowXP is a (1) duplicate disk defrag program that functions at a slower rate than the one that ships with WindowsXP, (2) a disk doctor {which cannot fix any problems, they are be fixed by rebooting and the CHKDSK program} that functions exactly the same as the error-check utility provided by Microsoft, and (3) a program that checks the registry for missing keys, etc.If you have WindowsXP do not waste your money on SystemWorks, just buy a virus checker.

I coordinate an afterschool program and this was recently our movie of the month for the 10-13 year olds and THEY LOVED IT! After we all wiped the tears, the students held a 'lively' discussion about their life struggles that pretty much aligned with the themes of the film.

Most of the other songs he flaunts about money and girls 5-8 years older than he is. Bow Wow really needs to rap about things that 14 year old boys can relate to. Not money, cars, and over your age women. Average kids don't understand that and they don't have it either. Bow Wow is a okay MC but Lil Romeo and him will probably be in front of a camera than behind a mic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? God, Why?","review":"Lil' Bow Wow's a wanksta!

The fruit of creative rap has been squeezed dry and the time has come for a change. Typically 3 to 4 years within a new decade the backlash begins and most of us who are fans of originality, creativity and genuine sounds are longing for the new Public Enemy, KRS-ONE, Matronik, Dr. Dre, Whodini, etc. This kid, as strange as it sounds, is the Leif Garret of this generation. Unfortunately, really soon, his career will be relegated to the likes of all those crappy corporate glam rock bands who had their 15 minutes fame. Truly this artist and all copy cats like him have brought shame and the final days to an art form that has run its course. The backlash will force all pop-rap acts like this out of the picture and bring back creative rap artists.Sorry I can't give it zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gift.","review":"My niece loves bow wow.

Also like the other class books, it doesn't seem to be game balanced terribly well. I recomend each DM consider carefully which portions of this book to allow, and whether they need modification. For example, in my campaign I've added two prerequisited for the Natural Spell feat, which allows a wildshaped druid to cast spell in wildshape form without worrying about the forms ability to speak or make somatic gestures. A bit overpowered, in my opinion, but acceptable with Still Spell and Silent Spell as prerequisites, basically requiring the Druid to devote three feats to this powerful ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masters of the Wild","review":"Offers excellent updates for the greatest classes in the D&D Game! My favourites are the new Druid spells! Excellent resource for expanding my campaign! Just don't forget to put the book down and sleep once in a while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For DMs not players","review":"The bread and butter of any guidebook is to (a) flesh out classes in rich detail (b)have new/cool feats (c)have really new/cool prestige classes. Unfortunately, this book fails on two fronts. Any player, except for the very new, would consider the information plebian. My biggest disappointment is in the prestige classes, which are geared for NPC's or, at best, solo adventures. For example, Deep Woods Sniper, Geomancer, Bloodhound, Foe Hunter, Verdant Lord, Forsaker, Windrider, Watch Detective, are all too specialized, requiring a severe limitation of campaigns. And don't get me started on the Oozemaster (what were they thinking?). I did like a couple of the prestige classes (Tempest, Animal Lord). Finally, the feats are solid, but favoring barbarian classes, which is good because barbarians were ignored for prestige classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly disapointing....","review":"First off, this is a fairly thin title, like most of the books of this line. It does clear up the druid rules, but does nothing for the ranger. It does little for the barbarian as well, though that class needs little help. I cannot say I like many of the prestiege classes either. All in all, this, sadly, is pretty much a waste of time. wotc, shame on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Druid upgrade","review":"Druids have always been over looked as a very useful character. But if the druid chooses the right companion you have twofor the price of one. They are also like a cleric in healing and their spells are awesome. On my first campaign I was a druid elf along with another druid elf, half orc fighter, elf ranger, elf wizard, and the dwarf bard that I turned into a Dyrad. I even got a giant poisinous toad named Bob. Without all the animals we would have never conquered the Second Temple of Elemental Evil. With this book you can give your druid anouther advantage like better Dire Animals along with Ledgendary animals. The prestege class are interesting including the Blighter. If you want something new in your gaming be a druid and this will help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better even than Tome & Blood","review":"This is truly the grand finale to this hit-and-miss series. Some great advice is provided on when your barbarian should rage, what favored enemy will give your ranger the most mileage, and on what animal companions to pick up. Don't bother playing a druid without this book. The book provides a snotload of handy feats, though some of these are repeats. Legendary animals are detailed. (These are like dire animals, but better. Check out the Legendary Tiger!) The spells are on a par with those from Tome & Blood. The prestige classes are better than those found in Sword & Fist. The rules update on the Druid's wild shape ability is as good as the trap rules in the relatively disappointing Song & Silence. This is the best paperback product out of WOtC since the advent of 3e, including Hero Builder's Guidebook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masters of the Wild - Optional but handy","review":"Masters of the Wild isn't too bad for a supplemental book. Frankly it is geared heavily toward druids but it does give bits here and there useful for barbarians and rangers as the guidebook implies. Prior to this book I had found it very hard to find prestigue classes that'd work for druids and it gives more details about animal companions, which is handy for both druids and rangers. Useful either for PCs or NPCs, but naturally only get this if either characters are druids, barbarians, or rangers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work.","review":"The battery fit, just like the Sony, but the camera sends up a flag saying, \\"Use infoLithium battery\\".

One of the few good tracks, \\"How does it feel to ya\\" is produced by former Naughty by Nature member Kay Gee and this track stands out. Another good track is \\"Still ride til we die\\".

It was simple to install; however, after just two days, the film started coming off just like other reviewers had said. I watched the company video and cleaned and dried the window just as suggested (I thought maybe others had not been so thorough), so it can't be dirt or oil causing the problem. I believe the tape is where the problem lies.

I am really disappointed since now I have no used for what I bought, which is inexcusable. I am throwing away dollars trying to save pennies!I honestly expected that because the actual plastic film is probably VERY cheap to produce, and is designed to shrink, that it would even be a little over-sized, especially because right in the instructions it says to 'allow at least 1 inch overhang on all sides'. If that is the case, what I bought is only good for windows up to 40\\" x 58\\"! That's a HUGE difference.Lesson learned: Don't trust the marketing for the this brand! Otherwise, it is not really a bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE","review":"I'm on my third box of this product.

I brought it backand checked to make sure my next box has stickier tape. It seems I'm not the only one. Most of the boxeswere opened and tampered with. It seems many people have a problem with this product or so many boxes wouldnot have been opened. I ended up using blue painters tape with the original plastic. Not next year.

Then they never buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use this product","review":"I found that the tape works just fine if you use a blow dryer after you have the tape and plastic in place. Getting them in place is a pain though and made for more frustration than I wanted to deal with. I am using what I have left over of the product from last season but will never buy it again.

This year, for whatever reason, Frost King totally changed the tape that comes with the kit and it sucks unbelievably bad. I cannot believe this tape even made it onto the market, that's how bad it is. Didn't anyone even test it first?Anyway, if you read the reviews on this site, you'll notice all the good ones are from 2009 and earlier, before they changed the tape.

We always end up using plastic on windows in the winter because we are suckers for old draft houses. My husband picked this up and Home Depot. And I kept thinking we were doing something wrong. Even though I knew we were not. The tape is HORRIBLE. It pulls away from window itself. Even it is freshly cleaned with no dirt to be found. AND the plastic itself pulls away from the tape. It pulls away when you use the hairdryer to tighten the plastic and as I sit here next to the window we just did it is pulling away with the wind. We will be getting the 3M today.

The tape provided is really not very sticky, so it's tough to get it to stick to the window frames (you really DO need to leave it in place a while and press it down repeatedly).

I stopped halfway through, threw in the garbage and got 3M products. To start with, the double sided tape is complete crap. It doesn't stick, but that's not the worst part. Trying to peel off the backing after it has been applied to the window seal is a joke. The fricking strips are cut every two inches, so you are basically peeling off a thousand little pieces of tape.

Here are my complaints: First of all, when you blow dry it tight, the tape doesn't stay glued. Also, it never blow dries smooth enough, even when I know I got it up straight. So I don't bother blow drying at all anymore. I can see through it just fine and I've gotten used to seeing the wrinkles. Oh yeah, the biggest pain in the butt is getting the backing off the tape.

This is because aside from its technical contents, it also contains lots of anecdotes that make it a pleasure to read. From this book, I could presume that Prof. Kennedy is not only a great researcher but an excellent teacher too. Even the answers to selected problems are explained thoroughly and clearly. Besides, the price is so affordable. Nevertheless, I would prefer to see the geometry of least squares than the Ballantine-Venn diagram utilized in the book. I also agree that GMM should be included in the subsequent editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written work","review":"The text is doubtless beautiful. If you get stuck with the convoluted and ambiguous terms/concepts while reading other econometrics text, such as Greene, Johston-DiNardo, Amemiya, or even Gujarati,.. this Guide will guide you through the forest of terms and definitions and theorems.I firmly believe only by understanding what the story is all about can one really love the matters.

This CD is as good as his Tribute To ... albums, and may even be in a league with If It Weren't For Polka Music I'd Go Crazy. Ziwich plays every instrument in the book (except strings, I guess) and his virtuosity shows.

I kept checking the Hasbro Scrabble website, even the website for the European rights owner for Scrabble. For Windows, yes, but no Scrabble for Mac OS X. Finally I see this group package, although according to the MacSoft website this doesn't even exist. Took a chance. It has Risk also, a great game, and Monopoly!

I use the Scrabble game frequently and have never experienced a crash or any other wierd problems. I'm running the newest OS (10.4.6) on my iBook G4. Maybe others had problems if they were using an older Mac with a slower processer. You may need to have enough memory left on the harddrive in order for the game to run properly. Anyway, I really enjoy this game pack. The only issue I have with the Scrabble game is that their dictionary of allowable words isn't as extensive as the one on my Palm OS. When I've tried to use some offbeat \\"legal\\" words, it doesn't accept it and I lose my turn!

The Dewalt tech put it this way: \\"We designed it to work in all speeds, but that's just the way it came out.\\" In other words, the production model is defective. I have an old 2-speed 18V drill, and the clutch works as it should in the 0-450 rpm range. The XRP clutch does not work in the 0-450 range. Since low speed has the highest torque, this is where you most need a clutch!! Wait for Dewalt to fix this! They know it is defective, but are trying to tell everyone it is normal. Bad show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Drill","review":"I have had this drill for 1 year and have had absolutely no problems. I believe it is the best drill on the market, which is why I bought it. As far as some of the other reviews are concerned I know plenty of people who have this exact drill or the non hammerdrill model and none have had problems. As far as it compared to the Milwakee 18v: Dewalt has more power 450in/lbs to 400in/lbs, 3 speed instead of 2 speed, and a one handed chuck which has never ever slipped compared to a two handed chuck. I have dropped this drill to concrete a number of times, once from a second story straight on the drill bit/shaft. The drill bit was completely bent and the concrete had a big mark but the drill shaft is perfectly straight. I also ran my drill over with an F350 and it still runs like new. Anyways, it is a great drill with more power than alot of corded 1/2 inch drills. I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me!","review":"They must have fixed the problem with the clutch. Mine works fine in all three speeds.I like this drill over competing drills for a few reasons. The ratcheting chuck makes me feel more secure about using a keyless system with a hammerdrill, for one thing. The torque provided by the lowest speed is almost ridiculously powerful. And it just feels more comfortable in my hand compared to other high-end cordless drills.The T-grip gives a better balance than a pistol-grip style drill like DeWalt's DW989, but I know some people who like the DW989 because the pistol-grip lets them get their trigger hand in line with the bit for masonry drilling. I was more interested in the balance of the drill, so I bought this one. So far, I haven't been disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"no clutch","review":"make sure you don't need a clutch for driving screws because none of the new 18v have a usable clutch. I can drive screws right thru oak on setting #1 on low speed. The only time the clutch even begins to work is on the highest speed and only butchers drive screws at 2000 rpm. Great drill for changing tires"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Power - Weak Transmission","review":"Ordered this 18v Dewalt three weeks ago to replace a five year old Porter Cable 12v. Received it and put it right to use. Amazed with all the power! Four days later, while driving 3\\" decking screws into soft pine 2x4's the transmission stipped out. Amazon was great about getting me a replacement. I've had the new one for about a week now, and it is making the same grinding noise and slipping like the first one did. I can't believe that I was unlucky enough to get 2 defective ones. There is some sort of problem in the design of the mechanism that allows for one handed bit changes. As soon as I finish this review, I'm calling Amazon back to try to get into a Porter Cable. I know they work good since my old 12v drove the screws in that this Dewalt wouldn't.

In order to make a one handed chuck the brake on these drills is extremly active. Unfortunitly the hard stop feature causes colet to put a slight impact on the jaws causing them to open after 40-60 stops.This Causes the bits to fall out. I emailed dewalt about this problem they refuse to ansewer back. Don't they test these tools befor put them on the market. I haved switched to all makita and no problems yet. I tried to buy american got hammered 1 more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Drill is a POS","review":"I purchased the Dewalt 18V thinking it was the best drill on the market. I took it out of the box and found it had excessive runout in the chuck. I returned it and got the Milwaukee. The Milwaukee it cheeper, it has more torque, it is a much better tool. The chuck is all metal, and it is a beast or a drill. Every other DeWalt that I have seen (4 out of 4) have all had chucks that wobble...

There are so few masterpieces that come out nowadays and I can only name a handfull over the last few years (Mars Volta - Deloused in the Comatorium, Procupine Tree - In Absentia, Tool - Lateralus...) and QOTSA - Songs for the Deaf can stand proudly beside these albums and wave the flag of butt-kick' rawk."},{"rating":"2","title":"ripping","review":"Kim Hughes hit the review square on the head (Nice one ;0).

The label stoner rock would do such a disservice to this album and band, this is just frickin' awesome, no matter what you call it. Buy it now!

The power rock style of this album is extremely catchy, and this proves to be a great driving, head-banging album. The riffs to No one knows, God is in the radio, and Song for the dead are some of the catchiest I've heard this decade. I'm especially impressed by Mosquito Song, which completely strays from the power rock style of the entire album, and moves into a symphonic folk rock song about cannibalism.Even though Josh Homme kicked out the bassist and played drums for the (joke) band Eagles of Death Metal, I still expect great things from their upcoming 2005 release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of 2002, and maybe best of the 2000's","review":"This is an amazing album.

So that being said, first track, BOOM, thats all i can say. It's so in your face rockin that you just can't ignore it. With the bassist Nick Oliveri wailing away on most of the vocals and the lead singer/rythim guitarist Josh Homme holdin down the riffs, it's a song like i havent heard in, well, ever. The albums energy continues all the way through, though i'm not a big fan of the track Shooter, everything else is absolutely essential for any rock fan. As it is a bit of a concept type album in certain aspects, it's a bit like a Pink Floyd album for hard rockers. So whether you like it because it's got that stoner music vibe, or you're just looking for something new, don't overlook this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"probably the best album since nevermind. The problem with rock today is that its all crap, like creed and nickleback. There of course are several others.

For some reason music fans of today can't hear greatness. I tip my hat to Queens because they made a hell of a record, and i'm looking forward to their future work.

I don't know who put a guitar in grandma's hands but take it away..please!I bought this clunker because mark lanegan was on it. Wow. Did they ever waste him.

Apparently this group thinks crappy 70's garage rock deserves revisiting. I beg to differ. This band has actually managed to be worse than the bands that spawned them. This is the bastard offspring of the worst incarnation of rock 'n roll. Retarded machismo abounds, and the lyrics bring to mind the phrase \\"retards attempting poetry.\\" I had to listen a few more times to prove it was actually as bad as I thought it was the first time.

It was poison to the ears.At first, I was excited for this album; I genuinely liked \\"No One Knows,\\" and I still do, despite it being overplayed, and Dave Grohl rocks. However, upon hearing the full album, I was severely disappointed. The drumming ranks among Dave's best. But the rest sounds like someone turned their instruments on, and shoved them into a blender, and let it run.If you want to spend your money on an album, pick up the Foo Fighter's \\"One By One\\" or the new \\"Nirvana\\" compilation. Completely bypass this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't understand why this band is popular","review":"I picked up this cd out of pure curiousity, when I listened to it...it flat out sucked! This music is obviously popular for two main reasons, Dave Grohl's performance on drums helps the band to look \\"cool.\\" Well, I've got news for you Grohl enthusiasts; he's definitely a solid drummer, but he IS NOT that great. The tiltle of this cd is befitting - these songs really would be more enjoyable if you were deaf; the music is that bad. The only song that's decent is \\"no one knows,\\" and that's not even that great of a song. The other reason this cd is popular is because it's the new \\"cool band\\" to listen to. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just rocks!","review":"I'd never really listened to QOTSA until I heard this album. Its awesome! The album flows so well from one song to the next. Great guitar and drums throughout. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Realese of the Year?","review":"It's certaintly looking that way. In short this album kicks ..., there's just no other way to put. The vocals are awesome and it seems like the guys have gotten to be better musicians since Rated R (especialy Nick). There is alot of diversity on this album, but they rarely step outside of rock, there is punk (Six Shooter) metal (Millionaire, Song for the Deaf) Doorsesque rock (God is in the Radio) stoner rock (The Sky is Falling) and even folk (Mosquito Song). All of the songs are memorable and get caught in your head very easily. They recall band like Sabbath and the Stooges, but were a lesser band would just copy the formula (The Hives anyone?) QOTSA give it a breath of fresh air. Take a bow QOTSA you earned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock the way it's meant to be","review":"This disc feels like a breath of fresh air because you have a group trying to 1) be catchy and 2) be musically interesting. Dave Grohl's drumming helps a lot, for example on \\"First It Giveth\\" there's catchy singing, relatively bland guitar/bass work, and the drumming makes the music good. The CD also bears close listening - odd instruments like flute pop up every now and again, though they're buried in the mix. The radio station interludes don't bother me, they're meant to tie the record together. The bonus DVD is cool - it has live performances of two old songs and \\"No One Knows\\", plus pieces of other songs. The neatest thing shows QOTSA at work in the studio and the technical drumming terms Josh uses when talking to Dave... \\"play it like bud-a-bump-bum-bump, but with stiff wrists\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! Intelligent heavy rock, at last","review":"Black Sabbath SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH; Nirvana NEVERMIND; Soundgarden SUPERUNKNOWN. If you'd been searching for the next classic in this sequence, look no further -- SONGS FOR THE DEAF is the business.I know nothing about this band, having bought the CD purely on the strength of reviews in broadsheet newspapers. I have not been disappointed. The DVD leaves me not much wiser. But those shrieking vocals, the wailing guitars, the light humour of the Clone Radio theme running through the CD, and the general quality of the songwriting ... You just have to buy this one, particularly in its 'Limited Edition' format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can do MUCH better than this","review":"This album follows the same formula used on the previous two albums - throw in 2 or 3 (at most) good songs and stuff the rest of the album with fillers.The song \\"No One Knows\\" is the single, and with good reason - there's nothing else ANYWHERE NEAR as good on the rest of the album. The only ones that come even remotely close are \\"Hangin' Tree\\" and \\"Another Love Song\\", and they are very different musically.The instrumentation is exceptional but where are the decent tunes guys? I'm not a fan of disjointed, droning melodies and chord progressions.As I said earlier, they are capable of pulling off two or three mind-blowers on each album. The talent is there - so why don't they start using it? I'm very disappointed (again)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock ?","review":"I have a few words to say,First of all let's start with \\"over rated\\"This is a nice CD and for that matter \\"R rated\\" is Ok too, but so what,...

I was going through a \\"thing\\" at the time and was really beginning to branch out musically. After chopping my way through \\"Is This It?\\" and \\"White Blood Cells\\", I decided to look up QOTSA on Limewire. After hearing \\"No One Knows\\" and \\"Millionaire\\", I decided to pick up the full album the next day. I was not ready for it. I was not ready for how much I would obsess over each track, over the percussion gun that is Dave Grohl. I don't think the album left my CD player for weeks. This album is a freaking journey. Seriously epic, at least to me. The crunchy sound of the guitars on the opening track to the haunting acoustics on ending track, this is truly a saga. 10 years later, this album still makes me feel like a millionaire. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few classic rock albums from this century.","review":"I purchased this album on CD when it first came out in 02' and I listened to it non-stop for a over a year. Nine years later, I still love this album. Queens of the Stone Age's sound is very unique, and this album contains some of their best work.When I give guitar lessons to younger teenagers, I always give them this album to ingest. And they all come back thanking me and telling me how much they love this album.This album was QOTSA at it's all-time best because of their line-up. The legendary Dave Grohl was on drums, and Mark Lanegan sang on a few great songs. Also, this album had Nick Oliveri on bass, who in my opinion, was just as important of a contributor to this band as Josh Homme. Post-Oliveri QOTSA albums just didn't have the same spark or quality.If you are a fan of good music, get this album - It's timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"QOSA Masterpiece","review":"Songs for the Deaf is a masterpiece, the album flows like a radio station, and that station brings great metal. All the Songs are great, with classics like No one Knows, Go with the flow and song for the dead. Really great heavy rock album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody's Gonna Be Happy","review":"Best metallic 'stoner' rock since Nevermind. Period. Superb manic drumming by Dave Grohl, massive crunchy guitars and even an appearance by Ween's Dean Ween.Now, what every reviewer fails to mention (that said I haven't read all the reviews) is that after the Victorian chamber music sounding hidden Mosquito song, there's another hidden track. It's a cover of Everybody's Gonna Be Happy by The Kinks, and it adds a funny party tone to a collection of mostly serious tracks.At least it was included on my copy, bought in Australia.SPACE TRUCKIN'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal perfection","review":"The best metal album since Metallica's Master of Puppets, easily. Why don't you own this? What's your problem, chump?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut album that brings something new to the table...","review":"After hearing their debut single \\"No One Knows\\", I had to buy the disc. I was very pleased with what I heard - because it was FRESH!! There are many styles of music and writing on this disc from the popish garage rock of \\"No One Knows\\" to the almost-orchestral \\"Mosquito Song\\", which I thoroughly LOVE! I'm a strings man myself :)As I listened I heard Freddie Mercury/Queen influences in their minor, chord changing choruses and familiar guitar work. I also love Josh's higher voice, much of Freddie Mercury too. There were a couple of songs I didn't really care for: Six Shooter, Go With The Flow and Gonna Leave You, but No One Knows, Mosquito Song, The Sky Is Fallin', God Is In The Radio and Song For The Deaf are so good, it still earns 5 stars!This is a definite, modern day must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Queens of the Stoneage (QOTSA) are really good. I didn't start liking then until this year after I saw them at Webster. They normally aren't the kind of music I listen to, my favorite band is Sublime, but \\"QOTSA\\" are really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Hurts - In a good way.","review":"This CD made me forget about \\"bands\\" like Puddle of Mud (sic) and Hoobastank and Creed. When I listened to it for the first time, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I honestly thought there would never be a Zepplin/Soundgarden caliber band ever again, and I had no hope. But this record plays like a thunderstorm in a desert. Homme's & Oliveri's layers of the guitar and bass are violent, exquisite, and tightly formed. Grohl rocks me as a drummer (he's like the king of change ups and he is arguably the most capable musician around). The lyrics re-invent \\"positive negativity\\" (genuine social concern as opposed to \\"my girlfriend is mean to me\\") and put a message fourth on a music medium of smooth, mellow heat. The end result is a shotgun crack right through the middle of mainstream silence. OK - maybe I'm getting too esoteric for a music review. Just get the album and give it a crack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album of the year? Groundbreaking? Hardly....","review":"Like everyone else, I was pulled in by the catchy \\"No One Knows\\". If you really listen to that song, though, it just repeats a few lines OVER AND OVER. Unfortunately, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree on this album. It feels like a broken record. The \\"Queens\\", in my opinion, are an overrated band getting hype for putting out something nobody else has yet. There's a reason nobody has done this kind of music before, though: It's not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly underwhelming","review":"don't believe the hype. this made-for-MTV, hopelessly outdated, bland and unoriginal band personifies everything that is wrong with music in general. hey, im no expert, but why waste your time with boring and inane patter when there are thousands of great albums just waiting to be heard?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and watch the video!!!","review":"I saw the \\"No One Knows\\" video on ..last week and I thought it was clever and the tune kina catchy.

I was also excited to have an anatomically correct male doll. I think, however, because he is three (on the older side of potty training age) and a somewhat intelligent child, he immediately figured out how to make the doll go potty (literally within 5 seconds), and just became fascinated by the cause and effect of squeezing the dolls leg. He could not have cared less that we praised the doll for going potty. He just wanted to make it go potty again.Aside from that, the doll does leak, as mentioned by previous reviewers. I think this could be a useful tool for a younger toddler (18-24 month old) who is ready for potty training, but if your child is older and therefore more aware of making things function on their own (and also a headstrong child), it is not so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This toy is expensive junk.

The bass playing is likewise exceptional, there is a lot of bluesy Hammond B3 which fits perfectly, the guitar soloing (some by John Scofield) is very strong and the horn riffing and soloing are quite good. This cd may not please jazz OR funk \\"purists\\" but as a logical extension of things like Spyro Gyra (whom I generally dislike as too saccharine), the Yellow Jackets, and Jeff Lorber Fusion this is actually a recording I prefer to anything those groups ever did.

In particular, his reply to Rorty just about made me cough up my cup of tea into the book it was that funny.The argument of objectivity is getting very tired and, after all the work done by Godel, Chaitin, Perlovsky, Einstein and Prigogine, really seems to have been undermined by it's supposed saviour, science. Time for new ideas and Lyotard's style should be one of the first. After years and piles of books by de Bono one wonders why ideas are still being presented in the dry vacuum of middle-excluded logic.Definitely worth reading and pondering."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASIN ??... a \\"BEST\\" discovery (pgs.83-101)","review":"1...for this uneducated old fool who has been pursuing a strange intuitiive feeling that postmodern philosophy had hidden somewhere within it a core that would clarify my self educated understanding of existence but had almost given up on all the danmd word players, loyatard's 18 pages offering his overall view of existence and cosmic evolution has renewed my hopes of discovering even more treasures amongst the trash of this world. 2...i am also profiting from (learning and enjoying) the other offerings. 3...if there are other treasures up to this level available, this blind old hawg hopes to find them. 4...for \\"late-in-life\\" autodidact lovers of heuristic learning such as i aspire to be i say \\"don't give in to supposed expert word game players\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Twisted Sister were one of the biggest hair band is the late 80s.

Her one concession is the title track, which is really the only radio-friendly song of the bunch.Her vocals are perfect, the arrangements are perfect, and the backing band is perfect. I like hearing what songs my favorite artists like and are influenced by, which you hear in concert a lot, so for PB to do this album, and do it so well, and without watering down the style, is such a treat. I'm sure doing this album was a labor of love for all involved, and it deserved a better fate.The only, and I mean only, criticism I have of the album is the last track. I hate secular Christmas music and this just doesn't fit with the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat Benatar's Surprise Treasure","review":"I became aware of this album by way of the \\"True Love\\" video. Tracking it down on Amazon (where else of course) proved to be a great move. It's a fast paced smokin' jump blues album that BELONGS in you Benatar collection. This little lady heats up songs like Bloodshot Eyes, Payin' the Cost to be the Boss, I Feel Lucky, Good Life as well as providing sultry vocals to the afore-mentioned True Love and So Long. This lady can sing! And the backing musicians are all spot on top notch people. Do yourself a favor, if your a Pat Benatar fan or a blues lover (I'm both),and definately give this album the listen it deserves. And,just maybe, if we get lucky, she'll do another one someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat Benetar does the blues","review":"I loved this CD.

If you want a quick music fix, but don't have time for a regular length cd, pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best singles","review":"Sakura Drops/Letters is a double A-side single that appeared in her \\"Deep River\\" era. Sakura Drops is very unique sounding with some beautiful lyrics. Utada hits her high notes perfectly and sings really low and beautiful at the same time. My only compliant was near the ending their was the instrumentation, Utada's back up vocal, and her singing. It got all clumped up and sounded to meshed up together. Letters is the best song out of this single. She hits her high notes perfectly and it's a really catchy song. I love the ending, because it's quite true. The Karaokes for both songs are nice too listen to. An overall great single."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This single is awesome! Sakura Drops is nice but I really like the song Letters. Her voice isn't as stable as it has been in other albums/singles of hers but she is singing higher than she normally does (also did this in Hikari). She does a nice job for being an alto singer. She really shows off her nice beautiful low voice for ending of Letters where she sings in English for a little bit. But on the whole it is a wonderful single. She is such a talented singer and songwriter. I look forward to her new album DEEP RIVER ...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New style..

One thing I have to say I am disappointed in is the fact that some songs seem to end without proper closure, such \\"Life Makes No Sense.\\" It seems as though they didn't finish writing the song, and just threw an ending in it.

A clever mix of great punk melodies, humor, and profanity all filtered through the balls out punk rock sound that only the Vandals can provide. Whether you're listening to the Vandals for the first time, or the 500th, this is the quintessential Vandals album. All of the favorite songs are here and some nice little sound bites as well.

Colorful but ponderous, with little plot and non-redemptive scripting, Noel Coward let us down on all fronts. Karl (Nelson Eddy) and Sarah (Jeanette MacDonald) are young newlyweds who flee the establishment to Vienna to live on love with little money. He is a struggling writer, she is the favored singer in 19th century Victorian high society. This spawns trouble for the happy couple when Saxony Baron George Sanders tries to seduce the lovely chanteuse. A duel follows, like none I'd ever seen...it was over before it began. I would have hoped dirctor Van Dyke II could have managed a few fencing lessons for Nelson Eddy to make the scene less clumsy.

This album, however, hides some very intersting pieces (personally I recommend \\"Blade Of Grass\\" and \\"For Kevin\\") and points to a new direction in his career. If you buy this album looking for the ferocious sinth's riffs that were the keystone of \\"Tarkus\\" or \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" you will certainly be disappointed. Keith is somehow more romantic, more balanced in his music. It is pretty obvious he's listening a lot of Jazz CDs. The genius is there, alright, but the music holds no vestige of the exibitionist that stabed organs in ELP's shows. None of us is getting any younger but Keith, like every genius, shows that you can always recycle yourself and find new brilliant ways of expression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is fine set of recordings, which demonstrate Emersons talent as a virtuoso keyboard player in a multitude of styles.Its mostly solo Piano and contains some marvellous tracks noteably Ginastera's Creole Dance.So if you like solo Piano (although there are a couple of Jazz Trio tracks as well), in a variety of different styles this is well worth buying.Keiths own sleevenotes give a little insight into each track and the whole CD shows what a great talent the man is."},{"rating":"2","title":"BlueVelvette","review":"I love this puzzle.

Personally I love Goldfrapp's inclusion of schlocky subject matter and the \\"Midwich Children's Choir\\" is good fun.

They are pleasant to listen to but not so simple that they bore this seasoned musician.You can definately see that Steve has some seriously good influences in his music. Some songs are remniscent of other musicians, but none are carbon copies.You can see the tons of tapped and untapped potential he has and I hope he keeps making music- I'll keep listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good album","review":"I just rediscovered this thing in my pile of CDs (I bought it when it came out and never listened to it more than once) and put it on at work -- and it's really good!

This particular salsa definitely works best as a chip dip. It can also be spooned generously over some diced ham and eggs but the sweet, mildJamaican blendis arguably a better choice for that.

It gets so scuzzy that I have to use toothpicks and straight pins to get the gook out of it's multitude of crevices. The straps are bulky and the harness is poorly designed.

The vinyl underneath the cover is diffucult to remove for cleaning and in order to get the straps off you need a special wrench to undo the bolts. There are very few pros...The tray removes easily but is too large to maneuver in a regular kitchen sink under a regular faucet for cleaning. It is also very porous and stains.The wheels and locks work well.It has a nice recline feature for smaller children but we used the bouncy seat for feeding until our son could support himself.The plastic piece which is postioned between the child's legs is a nice safety feature, especially when you chuck the straps.It seems comfy and roomy if you remove the straps or just connect the straps at the waist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!

My son was never rough on the chair, in fact, he has been in day care and really only used it on evenings and weekends. Of course I could purchase new parts, but I think that something of this nature, and in this price range, should last at least thru one child!

As the mom of a now-12-month-old my recommendation is to buy the simplest chair you can find - you'll be just as happy as if you'd bought this chair and spend a lot less time cleaning it. I've just bought a $13 booster seat to replace this chair and am 100% better-off. It takes 20 seconds to wipe down, leaves more space in the dining area and the floor's a lot easier to clean with just a regular chair to move.My guess is that a lot of the other reviews were written by people only owning the Peg Perego chair.

THREE TIMES A DAY, I have the privilege of trying to undo all the food particles caught in numerous straps, crevices, and every other inch of these highchairs. I wish that I had registered for a cheap, plastic, simple highchair that wasn't so \\"high-maintenance\\". Everytime I clean the highchairs, I end up frustrated and upset.

Anyway, I was able to return the chair for a full refund. My main frustration was that the tray never came close enough to my daughter. So, food would drop in between causing a major added clean-up! Us Moms are busy enough and we don't have time to waste. Suffix it to say, the company suggested using a pillow behind my daughter which they thought would make her closer.

But just before her 21st birthday, her mother is struck by a hit and run driver, and Henrietta discovers she's not who she thought she was.This is the third in Aird's series of excellently well-written, police-procedural-types of classic British mystery with the team of Detective-Inspector Sloan (methodical, persistent, an all-around \\"good copper\\") and Detective-Constable Crosby (young, brash and a bit dim).The best about Aird's books is that she actually gives you the clues (in the best tradition) cleverly hidden in the dialog and descriptions, so that if you pay close attention, you have a good chance of figuring things out. I wish more of her books were in print. Not as depressing as Martha Grimes or Elizabeth George, but equally interesting, and her detecting team manage to be amusing while still \\"real\\" people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic who-dun-it that's well worth reading.","review":"Like other reviewers I really enjoyed this book. It's probably Catherine Aird's best.Grace Jenkins is knocked down by a car and killed, which leaves her 20-year-old daughter Henrietta alone in the world. Bewildered Henrietta is then told that on the basis of the autopsy examination Grace Jenkins couldn't possibly be her mother- she had never had any children.Meanwhile,in one of the best scenes of the book, the police are examining the scene of the traffic \\"accident\\", and coming to the grim conclusion that it was a case of murder by motor car.The police have to solve a murder, and Henrietta has to find her true identity. The book is a comfortable read without being too soft-headed, and the dialogue is first-rate. The book is fairly short- there is no unnecessary padding.

The first part of the book is broken down by season - trivia questions, followed by the section for trivia answers (it would have been better if each trivia question was followed by the trivia answer by season, instead of spending time flipping pages back and forth).Then, too little attention was devoted to analyzing each episode.As much as I loved the show, is as much as I loathed the book, which is alot!

I knew the main characters were fictional, but expected their lives to be integrated with Tyndale's in a way that would show me more about who Tyndale was, what his life was like. No. This is just a novel - and a bland one at that - that makes up a story about helping smuggle Bibles, but the story is only about the shippers exploits."},{"rating":"1","title":"guidebook factory","review":"The idea of a totally comprehensive listing of California campgrounds is a great idea but this book fails when it comes to accurate information. I really question whether the team of writers actually visited the very campsites they describe.

I started reading reviews about places up north, and it gives plenty of descriptions and commentary. They're much longer than the ones in Los Angeles. I don't think he's camped down here. Just compiled a list of campsites here. Also, his rating scale is very questionable. One campground I know to be a virtual parking lot, he gave a 9 out of 10 rating for. I should have bought a different book.This book will be helpful if I decide to take a camping trip up north. otherwise, thumbs down :("},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst guide ever written","review":"I don't believe Tom Stienstra has visited many of the campgrounds he recommends.

John kay had a front row center seat during the most creative period of rock music.

I lost most of my weight from the Atkins plan. Though I'm off that plan...a low-calorie diet of no more than 1050 calories per day worked for me. I went from a size 14 to a current size 3. I figured this book would help with toning up my body...but there are very few strength training exercies.

I thought the reviews were misrepresentational. If you're interested in fitness and have read other books or magazines, or you're already following a workout programme, it's a waste of time reading this book.

Well, for that purpose, it is a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. If you are seeking weight training that will enhance your overall fitness program, look elsewhere (fortunately, I found a book by Joyce Verdal and am currently getting outstanding results)...if you know nothing about exercise, fitness and diet, this book would be a good all-around introduction, but the weight training part is inadequate (only 6 exercizes and a few pages--most of the book, as I recall, is recipes!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a SANE diet and fitness book!","review":"This book is the best book you can read, if you are looking NOT for a lose-it-quick fad diet, but for an overall change in lifestyle that promotes sane and healthy eating habits and a sensible exercise regimen. The exercise program works best for those who have been sedentary, but it it also possible to intensify the workout if you are already exercising.

Ice T is a cool guy, \\"unfortunately\\" he's the bad guy, the role that is, his performance is great. Chases, shooting, fights, danger all the way. Everyone dreamt of hidden treasures as a kid, well, when you've seen this movie you're glad you never actually went looking for one! Like Leprechaun's Pot o' Gold, everyone is chasing it.

Being an avid fan of Barbra Taylors Bradford, and her book Woman of Substance. This book was not near the quality you would expect from her. The story centers around the mysterious death of a young womens exhusband. She sets out to find the cause of his death. At times the story line was predictable, and seemed to drag. What suprised me was the twist and turn at the end. Yes it does have some surprises at the end, but after I was done with the book I just couldn't beleive someone actually came up with this warpped story line, espically a well noted writer like Ms. Bradford.

At first I felt the other Trek soundtracks were better. However, on seeing the movie, this soundtrack is superb. (I have many of the tunes stuck in my head!) Goldsmith did an excellent job adding great emotional content to this movie. This soundtrack contains a variety of melodies from the soothing track, \\"My Right Arm\\", to the pulse pounding tracks of \\"Scorpion\\", and \\"Engage\\".I'm usually not a fan of synthesized additions, but they are used in a way that boots the energy of the music. I recommend seeing the movie, as well as getting the soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But It's Mssing Something...","review":"I loved the movie Star Trek Nemesis and the music was great. I'm glad they have a CD of the music from the film. However, I am APPALLED that the song \\"Blue Skies\\" wasn't incorporated into the CD. How could they do that?!

But, putting that aside, I would highly recommend this CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks the Bravo of Trekdom","review":"I have been a fan of Star Trek, and of course the music of Trek. But I would have to say that the most recent soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith lacks the inspiring qualities that makes the Star Trek music great. Goldsmith like the other four soundtracks that he has done has the classic Trek music from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, but with the digital sound that is created, the music at times falls flat. Although I have not seen the movie at the time of writing this, if this is and could be the last movie of the TNG Crew, you would think that Goldsmith or at least Paramount would at the very least put more effort the soundtrack. I would also have to mention that the movie itself is intending to be just under 2 hrs of movie time, and the soundtrack is less than an hour, that is terrible. Goldsmith you did okay, but this is certainly not your best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Star Trek Soundtrack","review":"This Star Trek soundtrack has everything. \\"My Right Arm\\" is a touching theme that plays during Captain Picard's toast to Will Riker at the latter's wedding. \\"The Scorpion\\" is a hard-driving action number that accompanies Picard and Data's escape from Shinzon's ship in one of its own shuttles. \\"Data & B4\\" is an ethereal piece that underscores a scene between the android and his prototype \\"brother,\\" and \\"Let's Go To Work\\" accentuates a new resolve by Picard's crew to fight the enemy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for Hive Dwellers","review":"Star Trek fan since original series here. Soundtrack does support film's unfolding. Goldsmith IS a gift to mankind generally. Credentials being given, let me state that this is one of the most unlistenable CDs ever. Not designed for the HUMAN ear, the you-know-what must have commissioned it. 90% totally a wreck giving headaches when attempted to endure it several times. Goldsmith must have been in need of quick cash to lend his name to anti-music here, despite what anyone may propagandize he could not have been the true auteur. Western and Eastern modalities seldomly appear, listen to MPs VERY CAREFULLY before shelling out on it. Mood music for bad acid trippers, or maybe suicide bombers, ants, nanobots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sight unseen and UNHEARD, I WILL buy it!","review":"It's Goldsmith...the man can do no wrong...well, there was that little score to \\"Chain Reaction\\" of which he must be forgiven.In the meantime, the latest installment of the \\"Trek\\" saga is definitely a better film due to Jerry's involvement.

There was no beauty in this CD. Just action action action. Aside from the the piano solo of \\"blue skies\\" It was all synthisizer nonsense. One reason I believe Lord of the Rings does so well is the beautiful composing of HOward Shore. It is gorgeous worthy of a tear. There were no soft cortets just boom boom and so forth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film but poor score","review":"Goldsmith always manages to pull off great scores for the Star Trek movies and Next Gen, Deep Space 9 and Voyager tv series. But he fails in so many levels to capture the excitment of this action packed film. Maybe hes getting old or lacks the exuberance he once had. After doing hundreds of film and tv scores I dont blame him if he lacks originality. Star Trek the motion picture still stands as his best for the Star Trek movies. Hope you can come out with more originality in his other film scores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Goldsmith's first foray into TREK!","review":"Jerry Goldsmith's score to \\"Star Trek: the Motion Picture\\" stands as a pinnacle in the annals of music for a science fiction epic. The composer's contribution to the latest installment in the long-running saga is a worthy addition to an already brilliant string of monumental scores.This disc offers the listener to fully appreciate the powerful themes that were overshadowed somewhat in the theater experience. A more militaristic score than his previous scores, \\"Nemesis\\" bombards and thrills the senses, befitting the confrontation between the valiant Enterprise crew and its latest enemy.The quality of SACD is definitely worth the extra expense and, like Trek, is a preview of things to come.For that, audiophiles can be most appreciative."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get it wet","review":"I already didn't like this unit.

And I had to have the sending unit replaced (thank goodness for the friendship of The Bike Shop). So I was grudgingly getting along with the thing until I rode with it in the rain.

Initial topics, focusing on both the old-time automobiles as well as how they fit into society, were quite interesting. However, the portions on the innards of the car became technical and rather boring. It reads like a poorly-translated repair manual at times. My wife and I both felt that it should have stayed with the cultural aspects of automobiles--for example, what has its role been in non-European and non-American societies? Also, a stunning omission is the lack of information on future designs and current experimentation.

While both my co-host Jeff and I enjoyed this movie, we did disagree a bit on just how good it is. Jeff maintains that this is a classic martial arts movie with great fights, interesting characters and a real story. While I agree, I feel that the movie had a few pacing and storyline issues (albeit minor ones) and that Wang Yu is essentially doing an impersonation of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western characters. This also may be the first of the \\"special weapon\\" films featuring odd devices created for the movies.All in all, though, it is a worthy addition to any kung fu or action movie collection. The Dragon Dynasty edition is a beautiful version of the film, even if it is not HD, and features excellent English dubbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad movie just not my style","review":"The video quality is good and the sound is nice as well just wish there had been longer fight scenes.

I purchased the One-Armed Swordsman after reading many of the great reviews on Amazon.com. Lo and behold, for me, it was a total flop. There were no real fight scenes. Cold molasses moves faster than the pace of this movie. There were no surprises. The storyline was sub-par, the few fight scenes were horrible. Amazon must have sent me the wrong movie; this one was a totally flop.Do yourself a favor, don't believe the hype of the four and five stars given to this movie.

I'll start with my biggest problem with the mask, virtually all the vents on the mask was cover by plastic excess. I guess it came out of the mold and they attached it to the mask without bothering to free or cut an opening for the vents. I spent over an hour trying to cut out all that excess which I would've figured JT should have done.Also its small and does not cover, depending on big your head is, the top part of your head. I don't have the biggest face in the world but this mask stops right above my forehead, leaving the rest expose. Also the mask stops before my jaw line leaving part of my face and all of my neck exposed. Not cool.It's lighter than my previous mask but thats about it, I might actually just go back to my old one.Not recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Hymns made New","review":"I really lke this CD.

I find John's writing simple and practical. Is it Dallas Willard deep? No. However, it's more like a great message that you hear in a weekend service.

The observations offered by the author are slightly entertaining, and may be even quite insightful to the very easily-impressed and motivated readers. For example, using conductor and resistor as analogy is misrepresenting the physics and meaning of the scientific terms. The counterpart of conductor is insulator. Actually a resistor in an electrical circuit is the part that does all the work - that makes the light bulbs or pickle glow, for instance.Using surfing as an example of overcoming failure is okay.

Based on the events that took place in October of 1962 surrounding the Cuban missile crisis, they used actual transcripts and historical records in creating this well-written script. Expertly directed by Roger Donaldson, this film contains some top-notch performances from Bruce Greenwood as JFK, Steven Culp as RFK, and Kevin Costner as Kenny O'Donnell. The DVD version is amazing, with layers and layers of extras that provide fascinating historical background and perspective on the crisis itself and how a devastating nuclear war was avoided. It demonstrates the kind of information and detail that every DVD could and should offer, and is a must-have for any DVD collection. This is film-making at its very best.

Secondly, to not interject himself too much into a movie. He had O'Donnell as everything from Chief of staff to Jackie Kennedy's chief of staff, to advisor to AG Robert Kennedy.If you can get past Costner's bad performance, great story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Attempt... Falls short of the mark","review":"Kevin Costner stars in this over-dramatitized account of the Cuban missle crises during the 60's. The film basically encompasses the experiences of America's top leaders in the tense few days in which the United States was nearly brought to the brink of war between themselves and the Soviet Union. The acting is so \\"over-acted\\" that you can hardly focus on the events of the film without laughing about the character's reactions to the situations. All the actors totally fake accents are mind bogglingly annoying as you actually try to come to grips with the film. Costner's is the worst! Please, why don't they allow them to speak in a normal voice, it would help drastically. Besides that, this film was \\"okay\\", nothing extraordinary, and not too far below par, but it was missing a critical element called \\"interesting\\" that usually makes a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reply","review":"(...)

Costner was in virtualy every scene shot in this presentation and the Kennedy's were portrayed as merely incidental to Costner's \\"O'Donnel\\" character. If one is to beleive this attempt at telling a story to an actual historical happening then one must believe that Kenneth O'Donnel made all the momentous decisions affecting this crisis. The \\"Cuban Missle Crisis\\" was a sub-plot in this film, as evidenced by the total absence of V.P. Lyndon Johnson in this attempt at story telling.

The only reason it received bigscreen treatment was because of Costner's involvement. While I'm on the subject of Costner, I must say that his performance was horrible. His Massachusetts accent was horrible. He sounded like Elmer Fudd.

The black and white segments were pointless and contributed nothing to the film (except a concern that something was wrong with the color shift on the film).

I had trouble focusing on the story line whenever he was on screen, and even in parts when they showed him where he wasn't speaking, I couldn't help but think of how he was going to butcher his next line. Was the director too scared to tell Kevin just to speak normally? It would have been a fine performance by him otherwise.

I saw this movie with a buddy of mine and he felt the same way. A lot of information about what was actually going on behind the scenes.

Those missiles were there because Kennedy showed weakness in the Bay of Pigs incident. \\"Operation Mongoose\\" was the Kennedy brother's CIA-run operation for their obsession with assassinating Castro. Kruschev saw weakness and the need to defend his ally. Didn't see that discussed in this \\"historically accurate\\" movie.Kenny O'Donnell was not the devoted family man depicted here. He was a sleazebag.My problem with this film is that it is an inaccurate teaching of history. The producers may not claim to be 100% accurate, but so many young people - and others - believe it to be true if Hollywood says it is. The bottom line is that the Cuban Missile Crisis was Kennedy's fault. It was the Kennedy ego that got us into that situation. The whitewashing of \\"Camelot\\" needs to end.For drama, it was a good movie. But that's about all that can be said for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitewash at the Whitehouse.","review":"The actual Cuban Missile Crisis provoked 2 films, one (Dr. Strangelove), arguably the most daring, funny, and ferociously facetious satire ever made; the other (Fail Safe) a sober, thought-provoking thriller. Like this. Fail Safe flopped, because by treating the subject with due earnestness it made it seem not very scary, whereas Kubrick's laughter was noose-swingingly gallows. But at least Fail Safe retained its grim integrity - 13 Days, especially towards the end, needs increasing doses of uplift and religious sentiment. This is a comforting, nostalgic, macho film that sets its narrative in the present tense so we can forget the dubious legacy of its protagonists. What saves it is a haunting final image that seems to undermine the previous two and a half hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughibly Bad","review":"Kevin Costner's \\"performance\\" in this dreadful film should finally earn him the lack of noteriety he has so ham-handedly earned. I'm only upset that I couldn't give it less than 1 star. When Costner first began to speak, I thought he was making fun of people with Boston accents. Then he kept speaking that way and I realized \\"He thinks he's *doing* a Boston accent\\". Pathetic. Boring. Read a book about the Cuban Missle Crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film Should Be Retitled 55 Days","review":"The phony Boston accents didn't bother me. Neither did the performances by Kevin Coster, Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp. What did bother me is that the filmmakers assume the viewer is familiar with the Cuban missile crisis, the newspaper headlines and the politics of the period. They also assume you know all of the key players. If you don't, you're in trouble. Falling somewhere in between, I found myself often outside the action. Sometimes, I had to replay scenes (that helped). At other times, I had no clue what was going on. Friends and family who also rented the film gave it thumbs down. They hated Costner. I thought he was o.k. He fit the part perfectly. But you could tell that he was acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Direction, Costner's Accent the Real Disastah","review":"Maybe I just can't stand Kevin Costner. But the favorable reviews for this movie really surprised me. The only emotion I felt through the film was embarrasment -- for Costner and his on-camera wife's attempt at Boston accents. The story is pretty good, but the mushroom cloud scenes and random black & white sequences seemed amateurish and out of place. The direction pales in comparison to \\"Traffic,\\" which uses similar techniques with actual purpose and effect. Also, the Costner-family storyline was about as hackneyed as it comes... if you've seen either of the two recent meteor movies you know what I'm talking about.

The Kennedy's save the day from the Soviets and a group of evil Pentagon guys who want to start a war. This is made even more amusing by the fake Boston accents and the way Costner's varies in strength from one scene to the next.Every few minutes in the file we see a cut scene of a nuke going off. Hmmmm, I wonder what they were trying to say here?The Soviets had little direct part in the film which is pretty odd, seeing as they were the guys causing the problem.Also, the ending itself was a bit of fantasy and simple speculation on how the crisis was solved.The sad thing is that a lot of kids who weren't paying attention in history class will view this file as accurate. Parts of it actually were, but very important parts were not.This could have been a good film, but it failed on many levels.

Overall, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart story - LJ smith as it best","review":"I really enjoyed the book, the worst thing was to find the time to read it :)the story about psychics is really smart, as in most of LJ smith stories, you fall in love with the bad boy who is a least not as bad - in that book it is gabriel you will get in love with.All the characters are really cool, I liked the different personalities and who the story is developping.

I found this book just drifted along, and neither the main character or the author really seemed to have their heart in it, so I'm not quite sure why they bothered.

Neumeyer, a high school professor, discovers a briefcase with his name on it. He soon finds out how to open it, and in it he discovers evidence of his own murder. At first he thinks it is a joke, but soon realizes that it is true, so he goes on an investigation to stop his own murder before it is too late. Each part of the story actually takes place on the day the part was on (on TV), so you know, that every night you watch a new part, he has one less day to figure it all out. I enjoyed the miniseries and wouldn't mind watching it all again. I am goeing to buy this DVD. If you missed \\"Five Days to Midnight\\" on June 7th, I would highly recommend you buy it.

Diana Darby makes music that is a personal diary about love and her family. Often her songs are only guitar and voice. The songs sound like a whispered message from a friend. People who like Cat Power and Miranda Lee Richards will probably like this better. Diana captures a moment that feels like when the Velvet Undergound meets Love. But Diana is a storyteller too, and songs like \\"If It Feels Good\\" and \\"Ferry\\" expand our world. She mixes folk music with blues. It's very attention grabbing. It's a window to another world, where it's okay to be vulnerable. I am tired of the continuing death of eros. This is desiring and yearning music. It's an honest record that deals with beauty. Diana's voice holds my attention. It must be heard in a dark room on a special night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this","review":"The music itself might be good, but the sound quality is horrible. I suppose it's because of limited technology available in these old days, but the smothered sound really irritates me and ruins any enjoyment the music might bring.Oh, and one more thing.

The core linux command line stuff isn't there but you should buy a book that contains that information before tackling a server build first anyway.Final point: If looking for basic linux command line information, buy a linux command line book.If looking to learn the new points of Fedora Core 4 buy this book but play with the \\"GUI\\" and you'll figure it out in 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"It seems the authors of this book could not make up their minds if they were writing a reference book or a tutorial.

I have been a fan for years, and still count it high on my list of best albums of all time. There is some good info in this book, but the author comes across as relatively annoying in his presentation. The book is badly organized, even ending with a chapter about an unrelated band!In the book McGonigal even mentions that it had to be rewritten because MBV's Kevin Shields disagreed with the first version of it.If you love the album, you will think the book is OK.

Like many other reviewers I had been waiting anxiously for its release and this makes the disappointment with the final product even more difficult to take.McGonigal places himself in this book far too often. He presents only the most loose of narratives about the band itself and writes in what I consider to be an extremely amateur manner. It seems as if the book was produced with very little journalistic rigor, frequently regurgitating items from a previous work on My Bloody Valentine which should be considered at best disputed rather than true facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Heart On Pine Ridge:Family Ties, Warrior Culture, Commodity Foods, Rez Dogs and the Sacred","review":"A group from our church has gone to Pine Ridge on Mission trips for the past three years and we have gotten to know quite a few people there. We always seem to have gained more than we have given during our week stay. This book tells it how it is for much of the population on the Pine Ridge Reservation. It is a very helpful book for the leaders of our Mission to share with others that are joining us. We love the people there. They focus on what really matters in life and brings us back to where we all need to live. Most of us are so far removed from nature, family, giving our all to each other. This book shows us how and points out how far removed we are. It really brings questions to the way that I am living my life. It points out just how differently I need to live to become apart of life as Jesus would want me to live it.Thank you, Vic Glover. And thank you to our Native brothers and sisters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, that takes you deep into the world of the daily life on Pine Ridge,","review":"This is a great book that takes you on a real live journey deep into the daily live of Lakota people (and a stray Mohawk) on the Pine Ridge reservation. Vic Glover opens a window and allows us to peak inside his world and the world of his people, unknown to the majority living outside the boundaries of the reservation. Vic writes with a great sense of humour.Although he appearently has the skills, he doesn't cut into 'the bigger political or environmental issues'. In his book Vic makes it clear that the issue of surviving under harsh conditions and to maintain the social values and traditional structure is big enough to handle. All of this with a wit. That makes that the book stays close to the heart, his home and the land and makes it very recognizable, even for readers unfamiliar with Rez live. Highly recommended!Since I read Vic Glover the novel Skins by Adrian C. Louis became my second best book on Pine Ridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overlook this book","review":"I cannot begin to imagine or suggest the effect this book will have upon another reader nor to fully comprehend how it has affected me; I can only suggest that one dare to read this book and not pass up the experience gained in the of reading it.

Rubbing a clay and oil mix followed by using wraps to compress your skin has nothing to do with removing waste surrounding your cells. It's simple biology; only your liver & blood have the ability to perform that process. Only diet & exercise helps you lose those unwanted inches ladies! Do not waste your money!

I believe the stores should at least be able to order the item. When you do go online to find the trailer - good luck! I spent 20 minutes searching this field and that page. Needless to say I never found what I needed.I called the local store for assistance only to find out that they new less than the people who set up the websight and those that made the decision to make the trailer available solely online.With all this said, my son loves the tractor.

Told in everyday language as well as daily life, this story has quite a punch here and there. In the end, letting go and moving on with a renewed focus on the future, no matter what may be, is the key to surviving the things we cannot control.I thought this story showed the way of claiming our own power, women in particular, regardless of one's cirumstance or status.

This turned out to mean setting out to live in the Territory of Alaska, though neither had a job waiting and the only person they knew was Constance's eccentric Uncle Fred whom she hadn't contacted for years.Uncle Fred proved to be friendly and helpful, and after a couple of seasons the pair were ready for their real goal: floating down the Yukon from Fairbanks to Seward in their own homemade canoe, living off the land. The old Arctic hands-- but never her husband-- insisted that no lady could manage the trip. In fact, Constance was the canoe expert who sat in the back steering while her husband sat up front providing power.The couple wrote three sequels about their Alaskan life, but they are from the husband's point of view: interesting but without the charm of Constance's tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Hamtaro!","review":"Hamtaro and his friends are fun entertainment for the kids, with enough extra humor thrown in for the parents as well.

Throughout the whole book, instead of reading details about the creation of the movie, you will read tongue in cheek narration by Maggie. While sometimes you will read some interesting tidbits, the approach mostly detracts from the book.It's still a beautiful book, so that is why I am giving it 4 stars. 5 stars for the beautiful and very comprehensive overview of the art and design of the project, and 2 stars for the mostly disappointing narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"An embarrassing waste of time.

The book is written in a lovely style. You can tell this was written during the Victorian age....very nice writing style. But I felt this was a good book, an interesting idea, but fiction. I feel like the author used his talent for writing, with an idea of Jesus traveling to the East, and mixed it with his own traveling experiences and the Biblical teachings of Jesus. I do not feel that Jesus ever studied in the East, but it is a good read. I would not take the writing of this book to be fact or true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and forgettable","review":"This was a speculative purchase due to the editorial references to Numan, Kraftwerk and Ultravox. I have everything that Numan has ever released and about 90% of Kraftwerk's and Ultravox's output too. I didn't hear a trace of anything resembling those artist's creativity (I mean how can you imitate Numan? ;-) I'd say this piece of work sounds most like what John Foxx has been doing for the last few years, but without as much daring or melody. When I listen to something new I like to hear something which makes me want to hear a key track or two again and again. For me there are no key tracks and the whole album blurs into a wash of below par synth-pop. I bought Automatic by I Satellite some time ago and thought I'd like this too.

Reese was an OK hero, though kind of slimey for the first half of the book. He brooded too much and treated the heroine badly. The love scenes are hot, but the term purple prose comes to mind, and the setting was kind of drab and boring. Even though the \\"romance\\" seemed forced and wasn't believable, I liked most of the secondary characters.

If the end of a movie is lacking in luster or tension, simply turn off the lights and light your sword on fire. This will immediately cancel out any previous flaws in the movie.3. If you look good naked in the beginning of the movie, there is no need to act for the rest of the film.4. You know that it is a quality film when it takes almost half of the movie for you to figure out that the main characters are vampires, as evidenced by showing their protruding fangs a lot.Hope this helps you make up your mind about this movie.

In that a virus changes the human species into something else. With Ultraviolet we have humans and vampires. A futuristic world with plenty of cool gadgets. The special effects in this film are the film, but the plot is really lacking. I felt somewhat empty after watching this film. With more work on the plot of the film in a potential sequel added to the intense special effects this could be a great film. You can tell the actors worked hard on their training, especially in terms of martial arts. The last battle scene is my favorite part of the film. The background music gives an \\"old world\\" feel in a futuristic world. All these fancy weapons eventually leads to swords. So elegant, so simple, the sword is a timeless weapon that appears to outshine the majority of the weapons created before and henceforth.Work on the plot and you have a great film. I hope there's a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much more","review":"This movie is a disappointment. Never fully explains itself or the universe it is set in leaving the viewer wondering what the hell the movie is about for the very beginning.

Ultraviolet is not a movie, but merely an excuse for a lot of CGI effects. What plot there is is so convoluted when you unpack it you won't care because it's contrived and unoriginal. The acting is terrible. Then again, the only thing worse is the dialog the actors are forced to say. All fight scenes in movies are choreographed but the good ones are seamless so you can't tell. The fight scenes in Ultraviolet are a ballet with every move telegraphed so you never believe any of it for a second. I'm sure a lot of money was wasted making this film as was the money I spent to watch it.

I don't know how many DVD's is considered \\"Alot\\" but I have quite a few and the 5.1 Surround Sound on this film is very lackluster. If you want a good futuristic movie with real acting and intensity get Kurt Wimmer's first movie \\"Equilibrium\\". If you have already seen it and are still curious about \\"Ultraviolet\\" go ahead and see for yourself. It's almost the same concept (totalitarian future government) but even less realized then his other film. Milla Jovovich's acting chops are not even close to being in the same league as Christian Bale from \\"Equilibrium\\" and almost everything becomes tedious when you don't even have great sound pumping out of the speakers to fall back on.

Great, she walked into the middle of a circle of enemies. Over and over and over.That isn't even the real detractor, the acting sucked!

What horrible acting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for the Premise... the rest gets a BIG ZERO!!","review":"I couldn't wait for this movie to end. The premise to the movie is good, but the special effects were awful! I've seen video games on my old nintendo that were this bad (really, some of it could have been rendered on your xbox or ps/2).The plot and acting was bad, the gunfights, well you might have just put in some clips from any other action movie and you'd never have noticed the difference.I'm a big scifi fan so I'm pretty open minded for bad plots/acting etc, but this was just plain BAD.

What else can you want.Just Milla Jovovich deserves the 5 stars. Everything else is a bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a world you probably don't care about.","review":"Ultraviolet starts out decent, but with chase scene after chase scene it grows old quickly. I like the idea behind the story, but I didn't feel like it was utilized in ways that it could have been. I guess I will keep this short and simple. The movie had some pretty good fight sequences, Jovovich plays the part of a \\"death dealer with a heart\\" well, and the futuristic look of the film keeps you interested to a point, but the rest of the movie just seems cumbersome and drawn out. It reminds of Underworld meets Resident Evil in a way. Ultraviolet is ok for one viewing, so I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is into sci-fi and action to check out or if you are a fan of Milla Jovovich. So, with the exception of Milla and the couple action sequences I feel that this movie is disappointing and falls flat. That's just one man's opinion, so judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it negative stars I would","review":"After the movie was over, the 4 of us watching just wished for the hour and a half of our lives back. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. No plot, no dialogue, no motivation really for anything, very confused, no interest in the characters, not great effects, too much notice of the fact that it was mostly animated backgrounds and people. It was TERRIBLE. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. We should have been warned when even the teenagers in the theater were walking out in the middle. They had better sense than we did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I thought it was good","review":"I was expecting this movie to be crap. But I think it was really good. I loved the stylish look of the film. It's not at all realistic but then it's not really cartoony either. It's like it exists in it's own world and it looks great. The action scenes were very well done. Not all dumb looking like in Aeon Flux. The one thing I didn't like was the, at times, confusing story. And the fact that this woman was practically invincible. That kind of takes away suspense. But this movie was a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoping this will restore the cut footage that gave the film more clarity!","review":"I was one of the few who actually thought this was a decent movie, and it may be because I knew what was cut out of the film and what will hopefully be restored in this Unrated DVD. About 30 minutes was cut which told the viewer much more clearly why things were the way they were and why certain characters were doing certain things. As it was, the movie was VERY hard to understand without this footage - and thus it is no wonder it floundered at the Box Office!Also, there should be some nifty violence re-added as well! Can't wait to see the original vision!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with DVD version","review":"My comments only concern the DVD versus Blu-ray issue.I have the unrated extended cut of the DVD version and the PG-13 theatrical cut of the Blu-ray version. My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player). Ultraviolet is no exception. Moreover, the look of the film seems to soften details, which really defeats the point of Blu-ray.Aside from no improvement in the look, the Blu-ray version has no more special features than the DVD, and the extended cut DVD has seven additional minutes. Go with the DVD version on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually stunning; storyline non-existent","review":"From the trailers, I thought the special effects of this film would be absolutely stunning and I was not disappointed in that respect. I suppose since it was so visually rich, the producers didn't feel the need to have a plausible, coherant story to go with the visuals.The lack of script leaves the actors with nothing to do when we aren't being dazzled by the vivid colors, futuristic weapons and vehicles. The fight scenes look like a John Woo acid trip.Jovovich has done much better in the acting department and certainly we have come to expect more from Fichtner, but we can't blame them for the material they were given to work with.So, if you watch this, go into it wanting pure eye candy and not to get any sort of story to go with the view. Otherwise you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing here move along","review":"It a waste of money to buy Ultraviolet. The story line is very poor written and the fighting sceens look fake and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milla, Milla, you're so much better than this!","review":"I like Milla Jovovich, I really do. But when I saw this movie I cringed at the bad acting and overly contrived fight scenes. The only things that made me sit through it were Milla, the music was kind of cool, and the wierd, super-saturated colors. Everything was very bright and bold, but the feel of the setting was very cold, sterile and austere. I liked that juxtaposition. But the fight scenes...please! She's surrounded by a circle of heavily armed and armoured guards, you hear one squishy slicing sound and they're all laying dead at her feet? ::facepalm:: Oh wait, of course, it's a movie! Too contrived and coincidental for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milla kills everybody","review":"This film is about set action pieces and tight pants. Milla handles both very well. But the movie, average at best. The story is one that's been told before, but has potential if it was allowed to unfold, not thrust upon us to get to the next scene of Milla killing everyone. Special effects, not real special: Think Tron upgraded, but just a little. Overall, it's okay if you like Milla, Milla's stomach, Milla killing several hundred armed bad guys or Milla in tight pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Action Movie, but thats all","review":"CONTAINS SPOLIERS.This movie had alot of action which is good. But thats all that wuz good about this movie. This movie made no sense. It had no main point because it wuz starting 2 to make one but it just threw off into another path. It didnt explain how violet survived being shot. they said that she had to go through 3 hours of surgery. and plus shes a vampire and she got shot IN THE HEART. if a vampire gets hit by anything in the heart then its not gonna live. This movie wuz too long as well. It could have been 45 mins and still would have been horrible.

Absolutely NO gore with battle scenes, the plot was incredibly weak and Milla J. looked about 45 in this flick. The movie certainly did not present her in the best light. Reading several reviews, I think people actually missed the real plot. Unfortunately, for those who missed the real plot, you have to watch it again. I feel for you. There goes 90 minutes of my life I will never get back. The only good thing about the movie were the graphics. Other than that, no other reason to watch it. SKIP IT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UltraAwful","review":"Terrible. Just another low budget CGI Hollywood action flick crap fest. Only saw the first 1/3 of this junk but that was more than enough.

I didn't care anything about any of the characters, and the special effects were laughably bad.

I give it a complete FAwful. I have to go rent/buy something good to get the badtaste out of my brain.the ISLAND is probably a a C+ compared to this drek.You have been warned - the movie is a debacle.I would give it a zero if the rating scale allowed it.I will admit that visually the flaming sword fight had potentialbut other than that i just began hoping for the end of the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Transfer, Who Cares?","review":"This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever been unforsightful enough to endure. Why does it matter if it is a perfect transfer or not? If they had a ferfect Blu-Ray transfer in glorious 1080p of a pile of crap, would that warrant 4 stars? I hope not. Well, it is the same situation here, unfortunately.

This could probably win an MTV movie award for best fight sequence,Also check out Kurt Wimmer's previous movie \\"Equillibrium\\" a great introduction too his world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just Equilibrium!!","review":"I enjoyed the movie for the most part, yes the writing was off, but in the context of comic book it works. THe stylekized fight scenes also reminded me of comics. Also, don't get me wrong I love Milla, but this wasn't for her. Some one who looked a little more athletic like Jessica Biel from Blade 3. And towards the end the fight scenes started to look the same. I did like the homage to Shogan Assassin, not quite as good, but I appreciated to thought. I also read the review about Equilibrium (J. Falter) I don't get that at all Equilibrium was a better movie (which was a low budget movie as well, see; Equilibrium's special feature on the DVD) and I do agree with Agsded on this one, but you see alot of different movie in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"How is it that a society that has the technology to displace gravity and fit large objects into some strange sub dimension NOT be able to figure out how to cure a simple disease?!?!?! Maybe if the premise for this movie was actually logical it'd be more enjoyable. Action sequences were poorly done with far too much CGI, acting was very poorly done, and the entire movie just seemed to be geared towards fan boys and brainless morons that feed off the random and unnecessary violence of this movie. \\"Violet\\" is unwilling to detonate a bomb, killing all of the humans in a several mile radius, but she's willing to kill hundreds of guards that are just doing their job to feed their families. Way to go! If you like pointless action movies with bad acting and crappy action sequences, then this movie is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well that's pretty neat.","review":"Okay, basically, this was a bad movie. A prime example of how special effects don't make up for plot and/or presentation.The best part of the entire film was the 12 second scene where she prints out a disposable cell-phone. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen.If you consider buying this movie, you'll be much better off renting it. Once is all you'll want to watch it, if that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet","review":"Ultraviolet is filled with stunning visuals and amazing action. But it doesn\`t make up for the terrible script with an OK plot. Milla Jovovich is not a very good actress and the rest of the actors in the film weren\`t very good either. I wouldn\`t recommend this film at all. One of the worst movies so far for 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Comic Book Movie","review":"This is a comic book movie. And VERY GOOD. All you wanna be film critics are ridiculous. This is a very enjoyable, fast action, eye candy movie with cool film effects. The film has a blended look of reality and anime. The plot of good and bad and the discovery of one's own morale all in a futuristic setting make for a good fantasy movie. It is a fun and exciting flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Book was a quick read, very well documented for a case that is over 20 years old Robert Graysmith thouroughly did his homework researching the death of Bob Crane.

Of interest chiefly for the background on the making of \\"Hogan's Heroes.\\" As is so often the case, Graysmith presumes to be a much better investigator and writer than he is. This book is not worth your time. No definitive conclusion on the case, thus, a waste of paper and ink.

Leaving a ton of things out isn't the way to inform people of a murder. Auto-Focus, the movie, is filled with lies and the director has publicly admitted to putting them in to make the movie sell.

It has to do with attitude. The Bible tells us to have the same attitude Jesus had. He came to serve and we're required to do likewise. Brother Lawrence served and found joy in doing so. There were no minimal tasks to him.Brother Lawrence reminds us \\"God knoweth best what is needful for us, and all that He does is for our good.\\" He lived his life with that childlike trust in God.He talks about God hiding from us sometimes. He discusses faith being tested.

The main reason for my disappoitment is the stupid highlight videos (instant replays)that kept on popping up during the matches. I hated these highlight videos because they ruined the flow of the match. It wasn't like they showed the videos while the wrestlers were laying exhausted on the floor doing nothing (like after a wrestler hits a plancha and then rests on the arena floor for a little while). They would do these instant replays during the middle of heated action. I remember even missing a 2 count (u could hear the ref counting to 2 in the background) due to one of the instant replays. What made it even worse was that the same instant replays that were shown during the matches, were also shown after the conclusions of the matches. What was the point of showing the same clip twice? I really hope that FMW will get rid of the instant replays for the next tape it produces."},{"rating":"1","title":"FMW Is Hardcore","review":"I have watched this DvD and must say that for anyone who is a fan of TRUE Hardcore wrestling they should get this. For those unfamiliar with FMW, it is the TRUE Originator in Hardcore, Extreme Wrestling. It was the first to have the King of the Deathmathc Tournamet. It originated using lightbulbs, electrified barbwire, and EXPLOSIVES!!! The matches on the tape are some of the most extreme I have ever witnessed and I have been watching and following wrestling for 20 years.

He's going to be one of the year's breakthrough artists, no doubt. After touring this fall and spring with FFH and Big Daddy Weave, and then this spring with Third Day and TobyMac, he's collected quite a following of fans, all of which he deserves. His deep, heartfelt lyrics and great tunes blend to make a musical experience you'll never forget. I listen to this one for months non-stop. Very powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, dull and another little boy-sing-a-long","review":"Oh, what a hype with Warren Barfield! The truth is: just another little boy-singing, absolutely boring, not worth hearing a second time. And I did not hear anything about God in his lyrics, all heartless and makes you fall asleep. Sometimes I think those 5-star-reviews are written by the producers of this definitely poor product. Sorry, but this is the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT Boring but uplifting!","review":"Pay NO attention to the review from Germany who called Warren's album boring and didn't have God in the lyrics. That is a very unchristian and unbeliever like attitude.

All in all, this CD is definately worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Writing","review":"I can count on a couple of fingers stories that have brought me to tears and this is one of them. The author's originality is such a fresh and welcome event. I loved every page of this book.I do have one complaint and that is with the publisher.

I was not looking for more of the same old same old. I wanted to read a warm and personal story. That is exactly what Margaret has given us.Claire and Rebecca are very real characters. They stayed with me long after I had finished reading. That is proof of a good book to me.The structure is elegant, the writing beautiful. It ends up being a meditation on life, death, grief, and second chances. Quietly, the story built in power. I loved this book and have read it twice since I first discovered it.

Simply put I had no idea what to expect. At first I didn't think I liked the way it went from past to present and back and forth. I retract that.....I love the way this book was written. It's totally two stories side by side until they tie together!!!Yes it's a lesbian love story, but anything but typical. Something that I cannot exactly pinpoint hit me reading this book. This is the first book I have felt real emotion both during the reading and after it was done. This story has stayed with me. I even hate to admit it has stayed with me enough to read it again.I will not disclose any of the story line but I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to read a story that will touch almost every sense and emotion.

The selection of music and Baez's voice and arrangements is wonderful. This is a more rocked-out version of Baez than we are used to.Among my favorites are \\"Sleeper\\" the opening song, a sensuous tale of lovers, \\"Caleb Meyer\\" a tale of a feisty woman fighting off a would-be rapist:Caleb Meyer your ghost is goinTo wear those rattlin chainsWHen I go to sleep at nightDon't you call my nameI've been a fan of Baez for years and this is something of a departure from what you'll normally hear, but I think an enjoyable listen.

Absolutely wonderful songs, great voice and the worst recording since Big Brother and the Holding Company's first album. I hope Koch can re-engineer a fix. Its too good an album to lay there unheard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine songs, atrocious recording","review":"Obviously most reviewers enjoyed this album very much, and I have been a fan of Baez since the early 1960's. But for me the tasteful selection of songs is overshadowed by the worst engineering I have heard on a commercial relaese in decades. Joan and the instruments seem to be in different acoustic spaces and the entire recording is distorted with a buzzy quality that sounds like a mistracking phono cartridge. I actually thought something had gone wrong with my electronics until the next CD came on. If you can live with the wretched sound (listen to the samples online - the CD is no better) it's the best Baez in some years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confidence & Beauty","review":"Joan Baez has not always come accross as artistically condident and relaxed in her studio albums from the 70s and 80s. With DCBG she has settled into a beatiuful accoustic but energetic sound. Her interpretations are sensitive and \\"wise\\". She remains an important voice after more than 40 years on the international stage. However, the most amazing thing might be her beauty. Just look at her photos in the accompanying booklet? I thought it was against the law to look this great at 62! Move over Lauren Hutton."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great studio album","review":"I wish something special to do justice for Joan's great new album Dark Chords on a Big Guitar, like a gold album or a Grammy Award. Dark Chords is simple ones of her best studio records. A masterpiece. When I heard the album for the first time, the songs, arrangements and lyrics I am convicted that Joan Baez proved the power of her talent. On most tracks of the album is the dark atmosphere that brings her to her best. I must not forget to relate that her voice still sound beautiful.

Savatage was very influential in this release, having produced it. Early Savatage influences can also be heard In Darklin Reach's music. Although the production quality lacks a little, It is very similar to the bands live sound, and in a odd way, may even add to the recording.

She is in no hurry to impress, and doesn't need to be: Jukebox Sparrows is rich and deep, moody and engrossing.It's hard to categorize the music on this album. While clearly country-influenced, it has a sparkly pop sensibility and grooves worthy of great rock songs. The arrangements are stunning, with subtly quirky touches (\\"Bitter Blue\\" being the best example), and McNally's voice is wonderfully commanding. She doesn't rely on fireworks, but she enounces each syllable with seasoned confidence. \\"Down and Dirty\\" starts the album out in an entrancing mid-tempo; \\"Colorado\\" is hauntingly beautiful, drowning in spacey guitars and a lonely lead vocal; and \\"Bolder Than Paradise\\" is weirdly playful, all strange lap steels and percussion, right down to starting out with a drawling band count.McNally obviously has a knack for staying off the beaten path. These \\"Jukebox Sparrows\\" definitely warrant your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"jataka tales- a most special book","review":"When I was sixteen I borrowed this book from an out of town library, and drove to an old abandoned beach at a nearby lake.

Well, it didn't happen than night, but Amazon shipped it quickly which gave me some Piece of Mind. I Don't Look Back on the purchase.

Basically you better just want to use the phone directory or try adjusting the booster. Everything else is difficult to capture.Though it is a nice design, every call I made or received was full of static (the antennae were fully extended and the phone in that same spot previously never had any such problems for 8 years.)

Panasonic was great offering many trouble shooting advice but none worked. Amazon took the item back for credit.

Not only do Cheung and Chow work well as a comic double act, fans of 80's style bloodshed and Canto-English madness will really enjoy this ragbag of a film. You should really try to get the original subtitled version - some of them are real corkers - \\"wow.. really big breasts.. She kills me!..\\". There is also a lot of english in the original canto version, mostly the F word. My favourite line has to be Chow - \\"F***.. F*** you Up!\\".. Much gwailo bashing and unnecessary tumbling and fliping. This film also features the Police Chief from Fight Back To School 1+2 and God Of Gamblers 3, the notorious \\"scissor-legs\\" who sends Chow to find his wallet this time. Eric Tsang makes a fletting appearance as a dodgy watch sales man and Blacky Ko, who also directs, plays the demented killer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Stephen Chow's better films","review":"Those of you looking for the sarcastic wit married with slapstick and physical humor you would expect from a Stephen Chow movie should move along, as there is nothing much to see here. Those familiar with Hong Kong cinema will expect disjointed storytelling, often seeming as if the entire movie was improvised. If you are fluent in Cantonese, you would be able to follow the dialogue. But if you are depending on the subtitles, be prepared to get only about 75% of what is going on.All in all, an average movie, but seeing as how this is one of Chow's earlier works, a forgivable effort.

He has been deeply involved in some of the great and horrible events of the 20th century, from World War 1 to the Cold War. Now, as the century starts to come to a close, and the new millenium approaches, the Doctor anxiously awaits the arrival of someone who can tell him who he really is. Only 20 more years to go.Meanwhile, a teacher stumbles into his house, seeking refuge after her car gets stranded in the snow. Mrs. Deborah Castle, once known as Debbie Gordon, has had a horrible day and is feeling horrible in general, with the way her life has gone. But now her life is about to change, in the midst of an alien war that has been brought to Earth in the form of a child, and the Doctor will get involved again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"This is a great game for the whole family.

The older version used yellow as a color and didn't have this problem. The manufacturer should really correct this and you're better off playing with an older set if you can.

In his book, Helmstetter is yet another Amway apologist, showing us how the business ready to explode. What he lacks are the real facts.

This book is supposed to guide its reader from design to coding and implementation as well as testing.

Although it is takes place in Austria in the beginning of this century, the complex philosophical and psychological explorations, and the satires of human folly, are utterly timely now. For one thing, many of us feel like \\"men without qualities\\" now and then, possessing few certainties or clear conceptions of our own identities.

They are probably related since all of their noses looked like wieners hanging on the middle of their faces. They also have really stupid sounding voices. The series is kinda like James Bond, if he were a cyborg chick with mentally handicapped enemies. I found it impossible to care about this series at all.

The film is basically one hallucination after another which may appeal to those who enjoy this sort of thing. The film is, in parts, fascinating to watch, especially the 'vampire' sequence. The appearance of Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs add to the 'sixties drug addict' feel of the film as well. Recommended to those who enjoy something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly a rental.","review":"VHS tape was good quality, and the used price was a bargain...maybe. The film is a collage of different scenes tracking Rooks' journey to recovery. Lots of multiple exposures that are gratuitous, shots of Indian ceremonies that are not explained, and in fact that is the major flaw with this movie. \\"What the hell is going on and what does it mean?\\" We don't know because Rooks hams it up so much there isn't any time left for exposition. Barrault looks clueless and seems to be ad-libbing his role. On a more positive note, the sitar and jazz music is good. Will look for soundtrack, especially with Ornette Coleman's missing score. Nice shots of old New York and Paris, cameraman shooting over the motorcyclist shoulder is innovative for its time. Minor beatnik presence from a short cameo of Ginsberg and somelonger shots of a stiff and creaky Burroughs. The music is the best part of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Trip","review":"I was ready for a wild ride of visual hallucinations according to other reviews and felt this film really came up short. I was enticed by the fact that Burroughs and Ginsberg made appearences but I'd call them cameos. Burroughs' character is boring and Ginsberg and boyfriend Peter are jamming in Central Park singing Shamalama Ding Dong for about 30 seconds. The mythology of Peyote is touched on with Native American narrative but, come on, must the story be acted out with a woman in a Maxi dress walking along the banks of a river? She is supposed to be the mother of a trancendant mystical magical mind guide drug and it comes off more like a Dippity Do TV ad from 1967. The music by Shankar is great. I will give the film that.

It actually turned out pretty good. The band plays the songs well, and Dee Dee sounds good on vocals, if not as good as Joey Ramone. On a few of the songs, Dee Dee lets his wife Barbara sing lead, and she sounds pretty good, too. She has a cute accent! Although most of the songs are old Ramones songs, there are a few songs that are not. \\"Shakin' All Over\\" is a Guess Who song, \\"Motorbikin'\\" is an original, \\"Cathy's Clown\\" is an Everly Brothers song, \\"Fix Yourself Up\\" is an original and \\"Sidewalk Surfin'\\" is an original (it's not the Jan and Dean song).

Taking the reader back to the very edge of the mists of prehistory, John Bright then lays out, in a point by point fashion, the whole sweep of time in the near east up until the appearance of a certain Galilean who forever changed the world.A History of Israel is very in depth, very packed with useful information. Bright has written a wonderful book. It did (as most history books are likely to) set off my anti-scholarship allergy a few times. However, it is very worthy of being read.I give this book a very high recommendation. Bright's presentation is clear, at certain points even lively. It thoroughly deals with the developments in each time period. It delivers the reader to one heck of a destination-one of eternal significance-that beautiful moment in time where the Messiah asked a very pointed question that many are still in need of answering: \\"Who do you say that I am?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Options for the History","review":"Difficult read in many respects. Use of grammar by the author very dated. You would have hoped that later revisions would have consolidated and distilled this verbose presentation. John Bright's writing style makes the book a taxing read. If there was a charge for comma's, run on sentences, and fragments, this book would cost thousands!

He spoke very eloquently on the subject of physics, singularity in particular. I looked on Amazon to see if he had any books for sale on physics, and I found this book on a totally different subject. This guy is smart, very smart. He was a student of eastern religion, then became a Christian, which isn't a very cool thing to do in the eastern religion circles. He spoke on Coast to Coast to 10 million listeners about physics, and he didn't even have a book to sell. He doesn't seem to be in the media for money, and he certainly didn't get any glory from becoming Christian. Based on those facts, I think he really did meet Jesus face-to-face. I learned some things from the book, and it's also a fun and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"The first few pages of reading I thought to myself that I was not going to like this book, however, I was determined to keep on reading.

As the author stated, \\"We all pray to the same God, just under different names.\\" The only part I had some trouble believing was the last chapter on the UFO experience.

Not just in prayer or meditation but in daily life w whom so ever...Greater is his challenge to take your workspace of compassion and love and freely give it to others and place it on all those externals we as Christians didn't apply in healing our own hearts.I sincerely Thank David Sereda for writing his account knowing he would suffer scoffing for doing so.

I wish the image quality was better; if so this would be a really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic inspiration and reference!","review":"This book has an extraordinary array of poses, in motion and not! The models are all different body types, though all relatively young and fit. Quite a few more women than men.In response to the other reviews: it's true that this is not the right book to get if you want in-depth, clear musculature. It's more just to look at then to walk you through or teach anything. But the photos are good quality and it's a great reference for a more impressionistic or natural/flowing approach to anatomy, which is just as important for an artist as technical detail!It takes all types of books for a complete breakfast.. er, complete anatomy reference library, and this is definitely one of my keystones! A great reference, great substitute for life drawing, (as good as possible, since nothing really tops life drawing) and an amazing inspiration to flip through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than \\"The Figure In Motion\\"!","review":"I bought this book when it first came out a few years ago, and I have to say it both does even better than its predecessor, \\"The Figure In Motion\\", and takes it a step further with the quality of its artistic reference; I have done several drawings using the photos from this book, and the people I showed them to were impressed, to say the least. My only real complaint about \\"The Nude Figure\\" is that all of the nude models in the photos should have been women, as I prefer drawing female nudes over males; otherwise, this is a great reference book, and I can't wait for Mark E. Smith to come out with a third such book (only next time, featuring all female models, maybe with a bit more range in age and physical type) in the future. I'd recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing learned here.","review":"Can sum this book up in one word: disappointing. There is nothing artistic in any of the pictures. No commentary given. As amuturistic as nude photos can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nude Figure","review":"If you are looking for a book with a vast array of different poses then this book is for you. But unfortunately, because of the number of different poses presented, they did not include different angles of the same pose. What I liked about this book was that many different models of somewhat varying body types were used. The fault that I find with this book is the relative lack of male reference photos. It seems that only about 10% of the pictures are of males. So, if you want a good reference book for the female figure with many different poses represented then this book is a very good choice. If you are looking for a good reference for the male figure then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"I was quite disappointed with the quality of the pictures in this book. They were very grainy, some without much contrast. As far as the poses go, there were only a handful that 'worked' in terms of composition. Also the models tended to be too similar in size, shape, and ethnicity. The point of figure drawing is to develop skills to draw ALL shapes and sizes!There are other books on figure drawing that are much better in terms of skill development but I am still looking for a good book of photos to draw from. However, this one is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for artists looking for poses!","review":"The author of the book said he wanted to go for aesthetically pleasing, but figured artists wanted more on visibility. He would've done so much better going with his first choice! I wanted a good book of poses, and have yet to get one picture out of the book! Most of the poses in this book weren't pleasing to the eye at all. The models are all young, thin people in ridiculous, often painful looking poses. A little variety would've been great, too, and the two photos of pregnant women in there don't count for much. There are no old people, fat people, or even normal sized people! There are, however, an archive of the worst poses I've seen to date. Do yourself a favor and go get a good book like Anatomy for the Artist by Sarah Simblet or Virtual Pose 2 by Mario Henri Chakkour. You'll actually get some use out of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do they come up with this stuff?","review":"I was looking for a book with some good posing of just a natural figure for some sculpting and art work. The cover of this book looks like what i was looking for. When I opened the book i found several body types(some were older and some rather bony which wasn't so good) and very poor posing. There are both men and women in this book, however, some of the poses are so ridiculous that i have no clue how they could be used for anything constructive. I find about half the book useful. The other half is grainy photography and crazy \\"what are they doing?\\" poses. I must say that I still have not found exactly what i am looking for in one single book. And this one, i know isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in the basics","review":"As with most pose books, there is a severe lack of detail and contrast in the photos. The purpose of this book is to provide an alternative to life drawing, but fails in the very aspect of life drawing that makes it so effective. With such poor photography, it is extremely difficult to discern the surface features that are so important to learning artistic human anatomy. While the poses have a slightly more natural bend than most books in this genre, there is still an unnatural stiffness, or exaggeration of movement that is rarely every desired in figure references. In addition, all of the models are young college age people, with little or no ethnic diversity.The overall direction of this book attempts to provide the artist with a holistic smattering of references in anatomy, movement and lighting, but fails in all three catagories, badly. I don't recommend this book to anyone with serious ambitions in learning to draw the human figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will use this often","review":"I found many usable poses in this book. Some diversity in body types, which is nice. I could do without the hairy armpits, but thankfully we all have the creative liscense to erase that.I left out one star because the male nudes are terrible. I think there are only 3 different male models, and I don't even want to look at them, not to mention draw them. No muscle definition, one is pot bellied, and another with a bald head and flabby body completely covered with hair...easy to render as that is (a contour, then tons of hair)I'll pass.

Although it will especially appeal to Chicago Bears fans, any football-lover will also find it to be a great read. Steve McMichael was always one of the more colorful players on and off the field, and he tells the story in similar irreverent fashion. The book follows McMichael's career chronologically from childhood through college to the NFL, with a brief stop in New England before his long great career with the Bears. The 1985-86 Super Bowl season is recalled in the most depth, with the behind the scenes story of each week's Bears game. McMichael tells it all in a funny and insightful manner. I have also been a big fan of co-author sportswriter Phil Arvia for many years.

This book gives you more insight on this player as a person and star. It just adds to the love that I have for that very special team. There will never be another team quite like the '85 Bears and I am glad to be of fan of this team still to this day. Thanks Steve for the insight on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fine Work of Self-Promotion","review":"I don't want to seem too negative about this book because I am a Bears fan, and a McMichael fan as well, but I was dissapointed. I was expecting to read about the Superbowl season of 1985 from the point of view of someone who was there. Maybe read a couple of locker room stories that hadn't been told to the public before. But there really wasn't much substance to this book, unless you count the numerous references to McMichael's stats, and how great he thinks he was. Mongo, we know you were a great player, but it's sad to have you remind us of it ever other paragraph.So if you'd like an easy read, with a general overview of McMichael's career, this is a decent book.

Zimmo rides along with a truck driver and learns about all the different jobs that trucks do. The video also covers farming and tractors, bread making (a little off the title's subject, but interesting anyhow) and product delivery. Zimmo's voice can be irritating for the grownup, but boys seem to enjoy the action and educational aspects of this series, which includes spelling out of words and Fun Facts (includes statistics and other stuff which I didn't know). My son has memorized much of the audio portions, including 18 wheeler humor which he proudly recites to any willing adult!

Also this was intended as a home video release, so why was it shot in 2:35:1? Concerts are shot in 1:85 or 1:78. Not only does the camera work suck but the quality also sucks. I realize that this DVD probably wasn't given the same buget as say The Foo Fighters BluRay or The Police Certified but the Jeff Beck DVD that just came out blows this away.I've seen Eric Johnson probably a half dozen times in concert and he's never played for less than 2 hours. So why is this DVD only about an hour of music?The standards have gone way up for what a concert DVD or concert BluRay should look like and this falls way short of expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric Johnson the tone king","review":"The tone king has given me another opportunity to listen to and watch his technique, frame by frame. Eric Johnson's Anaheim DVD captures both and I love slap harmonics!

But now I think it's safe to say that if Rifftrax actually releases the DVD, you don't have to do any downloading. Just put the DVD in the player and you're all set.There are a wide variety of shorts in this one. Of course you'd expect the typical safety ones, but there's also one with Bob Crane that claims to be about patriotism while discussing a random assortment of good deeds, and there's one about a racist dog.I still miss the shadows at the bottom of the screen, but I have to say that Rifftrax DVDs are still very worth watching and collecting. Guaranteed hilarity at every turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"About as good as MST3Ks","review":"I've been a big fan of MST3K.

The questions are obscure enough to be hard, but fun enough to still feel like a game. Sometimes other trivia games make some partygoers cringe with their lack of knowledge, but this one just makes you laugh. It's fun remembering videos and trying to sift through your mental attic for stuff you KNOW you read in PEOPLE magazine somewhere. It's a great buy, but I would agree with another reviewer who said that it needed more questions.[My durability rating, above, means that, because there aren't enough questions, the initial fun doesn't hold up on replaying, not that there's anything fundamentally defective with the construction of the game pieces themselves.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the first five minutes.","review":"This game is a great idea, the unfortunate problem is that there are not enough questions. We played this game the night we bought it, and after two full games with four people playing we had used every single card.

I loved 80's music and video, so these questions were perfect for my Non-Trivial Pursuit memory!

The screen is completely protected. The back unsnaps for access to the camera, and you can also snap it around a belt loop if necessary.

It wasn't the racism, about which I was duly warned; after all, it was set in a very racist time and the attitudes certainly fit the characters. No, it was the name-dropping that got to me. Eickhoff had Holliday hopping aroung the country meeting, and frequently bedding if they were women, many, many famous people. Names that come to mind are Belle Boyd, the Confederate agent, Mary Anderson, the Union doctor, as well as the Earp brothers. I just got tired of it and gave up on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"might as well just watch the movie \\"Tombstone\\"","review":"I don't know if Randy Lee Eickhoff had anything to do with the screenplay, but Doc Holliday in this book is definitely Val Kilmer in print. In the book, Doc even does Val Kilmer's signature trick of rolling a coin on his knuckles! Anyone who has watched the movie will recognize the dialogue. It was interesting to read of Doc's pre-Tombstone days, but for that I would definitely recommend Karen Holliday Turner's \\"Doc Holliday- a Family Portrait\\". By the way, I counted Doc as saying \\"I'm your huckleberry\\" 5 times in the first 50 pages of Eickhoff's book, and some diologue is nearly verbatim (\\"Why, Johnny Tyler!

If you watch carefully, you can see from Jimi's facial expressions that he is not happy with his performance or the band's or both. The band sounds unrehearsed, the playing is sloppy, vocals are missing. Jimi does try his best to salvage things with some interesting solos but that as brilliant as it was, can't save things. Some songs in very raw form- Machine Gun, are trying to listen to. Yet on the other hand, 'Red house' is quite good. Sound quality is nothing to brag about, sounds like an old 8-track transfer-raw. I wonder if Jimi would have approved of this release, based on the way he takes his guitar off at the end of the show and slams it down on the stage, I think not. The serious fan will pass this one up. Hopefully, the Hendrix estate will choose future releases(both audio and dvd)more carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his last performances","review":"In rock music, the difference between a great performance and a bust can be razor thin. Which was this? You can see Jimi talking, while playing, clearly concerned about something. In All Along the Watchtower, the dreamy tones of the studio version is replaced by a powerful, high distortion version. On top of everything else, he briefly forgets the words. Was this a great performance relete with spontanaity or was Hendrix, a little more than two weeks before his death due to a drug overdose, starting to lose it? I don't know but one thing I do know, I am captivated by the performance. I liked observing the small things such as his switching from his signature stratocaster to a flying V. Quite frankly, I hadn't been aware that he p[erformed with a V so this was a revelation. If you are a Hendrix fan, this DVD will fascinate you. If not, I doubt that it will make you into a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One great show, one great man","review":"I found the DVD version of Jimi - Live At The Isle Of Wight to be great. The picture quality is fantastic, much better than the laserdisc version. I was a little disapointed to see some of the tracks on this video edited. For example. Pieces of Machine Gun were cut to make it shorter. Also with Voodoo Chile, Slight Return. I was glad to hear All Along The Watchtower amd Spanish Castle Magic.

Mr. Costello embodied the angry attitude of punk rock, but unlike most punk bands who were unskilled musicians that thrived on high energy, he possessed a rapier pen and an ear for melody. The album opens with the fierce \\"No Action\\" that in fine punk form clocks in at less than two minutes. \\"This Year's Girl\\" is wry take on the fame machine. \\"The Beat\\" has a catchy organ riff and is about the tried and true subject of self-gratification. \\"Pump It Up\\" is a fiery track as is \\"Lip Service\\". \\"(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea\\" has a manic verve while \\"Little Triggers\\" slows things down. \\"Radio Radio\\" is the most famous off the album, but the album's best track is \\"Lipstick Vogue\\". The song has a thumping bass line that shuffles along until a frenzied close. This Year's Model gave further proof that Elvis Costello may well be the king."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal","review":"Not much left to say on this record. A must-have. Rhino's remastering job is excellent and pushes the treble up more than the Rykodisc versions. I also admire Rhino's decision to move all bonus material onto the second disc in order to preserve the integrity and provenance of the original recording. Truly impressive. My only caveat is that they didn't move Radio, Radio onto disc 2, as it was not included on the original UK edition of the album and sounds out of place alongside everything else. Night Rally is the perfect album-closer, building to a fantastic Se Telefonando-esque crescendo. I wish they'd left it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis at his best","review":"I bought the LP the week it was released and have loved it ever sense.

Dominated by Steve Nieve's organ, this CD is more polished than Costello's debut, but it feels a little over produced compared to the stripped down sound of his first release. Despite this the songs still create a sense of tension rarely found in anyone's music. \\"Radio, Radio\\" may be one of the greatest songs ever about the idea of \\"popular music\\" and its effect on us all and the double play of \\"The Beat\\" and \\"Pump It Up\\" sums up teen years pretty well.

This is undoubtedly the single worst purchase I've ever made, and that includes failed lottery tickets, which at least gave me hope for a few hours.Aargh.Caveat: take this review as that of an old (51 years old) Yes fan who, unlike many, cringes at music that sounds like it's coming from a cheap Casio keyboard stuck in an endless loop and needing a reboot.

Three words I can use to describe it is boring, turgid and bloated. Unfortunatly it's just the son of one of the band who got some new kit for his birthday having a mess about.

Hey, to each his own, but please leave Yes alone unless you have more talent than this. This sucks. I'm taking mine back. Waste of money.

I'm afraid isn't one of them. Fresh from the school of \\"I've got an Akai sampler and I intend to use it\\", Virgil Howe (or \\"The Verge\\" as he credits himself) proves unintentionally that it's best not to tamper with musical genius. Fanatics like myself will of course own it because it's Yes; but I promise you won't listen to it more than once. Repetitious beyond belief, I was convinced on more than one track that the CD was defective! Dreary packaging and impossible to read liner notes only add insult to injury.

And, that having been said, I'm a bit disappointed. The first song (Tempus Fugit) gets great treatment, and sounds good, probably because the original lends itself to a bit of electronica. As the album progresses, though, the songs become more disjointed the remixing less... appropriate.I tried to think of how the remixes played off the themes of their originals -- Yes songs are packed with quick changes of instrumentation, tempo, and volume. But, it all works in that way all Yes fans have come to appreciate. Similar changes in the remixes, though, don't flow as well. Rather, I found myself wondering if \\"The Verge\\" was trying out all of the possible features of his new synth.Ah, well, I'm sure I'll return to a few of the tracks once in a while.

There are warnings about using rubber gloves when handling the product. I intentionally applied a couple drops of the product to my skin and ... NOTHING! No burn, no heat, no pain. I put a drop in a glass of water and it floated on top. I stirred it and drank a little. There was a very slight burning but I've had Chinese food that was a lot hotter.Another unusual observation. This liquid is dark brown in color. I have extracted the juice from a bag of Habanero peppers using a power juicer and the liquid was clear and at least a hundred times hotter than Pure Cap. If this is pure capsicum extract, why is it brown.My advice is to stay as far away from this product as possible.

Except for a couple of interesting side incidents, along the way, and many pictures taken, they spend most of the time arguing or not talking and watching the scenery go by.

To be honest, I was expecting something entirely different and was pleased with the subject matter, and presentation of the story. I'm not going to give away any of the storyline, but you will be well pleased with the time you spend reading this. Be prepared for different!

Today the word \\"queer\\" has been co-opted along with \\"gay.\\" The average young reader (under 60) wouldn't have a clue to the treasures between these covers and might be driven off by the title. There may be \\"queer\\" people in this story but they are not in evidence by todays standard of meaning of the word. The people in this book may be \\"queer\\" and \\"gay\\" but not homosexuals (I don't believe). The gay community of today might object to being neglected in this tale.

What fun!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Fresh Air","review":"My daughter has loved Kipper since she was about 10 months old. We were shocked, when at 10 months she actually sat through three episodes of Kipper. We don't encourage a lot of TV viewing, but Kipper is always welcome in our house. It is a nice change from all the other nonsense out there.Its stories and characters are refreshing in today's fast-paced world. It has a simple animation that will be a relief from all the flashy, fast-paced cartoons. We think this lack of complexity is what first caught our daughter's attention. It isn't violent, it isn't demeaning, and it is worth every cent. I never get tired of watching it with my daughter and how many children's shows can you say that about. At 15 months, she still loves it. We own four of the Kipper DVD's now and love every one of them, but Pools, Parks, and Picnics is one of my personal favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video. Great Deal. Buy it!","review":"What a deal! You get 7 Kipper episodes on this video as opposed to only four on Kipper, Pig's Present and Snowy Day (all great videos worth buying too). I think this Kipper tape is great for exposing children to a broader vocabulary and teaching them how to interact with others. This video is probably better suited for children that are at least 2 years of age since there is much more dialogue than the first three Kipper tapes (listed above). Although if you child loves Kipper and is under two, he won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Artsy...","review":"This film has been on my shelf for years and I just recently decided to watch it. The shining moments are the dramatic elements and the eroticism. It relies heavily on artistic visuals which is sometimes used to mask any bad acting or melodramatic plot line. The one true standout however is the boldness of the director/screenwriter. She attempts to go where few if any have gone: exploring the fetish doctors have for their amputees, in fact revealing a deeper meaning to the limb-less beauty and the insecure doctor. Overall, it was surprisingly good and commanded my attention from beginning to end. It managed to create a high society, artsy film ready for any severing or amputations that may be necessary. Also I see that the DVD versions available are now out of print and the ones for sale are ridiculously priced. I'm glad I bought it when I did at a Circuit City for like $9.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"Item is a bootleg and import.....","review":"I was very disappointed in this item when I received it. The case is written in another language which you really don't see when you look at the small photo on amazon. The main menu of the DVD is poor quality and skips and was obviously made by an amateur. It also has Korean (?) subtitles as the default (but can be manually turned off each time you watch the movie).

She left just days before shooting started and lawsuit involved and she lost. Then the star change to Sherilyn Fenn, another lovely actress but apparently her star power in nowhere near miss Basinger as the movie did miserably in box office. But the movie itself is good about an obsessive doctor played by Julian Sand who stop at nothing to be together with a lovely girl played by Sherilyn Fenn. David Lynch's daughter direct.

Nick was trippin', cutting off the woman's arms and legs made me totally claustraphobic!!!The movie was unintentionally homorous, often due to the delivery of lines like \\"...but I love you, Helena!!!\\" The line isn't funny, it's just the pseudoconviction put into it's delivery.I will tell you though, the ending through a pretty neat spin on things!!!

I'm a big fan of Sherilyn Fenn ever since her turn as Audrey in \\"Twin Peaks\\" and Julian Sands in \\"The Killing Fields.\\" After laughing through most of the love interest sequence, the ridiculous attempt to mimic Fellini's \\"La Dolce Vita\\" fountain scene, the ludacrious wind that seems to monsoon the inside of Sherilyn's bedroom, I have to conclude that this was one of the worst movies ever written. I have to ask WHY exactly did the Enigma soundtrack was chosen?

To add insult to injury the performances are just as bad as the direction. Passing on this script and project was the best thing Kim Basinger ever did. Was it the director's fault, the actor's fault? Well maybe. But I think the whole promise was a bad idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"I went into this movie expecting to like it, because I was familiar with the bizarre premise and thought it would be edgy and compelling. Instead, it was slow-moving, terribly miscast (especially Bill Paxton as the hunky bad-boy sex-machine lover of Helena) and had one of the cheesier soundtracks I've ever heard. A complete waste of time (and I don't say that often.) Bill Paxton and Julian Sands, both fine actors, undoubtedly cringe when they look back at their decision to add this movie to their respective resumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood classic","review":"I genuinely do believe that this has to be one of the most misrepresented and misunderstood films of all time. It is extremely tongue-in-cheek, a surreal exploration of a sad, pathetic, horny and longing individual who lives in the dream-like world of sexual obsession. The acting and direction are rather unorthodox in order to contribute to this theme. Beautiful scenery, erotic imagery and an unusual plot make this an utter classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bizarro Cinema!","review":"Often a film of such a bold and original nature gets blasted by critics, and indeed that is what happened to Boxing Helena. When considering that these same critics overly praised such Hollywood Summer tripe as Star Wars Phantom Menace and Men In Black, their panning of this and other films fall flat! Boxing Helena is a daring, imaginative exploration of one man's dangerous obsession. The direction is tight and artistic, the acting top-notch and the script a highly definative character analysis. I'd gladly give more stars, but MGM did a terrible injustice to this film by offering a bare-bones DVD. Though the price is right for what it is, the lack of the Signature Lazer-Disc extras is disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamo Movie","review":"Saw this back around the time it came out but recently I watched it again and it is one of the worst movies of all time!

For example, various right-hand pizzicato techniques, drops, pull-offs, producing \\"growl,\\" working in an ensemble with other musicians, basic intros and endings, and much, much more. He doesn't waste any time searching for words; Ed's presentation is well scripted and efficient, and he delivers it very well. The result is a DVD that is jam-packed with information and good demonstrations.I have Todd's , Ed's, and Rufus's DVDs, and I find them all valuable (and fun) for different reasons.

After watching the DVD set, it does bring back good memerories. It's basically Twilight Zone for kids and portrays some G rated scares and creepyness as a family moves into perhapes the weirdest town in the contry. I was amazed to see Joe Dante (Gremlins, The Howling, Explorers) directing the pilot episode. I enjoy most of his films and its no wonder I liked it as a kid. I was also surprised to see this series released on DVD as it was really a failure on its initial release. I assumed the series would never get its just home video release so I am happy to see that everyone that enjoyed it growing up can now own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Weird But Fun\\"","review":"The series, \\"Eerie Indiana\\" is a strange show and I like strange. You can't take it serious, though, but it is something the whole family can watch together and enjoy. It is funny and entertaining.It is about a family who moves to Eerie, Indiana-a place that odd things occur and people who are not as they appear. One example is a 50's type mom who preserves her twins (and herself) in life size tupperware containers. The series revolves around the son, Marshall, and his new best friend, Simon. They investigate the \\"weirdness\\" and record it alll. What is interesting, no one else seems to notice anything. To the rest of the town-including Marshall's family, everything is normal.\\"Eerie Indiana\\" consists of 19 half hour episodes-great find for kids of all ages. Enjoy your visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING!!","review":"Be warned!! I think all interested buyers should be informed about the defect on one of the discs. On one episode on disc three right in the middle of the show it pauses, lags and skips. But other than that its a great buy even with the \\"Slaped together quickly with no care\\" feel too it. So i warn you! Ask your self how bad you want it because i wanted it badly but that one defect ruined it all for me but i wouldn't trade it for anything either, so be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"snooze ville indiana","review":"this is more of a kids series. was disappointed and cant even finish it. borining, fall a sleep tv. cant believe i paid that much for something so boring,."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"i'm into a lot of eerie, spooky and the like and the infoi read led me to believe this series is for everyone.

Several lines lept out at me, and after googling \\"bittersweet is the compassion of a psychopath,\\" I found the lyrics \\"Livin Times\\" from this album.Over better-than-average beats, I found a mind-boggling density of concepts that makes the most of hip-hop as an artistic medium. Sure, you could just talk fast, or repeat the same thing over and over (What? Okay!). But you could really express your identity and worldview - if you have one.The writing tickles the same fancy that makes reading a very literate book so much fun. But unlike Lolita, I can dance to this.Overall, the album is a little hit & miss for my personal taste, which probably means that some but not all of the songs will appeal to a wide range of people. Individual tracks can be bought - they're on e music. And best of all, there's a new lifesavas album out in April so look for that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars good album could have been better","review":"I had high expectations for this album maybe they were a little to high so maybe im the wrong person to review this album. I was impressed by about half of the album most of the beats were dope but where this album really excells is the lyrics. This joint has some seriously hot lyrics but only about half of the beats are what I would consider def so after about the first couple of great tracks you start to hear some really corny stuff then some great songs and then the corny songs sort of creep up on you again this pattern continues throughout the album making it an inconsistent listen but still I enjoyed this album like ive enjoyed all of quannums projects these are people who put thought time and energy into their music and are not concerned about making a quick buck but are more concerned with releasing a quality product. I hope that their next album will be a little more consistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the al-tuna-tive","review":"I was hoping that it would be an alternative for canned tuna, but it isn't.

After trying for a while to remove the bones and skin, I just gave up and threw it out. Maybe I got a bad can? If not, you guys need to open a can of tuna and compare product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for Moms looking for healthy recipes","review":"I received this book as a gift, and was pleasantly surprised by the content. I was assuming that it would be another mainstream recipe book (as another reviewer noted, there is nothing on the cover to let you know it is full of healthy \\"hippie\\" recipes). However, there are 30 or so pages of good nutritional advice and then scores of great \\"alternative\\" recipes, covering breakfast, snacks, drinks, soups, entrees, breads, and desserts.Please note that if you don't like whole grains or 'whole food' ingredients or 'weird' vegetables then you won't like this book. Also, you will need to be able to get to a health food store for many ingredients... but if all of that is right up your alley, they you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cookbook for anyone wanting to eat healthy (pregnant or not)","review":"This cookbook is full of gems! I love the focus on organic, whole foods. As a nutrition counselor with a focus on the healing tradition of Ayurveda, I think this cookbook is nourishing, nurturing and useful for everyone, but especially those expecting. I've given out several of the recipes to clients, friends and family. Robin Lim is a midwife with many years of working with women's health and her wisdom is evident. Highly recommended for pregnant ladies as well as people with an inclination towards healthy cooking and earth mother tendencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Not Impressed","review":"This books contains mainly just recipes, most of which you cannot find the ingrediants for in regular stores, not to mention they take too long to make! The author makes some valid points about nutrition in the early part of the book but refers often to her pregnancy while she lived in India. She also heavily stresses eating organically but since I don't, I did not get much from this book. Her solutions for pregnancy symptoms are a little hard to swallow - honestly, how would one get water from a green coconut?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks!","review":"We tried three receipes from this book and they were all complicated and tasted horrible.This book just stinks - don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Approach","review":"I had to respect the approach that the author took in putting the information together in the book. She meticulously cited her sources and was very clear on what was based on conjecture.

Mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Bang the Drum Slowly\\"","review":"The first Henry Wiggen novel is the best of them all. While not as well known as Bang the Drum Slowly, which is its sequel and which certainly deserves the praise it has received, The Southpaw is a wise, touching, and very funny book about a young man's coming of age in post-war America. All of the big themes of American life are here in a short, first person novel written in dialect (so hard to do well, here so effortless) about a young pitcher's journey to the major leagues -- race, class, ambition, envy, fame, friendship, love. All treated deftly, and with good humor. Finally, Henry Wiggen is as fresh and attractive as any character in recent American fiction. Read all of the Wiggen books, but start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball as Americana","review":"Mark Harris wrote perhaps the finest baseball novel ever with \\"The Southpaw.\\" The book portrays the coming of age of a young left-handed pitching prodigy, Henry Wiggen, as he tries to make his mark in the majors in the 1950s. The book is written as a memoir by Wiggen himself after his rookie season with the New York Mammoths. The Mammoths are chasing a pennant and Wiggen is seeking to become \\"an immortal\\" and a man. Laconic, wry, amusing and gripping all at the same time, Wiggen's memoir slowly but surely draws in the reader. I had to get up at 5 in the morning to finish the last 100 pages to find out what happened to Henry and the Mammoths. Truly a \\"perfect game\\" for Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, pretentious, and profane","review":"Having picked up its more famous sequel Bang the Drum Slowly on sale, I got The Southpaw so I would know the background. Now I have no desire to read the sequel. This is supposedly serious fiction for baseball fans, though most commentary will tell you it is not about baseball at all. Perhaps not, but there is a lot of boring baseball in it (the recounting of baseball games ought not to be boring, but it is here). The non-baseball stuff is at least interesting at times but otherwise has almost no redeeming value. Apparently \\"coming-of-age\\" should lead one to become more selfish and more cynical. And it is hard to conceive of a first-person narrator so lacking in self-awareness. We are supposed to like Henry Wiggen, but he is not likable. None of the characters in this book are likable. The Southpaw is boring, pretentious, and profane. I finished this because I started it, but I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality not as stated","review":"The book was in terrible condition: binding broken and pages almost falling out, cover, edges weather-beaten and dirty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Shows It's Age","review":"As an avid baseball fan but a first-time baseball novel reader, I was disappointed with Southpaw. I didn't think twice about when the book was written (50 years ago) when I bought it. As I read through, the age of the book was obvious; not because of the style of baseball described, but because of the laughable simplicity of the characters. Some will rejoice that this book takes us \\"back to the good old days\\", but if you're looking for a more realistic novel of the game with thrilling twists and turns of a drive for the pennant, this book is not for you.Also, if you know little about baseball, the book will be hard to follow when it describes game action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say worthless???","review":"I can, and I did.

Ky-Mani has a different sound than any of his brothers, and he sounds GOOD. Rude Boys is a good rollin' track, Ky-Mani's vocals are especially good here, a bit gravely and more raw that on some of the other tracks. Party's on is a nice little hip-hop kind of track; where ARE the keys to my Benz? This is an exremely enjoyable CD, I don't think anyone would be disappointed after purchasing it. It will do everything from make you want to get up and dance to silently cry when listening to \\"Dear Dad\\".

The problem, however, is that a substantial proportion of that portrait is conjecture, built out of an uncritical examination of literature and legend. Do not think that after reading Meade's book you will come away with true history. For a truer, less romantized account, read Amy Kelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman with a Story","review":"Just as with most world-wide examples today, the historical lives of English monarchs and other persons of power and fame was dominated by men. But, as women mature I personally believe we grow weary of so much exposure to one-sided male perspective. This book helped alleviate my weariness. Meade does Eleanor, and the rest of us, a service by telling Eleanor's incredible story of power and politics and gender with a historians well researched, reasoned clarity, a scholar's forth-rightness, and a woman's sensitivity. And what a story did Eleanor's life make!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent chase","review":"While the book does feature the F-22 depicted on the cover, it's really a B-story subplot that doesn't seem to really involve the Fericos at all. However, it does continue the unofficial series that DeFelice's works fall into with the reappearance of President Jack D'Amici and ties in the HOGS trilogy he wrote as James Ferro by revealing the ultimate fate of BJ Dixon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying High and Laying Low!","review":"DeFelice again proves himself the master of the genre with his latest techno-thriller. Jack Ferico, in a race to find his older brother, Danny, takes readers on a joyride like never before. Yet, BROTHER'S KEEPER is far more than simply an action/adventure. DeFelice expertly explores topics including family devotion, sibling rivalry, and self-pride. A jumbo-jet of a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action book","review":"This is just my second DeFelice book, but I'm hooked on his style and plot lines. Lots of good action scenes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just boring","review":"Sorry, just Booooring! I made it halfway through this snoozer before I decided that clipping my dogs nails was going to provide more excitement. Some probably feel that if I didn't finish the book then how can I say if its good or bad. Well in my opinion, if an author can't put something together in the first 100 pages or so that makes you want to read on then they're not doing their job. I've read other DeFelice novels that I enjoyed, despite his collaboration with Cussler (arghhh!) but this was not one. Move along, nothing to see here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A goody.","review":"I found this book very enjoyable and it moved well, its not slow on the get go, I also liked the ending, very different from his other books, which usually end with the guy getting the girl in the end, this time they....<read the book> enuf said (: And I liked the mention of a New Zealander, Cheers Bova...:"},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese calligraphy instructional and art book","review":"book is nicely done, an easy read and gives a good view for beginners on the Japanese written language and the arts surrounding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not essential, but nice to have","review":"This book is not essential to your campaign by any means. If you want to add a little more flavor to your campaign, though, the historical pantheons can be fun, and the rules in this book make creating your own pantheon a little easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really useful","review":"This was the 8th manual in my library I have for running my NWN module and it is the worst one so far. I really didn't find it as useful as I though it would be. I needed it for the 3rd edition gods and really, it doesn't give me any more info then the 3 primary books (DM, Players, Monster). In fact, It seems to contradict them a bit. I shouldn't of purchased this book, it really will just rot a bit. For a module designer who's trying to add deities in to their NWN module, its really not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very wonderful book. Must have for serious DMs.","review":"This is a wonderful addition to Dungeons and Dragons 3E. The artwork is superb, the introductory chapters are well written, links to the Epic Level Handbook are established, and it contains full stats on four pantheons to boot. I just have a few beefs with it:1. What are they thinking, making Corellon Larethian androgynous? That puts disturbing pictures into my mind...2. The alignments and power levels for certain deities in the historical pantheons are not accurate. Example: Ares is presented as being chaotic evil. To the layman, that seems fine and dandy. But, to an (amateur) scholar of mythology, that does not tally with the historical Greek gods. Zeus does not tolerate evil. Ares is not evil per se; he simply loves to fight. Thus, he is CN. There are other, similar errors in mostly the Greek and Egyptian pantheons, but rather than bash WotC, I'll just let DMs rule 0 them.3. Set is a hippo, not a jackass."},{"rating":"1","title":"deity statistics","review":"This book did not present the pantheons in a very loving fashion, but instead used most of the pages for the pantheon presentation for statistics for deities. Most people would never use these statistics in their games. You will not get a good feel for the pantheons in this book. Steer clear. look into \\"Faiths and Avatars\\" and \\"Book of the Righteous\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and Detailed for Roleplaying Ease","review":"This is a grand piece for the 3E set. The book is both illustrious in it's presentation and informative in it's content. Those running in the Greyhawk world like our group will find it a much sought after piece. The book not only gives you alot of serious data on the pantheons of fantasy realms but also gives you information on how they interact. A section is devoted to creating your own devine rulers as well. Definately packed with things the munchkins want too like new spells and magic items. Definately worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Buy With Caution","review":"This is an excellent book to gain ideas for including your own mythos and pantheon into an D&D game. It examines types of faiths (monothesism, polytheism, duality, forces & philosophies), reasons for faith (love, fear), and includes four pantheons. Also included are a monotheistic faith, duality, and a mystery faith.This book serves as good \\"brain food\\"; I recommend it. If you want complete advise on everything divine, this is not it. The stats distracted the main focus of the book but I give it four stars; excellent job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for a select few","review":"If you're a DM and into using Dieties in your campaing, this book is pretty good. Otherwise, don't waste your money. The artwork is fantastic, but it has absolutely nothing to offer the average player. No new spells, domains, prestige classes (except 2 related to a minor god), etc. Just borrow your DM's copy and thumb through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As others said- limited in scope","review":"I can't give this 5 stars, nor even 4. I can't do half-stars, so it's 2.5 for me. Certainly fun to flip through & see all the stats, but as someone who started off with 1e. AD&D;, it was a letdown to see so few cultures represented.Heh- they didn't even *bother* doing one for 4e., so it'll be interesting to see if they do for the up-coming \\"D&D; Next\\" 5e. I'd hope they greatly expand in the cultural department if they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an UPGRADE - not full product!!!","review":"The item description does not make clear that this product is an upgrade.

It's what is referred to as \\"filler\\". Its sole purpose is to take up space on some poor channel's schedule. The way they represent the city of Scottsdale, AZ is absolutely laughable. It might as well be some sleepy little town of a few thousand the way it is presented here. The plot involves people being killed and we are supposed to be concerned as to who is doing it.

It basically says all non-christian musicians are possessed by demons all in order to brainwash society and do Satan's bidding and it goes on and on for an hour and a half.

I purchased it because I LOVED the movie \\"Sorcerers of the New Age\\" that Joe Schimmel did. In that film, he backed up all of his claims meticulously with video footage from interviews, concerts, and quotations from books.In this film, Joe Schimmel talks in a stupid, overly excited voice the entire time. He takes quotes out of context, and I even noticed that one picture he showed had been doctored. The movie was corny and just plain STUPID. If I hadn't seen other documentaries on the topic of secular musicians being possessed, I would laugh this movie off and go listen to some led zeppelin.If you want to see a good movie on the satanic nature of rock and roll, watch \\"Sorcerers of the New Age\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an album should be.","review":"It's hard to put to words such devised and crafted sounds. This is an album in the purest sense. It's not some hacked collection of throw-away songs padded around a radio-friendly single, there's actual art and purpose to this one. This isn't to say this album doesn't have songs that COULD be played on radio, lord knows it does and they should, they're just not the type of songs radio programmers currently eat up and shove at you. There's a pervasive mood to this one. It's dark, yet not. More like toying with hopping between dark and light, the kind of album Billy Corgan wishes he could make. Definitely the next evolutionary step after \\"Elemental\\". It's not an album that immediately jumps at you on first listen, and that's a good thing. True genius takes time to show itself and to be appreciated. The best albums are ones that you REALLY get by about the 6th or 7th listen. One of the last true artists in music today."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Tears for Fears, you'll like this.","review":"I couldn't help but respond to the review posted by \\"Huge 80's Fan\\" below. He gives it a only a fair rating because he says \\"...there just isn't any one 'hit' on this CD. It's not bad, it's not terrific, it's just OK. ... I don't think you will hear any of these songs on the radio.\\"And that's a bad thing? The fact that it won't be blasted on every radio station all the more should tell everyone that this album is very good. I recommend that \\"Huge 80's Fan\\" stick to buying old albums of Cyndi Lauper and current hitmakers like NSYNC and Britney Spears.Bottom Line: If you like the old TFF's albums, you should most likely find pleasure in listening to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he go off the deep end?","review":"First off, let me say that musically this CD has a few nice things to offer, which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. But in addition to some of the hackneyed synth lines (which I won't go into since other reviewers have covered this well), he writes lines like: \\"Bullets for the brains of the atheists\\".So let me get this straight, Roland: Atheists should be KILLED???Is this some weird kind of Christian tough-love or has he simply gone insane? And there's no getting around this hateful line either: no one can claim this is somehow metaphorical because he precedes the line with \\"Hey now read my lips\\" and he then repeats it.Anyone who wants to spew hatred can do it without my financial support. I'm not even an atheist and this offends me deeply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apalling","review":"I bought this album because I had heard that it was essentially a Tears For Fears album in everything but name. That much is true. The music is as good as anything that TFF produced. Were that the end of the story, I'd give this album a good rating. But...The one thing that ruins this album is the song, \\"Bullets For Brains\\". It's a song about murdering atheists. If there is a positive sub-message in the song, or if it's meant to be sarcastic, it isn't at all apparent. Why Roland Orzabal would write such an apalling song is baffling. Musically, it sounds good, but it's like listening to a racist song just because it sounds catchy. It's definitely not something you want your kids listening to. It definitely deserves a \\"Parental Advisory\\" warning sticker. As far as I know, Orzabal has offered no explanation for this song. I think he owes the world that... or an apology."},{"rating":"2","title":"He cant do a bad album if he tried","review":"Roland orzabal is the only musician I have ever called a genius. This album is filled with great instrumentation has great production and the lyrics and melodies are driving and profound. My highest recomendations-best album Ive heard in 5 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catatonic......","review":"....I'm sorry, Roland, not one of your best. I want more of the voice. The dreamy music drowned vocals. What happened to the soulful voice of \\"I Believe\\" and \\"Woman in Chains\\". I know there's a beautiful soothing voice somewhere, but it seems as though it's been buried. I liked Snowdrop, but I still strained to hear. Please bring your wonderful voice back into song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Cats fizzles..","review":"i'm a huge R.O. fan, but this cd fizzles bigtime. this is somewhat of an exploration into techno, and is nearly absent of the brilliant songwriting we have come to know and love. i think he self titled this CD because it is clearly different from his work as TFF. i could not reccomend this disc to even the most avid fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was rather disappointed with this album. It seemed to have good musical qualities that were ruined by a techo stlye beat that was unappealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, contrived and un-inspiring.","review":"You can't blame Roland Orzabal for attempting to strike oil for a second time...unfortunately, \\"Tomcats Screaming Outside\\" is a contrived and emotionless techno/electro waste of time. This is boring and half-hearted at best.The amount of memorable and enjoyable moments on this album could be compacted into about 3 or 4 minutes of music...about the length of one song. And that one song would only be comparable to the least interesting of the greatness that was Tears for Fears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take my word on this and you will never regret it","review":"Well this has got to be the best music that has come from the UK in the last ten years. This cd not only capture the mood of the world music scene at this moment but mixes the mood with a lyrically rich entree to be followed by the main meal of the supreme vocals of Roland at his best. If this does not get airplay throughout the world it is because people have put Roland into a basket and have close their ears. Be prepared to go on a musical journey that will get you to asking for more. Then go back to the previously release Tears for Fears cd's that Roland has done since Curt left. The tracks on this CD that will get you hooked are Dandelion , For the Love of Cain , Low Life and Bullets for Brains just to name a few but the whole cd is brilliant. Well Done Roland !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT one...","review":"I kinda liked Tears for Fears music in the 80's. I simply loved it in the 90's and am absolutely blown away by them in this century! I've just discovered Tomcats Screaming Outside recently, and am thrilled to have yet another GREAT cd to add to my TFF collection. If you made it this far in the review then you probably already know what I'm talking about. Roland Orzabal is a multi-talented treasure. I should just shut up and listen...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Me Want More","review":"Just picked this one up because it was the only Tears-connected CD that I didn't have. It of course reminds me of Elemental which was basically an R O solo effort. This one grows on you as you replay it. It makes me want Curt and Roland to get busy and give it another effort. I miss the production qualities, harmonies and the theme oriented stuff they used to do. There is a place for their music and there are people who want something somewhere in between the Killers and Fiddy Cent or Snoop Dogie Style or Def Jam Mo Fo etc. etc...."},{"rating":"2","title":"He never fails!","review":"Being a huge Tears For Fears fan, I just had to run out and buy this import. Roland Orzabal has been making amazing music for so long that I really started to wonder if he could continue to keep up the momentum. Well, he certainly did and then some! I really fell in love with the album \\"Raoul & The Kings Of Spain\\", but I must say that this is probably Roland's best work to date. That is saying a lot since I really felt \\"Raoul\\" would be the height of Roland's talent. I can not believe he has outdone himself once again! Such a shame that he is continuously overlooked to the point that most people don't even realize that there really was life after Curt Smith left Tears For Fears. If you like this cd, be sure to check out the Emiliana Torrini album that he recently produced called, \\"Love In The Time Of Science\\". Once again his brillance eminates!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for Die Hard Tears/Roland fans","review":"There are a few real gems on this but a fair amount of junk too.Worth getting if you already have the rest of the Tears stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Songs","review":"First of all, I'm very pleasantly surprised to see so many reviews of this excellent album. I always assumed that this was a neglected treasure that only diehard Tears For Fears fans would know about. And even if that's the case, there is still cause for proclaiming how brilliant this album is. Roland Orzabal is definitely one of the more underrated singers and songwriters of the past three decades. And this album is ample proof of his songwriting prowess. Some absolutely brilliant, shimmering, lovely tunes on here. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last Tears For Fears","review":"In my views it sounds more like the real last TFF album, then the one release afterward with Curt Smith. The songs are very different from one another. The name of the band is atrocious, but the result is more then decent. I like the way Roland compose it's music when he is inspired. It's not always the same recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Removes!","review":"This stuff really works. Sometimes it can be very difficult to remove medical adhesive, but this stuff does work.

This is a great album and doesn't sound \\"Nashville\\" ('cause it was recorded at Billy Bob's!). Pat Green's songs are written about all the good things in life: partying, girls, and Texas.

The movie paints a compassionate portrait of small-town life in the U.S., and Jeremy's travels lead him to cross paths with teams comprised of New Zealanders, Native Americans, Canadians, and a somewhat obnoxious (but not all bad) junk-mail king from Tampa Bay. He also discovers his own familial connection to the Midwest.Everyone in the film shares a passion for the impressively difficult game of fast-pitch softball - and if you've ever wondered, it really is harder to hit in this game than in baseball. Fastpitch by all accounts is a dying sport. The film captures Jeremy's 1996 season, and one is left wondering what's happened since. Nonetheless, it's a wonderful, warm film that everyone will enjoy, whether or not they're a sports fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book.","review":"This book is not for the entry level climber.

I think the company should have dome some more thought into it. There are diifernt kinds of fasteners that are safe for the kids that can be removed like a nylon screw with a nut. Also the roof support does not sit flush in the hole so when you go and tap the bolt in the hole the pole will shift upwards and you can miss the hole. I even tried to contact the company through their e-mail and also tried to call and no one has called me back. This was a birthday gift that I now have to try to get the roof support secured so it is safe. I will never again buy a step 2 product based on this experience.

Someone else wrote in their review that John Carpenter just can't \\"get it done\\" when he has studio funding for a film - and I agree. Halloween and some of Carpenter's other low-budget classics are the movies I would like to remember him by, not this movie.The storyline is mediocre and not much is done to impress in the way of special effects.

No other movie this decade can compare with the disturbing imagery of Madness. Sutter Cane is the top selling horror novelist in the world, but it appears that Cane's writings are having no shortage of ill effects on his readers. Cane is writing to bring about the end of the world and it looks like he just might succeed! Carpenter spares no expense in the dementia department and pulls no punches with the gore.

Next time I will trust my own instincts about what I rent! This movie was just plain bad. Its hard to tell what is actually happening throughout most of the movie. Is it a dream sequence? Is this stuff reallly taking place? None of it looks believable in any case, and I gave the film 55 minutes before I shut it off and turned on TV. The plot was not convincing, the acting over the top, and the writing was not acceptable. It is not horror, and not scary.This movie has nothing in common with the John Carpenter films that truly are excellent----- Halloween,The Fog, etc. So, I am not quite sure who the people are who rated this confusing, poorly-written film so highly!

Although it is far from the scariest film ever, it certainly is one of them. There is just something about THAT mysterious knocking green hand and THE young bike rider-turned-old that creeped me out for years. I still can't imagine what that creature that tore up the insane asylum looked like, making multiple viewings of this film a must for me.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for carpenter's fans","review":"I give it one star for a simple reason: the film lacks all the things that make a Carpenter film distinctive; the atmospheric music, the menacing atmosphere, the way he turns a western into sci-fi. In the Mouth of Madness is basically a Lovecraftian story in the big screen, and although Lovecraft's tales work on the printed page (and in the imagination) they don't work when you show it on screen. Carpenter adapted Lovecraft's ideas brilliantly in The Fog, but in that movie, we never see the face of the monsters. Here he shows too much and it doesn't work.I don't blame Carpenter for trying something different, but even Ghosts of Mars or Vampires are better than this.The worst Carpenter movie of all.0 of 9 people found the following review helpful.

It sucks. One star is probably closer to the truth but I'm feeling generous. With a bad script, bad effects, and plenty of overacting, this mess has not one scare in its entire running time. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woefully under appreciated","review":"Why this movie isn't given higher marks is beyond. Carpenter has been in a funk filmwise for sometime. With this wonderful screenplay pulling the best elements from Lovecraft's mythos and a great performance from Sam Neil, Carpenter shows why he was the king of movie horror for over a decade. Much like \\"The Thing\\" and \\"They Live\\", this film gets better as it ages and I hope it starts to find the audience and favor it deserved the first time out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping well plotted and conceived Horror More Than Just Special Effects and Gore","review":"John Carpenter has made many unconventional movies they don't always work. He nailed this one! It is a blend of horror, Dark Humor with a sprickling of noir. Great mood music and photography (not only great scenes but unusual), character developement far better than most horror. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen regardless of genre. I wish he would make a quality sequel to this not a commercial prequel that everyone else is doing. This is John Carpenters finest moments here if you like horror or even want to see a unique film with vision look no further."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw up in my Mouth . . . of Madness","review":"I original bought this DVD a while ago because I thought it had something to do with H.P. Lovecraft. It really is a terrible film. The script is amateurish and the direction of Sam Niel is disappointing and the story is really boring. I really liked The Thing and Escape from New York, but this film is tedious at best, not frightening, and such a derivative mash up of a bunch of horror stories that it has no thematic center. Frankly, it just sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A maddening dissapointment","review":"This film represents both the best and the worst of John Carpenter. Initially, the premise is fascinating, combining an original approach to the horror genre with an alomst suffocating sense of paranoia...then come the special effects. The last half of the film degenerates into yet another pointless exercise in the hight-tech gross-out--all at the expense of plot and characterization. Suddenly we are wrenched out of the horrifying realm of primal nightmare that Carpenter crafted so well in films like Halloween and The Fog to the adolescent appeal to special effects that overtook some of his later films (does Christine ring any bells?). Most of the plot of the film is an outright theft of the writings of H.P. Lovecraft--even the title is a rip-off of Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness. H.P. deserves better than this, and so do fans of the horror genre. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PFFFFFFTHAHHAHAHA","review":"you honestly are asking $50 for this on dvd? single disk, no special features? unless that includes a personal visit from sam neill you must be out of your mind. this movie is more than 10 years old, getting pretty close to 15 years to be quite honest. if any of you schmucks bought this at that price you deserve exactly what you got - ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"John Carpenter's films are a list of hits and misses, and this one's a miss.

After viewing it two times, I still find it lacking. First, Julie Carmen STINKS! She lends no support to Sam Neill... (can someone please tell me what he's doing in this movie?! He's so much better than this!) She's stiff and I found this distracting. The plot, although potentially good, failed to deliver. I saw the movie twice just to find any redeeming qualities. While there are some good parts to it, my overall review is that there are better movies to spend your time watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recording I didn't know existed","review":"I had an LP of Red White and Blue(grass) Pickin' Up, one of my all-time favorite recordings. While looking for a CD of that record (I had converted the LP to CD about ten years ago, but wanted original studio CD for better sound), and I found the had recorded a second album! I scooped it up as quickly as I could.As good as Pickin' Up, the addition of a string section in some of the pieces doesn't detract from the \\"bluegrass-y\\" nature of the album. I think my favorite piece is Whittlin', a full-bore, high-speed instrumental as good as anything they've done, and one of my favorite bluegrass pieces ever (but only 1:40 long.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tasting calcium chews!","review":"I've tried several different brands of calcium chews and these are the best.

The manual that comes with the camera is so convoluted, it actually does more harm than good. This book by Dennis Curtin is blissfully clear and well written. Everything you need to know is organized and explained. It's not a glitzy tech book, it's a \\"use it\\" manual that should have come with the camera.

The book includes some basic photography information interspersed with features of the 995, but the 995 info can all be found in the owners manual, and there are a lot better photography technique books available.

Much of the text is devoted to the basics of photography and is likely included in all of the author's camera-related books. The Nikon-specific material does not provide any more insight than does the Nikon manual. Moreover, the book has no index (the Nikon manual does!), hence it's not easy to find topics of interest. And the numerous typographical errors further indicate that this book was carelessly slapped together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet yes, a pain to install","review":"The fan is indeed quiet.

Please! spare me.The action sequences and dialogue are closer to comedy, not intended I tell you.I am baffled as to what on earth Rutger Hauer, Gabrielle Anwar and Joe Mantegna are doing there???Maybe with other less known and talented actors, the film would have been more bearable.The only saving grace in all this mess, is watching Anwar and Monika Schnarre, two very beautiful women, but sadly the script and direction are a waste.Save your $$s for a proper action film, and give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise twist","review":"Movie has a surprise twist in the story.

Overall, just a great clock and was exactly was what I was looking for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reworking the Familiar","review":"A curiously compelling little movie, Crashout is a throwback to the tough prison-escape movies of the 30's. Fortunately, the producers had the good sense to hire an expert cast of B-movie veterans to enliven an otherwise shopworn plot. Writer-producer Hal Chester and director-writer Lewis Foster provide each convict with a distinct personality that holds viewer interest as tensions mount, while the audience anticipates how each character will be brought to justice. Standouts in the cast are the always subtle Arthur Kennedy, an engagingly ambivalent Marshall Thompson, and William Tallman doing his scary psycho bit, this time as a knife-throwing religious fanatic. And in a poignant bit part, cult favorite Gloria Talbott as the prospect of a normal life for the ill-fated Thompson. Though you've seen it all before, there are many nice touches that lift this otherwise generous slice of thick-ear beyond the merely routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crashout: top notch prison breakout film!","review":"Sure, we've seen the escaped convicts formula before, but this one hits home. Here is a real diversity of the six characters; each one as convincing as the next. William Bendix is his usual great gruff self, playing the heartless, cold-blooded mastermind. My personal favorite, film veteran Arthur Kennedy, excels as the counterpoint to Bendix: he excels as the white collar criminal with a brain, and ultimately, a heart. Fine dialogue, plenty of action, and even a little romance thrown in. A winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, a hit!","review":"I've only made a few of the recipes, but that is a few more successful attempts at low-carb vegetarian fare than I've had with any other cookbook.

Many of the recipes have 50, 60, even 70 grams of carbohydrates per serving. Also, for anyone who actually knows how to cook, many of the \\"recipes\\" are pathetic. For example, the recipe for spiced nuts involves putting spices and nuts in a bag and shaking, that's it, no roasting, caramelizing, etc. Another recipe instructs you to roll strips of scallion and bell pepper up in \\"lunch meat\\" with mayonnaise).

(Fabrice Luchini is great as the lawyer who'smotives are always a little mysterious).An interesting, subtle study of what's really of value in life.My only complaint is that some of the Machiavellian machinations are alittle obviously played by both Ardant's character and her greedy,wormy new husband, who values a peerage over marriage, love or family.Somehow that artifice made the film a bit less emotionally powerfulthan it might be.

Moreover, the film is boring; it takes a lot of time to relate even a little bit of not so interesting information. The ending, meanwhile, is anti-climatic and not totally unexpected.

Probably another clumsy dance album with one true hit and a bunch...I mean a BUNCH...of filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"After hearing \\"Move Your Feet\\" on the radio, I was psyched for 2 months for the album's US release. What a disappointment, none of the tracks sound like \\"Move Your Feet.\\" After reading several reviews that compared Junior Senior's sound to Chic, perhaps my expectations were too high. Suffice it to say, the songs are sloppy and annoying with that one notable exception, and bear NO resemblance to old school disco."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR GOD SAKES....DON'T BUY IT!!!","review":"Like anybody I was curious to hear the sound of this duo since I like the single and the video that's out, but hearing the whole CD...I have no words.

Besides, how cool can it be if VH1 used it in all their ads?If you are looking for fun, unusual music to bring to a party, just to watch all the rap boys and girls freak out, purchase an album by The Soft Pink Truth. Their latest release \\"Do you want New Wave or do you want the Soft Pink Truth puts this watered down drizzle to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Fun!","review":"After seeing the video for \\"Move Your Feet\\", which is a hilariously animated video that colorfully brings the song to life, I did as I was told and moved my feet over to the computer.

Once you hear it, you'll never want anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the party started!","review":"The danish group Junior Senior is really something you should listen to, one of the funkiest dance tracks of the summer \\"Move your feet\\" is their creation. A cool and funny party song that defenitely will move your feet. I thought the rest of the songs would be simular but after i've listened through the album i was wrong, half of the songs are simular happy pop-dance songs but the rest( even if they are funky and easygoing\\" they are more rock oriented, kind of like Beach boys happy 60's sound. Their second single \\"Rhythm Bandits\\" is the best to date, even if it's not typical dance it's good enough. \\"Shaky your coconuts\\" \\"White trash\\" and \\"good girls, bad boys\\" get's your attention cause of their names, but those are also cool dancable party songs. At the end of the day this album is fun, and worth your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good!!!!","review":"Happy, \\"bounce around the room\\" music somewhat reminisent (sic?) of the Ramones.

I bought their CD \\"Unclear Near\\" at the show (I think it was the first day of release) and I must say that this is a band that has what it takes to be successful. The CD is strong enough to please both Christian and secular markets. What's more, the band's ministry provides a great message.

'Personality, Divination, and the Tarot' by Carl Sargent, was recommended because the author uses the TdM. Why did the author choose the TdM? Because the cards come without a LWB! 'The Marseilles deck...forces us back upon our own imaginations and understanding.'As the title suggests the cards are described using personality theories, but then suggestions are made for reading with the cards.

Lincoln sought power, pure and simple, and he found it be rewarding his enemies and ignoring his friends.So many of you are so easy to brainwash."},{"rating":"2","title":"more modeling concepts","review":"This is not a new cover on an older book. Having enjoyed Beltrami's first book I was glad to see a second. The new continues the subject of modeling not math. Well written, the author's book ties the conceptual difficulites of the subjects with the necessary math to get the point accross and guide the reader to new frontiers of insight again in the sense of the physical model not the math. This is a very important point! One does not lose sight of the over-all objective as with some math intensive proof types. The beauty of the work is getting the necessary across with the least. One disappointment though. The book was to short. I hope the author continues another work. Perhaps some more indepth of previous covered material. All examples and problems are easily solved in Mathcad, which already has the depth but sometimes not the explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"For fanatics only?","review":"I came of age as a baseball fan in the 70s, so sure, I read this from cover to cover and got some warm fuzzy nostalgic feelings.

However, this particular pair is tight --I have never had this problem before and may end up taking them somewhere professional to have them stretched out so they will feel more comfortable. I bought a different pair earlier this summer from a different vendor which did not have this problem, so I don't think it's my feet.

The beats are all energetic, the guy definitely got flow. Topics of Fabolous is repetitive but he does it well. Guest appearances all do their thing. DJ Clue's beat are so-so level for his work, but they are all solid although nothing stands out.

It all has to do with being in the right place at the right time I guess. The only reason his first single was good was because Nate Dogg appeared on it. Fabolous sounds like a even more nasal version of Mase and it's hard to sound more nasal than Mase. Plus, \\"Get Right\\", the remake of the Junior Mafia-Biggie song, falls so flat it should be illegal. This definitely was one of the worst songs of 2001, possibly one of the worst songs ever made in hip-hop. Fabolous should keep his day job because sooner or later when there's a new person the media will ride on and kids will start buying that, he'll be needing it.

My friend Trish brought over a tape she made that had African Reggae on it. We were in hysterics as I translated the lyrics for her. Naturally, I went right out and bought Unbehagen (Misbehaved) for myself.Pretty soon, I found my way back to her earlier work, Nina Hagen Band. When I even think of Naturtr?ne, and that whole Wagnerian aria she pulled off - I still get chills. Then she smacks you down with her cover of \\"My Way\\".Magnificently irreverant, hopelessly unclassifiable. Hagen is unique, even amongst Punkers. Best of all, if you're an aging yuppie, you get really really strange looks from people when you're slamming away in your BMW to \\"Fall in Love Mit Mir\\".Heh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin Rocks!!","review":"This thing is so light and so easy to use, I am so happy I have it!!!

I'm a cyclist and it allowed me to listen to hours of music with such a small player I could put in a pocket or hang around my neck.However, after about 6-months of use of about 3-4x's/week, the on/off/forward button broke on it. Since there are only two buttons on it (which is something I really liked) I can't turn it on. I wasn't too upset because I thought I could get it repaired. Well, the (800#) you call for customer service is not working. So I tried the online repair which I received an e-mail back, but never a follow-up on how to get it repaired. So now I have this great looking mp3 player that is useless.I wouldn't recommend this product, until Virgin gets their customer service worked out. You will need them at some point in the future when the battery wears out and they need to replace it, because the instructions say it can't be replaced by the consumer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"There are better work out dvds.

Basically it follows the same pattern as the other two. She tells you where she is from, how she got her start in Playboy and what she wants to do in life. My biggest beef with this video is you had to wait almost twenty minutes before you got to see with her clothes off in a scene. I wished they show more of her and less of the people they interviewed.

Would you give up on them in the long run and take the easy route, or would you do everything in your being to save them? That is the question that is posed in this wonderful film adaptation of the book \\"Marathon\\" by Richard Harties. If you love classic cinema you will love this film as I do. The trailers that come before the film are not indicative of the film itself. In fact they are no where near the quality and cinematic value of the film they accompany.

The only issue we have with it is that the handle is made up of three pieces put together.

If you are familiar with this ruse, this book is nothing new.It certainly is interesting to read; especially if you already know the true purpose for books such as these. I should know. I was born a Muslim and lived as one in Syria for 40 years. I was once one of the individuals who used such materials as these to convert non-Muslims.

You know that feeling that something is missing in your life, no matter how much you do and how busy you keep yourself? You just know something is missing but you don't know what it is exactly? You can actually FEEL that you are filling up a place in your heart that has been dry for so long! Go see it! See if I'm right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie makes you want to be a better person!","review":"I had not heard of the movie before, but I saw it yesterday and it was awesome!

My Grandmother may have given it the best endorsement, saying \\"every family should watch this\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie!!","review":"This movie is great! It provides awesome lessons for fathers and husbands on how to be a father and how to relate to family and friends. It presents realistic challenges which can be overcome when a man stands as God intended him to be. It's a movie that men, whether Christian or not, can identify with and the spiritual lessons in there are priceless. I'd advise all men and women to get a copy on dvd, it's not a movie you should watch only once! It needs to be watched over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous DVD Review","review":"Every DVD that this church has produced has been tremendous. Courageous is a must see DVD for the entire family. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another one for the library!","review":"Simply fantastic!

This movie plays on every emotion...make sure you take a box of Kleenex. Every man should see this movie, really puts emphasis on the important role of a Father. Every woman should drag their Husband, Son or Father to this movie. We forget in the hustle and bustle of everyday life the important role we each play in the lives of others. This movie touches you spiritually. Shows how we complicate our lives with \\"stuff\\" and how simple life really is and by keeping God at the center of your life, how good can overcome evil. Can't wait until it comes out in video...would make an excellent Father's Day gift for a loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Christian Movie that Celebrates Fatherhood","review":"Better than \\"Facing the Giants\\" and \\"Fire Proof,\\" this movie is the best of the three. There are some truly great moments in this movie, although it can be a little preachy at moments. In world that pretends that fatherhood is unimportant, this movie celebrates it and encourages men to fulfill their God designed role. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie you'll watch over and over again","review":"Courageous is a powerful movie. It has action and plenty of tender moments. The acting at times is a little weak. Many of these folks are not professional actors. By the time you finish watching the movie, that aspect is easily overlooked by the powerful message. This movie urges everyone to take necessary action. There is a strong religious message, not encouraging religion, but rather encouraging fathers to take their role seriously in the family.As the writer of a book coming out in 2013 about the breakdown in the family unit, I've seen the studies that show the negative impact of divorce and high conflict family relationships. This movie puts emphasis on the role of the father in the family. Anyone man can be a dad, but it takes courage to be a good father. This movie is powerful enough to move men to be better fathers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"Enjoyed this family oriented film, definitely carries a good message in this one. It probably is not for everybody since it does lean towards religion and all, but a little religion never hurt nobody...besides there is a great message and a easy family watch. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"There are many movies on the market today...but few that have the value that this movie has. This is a well written movie. The cast has done an excellent job at getting an extremely important message to all who invest the time to view it. Yes, to watch this movie is a wise investment of your time. Fathers/dads, this will encourage you to be active in the high calling you have in regards to your family. The whole family will enjoy this one. Take the time to watch it a couple times. Have a great day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I recommend it to everyone!!! My family and I have watched it over and over again. Great movie!! Everyone needs to watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie.","review":"My wife and I enjoyed this movie, but must admit it falls short compared to Fireproof. Flywheel and Facing The Giants are also worth watching as well. We both wait with bated breath on their next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding movie on Fatherhood","review":"CourageousAfter viewing \\"Courageous\\" at the theatre, we ordered copies for ourselves and the men in our lives. The film depicts fathers in realistic situations, with the struggles and challenges life presents. It shows the need our world has for strong, faith-filled, dedicated fathers to help children grow into responsible adults. Also confirms the value of the support found in the Body of Christ to live the life of holiness we are all called to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, a much needed film for today!!!","review":"This movie is a great movie for a man to get back to being a \\"real man\\". Its also a great family movie for all, and it will touch you in your inner soul. In my opinion one of the best films I've saw in a long while. This will make you think about whats important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winning movie!","review":"I bought this movie as a surprise for my sweet husband. We've purchased, watched, and been deeply touched by all Alex Kendrick's movies. If all Christians would be so in tune to God and what He wants for us and of us, our world would be so much stronger. This film was touching, strong, awakening, and loving - just like our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ who are our \\"role models\\" in all things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Great movie. Made me want to do better as a father. This movie showed life is short and family is very important next to God. This movie is a must for fathers. More fathers need to spend time with their families. The family is so important to God and America."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is really important?","review":"This movie centers around the main theme of Jesus Christ first and then family second. I like the way the movie set the scene for the importance of family and to make every day count. Some parts of the movie were a little corny but that is what happens when non-movie maker put together a movie and that is why I gave it a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is, by far, one of the best movies ever made. It is so heartfelt, genuine and is an excellent display of God's love for us. It kept my attention and my expectation during the movie. And, to see men express such conviction and love for God is beautiful. Definitely one of my top movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous","review":"This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It is about fatherhood and has religious overtones. This movie will make you cry. It brought tears to my eyes. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Courageous is definitely a wonderful movie to watch. The actors were absolutely perfectly selected, however, I am familiar with a couple of the actors one of which appeared in the movie Fireproof. One of the reasons I enjoyed the movie so much is because I feel it takes a courageous man to be a good husband and father today. It is very challenging for a man to be the head of the household in today's society. Men have to maintain his family financially, spiritually and morally and still have to go out and support his family. I rate this movie an A+ and recommend it for families and church socials."},{"rating":"2","title":"courageous","review":"totally fantastic!!!!! when you find Jesus Christ you have life!! how i pray for more people to watch movies like this one and fireproof,,God Bless"},{"rating":"2","title":"myerhaven2","review":"This movie is a great Christian family movie that is heart warming as well as motivating to all Dads (including myself) that may need to evaluate the time and quality of time, they are spending with their family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Christian movie that makes you think","review":"With all the things going on in the world today movies like this are needed.

This movie is for everyone all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO!!! NOT AGAIN!!!","review":"Oh Swell! Another one of these badly acted, poorly written pieces of Christian propaganda. This tripe is an insult to filmmaking in general, and to anyone with a discerning mind. They show this junk in churches for free because no one in their right mind would pay to watch anything with the Kendrick name on it. It's sad to think that they manage to find money to make this drivel, and worse that there are braindead religious puppets who claim that it is \\"great filmmaking.\\" It is my sincere hope that these rank amateurs never waste another moment of celluloid time on feces like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ohhhh Brother......","review":"Sat down to watch what I thought was a good police movie and instead was made to feel what an inferior father I was because I didn't sign a piece of paper, frame it and hang it on a wall.I knew something was up with this movie when I see cops sitting around an outdoor table at a b-b-q and no one's got a beer in their hand. A cop, without a beer? Yea, that's realistic.And no cursing? Puleeeeeezzzzze.Hey, if you need to get together with your buddies and have a ceremony and sign a piece of paper to be a good father, then I say, \\"whatever it takes\\".

And frankly I want my money back Amazon! Yes,I should of read the reviews first as I did not realize this was a christian movie. My husband and I could not even finish watching it. The acting was awful and the movie was slow. It seemed as though they put every race into their stereotypical role and the white man was there to save them. I honestly felt they threw in a black cop as not to seem racist. It was horrible, just horrible. Do not rent this movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If youre gay stay away!","review":"Wow. Saw this with my bf just to hoping to see Kirk Cameron with his shirt off and hes not even in it! Not only that but all of these cops are completely clothed for the entire movie.

It tells of relationships between fathers and their children. A man's role as a father and how to take that role seriously. Also how to be accountable to others for how you live your life. The relationship of these men with each other and how they helped, supported and prayed for each was amazing. I would highly recommend this movie for all to see. A family oriented movie.

I honestly wasn't convinced initially by the trailer I saw, and probably would have passed it up were it not for the fact that I wanted to support these guys because I have appreciated all of their other movies, and I figured that even if this one fell a bit flat, I still wanted to support their work. Well, turns out this is, in my opinion, their most powerful movie yet. If you go into viewing the movie as a critic, you will undoubtedly come up with finding all kinds of flaws. But if you go to receive, with an open heart and mind to God, this can be life changing, as it was for me, especially if you read The Resolution afterward! (also by the Kendricks, with Randy Alcorn). (By the way, if you want confirmation of what I'm saying here by numbers, you need go no further than Rotten Tomatoes, which currently has \\"the critics'\\" score at 37%, as opposed to 93% for the viewing population as a whole)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS MOVIE","review":"I absolutely love this film!

I thought that I was in for a cop movie based on the title, the description and the trailer. Instead I got 2 hours of very fundamental Christian feel good and mediocre preaching. I don't mind preaching in church. I don't mind preaching on TV or in the movies BUT you should not pretend that this is a movie about the police or about Courage. Do not buy this, rent it or watch it unless you want a two hour simplistic sermon. It was so bad, and I felt so taken advantage of that I have written a complaint to the airline. If it is religious advertising it should be advertised as such. I would be even more offended if I were not Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not a feature film, it is a sermon","review":"I was totally misled by the high ratings on amazon, and I did not read enough about the film to know what I was heading into.

Alex Kendrick writing was sensational, emotional-gripping, and spiritual moving with a hint of action, family values, and comedy with drama all in one package. He gave just enough dose where you laughed, you cried, and you smiled, or tugging at your heart but you learned the most important value: men to rise to their rightful place as the Bible commands them. More importantly, others to hold them accountable and to enrich these values in their children, and other children who may have lost a parent or doesn't have a guardian at all. Thank you! I even encouraged my father to watch it and make such a vow unto God.

Well done with a powerful message!!","review":"Well worth watching over and over again. A message that is much needed for our time. You won't regret the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous - an AWESOME movie!","review":"This was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. I would recommend this movie to all adults not just men. It's very easy to get caught up in day to day living and this movie really makes you think about making children and family a priority. I can't wait for the movie to be available to purchase. I want to buy a copy for my sons and brothers. The movie is inspiring and encouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous","review":"A wholesome Christian movie showing some very realistic stresses individuals and families often confront without much support or self-awareness. It encourages one to become emotionally mature in the Christian faith and to be supportive of others who have not matured from a born in selfishness to a mature caring supportive human who gets pleasure out of helping others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I saw this movie with my husband and my two sons (one adult and one teenager). We all love it. It represent the Christian values that our society should cherish. It brought me to tears. Definitely shows how fatherhood should look like. Wow!... and trust and honesty were shown very clear. Every young teenager should see it and we parents should talk more about fatherhood to our boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous","review":"We saw this movie at the theater and it was excellent plus!! We have watched it again since we got it and are grateful to have it. Great movie!! Thanks! God bless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fenominal Movie!!!","review":"Great movie!Movie is about a group of policemen who decide they don't want to be just \\"good enough\\" fathers anymore. They make a pact and agree to become better fathers and examples to their families.Such an emotional roller coaster! Really really funny moments, but also very very sad moments. Very gospel-based. Great message for families, esp. for fathers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is how real men should interact with their families....especially children. Inspirational story of how change can benefit a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story line","review":"This DVD is very good for the entire family. It moves right along in the story line and has excellent Christian values that we all need to be reminded of periodically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous","review":"This was an excellent movie and I enjoyed it. I recommend it for anyone to order. Also it was mailed and came quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another step of improvement","review":"Courageous builds on the production team's previous titles, reducing the cringe inducing dialogue or videography to almost none. While the targeted audience is obviously Christian evangelicals, it effectively draws the audience into the picture producing both emotional empathy (sometimes cheesy) as well as a call to action. Definitely the best explicitly Christian film to-date, and probably the first which could start to compete with hollywood-made movies in terms of quality. I'm giving it 5-stars because I consider it best-in-class, and a significant technical improvement over films like Fireproof and Facing the Giants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men it's time to be men of god.","review":"To every man out there it's hard being a man in today's world with pornography,the world telling men that we are not important in our marriages, well we are! Men love and cherish the family that god In-trusted you, be involved in your children's lives, discipline them, tell them that living a godly life is important and that Jesus Christ is God, this is the truth men live your lives to please him and only him. And one more thing, love and respect your bride and tell her that she is beautiful and special and that god blessed you with her, god bless you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie Courageous","review":"With all that is going on in the world this is a must see movie, especially if you are a dad.

Everyone should see it! Excellent story line and acting. Everyone of their movies gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My whole family was engaged","review":"I'm the type of mom who will 'lure' her family into watching something wholesome and good, otherwise they would all resist my good intentions. I watched this movie with my husband first, who actually tear'd up towards the end - wow, never saw that coming! I watched again with my 16 year old daughter, and she loved it, and then again with my 18 year old daughter, the one I had to coerce the most to watch it. Luckily, the opening scene completely sucks you in, after that, the movie easily keeps you engaged. LOTS of great messages in here, my goodness. If only every home around the globe could watch this. An excellent message, fitting for our times of dual-income homes and busy schedules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I was very impressed with this movie. It is a must see for Husbands and Fathers!

This movie is one in a series of movies made by a church (so a lot of the actors are the same): Fireproof, Flywheel and Facing the Giants. This movie is very interesting and has a life changing message, to boot. It's cool to see the quality of their movies get better with each new release. I would recommend this movie to anyone with sound moral values. This one is definitely family friendly and enjoyable. Summarry: So if you enjoy good wholesome fun, this one's for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie.","review":"This movie was great. The story was great and real and it was made so anyone can relate. The actor was decent but not like a normal Hollywood film. You will enjoy this movie for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents Don't Miss This One","review":"My husband and I just watched \\"Courageous\\" and loved it. It is a must for parents to see. There is a reason that it takes two to create a child and this movie shows that it takes two to raise a child. Buying copies for each of my children, who have children of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie every father needs to see.","review":"So many children are in desperate need of their father's love. But the only thing for them are the streets with violence and filthy gangs. The message is really awakening, society needs fathers who are role models for their children. No reforms or legislation could solve this issue; only godly fathers who wake up every morning with the commitment to grow spiritual beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Film !!!!!!","review":"This is an excellent film. I really enjoyed it. The story is amazing, the acting is amazing, etc. Jeremy Sumpter is an excellent actor and this film really lets him shine. Danny Glover's directing is right on and enjoyable. I highly recommend this movie for everyone of all ages. See it you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"White men are bad news???","review":"The movie was a sweet story about adorable young white boy growing up in rural NV in 1960. In this story his doctor dad is good for nothing, selfish liar. There is a nasty good for nothing, lowlife, drunken bar regular (who incidently is a white guy). The only other white guys I recall having more than one sentence in the movie (and it may have been collectively) were the film makers who (of course) looked and sounded in general to be a disagreeable lot.The boy spends his summer in a saloon with two male role models from which he gains wisdom and maturity. One a likeable, not overly intellegent Native American with a big heart. The other, the star of the show, portrayed as a very wise, sensitive and caring African-American man who helps the boy through the rough patches.What was the message this movie is really trying to convey?It seemed pretty thinly vailed to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"False introduction","review":"I bought this movie because of Meng Fei, however, he is not in the movie at all. Any way, it is a very bad movie. It is not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wierd.","review":"Instead of relaxing piano music, this cd had selections with wierd musical soundson it with the piano music. I guess he tried to mix \\"new age\\" into his selections,but I didn't care for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful? Fantastic!","review":"Paul's new cd titled \\"Faithful\\" is amazing! It strays a bit from the Paul we have come to know and love. Yet, at the same time he doesn't disappoint us at all. He goes back to the classics in Scarbourough Fair and keeps us fascinated with his title track Faithful. The emotion and feelings he puts into each work is felt as you get lost in the music. His \\"normal\\" music takes each of us a journey of emotion, leaving you better than when he found you. His new cd takes you to the same place, but on a different road. He has an amazing talent for touching each one of us. This new cd, without you realizing it, takes you a thought provoking trip inside yourself. A must have for any piano lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply LOVE this album!","review":"I think this is Pauls best work. I love the Hymns music as well but this I can listen to anytime. It takes my mind away into memories of the past, and dreams of the future. I can spend hours with this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"First time to enjoy his music, and am glad I picked this album to experience Paul Cardall. It's worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faithful","review":"I have mixed feelings regarding this artist. Some of the songs were enjoyable and filled me with serene emotions; while other songs I didn't care for. It wasn't what I expected; not sure how to describe other than I was mildly disappointed that I purchase this particular CD by Paul Cardall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music!","review":"If you enjoy beautiful, relaxing piano music, you will enjoy this CD. I especially like the pieces with cello accompaniment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but please preview for sensitive kids","review":"This book is beautiful, the illustrations are soft and dark and gorgeous. The seasons come alive through the poetic language and the lovely pictures used to describe each of the thirteen moons. The story ends with the boy grown an old man passing on the moonstick tradition to his grandson. One of the thirteen moons is the \\"moon of the hairless calves\\" and the book describes the sadness the boy feels when pregnant buffalo are killed and their hairless buffalo fetuses are found during the butchering. While the picture for this moon fortunately does not show this and then text acknowledges the sadness you should judge whether or not this is something your child is ready to think about. I love the overall message of change coming and then coming again, it is very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well...........but not any more","review":"I received this at christmas, it made good stiches, but a few weeks ago it would stop making stiches, I will be buying a more expensive machine, if I were you, you should not buy this and spend a little more on a good machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dressmaker II .... Waste of time and money","review":"Horrible little machine. Skips stitches, can't controll tension, repeatedly broke thread (no matter what quality used), makes strange noises. To make matters worse, no availability of customer service. No response to emails or phone calls. I got it to just do some straight edge sewing and hemming. Couldn't even do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Like in many of the other reviews i have had the same problems. Crooked stitching, broken thread every time i tried to correct the stitching, can not sew many types of thick or thin fabric, setting are very fast when plugged in and way to slow when operating on new batteries. Was using it to sew simple little dolls but it broke after maybe 5 uses and cannot get a replacement like promised with warrant when i purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks easily","review":"This sewing machine broke within a couple of uses. I probably worked less than 6 hours on it before it stopped working. It comes with very clear directions for many issues but the troubleshooting steps did not help me to fix the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was suppose to be getting this sewing machine as an early xmas present. I'n new to sewing and don't have a lot of storage so it was the perfect gift. However, like another review while sewing for the first time after about a half hour the tension knob popped out and then every few minutes after that continued to pop out. Then while changing the bobbin something must have happened because it did not sticht right after that even though I followed the directions(which are useless)and consulted veteran sewers. My mother, who bought it for me was disappointed and isn't sure if she can even return it. However, I did sew most of a large blanket and hem one leg of a pant before it no longer worked. I'd go the next step up if possible"},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS TOO FRAGILE","review":"Thinking its small & light in weight, I purchased the product.But later I discovered the other unmentioned qualities.It cant do stitches on the clothes that are a little thick,so forget about using it on Denim jeans.While stitching, the threades get tangled every often.And entangling it will be equal to tearing your cloth apart because there are no ways out to have any access into the inside mechanism of the machine.Neither can one see inside in order to entangle the knots that have been caused inside.So please dont waste your money in order to save it.Its good for kids who wish to stitch frocks for their dolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"I travel in a motorhome and needed something small that would store easily. This machine was perfect for that. I don't do a lot of sewing, but mostly mending. I have mended several items with the dressmake and was very pleased with its operation and the finished product. I am very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I purchased three of these machines for my children, ages 6, 8, and 10 for Christmas. It was a very sad thing to put them together and have them sew crooked everytime and not backstitch. My children were frustrated and I was disappointed. I think that Euro puts out a fair product in the larger machine. The smaller one was a poor machine to say the least and a waste of my time and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective or just not a good product?","review":"I had such a terrible time with mine, I am returning it. The thread would not stay threaded right no matter what I did. But the biggest problem was that the screw holding in the needle will not hold it in. It won't tighten enough to keep in the needle. So I kept fixing it and it kept falling out. I struggled with this machine for almost an hour over multiple issues. Finally I am giving up. I will stick to my good old Singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRESSMAKER II SEWING CENTER","review":"i bought the Dressmaker II for my grandchild. It seems the best for a beginner. Oh, my goodness, what a terrible machine. It's loud--very loud, plus, no child would ever be able to get this machine threaded; the tension adjustment is almost non-existant; and the machine is way too lightweight. There is no part of this machine that is good for any age. I couldn't even, in good conscience, give it or sell it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP N DOESNT WORK!","review":"This time is cheaply made! I guess you get what u pay for. It is currently sitting in the box for return, It doesn't work the bobbin was all messed up! I am very disappointed I thought this would be good but I was WRONG!!! Dont waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This machine is not worth buying, it is horrible!.","review":"This machine is not worth buying, it is horrible!. Yeah it does stich but not for any use. I am not able to change the bobbin. Instruction manual is in spanish, I have to learn spanish to read that!. Please DO NOT BUY IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't expect much, but was still let down","review":"I wasn't planning on using this to make clothes or anything, I wanted something cheap and basic and thought this might be good enough. False. I'm just trying to use it right now to make an iPod case out of a tie, something small that shouldn't take much time, and I cannot even finish this stupid 3 inch seam I am trying to sew. The sewing is completely erratic (both with and without the foot petal, but it's better with), not doing anything at all and then speeding ahead incredibly quickly and unexpectedly, ruining my seam. Not to mention the thread breaking, getting tangled, coming out (there's a reason actual sewing machines have the needle hole facing front and back, not left and right). Worst purchase ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great simple sewing machine","review":"This one is very simple and easy to use. It's small. So I put the box on my bookshelf. It doesn't have the funcy stitches, but less than $30, no complains!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this machine!","review":"This machine is horrible! Can't even make simple projects without having multiple problems. Instructions are useless too. Buy a nicer machine and save yourself the hassle and fustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"For basic sewing or for kids","review":"I could pretty much use this sewing machine for basic stuff..It was obvious that thicker fabric, like denim, wouldn't work well with this machine, and I was right. The really bad thing about it was defintely the fact that the thread was not of good quality, it gets tangled around 40-50% of the time, and there is no way of going \\"inside\\" the machine.I bought the dressmaker thinking I was taking an easy way out and saving a couple of bucks...But to be honest, this is for quick fixs and/or kids. If you have a kid just starting out, then this is for them. If have anything simple to fix, with straight stitching, this is also for you. ANYONE ELSE: SAVE YOUR MONEY and put it towards a sewing machine that'll last long, and that will do the work right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Euro-Pro 1100 The New Dressmaker","review":"I AM NOT A KID - IN MY MID TWENTIES AND NEWLY MARRIED.Great little machine. I live in an apartment and I am in need of as much space as I can conserve. This little machine is powerful, compact and does the job of a big machine. I never sewed before, so it took me some time to get up to speed - and this is the machine to do it on. I found that using better thread was very helpful as the threads that came with the machine were not for all sewing jobs. I would recommend getting universal needles to use also. Best suggestion I can give is to be patient and buy a beginner's sewing book for helpful hints. However, I give this little and powerful machine a thums up - I made a slip cover for my sofa and covers for my dining set chairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little piece","review":"I Just got the machine (bought it cos I was getting it cheap :). Was really surprised to find the machine was so small and featherlight, making the machine move around the table a little bit while stitching. (If it was slightly more heavier and stable, I would have given it 5 starts). As others have pointed out, the threads that come with it are not of good quality. The built in light goes dim as soon as the machine starts. Other than these three negatives it works perfectly fine on the adapter that came with it. Havent tested it on batteries as i dont intend to use it on batteries. I am using a sewing machine for the first time and am really pleased with the product for the price I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Decision","review":"I also bought this because of the low price, portability, and accessories. The product description seemed to make it seem as if it would sew properly, when in fact, it barely sews at all. It is so lightweight, that it literally moves all over the table when running, due to the vibration. The stitches are inconsistent, because the tension is perpetually off and the thread breaks often. All of this, combined with the fact that the machine is so TINY that you can't sew any fabric of any size at all...I am so upset over purchasing this product, but I can't send it back since I've used it.NO STARS. DON'T BUY THIS SEWING MACHINE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST Read for Anyone in Management","review":"I bought this book on second thought because I was also buying \\"Leading Change\\" by Kotter. However, I picked up this book and could not put it down. As a long-time leader, this book validates much of what I already know and do. However, it also brings a lot of insight into the differences between leadership and management. The author really analyzes the complexity and interdependency and interrelationships that are faced by, and must be overcome or managed by leaders and managers. I liked what and how Kotter says it in this book that I bought one for each of my managers (I'm a CEO). I am hoping that this easy-to-read, and understandable book brings a lot of insight to them. I highly recommend this book to all current leaders and managers, and anyone hoping to go into leadership or management or both."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 6-pack of Kotter articles","review":"In the reviews below, only Godfrey notices that this book is simply a collection of 6 previously published Harvard Business Review articles (1979-1997). As such, the book is a handy one-stop shop of Kotter's leadership and management writings over the years, and these articles contain nothing new. One might have wished for Kotter's current commentary on each of the individual articles.His original contribution to this volume is the first chapter, where he retroactively imposes order on and draws lessons from the earlier works. Overall, this book is a useful compendium of Kotter's ideas from the past 30 years for those who are unfamiliar with his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost completely non-informative","review":"This book contains John Kotter's usual dose of platitudes and blindingly obvious insights. Anyone that gets anything useful out of this book is far too dumb to lead anything at all, except perhaps a hollow and meaningless life.How he has gotten the world to swallow this nonsense book after book, each one a rehash of his previous mishmash of meaningless business speak (\\"energizing your employees\\") and vague, unfollowable axioms about, for example, \\"having vision,\\" is beyond me. But perhaps I just haven't achieved my full alignment potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"not enough in depth and insider information. the cd was amateurish and weak. Pretty much a rip-off"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY THE BEST GUIDE!!!!!!!","review":"A very straightforward, well-organized and informative guide. Will really help you make a good decision about which schools to apply to. I also bought The MFA Handbook by Tom Kealey and found it helpful in certain ways, but really lacking in others. This one is SO MUCH BETTER. Not biased or unreliable like Kealey's guide. Just straightforward information."},{"rating":"1","title":"General Information","review":"I was disappointed with Amy Holman's An Insiders Guide To Creative Writing Programs. Where is the inside information? The book is basically a list of schools and programs, each listing containing non-critical information gleaned from web sites. There are no critical assessments here regarding funding, admissions, etc., which tends to equalize and generalize each entry leaving me unable to point myself in any direction. I bought Tom Kealey''s Creative Writing MFA Handbook at the same time (five stars) and love it. If you have your own list, Kealey's book, the internet and some self direction you don't need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be better if it was sold as advertised","review":"The book is a very decent reference but it is very limited. The book description even states there are only 80 reviews total in the book and that includes universities, colonies and international programs. What sold me on the book was the CD that expanded the reviews to include over 300 programs. Well, the CD doesn't work. Amazon has replaced my original book/cd and the second one doesn't work either. There are three other reviews of this book that say the same thing. THE CD DOESN'T WORK. It is false advertising and the book/cd should be recalled by the publisher. If you have also bought this defective product send an email to Amazon to put pressure on the publisher to fix the problem. If you haven't bought it, DON'T until the publisher fixes the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL","review":"This is the best purchase I made all summer. Two people from my writers group recommended it to me and I have been recommending it to everyone I know who is either in an M.F.A. Program or applying next year. The title makes it seem like it's only for people who are thinking about applying to graduate school, but it's equally valuable for people who are there now or even people who have graduated. I will probably use this guide as a resource for the next ten years of my life. The information on writing colonies and residencies alone is worth the money. Whether you're a poet, fiction writer, or non-fiction writer, you'll wonder how you ever got along without it. An essential guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"I bought this book after reading the positive reviews on the site. I was very disappointed by the MFA listings. I looked to this book to give me something other than what I could find on a quick website search of the college. Financial aid, among other things, is one especially murky topic that is hard to find out about quickly. I assumed that buying this book would give me information I'd otherwise have to look long and hard to find. Well, in the case of the MFA section at least, that isn't the case. The stuff that's hard to find on the website, is the stuff that's missing from the book! I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some highlights, but Skynyrd can't match old glory","review":"As a huge fan of the original Skynyrd, I was excited and impressed with the 1987 Tribute reunion tour featuring 5 former members, with Johnny Van Zant (Ronnie's younger brother) and a new 3rd guitarist (original guitarist Ed King who left the band in 1974 even rejoined). In concert, Johnny sounded and even looked the part of his older brother Ronnie. The band seemed earily like the original.Unfortunately, this album doesn't match the old glory or the heights of the 87 tour. The guitars don't sound as fresh (much thicker, crunchier tone) and Johnny sounds too redneck. Pure and Simply is the highlight of the album, and while the rest are certainly listenable, nothing stands out. Unlike the Allman Brothers Band which has put some of the best material of their career in the 90s, Skynyrd has not matched their previous magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Stale","review":"This reunited version of Lynyrd Skynyrd sounds too stale. Each song is delivered in the same angry tone and key. One guitar solo sounds like the rest. And the back up vocals by the new Honkettes are overutilized. Smokestack Lightning and Pure And Simple are two excellent songs. A few of the others aren't bad either. But its very annoying to listen to this CD in one sitting as it really all sounds the same halfway through the disc. Purchase Street Survivors or Second Helping for real classic Skynyrd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy \\"Per-Nounced\\" instead","review":"This album is the same \\"New Skynyrd\\" that just doesnt sound good. Theres only two original members left to the band, the new Skynyrd is just a group of wanna be's that joined onto a really cool band that has a good reputation. Johnny Van Zandt is trying to act way to redneck in this album, and most of all, there is just nothing that stands out, it's all just the same old boring tunes. Buy a classic albums instead, like \\"Per-Nounced\\", \\"Second Helping\\", or \\"Street Survivors\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this online","review":"As with all products bought online, there is a chance that it does not fit. It was stated this is was standard size but it did not it my car steering wheel. It might of been a manufacturer defect, the product broke during installation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remy Rocks","review":"Since Remy Zero is one of my favorite bands, I know that this review is a tad bit biased. If you like indie rock or in other words, good music, you'll like this cd. It's fun and I never get tired of it, but that's probably because it's not on the radio every 3 minutes. I love bands that a lot of people aren't in to but I wish everyone was into this because they really deserve the fan base. Every track is great so I don't really have a favorite, although \\"Save Me\\" drew me in (especially since I watch Smallville). I also recommend Phantom Planet, Caedmon's Call, Bebo Norman, Jude, Pete Yorn, and John Mayer (among about a billion other great bands including Dave Matthews)."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful and passionate...","review":"the title instrumental track sets a mysterious tone, and Glorious #1 feeds off this energy, providing a powerful punch. This album soars on a brand of rock music that remy zero have perfected and seemingly patented, because nothing else matches it. There are the more mellow tracks, such as \\"Belong\\" and \\"Perfect Memory,\\" but the lyrical passion in these songs keeps the ear very interested. This is an album with no filler. Every track is energetic and powerful. Remy Zero does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best modern rock band!","review":"This is the best example of well-written modern pop/rock I have ever heard. From the moment I slipped this disc into my CD player, I could tell that I had found something special. The title (The Golden Hum) perfectly sums up the feeling I came away with. This band is from Birmingham, AL, and it's quite refreshing to find a band with such well-conceived rock music, coming from the south. This album, produced by Jack Joseph Puig, is like the best of Smashing Pumpkins, Pink Floyd, Queen, and U2 all wrapped into one very original package. I have listened to this disc front to back hundreds of times and I never get tired of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock at its best!","review":"Although this is my first album from Remy Zero, I think its safe to say they are an incredible band. This is one of those albums that doubles itself in general quality with each listen, therefore first impressions are hardly accurate here. From the opening track \\"Glorious # 1\\", which really gets the albums general flow going with catchy lines such as \\"My prints all over the smoking gun\\", into the more emmotional crafts such as \\"Belong\\", \\"The Golden Hum\\" will undoubtedly find its way into your collection. I recomend this to all music lovers; it is an album diverse in variety and vocal/lyrical talent. Go get it, you will not regret it- its rock at its best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best act in rock today!","review":"Remy Zero's third outing, The Golden Hum, is their first album with a major record label. As expected, it has a bit more of a radio friendly sound than Villa Elaine. Much to my surprise, though, the album is every bit as good as Villa Elaine while going in a new musical direction. Upon listening to the album a few times, you'll really catch the depth and the artistry of the songs. Like Villa Elaine, there is no filler material on this cd. This album is very highly recommended. This is easily my favorite album of this year. These guys may be the best act in rock today."},{"rating":"2","title":"2001 has finally arrived","review":"Remy Zero is very straight forward on their approach: layer guitars and sing from the heart. THE GOLDEN HUM is so wholesome and pure America clearly has an answer to the Radiohead cult across the Atlantic.Not since Janes Addiction has a blend of rock guitar and spiraling vocals worked so well where you drop pretentions and lose yourself in the music. You take their trip toward things that are real and sacred.THE GOLDEN HUM is brilliantly produced and linear, not some cryptic art rock that doesnt stand up like some others.... Buy this record, see them live, and save your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing","review":"I had heard \\"save me\\" on smallville and was curious about how the rest of the song sounded. When i downloaded the song i was impressed, and after listening i went out to buy the album. The CD was simply amazing. Every song makes you want to hear it again and the sounds the band produce are unbelievable. My favorite songs from it are; \\"bitter\\", \\"glorius #1\\", and \\"over the rails and hollywood high\\". I strongly urge you to buy the CD, for you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the year\`s best","review":"pick up this album! cinjun\`s vocals are spectacular and the rest of the boys are in top form as well. the album has the most amazing undercurrent that gently sucks you in. the more you listen, the more you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"Emotionless and shallow, and not nearly as interesting as their other albums.

Save Me is stand out track from Smallville series & they featured at end of last episode in season 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Hum","review":"First heard \\"Somebody Save Me\\" on the TV series, \\"Smallville.\\" I really liked the song and just had to find it. I had never heard of Remy Zero before, but I was pleasantly surprised when I received the cd \\"Golden Hum.\\" Alot of their music reminds me of U2, so if you like them, you will probably like Remy Zero. I was also pleasantly surprised with the price I paid for it! I received the CD very quickly and am overall very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contentment","review":"Remy Zero's third release The Golden Hum begins with an instrumental, an overture intended to set the tone for what's to come. Yet the instrumental is such limp doodling it belies the muscular, shape-shifting songs to follow. There are duds (\\"Out/In\\", particularly), but they're less detrimental than those on the fractured Villa Elaine. The Golden Hum is a metaphor for contentment - what crazy things we do to get it and how easily we overlook it when it's in our grasp. In \\"Glorious\\", a couple who \\"don't have to be lovers\\" are just happy to be in each other's presence. \\"Perfect Memory\\" is about how we bathe the pieces of past disappointments in the glow of nostalgia. \\"Belong\\", the simplest and best track here, is a mid-tempo shuffle that's both a lament for the end of the affair and an evocation of what we most seek in a partner: a sense of being home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remy's Best Album yet","review":"After a debut with only 1 good song (Temenos) and a good album after that with Villa Elaine, Remy Zero has a better, more productive sound. But what's best is that this is a good album, not a CD with a couple singles and bad music surrounding them. If you liked the previous album, I'd figure you'll like this one, too. For those of you that haven't heard much of Remy or are curious, a lot of people who'll buy this album probably have Radiohead, Coldplay, or Travis in their CD player. But, hey, I took a chance and bought Villa Elaine not knowing any songs, and I really enjoyed it. So, put down System Of A Down or Slipknot and buy a CD with real music, not incessant noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE AWARD FOR MOST ORIGINAL SOUND GOES TO REMY ZERO","review":"Yes they have been compared to u2, r.e.m., live, and bowie? Well any way, musically, they resemble none of the above! That's right, REMY ZERO has a sound all their own. THE GOLDEN HUM is one of a kind great rock music! With original sounding music and a variety of different sounds at that. All of the songs are good, but 4 of them , I would consider to be great! SAVE ME, one of my all-time favorites, PERFECT MEMORY, one of the most beautiful ballads ever written!, BITTER and OUT IN, both great alternative rock songs! REMY ZERO in one word are awesome, and have become a personal favorite of mine! If you like great sounding, original rock music, THE GOLDEN HUM by REMY ZERO is a must have record, and one of the very best of 2001, and in my opinion EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute CRAP","review":"This had a lot of decieving reviews.

The hat is poor quality like it was meant for a child's Halloween costume, it doesn't fit an adult head, and is sewn funny so that the tip flops down and to the side in a weird way. It is deep black instead of dark grey like the original hat, and doesn't look like this photo at all. It is made of rather cheap-looking material and has that \\"costumey\\" look about it- not authentic looking at all. I feel like this was false advertising and I hope they will let me send it back...if not, Amazon will get an earful.

They seem quite unoriginal -- they mostly sound like late Pavement, except when they sound like Stereolab. Still, this is really fine unoriginal music; good production, quality songs, neat atmosphere. I'll look for this band's other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than their last by far","review":"This sounded pretty much the way I expected - retro-pop littered with ornate horn sections and the odd bit of surf-style guitar. Beulah are the typical indie band who have five-album careers without changing their sound too much. The production is much more refined here; this is one crisp and pristine cd. I like the distinct '60's West Coast' sound these songs evoke. The Beach Boys reference point many others have mentioned is not far off the mark. They have moved on from their patchy last record, which I found to be pretty annoying. There's more variety here and the lead singer's voice sounds much better. He's still got that nasal thing happening, except now it sounds like he can carry a tune. Beulah look to be on the verge of indie cult-status, but I'm not sure if that's a great thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"Beulah's new record is easily one of the best indie albums of the year. It builds upon their last two records by introducing more organic and complex elements hidden in subtle orchestrations and arrangements. It's a stunning effort, really. For those wanting a twee E6 record, you might wanna steer clear because this might be a little too heavy for you. All I can say is that I just finished listening to the new Mercury Rev, Spiritualized and Stereolab records, and I gotta tell ya, Beulah blows them all away.

There are other books that excel at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than the original","review":"This movie version was awesome! I feel like this actress really captured the role of Lolita. She reminded me a lot of what I was like when I was 12. It was less of a spoiled brat attitude than an attitude of a trapped girl yearning to escape. Humbert was awesome, too. Much less \\"slimy\\" and creepy that the original actor. He seemed like a normal guy who may attract young crushes. I love that this movie was much more in detail, it gave you a realistic idea of the types of abuse that Lolita was suffering/trying to escape from. I also enjoyed the ending much better, when Humbert is shooting the playwright. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful love story!","review":"This is a beautiful love story! He literally sacrificed his life for a few moments of ecstasy!He loved Lolita in the deepest and purest way. We are now obsessed with pedophiles and sexual predators but this movie is not that!! All you have to hear is the love theme when he first sees her to know his feelings best viewed on your iPhone in bed. This medium is more intimate than the wide screen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do justice to Nabokov's novel","review":"I must say, when I saw this film I felt like this did not do justice to Nabokov's Lolita. Most of the actors are not that great, with the exception of Jeremy Irons who makes a good Humbert. Our Lolita (Dominique Swain) is too old. When Humbert first meets Lolita in the novel she is 12 going on 13. Lolita realizes the power she has over Humbert and plays with him, so to say. I don't see that coming across here. In this movie, we know that Lolita and Humberts relationship is consentual, but most often, Swain makes Lolita seem like a whiney little brat. I did not like Melanie Griffath in the role of Charlotte Haze, the lonely widow desparate for Humberts affections. She doesn't come off with as much desparation and annoyance as she should. This film focusses too much on the sexual relations of Lo and Humbert. For example, when Mrs. Haze comes in after Lolita has skipped back to her room and asks Humbert, \\"is she keeping you up?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Film","review":"Fulfilling and erotic yet a feeling of undesirable controlled tension. A must for the drama love story geeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BAD IT GAVE ME A HEADACHE!","review":"They'll never cast this movie properly (not in the USA anyway). I don't know who is more ill-suited (or uncomfortable-looking, for that matter), Irons or the actress playing Lolita. An adaptation of V. Nabokov's brilliant book couldn't be more misconceived than this lead-footed & uninspired piece of soft-core eye candy. The 16 year old girl playing Lolita acts like a 40 year old imitating a coy child. This title of this film should have been FLAGRANT EXPLOITATION. It is WITLESS & STUPID & BORING."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving and Touching Experience","review":"I thought that this was a beautifully made movie. The unusual subject was handled with with grace and class. I wanted to hate Humbert, but I found myself feeling sorry for him. Kudos to the director!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely poor copy - misrepresented here.","review":"What they do not tell you when you purchase this movie is that:1: it is an EXTREMELY low resolution copy. It's like a copy of a copy of a copy that someone took from a VHS from when it played on TV and then burned to a DVD using a cheap burner on a laptop in somebody's dorm room.And 2: the subtitles are mandatory. You can either watch it with english subtitles or chinese subtitles, but there will be subtitles.I cannot believe that there is not a legitimate DVD copy of this movie anywhere, and I can't believe that Amazon is allowing this to be represented as if it were a legitimate copy.Shame on the seller and shame on amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 Stars, decent casting but bad directing.","review":"I first read the novel several months ago based on the recommendation of my high school English teacher. I read the novel and loved it, then my dad recommended to watch Stanley Kubrick's adaption of it. I watched that and loved it. I was intrigued so i decided to check out the newer presentation of the film.In short, Jeremy Irons is an excellent actor and excelled at playing Humbert; however, his supporting cast and the film direction is nothing spectaculr. I did enjoy the cinematography and Iron's voice overs from his audio reading of Lolita. I certaintly do prefer the original movie which contained far more subtlety than this version, this isn't necessarily a bad movie, just an average film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true love stroy","review":"I read the book first, myself, which I recommend you do as well. Adrian Lyne truly captures the spirit of this book. I couldn't have picked a better person to plays Humbert then Jeremy Irons. I, myself, am surprised that he would partake in such a \\"controversial\\" although I am glad that he did. This film is not that explict. There is no direct nudity from Irons or Swain, who plays Lolita, although there is from Frank Langella, who plays Clare Quilty, but it is only for approx. 5mins. This movie is spellbinding, and the characters are brilliantly carried out. I was expecting more from Melanie Griffith myself but Dominque Swain truly captures Lolita. Kudos to her for her first feature film. A MUST SEE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow . . .","review":"After reading the book and seeing both versions of this film, I must say I was amazed. Adrian Lyne's version is much better than Kubrick's. There was narration from the book, including the vital first paragraph, and many events were true to the book as well. I thought Jeremy Irons portrayed a much better Humbert Humbert than James Mason. Come to think of it, I liked the entire cast better. I did not, however, like Frank Langella, although he was truer to the book's Quilty than Peter Sellers was. Everything is done very tastefully, considering what the story is all about, and is engrossing throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and brilliantly made!","review":"This movie is very powerful. Although it has no explicit scenes of sexuality, the eroticism, sexual obsession, and drama measure off the scale. I was left shaken at the end of the movie. The acting is brilliant, the emotions radiate through the screen, the eroticism will drive you mad, and the tension will vibrate through your ribs. This is a must see must own movie, you will not have any regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya-ya...","review":"Ultimately, the great novel transcribed or adapted to the screen must fatefully fail. Unavoidably, the comparisons between the two Lolita films must come about. The original Lolita (1962) was directed by the late Stanley Kubrick and was adapted for the screen by Nabokov himself. To keep things short in this review...the modern Lolita lacks one thing that the earlier one had: a striking irony in the view and substance of the Lolita character. The original version depicts the nymph Lolita much more convincingly. Both films benefitted from a wonderful cast, although I believe that Melanie Griffifth's (sp?) casting was somewhat of miscast. Her performance was good, but I could never get the Shelley Winter's image out of my mind. Lastly...I felt something else missing from this version. What happenend to Lolita's Ya-Ya?"},{"rating":"2","title":"love at first site","review":"dominique was perfection as lo. the story did go down a bit after... the mother died but it was still worth watching to see how lo and humbert would stay together if they could bare eachother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Lolita.","review":"To associate this horrible movie with Nabokov is a shame.

I mean even the girl was acting like she was 10 years old and someone could find that sexy. The way the whole movie was displayed really disappointed me.

The writer attempts to draw the reader into an alternate reality where magic is common and accepted, except in the heroine. This would have been OK, but the story comes off as quite disjointed and hard to follow. The characters are not ones to which I could relate.

Never is this more true than in a family. In this popular sequel to Connecting Hearts, Denise and Randa learn that finding the other half of one's soul is only the beginning.Life has a way of presenting a combination of surprises and challenges.

Other serial aficianados may disagree with me but I would guess that it appears on their top five or ten serial lists. Among its many assets: a plot that develops logically from chapter to chapter, a superb bravura performance by Henry Brandon as the villainous criminal mastermind, and a superb musical score by Cy Feuer.

The plot and momentum of this movie reminds me of the classic Andromeda Strain; but they are different in their own way.This was released in the UK direct to video (no idea how it was released in the states) but I gave it a go, and it's actually very entertaining. The acting is good and so is the script. If the makers of this movie had invested more $$$ into it, they would have had a blockbuster thriller.

It\`s also hard for them to put up with her and she makes them do stuff and if they didn\`t she would say something and they would feel bad about it and help her. Everything would happen at the wrong time when they were by her and they try to kill her, but it\`s impossible. That\`s all I got to because it was late when I saw it and I was too frightened. I enjoyed it, but not everyone will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!","review":"This movie was very entertaining! It kept me watching to see what was going to happen next!

A Review by Dan","review":"I really like Ben Stiller and think that his comedy is a nice relief from all the teenage-geared crap. This movie looks pretty funny, and I think you have to see the actual thing to make a true judgement. The Trailer for Shrek, to me, and probably to quite a few, well, frankly, sucked. The movie looked like a total bomb, yet it did outstanding in Box Office Sales. This movie gets a 5 star rating so the only other review doesn't have to ruin it for everyone else. People should make their own judgements, not some person who thinks every movie they see sucks or is biased against an actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money or time.","review":"This movie is just awful.

I've always found his movies to be absolutely hilarious and when I saw the preview for 'Duplex', I was excited to see it. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as good as any of his movies. While the plot was decent, the movie seemed like it rushed through events kind of fast, the script wasn't exactly amazing, and as a whole, the movie just wasn't all that funny... Hopefully, 'Along Came Polly' will be better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly abysmal","review":"My wife gave up on it after a half hour.

Jerry always won and Tom is actually the victim.

I knew something is going on with the agent, cop and the ugly old one, it was too obvious.But this movie does give us one helpful advise, DO NOT trust any old ancient human, they are not what they seem, DO NOT give them respect unless you really know who they really are. Appearance can be deceiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a comedy...","review":"... The reality is, this is a hilarious movie about that old lady taking 4 hours in the grocery checkout that you can't avoid fantasizing about just knocking off to get through. In your head, afterwards you'd be revered and cheered, but you know that in reality you'd get life in prison. Keep in mind that about 3/4 of the way through the film, it is revealed that the old lady wouldn't care if she'd get bumped off, because she was old and had done it countless times to other tenants before."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was waiting for the old lady upstairs to pull off her mask","review":"As far as enjoyable movies go, this was not one of them. There are some people who enjoy dark humor. This movie definitely crosses the bridge into \\"just an awful plot to begin with\\".Towards the middle of the movie, as the plots to remove the old lady upstairs continue, my girlfriend told me that it would still be \\"allright\\" to watch if the ending was satisfactory. After a few more attempts to remove the old lady, she revised her opinion to \\"no good ending could ever save this movie.\\"If you are looking for a mix between Scooby Doo and Home Alone 2, with some awful writing, you have found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be GREAT!

Really quickly. It's still old. Make it STOP. The slapstick is stupid. The acting is horrid. The idea is something because as you know this happens all the time and I have been through something similar myself. But do yourself a favor and pass on this movie.

This dictionary includes more slang than any other that I have used. This is a good thing. In everyday communication you encounter so many words that are not taught in ulpan. Of course, slang changes a lot, so you can't expect a dictionary to be complete, however, at least there is more slang and idiomatic usage in this dictionary.The failing that this dictionary has, is that it does not include the plural forms of words when they are irregular.

The songs are sung by talented children. Both volumes 1 and 2 contain many traditional folklore songs. What I find disturbing is that no credit is given to the artists. All you get is a list of the songs. It would be nice to know where the children are from. A great feature would have been if a booklet were attached giving a brief description on how to play some of the games with the words and score to each song. These are songs that will continue from generation to generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book!","review":"True Women is my favorite book. I especially love Sarah.

There weren't too many exciting parts, and frankly, it becomes kind of boring after you read it for a while.

When I found out who it was by I went out and bought it immediately and I haven't taken it out my cd player yet only to put it in the car cd player.

No matter what I do, it just makes it down measly one step before it stops dead. What's wrong? Am I Slinky-challenged? I notice the Slinky's spring-iness just doesn't feel right (feels tighter than I remember). I'm guessing the amount of spring has to be just right for it to work properly.

Hugo holds his wife Kate captive, thinking she lied about being a virigin and has now cheated on him. She's a virgin, of course, but he accuses her of being the sluttiest slut who ever did slut. Honestly, I think Hugo was turned on by the idea...but disgusted at himself for being turned on, so he takes his aggression out on the heroine/victim.This book is missing a critical piece in a romance novel: any semblance of romance. There is no communication, only accusation, abuse, torture, stubbornness, pride and outright stupidity. If the author had included some inkling of a love and affection between the two characters, some sort of true remorse or process of healing, perhaps it could have been redeemed. The Judas Kiss by Sally Wentworth is one my favorite Harlequin Presents.

I never in my life thought that I would be responding to German questions without having to first translate them into English. This course has given me something that I will keep for the rest of my life.The only bad thing that I have to say at all about this course is that it doesn't provide you with the spelling of the words that you are learning. But this course isn't meant to focus on spelling, it's meant to focus on hearing and responding so I was not too upset to let that slide. I'm 100% positive that, after I finish volume II, that I will purchase volume III.

It showed up just a couple of days after I ordered it. It comes in a pretty big box - I'd say about 3' x 3' x 8\\". The package includes the net (folded up into a nice nylon carrying bag), the tee and 24 rubber balls. The tee is good quality, the balls are great - about the same weight as a real baseball. I also use them for hitting grounders on asphalt (the field is currently too muddy). The net sets up easily (be careful, it kind of \\"pops\\" up by itself). The only cons are that the stakes, although very solid, don't stay in the ground (probably due to the muddy field). And, folding the thing back up is a bit of a pain for a guy w/ a bad shoulder. I get around the stake problem by using a 40 lb sand bag on each side - works great. I'm getting better at storing it with each use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Unit pops open and works great for hitting, hitting off tee, soft toss and pitching to the strike zone.

In company with \\"Touch of Evil,\\" \\"Citizen Kane\\" and \\"F for Fake,\\" his masterful adaption of Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\" is one of his best films. The thousands of hours of devoted work done by the filmmakers who helped restore this masterpiece (enhancing sound effects, painstakingly matching what had been a criminally out-of-sync soundtrack to the players' mouths, digitally sharpening the film's every frame) is shown to great effect in this DVD.

There are too many basses and baritones, insufficient sopranos, too many accidentals, and no harps (!). I actually winced at one note in the duet between the Ent and the Entwife which is written to be flatted, why, I cannot fathom. High notes emphasize small words - of, on - and more important words are hurried together because the composer seems not to have taken the natural rythms of Tolkien's poetry into account.

The skill with which Carey uses flashbacks to tell the entire story of Kirk's last mission is amazing, and we get one of the best glimces into Kirk's younger years than had ever been presented in print, small, or large screen formats. We also are introduced to several new people that molded Kirk into the best captain in Starfleet, his in-and-out father, Commander George Kirk, and Captain Robert April, the first captain of the U.S.S.

(It's fun to read them in order to see the development of the main characters' relationship -- this is the latest in the series, by the way). The strength of the book is the acceptance and warmth in Mitch and Des' romance, and the fact that neither of these two follow the conventions of society.

One of the characters is a clone of cable news's Tucker Carlson, complete with bow tie and smugness.

It may be that the very complexity of these albums is what makes them so wonderful once one has given them the time they require. At the same time, this may cause them to come across as somewhat missing the mark on the first listen. (One reviewer described this album as a \\"snoozer\\".)In a sense, the listener will get out of these albums what they are willing to put into them (in the sense of being willing to withhold judgment until after two or three listenings).

Both main characters are genuine, smart, witty, attractive and plain likeable. Of course, within this genre, there is usually a happy ending, but in this case, the trip itself is emotionally worth the read. There were times while I was reading this that I could hear my inner voice saying, \\"No, no, tell her how you feel!!\\" If you are looking for a book that is nice exposition between steamy sex scenes, this is not for you.

He doesn't like it when I \\"snooze\\" him and ask that he call me back in 10 minutes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate, with one caveat","review":"The caveat is that if you place the clock above eyelevel, the display is dim and unreadable, which is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. Otherwise this is a great alarm clock, easy to use, with multiple wakeup times, (two pairs of two).I need a 6:20 wakeup M-F, my wife needs 8:00 AM M-F. Weekends 9:00 AM works for me, but she still needs the 8:00 AM call. This is easily setable with this clock. Sometimes my wife doesn't need the 8:00 AM weekend call, so we just press a button to turn it off.5 stars if you can place the clock at or below eyelevel, otherwise do not buy it.This is a truly easy to use and feature rich clock, with my caveat. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock Radio","review":"It didn't work on one side from day one. Unfortunately, I waited until after the warranty period to complain. Sony's solution was to give me the chance to buy a refurbished one for $110!!! Very disappointed with their idea of customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware this Sony","review":"We had a Sony for many years that was called by this name that we got at a yard sale for a few bucks.We really liked it so when it finally died we bought this one that looks like the old one and is named the same thing by Sony.Well this is a piece of China junk.The numbers are small and practically unseeable due to there not being enough contrast.The light covers over the numbers.You also must be looking at it dead on to see anything.Also the alarm is very low without any adjustment.We now have to get up by the music side because that is adjustable.?.? One thing we did like about this is that it has a his and hers alarms that turn red so we can easily see if they are turned on.I would guess there are much better ones out there that have these features.The first one wore like iron...I can only hope this dies a quick death......Sony should know better or maybe like so many other companies they'll just get by on their name for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Not As Described","review":"I just returned this item to Amazon. My main reason for buying this alarm clock was to have seperate weekend/weekday alarms always set so I can't forget and wake up late. It does not let you keep all 4 alarms set all the time so really you only have 2 alarms. That is the same as any other alarm clock. You have to remember to switch it from weekday to weekend and then back again! Its just a pointless gimmick that does not really work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving up on it","review":"We've had this clock for two years. It seems like it should be a great clock, and it has some nice features, but there are two things wrong that we just can't live with, so we are getting a different one.1) The display is so bright, even on the dim setting, that we have to turn it to face the wall and push it right up against it to block the light. So it's just not very handy for seeing what time it is!2) There are many buttons on the top and the face of the clock and it really is easy to unwittingly hit the wrong button when you've been yanked out of a deep sleep in the pre-dawn hours. With it turned to the wall, I have to turn it around to get at the OFF button, and often hit snooze in the process.I'll give it two stars, since we did make it work for two years, but I'll never know how we managed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"Nice clock radio, easy to use and set alarms, sound quality is pretty good for such a small radio. Display is small, hard to see the time, at night without glasses - for us who need glasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible LCD","review":"This Sony clock has a terrible LCD. I can't see time from low angle. The LCD sucks. I have to put 2 books under the clock to change the angle. I will never buy a Sony Clock again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weekend Mode is Misleading","review":"Note that this clock does not know when the weekend is. To shift it over to the weekend alarms (set later so you can sleep in), you need to press a button on the top of the unit that says Weekend. And then press it again once the weekend is over. I.e., if you forget to press it on Sunday night to tell the unit that the Weekend is over, then you will be late for work on Monday while the clock continues to believe it is the weekend. Not a good design, and since even a cheap watch knows what day it is, it is not as if too much is being asked of Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bright","review":"We've had Sony clock radios for twenty years. The new one is way to bright. We tried it in our bedroom and because it was so annoying we transferred to our guest suite. The guest we had for Christmas, said it was so bright they couldn't sleep, so they got up and put it in a drawer. We threw it away after our guests left!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to get rid of it, too bright","review":"We bought two. One for the guest room. Good value I guess and easy to use but only one star because we eventually had to toss both clock radios. The dim setting is WAY too bright. We don't need a night light.When we had guests we would always find they had stuck the clock in the drawer or tipped it over on its face because it is so bright. So it isn't just our opinion. It doesn't look that bright on the dim setting in the daytime but at night after your eyes are adjusted the whole room is orange."},{"rating":"1","title":"This alarm clock is SO bright I can't sleep....","review":"The set up of the dual alarms is very nice, but the display is entirely too bright for an alarm clock. I have to turn it around every night so the bright green and orange lights don't keep me awake. Beware...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alarm clock!","review":"A friend of mine has this clock, and recommended it to me. It's a wonderful little alarm clock! I love the \\"retro\\" color look of it, and the controls are so easy to use. I also really like the \\"weekday\\" and \\"weekend\\" alarm settings. It's nice also to have to option of waking up to the radio or the alarm. The price is right too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and it works!","review":"My wife got me this clock for Christmas last year. The alarm on the old one I had was difficult to set and confirm it was set. On this clock the alarms are easy to set and it is easy to see they are set and the time they are set for. I guess I can't say much more than I liked the clock enough to get the same model for my wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This is a great product and easy to use. I love mine so much I just bought one for my husband since we both get up at varying times during the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"like the product but ........","review":"I like the Sony clock radio. Really liked the dual alarms and the controls. However the display leaves something to be desired . It is hard to read the time unless you are looking straight at it and even on the dim setting it is so bright it casts shadows on the wall ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alarm clock with easy controls, radio is okay","review":"We originally purchased a similar alarm clock at Target (tan rather than white in color). We later added a second one from Amazon. What my wife and I love about this clock is the ease with which the alarms can be set and the fact that both times are shown. There's no little alarm1/alarm2 switch like on some older alarm clocks. It's also nice that the alarms can be set to different styles (my wife prefers radio, I prefer the buzzer). The fact that it has a battery so that it does not need reset after a power outage is also a very nice feature. Naps are rare these days, but the nap alarm is also a good idea.Purely for an alarm, I would rate it 5 stars, but the analog radio is just okay. It works fine and has the sound one would expect from a $25 radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this clock.","review":"I am so happy I went with this. It's small and lightweight, and effectively has 4 different alarm settings. You can only have 2 set at a time, but it's great on the weekends when I don't want my alarm set for 6am. It's also great that I can have my alarm set and my boyfriend can have his set at the same time. And being able to see that the alarm is set while not having to fix the time every night is my favorite feature. No more waking up in the middle of the night wondering if I've actually set my alarm.Another great feature is the different alarm tones. Again, my boyfriend and I can set our alarms to different tones without having to change settings nightly.All in all, a great buy. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dual Alarm For the Money! Time CAN be Adjusted-See Here","review":"Had a problem with my Sony being off by 5 minutes (too slow) and saw that other folks here said time could not be adjusted. Time CAN be tweaked and is EASILY adjusted. Here are instructions for those who may have lost their manuals. This is the only problem I have had since purchasing 2 years ago. If you need a great dual alarm, do not hesitate to make this purchase. Love my Sony Dream Machine!SETTING THE CLOCK ON SONY ALARM CLOCK ICF-C180:1. PRESS AND HOLD DST/CLOCK UNTIL BEEP AND HOUR FLASHES.2. PRESS + OR - UNTIL CORRECT HOUR APPEARS. (If hour is fine, proceed to step 3.)3. PRESS DST/CLOCK AGAIN UNTIL BEEP AND MINUTES FLASH.4. REPEAT STEP 2.5. PRESS DST/CLOCK TO FINISH.Works without a hitch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clock Radio","review":"This product has several good features, and seems to keep reliable time.It only has one melody, so that is a little frustrating, but still it gets us up in the mornings : )It is easy to set, and there are two distinct alarms so my husband and I can have our separate alarms, and they can be easily turned off if we get up before the alarm goes off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even a 6 year old can use it...","review":"I bought this clock for my 6 year old daughter because she's now at that age where she wants more independence. This includes waking up by herself in the morning. This clock is easy to use, and after showing her how to use it just once, she can set the alarm for during the week and turn it off on the weekend. She loves the radio sleep function, and can set that herself as well. She's allowed 20 minutes of radio time to fall asleep to. She loves the glowing face, for the extra light, and the large numbers now that she knows how to tell time. It definitely makes bed time more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"TRASH. The button that sets the clock in and out of daylight savings time is right on top of the clock and is activated by a single touch. So you're fumbling for the snooze button and, SURPRISE, you instead set the clock off daylight savings time. You'll get a rude surprise the next morning when you're an hour late for work.Sony should know better than this, much better. Now I have to go to the trouble of sending the blasted thing back to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honey, did you set the alarm? . . .","review":"I bought the above Sony after having gone through two Timex Nature Sounds in about five years. The Timex had great features but poor reliability. From the description and reviews the Sony seemed comparable plus it had the added attraction of a nap timer. I also liked that you could set an alarm for weekdays and another for weekends. Imagine my surprise this past Saturday when I was awakened at my weekday time of 6:30 am! That's when I realized that there is no DATE display on this clock. This means you must remember to turn on the alarm on Sunday night and turn off the alarm on Friday night (for weekday-only alarm). Who needs that, especially when so many other clock radios in the same price range have the date feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"SONY ALARM CLOCK/RADIO","review":"This is the second Sony cube clock/radio I have owned.. The first one lasted 25 yrs. I see the improvements made.. I like everything better EXCEPT it is difficult to see time in darkness..The background light is good, but the digital numbers are not dark enough.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innocent Blood","review":"This would have to be one of the worst, most boring, elephantine padded book it has ever been my misfortune to try and read The story is all padding and no substance. The plot is thin and could have been explained, disclosed and finished in six chapters at the very most, every move, thought and action was described in minute detail and over and over again. Who cared about what happened at court with the adoptive mother, who cared about how the daughter did up the flat, who cared about how the idiot man walked about and where he walked and what he thought. Just these three items took nearly whole chapters to cover and they added absolutely nothing to the story and there was a lot more of this type of thing to struggle through. Very bad read, do not recommend it to buy. Not one of P D James's best unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcompensation","review":"In this particular book P.D. James is overcompensating for her insecurities as a mystery writer. She wants to prove that mystery is a legitimate genre and therefore infuses this book with crass psychology, characters that expound literary quotes at the drop of a hat, and sensationalism. The characters are woven to be so complex that ironically they turn out to be simply one dimensional. Her tone for the treatment of victims (especially the rape victim) is absolutely infuriating and frightening. Pick up a copy of the National Enquirer...it's cheaper and more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong choice","review":"In all innocence and as a lover of P.D. James' works, I purchased \\"Innocent House,\\"and was astonished when I received a thin paperback. I was even more astonished to learn that this paperback was simply an EXCERPT from a novel and not the novel itself. True, I did not pay much for it, but I would not have bothered to waste even that sum and time if I had known what \\"Innocent House\\" really was. I had already read the original novel, but even if I hadn't I don't know what that excerpt would have accomplished.The seller should have alerted buyers to what s/he was offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get through it...","review":"I don't think that the protagonist of a novel has to be sweetness and light all the time-I can accept flawed characters, even seriously flawed characters. Philippa, however, was such a thoroughly unlikeable and despicable character that I honestly did not care what happened to her and actually found myself wishing that something bad would happen to her. She was selfish,cold, ungrateful, cruel to her adoptive parents, and I just could not continue reading. I generally like P.D James, but I did not like this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, come on!","review":"I like P.D. James and have read a number of her books.I really liked the first 350 pages of this book. Thestory line was creative and good character development.BUT the ending, oh my goodness. I am not going to give anythingaway, but BARFFFFF!!! It would have been so easy to have a goodending but this takes the cake for stupid and gross moral behavior.BARFFFFFF!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent live c.d.","review":"this show was recorded in there hometown and you can definately tell they went all out to show everyone just how big there bag of tricks can be. If your a long time fan you wont be able to put this album down when you first hear it. The first set has something for everyone. Horse leading right into Silent In The Morning is beautiful and The Lizards is one of the best versions ive ever heard. The second set is just a continuous jam with trey telling parts of a story mixed in with incredible solos by Page and the other guys. All the songs blend together perfectly to make everything mold into a masterpiece. The third set will knock your socks off with the suzy greenberg encore. this is a must have for avid listenors but if your a new listenor i would shy away from this album and go for a studio album like billy breathes or rift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have listened to my fair share of Phish and I can say in all honesty that this is the best concert i have ever listened to. The first set is extremely good with a great stash and lizards. The second set is the best i have ever heard. The Antelope>Catapult>Antelope is so filled with energy i couldn't help but smile. A Simpsons tease during Antelope was nice and the Harpua was great. Trey was so energetic and free that i couldn't help listening to it over and over. The transfer to Also Sprach Zarathustra was nice and Closing Harpua was fantastic. AC/DC was very good and the Scent of A Mule jam was incredible also. Suzy was great and the Contact jam was suprisingly good. Every song at this concert was great and even the N02 was a nice addition. Buy this CD if you like music, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"21 Bones Vol 1","review":"This album is the benchmark to which all other trombone ensembles aspire to reach.
